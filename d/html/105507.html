          Pulmonary hypertension-congenital heart disease (PH-CHD)

         – Patients with PH-CHD have a variety of types of PH  (

         ). In patients with PH-CHD, PH is commonly, but not always, caused by CHD. The most common type of PH-CHD is congenital shunt-related pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). (See

          Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)
         </strong>
         – PAH is a type of PH diagnosed by demonstration of a mean PAP ≥20 mmHg and a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) ≥2 Wood units (WU), along with exclusion of other types of PH  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348" href="/z/d/graphic/66348.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). This definition of &gt;2 WU was revised from &gt;3 WU in the 2022 European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society guidelines to reflect data regarding the prognostic significance of PVR &gt;2 WU [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. However, for treatment purposes, PVR &gt;3 WU is utilized since data regarding utility of treatment for PVR 2 to 3 WU are not available. Severe PAH is identified by a PVR ≥5 WU [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. PAH associated with CHD is one of many types of PAH. Eisenmenger syndrome is the most severe form of congenital shunt-related PAH. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         While some patients with group 2 PH have only postcapillary PH, some patients with group 2 PH have disproportionately high pulmonary artery pressure due to elevated PVR reflecting the effects of their CHD (eg, late repair of a VSD) on the pulmonary arterial vasculature, combined with elevated left heart filling pressures (eg, restrictive left ventricular filling). This mixed pre- and postcapillary PH is complex to manage, requiring attention to both the pre- and postcapillary components. (See

         In patients with PH-CHD, PH is usually, but not always, caused by CHD. In PH-CHD, the PH can be purely precapillary (elevated pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR] with normal pulmonary venous pressure, as for those in groups 1, 3, and 4, and for some in group 5), purely postcapillary (secondary to elevated pulmonary venous pressure with normal PVR, as for some with group 2 PH), or a combination of the two (mixed PH, as for others with group 2 PH). Patients in group 5 may have isolated precapillary PH, isolated postcapillary PH or both.

         As noted above, PH-CHD with group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) can be caused by ventricular, atrial, or aortic shunts  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55944" href="/z/d/graphic/55944.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ), especially when they are large and hemodynamically nonrestrictive, due to increased pulmonary blood volume and/or pressure overload. Other disorders, including complex anatomic abnormalities, can also be associated with PAH and Eisenmenger syndrome. A communication between the systemic and pulmonary circulations is present, generally with an associated initial net left-to-right shunt. In a study of 201 children and adults with Eisenmenger syndrome, the most common defects were ventricular septal defects (VSD; 33 percent), atrial septal defects (ASD; 30 percent), and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA; 14 percent) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In some conditions, the normal anatomic relations between the atria, ventricles, and great vessels may be altered. For simplicity, in the discussions that follow, the term "right ventricle" will be used to describe the ventricle from which the main pulmonary artery arises; the term "left ventricle" will be used to describe the ventricle from which the aorta arises.

          In utero
         </strong>
         – Systemic-to-pulmonary communications usually do not have major effects on fetal blood flow pathways. Right-to-left shunting at the atrial level (across the foramen ovale) is normal in utero, and the high PVR of the fetus limits left-to-right shunting.

         <strong>
          After birth
         </strong>
         – In the postnatal period, there is normally a rapid decline in PVR and an increase in right ventricular compliance, resulting in a net left-to-right shunt and an increase in pulmonary blood flow.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In most patients with systemic-to-pulmonary communications, some shunting occurs in both directions. This is expected since there is fluctuation in the pressure gradients between systemic and pulmonary circulations during the cardiac cycle due to changes in intrathoracic pressure associated with respiration, and changes in venous return associated with exercise, positional changes, and other factors. The convention of referring to a shunt as "left-to-right" or "right-to-left" is therefore typically an expression of the
         <strong>
          net
         </strong>
         result of bidirectional shunting.
        </p>
        <p>
         The extent of extra flow is assessed as the ratio of measured pulmonary blood flow (Qp) to systemic blood flow (Qs). In the normal case, where no connection exists, the ratio Qp:Qs is 1:1. Net left-to-right shunting results in a Qp:Qs &gt;1, while net right-to-left shunting results in a Qp:Qs &lt;1. For example, a Qp:Qs of 2:1 indicates that the pulmonary blood flow is twice that of systemic blood flow. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The increase in pulmonary blood flow with net left-to-right shunting eventually leads to pulmonary vascular disease  (

          picture 1
         </a>
         ) and increased PVR. The increase in PVR results in a rise in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) which is called "pulmonary artery hypertension" or "pulmonary arteriolar hypertension" (PAH) to emphasize the etiologic influence of disease in the pulmonary arterioles. As PAH worsens, the shunt may reverse with net right-to-left shunting  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52487 graphicRef70502" href="/z/d/graphic/52487.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>
         ]. With shunt reversal, venous blood returning to the right side of the heart passes through the communication, reducing the oxygen saturation of the arterial blood in the left heart and causing cyanosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Increases in flow through the pulmonary vasculature cause shear forces that disrupt the vascular endothelium and activate cellular mechanisms critical to the pathogenesis and progression of PAH [

         Plasma levels of endothelin, a vasoconstrictor and stimulant of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, are elevated in patients with PAH due to CHD  (

         The risk of developing Eisenmenger syndrome appears to be determined by the size of the initial left-to-right shunt and the volume of pulmonary blood flow, with larger shunts having increased risk. In addition, the type of defect is important. Only approximately 10 percent of patients with unrepaired atrial septal defects develop Eisenmenger syndrome, compared with 50 percent of patients with unrepaired VSD and nearly all patients with unrepaired truncus arteriosus [
         <a href="#rid18">

         Eisenmenger syndrome has been documented in some patients who never manifested a large net left-to-right shunt [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,20
         </a>
         ]. In fact, it is unusual for the evolution of the syndrome to be documented clinically (especially given the currently available approaches to managing known left-to-right shunts). The temporal pathophysiologic sequence outlined above has therefore been called into question; in most patients diagnosed with Eisenmenger syndrome, PAH, net right-to-left shunting, and cyanosis are found at initial presentation.

         The pathogenetic mechanism of damage to the pulmonary vasculature differs in patients with ASD compared with VSD or PDA. Vascular injury is related to the degree and duration of volume overload alone with an ASD, whereas high pressure shear forces also contribute with a VSD and PDA. (See

          ASD
         </strong>
         – In patients with an ASD (pretricuspid defects), left-to-right shunting across the defect starts at birth and increases during the neonatal period with maturation of the pulmonary vasculature. The normal pulmonary vasculature is able to accommodate the increased volume of flow by vasodilating and recruiting previously under perfused vessels; thus, PAP does not rise significantly in most patients with an ASD until adult life [

          VSD or PDA
         </strong>
         – In patients with a large (nonrestrictive) VSD or PDA (posttricuspid defects), severe PH is present from birth because of the large, hemodynamically nonrestrictive defect. Early on, the hemodynamics are characterized by systemic level PAP (severe PH) with a large left-to-right shunt. The combined effect of volume overload and shear forces elevates the PVR and reduces the magnitude of the left-to-right shunt (see

          "The epidemiology and pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (Group 1)", section on 'General physiologic mechanisms'

         ). Eventually, patients develop severe PAH with shunt reversal (right-to-left flow) and resulting hypoxemia  (

However, the pattern and degree of cyanosis and clubbing depends upon the patient's hemodynamic status and cardiovascular anatomy. An often mentioned example is the patient with a patent ductus arteriosus and Eisenmenger syndrome, in whom the right-to-left shunt through the ductus typically delivers unoxygenated blood distal to the left subclavian artery. This can result in differential cyanosis and clubbing that may be more pronounced in the lower extremities.

         An electrocardiogram (ECG) is not required for the diagnosis of PH-CHD but is generally obtained as part of the evaluation to provide a baseline for future comparison and to determine rhythm. The ECG usually reveals abnormal findings in patients with PH-CHD. These include evidence of right atrial abnormality (tall, narrow P wave)  (

         A chest radiograph is not required for the diagnosis of PH-CHD but is generally obtained as part of the evaluation to assess lung disease, which may be a concurrent or alternate cause of PH. Typical chest radiograph findings in patients with PH include dilated central pulmonary arteries; peripheral pulmonary artery pruning (abrupt attenuation and/or termination of peripheral pulmonary artery branches); neovascularity, which is better seen on computed tomography (CT) scan [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25

         ]; right heart enlargement; and right ventricular hypertrophy  (

          image 1

         ). The right atrium is prominent and the left heart border becomes straight or convex due to the dilated and displaced right ventricular outflow tract. Calcification of the pulmonary arteries can occur late in the course of disease. The chest radiograph may occasionally be normal in patients with less severe PH-CHD. Some patients may have lung disease concurrent with or instead of PH-CHD, and features of such disease may be identified on the chest radiograph.

         PH-CHD should be suspected in CHD patients with persistent cardiac shunt and associated cyanosis, decline in functional status, syncope, lower extremity edema, abdominal distention, or hemoptysis. PH-CHD often first comes to attention when estimated pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) are found to be elevated on echocardiographic assessment.

The elevation in pressure leads to increased right ventricular wall thickness with paradoxical bulging of the septum into the left ventricle during systole.

         injection is recommended for all patients with a new diagnosis of PH to exclude an intracardiac/extracardiac shunt such as an occult atrial septal defect (ASD) as a contributing factor. Agitated saline contrast can be helpful in confirming a suspected intracardiac shunt but should be avoided when a large intracardiac shunt has been established.

          Additional features
         </strong>
         – Echo-Doppler features have been described to help determine the etiology of PH in non-CHD patients, such as left atrial dilation and restrictive left heart filling parameters seen in pulmonary venous hypertension. In addition, Doppler features suggesting PH include pulmonary acceleration time less than 80 ms and/or systolic notching of the right ventricular outflow tract profile [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28

         <a href="#rid29">
          29

         Two-dimensional echocardiography may be limited by poor acoustic windows in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) should be considered in patients with suspected PH with suboptimal transthoracic images, in an effort to exclude CHD. TEE may be contraindicated in some patients given the potential risk of sedation. A TEE (with agitated

         ]. Intracardiac and extracardiac shunts may be very difficult to identify by TTE. Three-dimensional echocardiographic imaging may be helpful in assessment of right heart size and function and also in the assessment of an ASD. Intracardiac echocardiographic imaging is used primarily during interventional procedures.

         If cardiac defects, cardiac anatomy, and right ventricular function cannot be adequately assessed by echocardiography, imaging by cardiac CT or CMR is indicated. Both CT and CMR imaging allow assessment of cardiac anatomy, assessment of pulmonary artery size, and quantification of right ventricular size and function.
        </p>
        <p>
         CT is generally preferred over CMR for patients with PH-CHD, since CT angiography may better identify thromboembolic disease and pulmonary artery anomalies than CMR. CT of the pulmonary arteries can reveal enlargement, thrombosis, and mural calcification of the pulmonary trunk and its proximal branches [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30,31
         </a>
         ]. High-resolution CT imaging with lung windows can also be added to screen for lung pathology. Within the lung parenchyma, embolic infarction, hemorrhage, neovascularity, lobular ground glass opacification, and hilar and intercostal collaterals may also be seen [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. The last three abnormalities appear to occur more frequently in cyanotic than in acyanotic PAH and may correspond to the histologic findings of malformed, dilated muscular arteries within the alveolar septae and congested capillaries within the walls of both alveoli and medium-sized pulmonary arteries [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25

        <p>
         Serial CT and CMR imaging are not routinely performed in PH-CHD patients. Follow-up cross-sectional imaging frequency is individualized and depends on underlying CHD and associated lesions. Serial CMR is being explored as a tool to follow right ventricular function in PAH and may be used to assess right ventricular function in settings where there is consideration of lung transplantation.

The specific evidence for use in PH-CHD remains limited [

         </strong>
         – A six-minute walk test or similar exercise test may be considered as part of the functional assessment. This also provides information about functional limitation and oxygen desaturation; it is helpful to monitor status in patients with documented PH-CHD and is helpful in evaluating prognosis. A six-minute walk test is also often used to assess response to medical therapy. Submaximal or maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing with measures of gas exchange may be useful in some situations in order to further define causes of exercise limitation.

          Eisenmenger syndrome
