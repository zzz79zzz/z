Symptoms and illnesses related or attributed to indoor environments are common. A variety of factors associated with the environment and with the patient impact these symptoms, which may reflect new disorders, exacerbation of preexisting conditions (eg, rhinitis, asthma), and/or disorders caused by specific workplace exposures (eg, occupational asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis). Building-related symptoms can have a substantial impact on health. It is important for the clinician to recognize when symptoms are related to the patient's workplace, as these should be treated as occupational illnesses.</p><p>This topic will discuss building-related illnesses and symptoms, including epidemiology, potential exposures, host and building factors, and an approach to the patient with work-related illness. The discussion will focus on nonindustrial indoor work environments and schools, although many of the same exposures also exist in homes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11132819"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several terms have been used to categorize syndromes of symptoms related to the indoor environment. Building-related symptoms or illnesses are considered work related if the indoor work exposures caused the illness or exacerbated a preexisting condition.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19592425"><span class="h2">Building-related illnesses</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Building-related illnesses are disorders that are associated with a particular building or indoor environment and meet diagnostic criteria for a specific illness. In some cases, a discrete causative agent can be implicated, but more often this is not possible. (See <a class="local">'Building-related symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>Building-related illnesses can vary in severity and acuity. Examples are listed in the table and include the following  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91830" href="/z/d/graphic/91830.html" rel="external">table 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rhinitis and asthma (ie, irritant or allergen induced, de novo, or exacerbated)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dermatitis (common causes include low relative humidity or "chapped skin," or exposure to fiberglass insulation)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypersensitivity pneumonitis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Legionnaires' disease caused by dissemination of <em>Legionella pneumophila</em> via contaminated air-conditioning systems</p><p></p><p>These will be discussed in more detail below. (See <a class="local">'Approach to the patient'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11132851"><span class="h2">Building-related symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Building-related symptoms are symptoms that occur when the individual is in a specific building but are not easily categorized as a single definable illness. In the past, these presentations were often grouped under the term "sick building syndrome," but this term had limited descriptive utility and implied that the building was ill rather than the patient. In addition, it became clear over time that building-related symptoms are, in fact, very common and occur in many ordinary workplaces. For these reasons, the term "sick building syndrome" is rarely used in the current literature, and "building-related symptoms" is preferred and reflects a more patient-centered approach.</p><p>Building-related symptoms typically begin after entering the work building and may improve or resolve upon leaving the building. In the case of allergic or asthmatic symptoms, responses can be delayed by several hours. Over time, symptoms may become more frequent or persistent and may be triggered more nonspecifically by numerous exposures.</p><p>Commonly reported building-related symptoms include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mucous membrane irritation – Itchy, watery, or dry eyes; stuffy or runny nose; sinus congestion; dry or scratchy throat</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chest symptoms – Cough, chest congestion, dyspnea, wheezing, increased use of asthma medications</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Skin symptoms – Rashes, dry or itchy skin</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>General or neurologic symptoms – Fatigue, difficulty concentrating, headaches, dizziness, myalgia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sensory symptoms – Abnormalities in taste or smell, perception of strong smells</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14721968"><span class="h2">Indoor air quality</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Indoor air quality refers broadly to the quality of air within buildings constructed for nonindustrial business or for residential purposes. Indoor air quality is affected both by indoor emissions and pollutants as well as by outdoor air quality since outdoor air is the source of air circulated within a building.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1894219"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11135036"><span class="h2">Prevalence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Building-related illnesses and symptoms are common. Several cross-sectional studies and reports on "problem buildings" have investigated the prevalence of symptoms attributed to the nonindustrial work environment, and up to 60 percent of workers have reported at least one symptom related to the environment at work [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. However, the general prevalence of building-related illnesses and symptoms is largely unknown, given the lack of a definitive test or set of criteria for establishing the diagnosis.</p><p>Reported outbreaks of specific building-related illness are uncommon and are most often infectious. (See <a class="local">'Infectious agents'</a> below.)</p><p>Clusters of hypersensitivity pneumonitis cases have been described, but these have most commonly occurred outside of office environments (eg, "hot tub lung," a hypersensitivity pneumonitis linked to nontuberculous mycobacteria). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5342.html" rel="external">"Overview of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1894230"><span class="h1">INDOOR EXPOSURES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In industrialized countries, people spend approximately 22 hours per day indoors [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. Nonindustrial indoor environments can be a source of substantial exposures that impact health and productivity. Indoor air pollution may come from toxic or irritant chemicals (eg, carbon monoxide, tobacco smoke, or cleaning products), allergens, or infectious agents  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91827" href="/z/d/graphic/91827.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Symptoms are rarely caused by a single exposure; more often, the patient is reacting to a combination of factors.</p><p>At present, there is not a single set of standards for indoor air quality in the United States, although there are standards for specific "criteria pollutants," as discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Criteria pollutants'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11134780"><span class="h2">Exposures in specific environments</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>More than one-half of employed adults work in offices or similar nonindustrial environments [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Children and adolescents spend significant portions of their day in school buildings, which are typically older and less well maintained than office buildings [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11134677"><span class="h3">Schools</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Poor ventilation has been identified as a common problem in many schools [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Schools are also a major site of exposure to cleaning products, molds, dust, dander from cats and dogs, and diesel exhaust from school buses [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]. Infectious outbreaks, particularly with viral illnesses, are common in school environments. Outbreaks with less common but communicable pathogens such as meningococcus, <em>Legionella</em>, or tuberculosis also occur. (See <a class="local">'Infectious agents'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11134689"><span class="h3">Restaurant and entertainment venues</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bars, restaurants, casinos, movie theaters, and other hospitality and entertainment venues are associated with many exposures, including environmental tobacco smoke in some settings, although there has been legislative curtailment of indoor smoking in many countries. Food handlers are susceptible to allergic responses from antigens such as seafood, fruits, and wheat, either from skin contact or inhalational exposures [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Cooking fumes can be respiratory irritants.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11134821"><span class="h3">Health care facilities</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Health care workers are exposed to numerous allergens and irritants. Allergy to natural rubber latex received significant attention as glove use became more widely adopted in the 1990s to avoid bloodborne pathogen exposure [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Latex glove use has since declined, but numerous other allergens are present in the health care environment, such as pharmaceuticals (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9834" href="/z/d/drug information/9834.html" rel="external">psyllium</a>, antibiotics, chemotherapeutics, aerosolized medications), disinfectants and sterilants (eg, glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde), and cleaning products [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Many of the disinfectants, sterilants, and cleaning products are also strong irritants. (See <a class="local">'Cleaning and personal care products'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11134851"><span class="h2">Specific exposures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Important indoor pollutants include secondhand smoke, molds and other allergens, volatile organic compounds, particulate matter and other specific gases, cleaning and personal care products, and emissions from cooking and heating. Infectious agents present another type of exposure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1894237"><span class="h3">Secondhand smoke</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many terms are used for the involuntary inhalation of tobacco smoke by nonsmokers, including secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure, environmental tobacco smoke exposure, and passive smoking. SHS exposure is associated with increased risk for respiratory symptoms, cardiovascular events, and lung cancer. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6919.html" rel="external">"Secondhand smoke exposure: Effects in adults"</a>.)</p><p>SHS has been named a carcinogen by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. In the United States, legislation banning smoking varies broadly from one state or locality to another, and bans are being increasingly implemented across the country restricting smoking in restaurants and/or bars and public or government buildings. The American Lung Association (ALA) tracks state tobacco control laws in the United States in a database that can be accessed at the ALA tobacco legislation <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lung.org%2Fpolicy-advocacy%2Ftobacco%2Fslati&amp;token=6adX8eSyuMhIqrQHY4S4L5QtQxltLM8f1oZY3bsRzMDRKHYjZ4jbbBmoSIp6zEnRYuIHPLbAmh%2BoS3QPG4ifyQ%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=15265" target="_blank">website</a>. At least 25 countries in Europe have also enacted legislation banning smoking in some public areas [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Although smoking is becoming less common in many workplaces, SHS remains an important source of symptoms and morbidity, and patients should be asked about SHS both at home and at work. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6376.html" rel="external">"Control of secondhand smoke exposure"</a>.)</p><p>Overall, smoking bans have resulted in improvements in self-reported respiratory and sensory symptoms, lung function, and cardiovascular events as well as improvements in measurements of indoor air quality [<a href="#rid13">13-16</a>]. Studies examining the effects of workplace smoking prohibition on the health of hospitality workers have shown a decrease in respiratory symptoms and sensory irritant symptoms and improvements in lung function as early as one to two months after smoking bans were enacted [<a href="#rid17">17-21</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H257486986"><span class="h3">Electronic nicotine delivery systems</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), including e-cigarettes, have surged in popularity, both as smoking cessation devices and for recreational use. E-cigarettes are battery-powered devices that heat and aerosolize liquid to be inhaled. Most such liquids contain nicotine. Use among adolescents in particular has increased at a rapid pace [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Concern has arisen about health effects of nonusers exposed to ENDS aerosols that can contain toxicants including nicotine as well as fine and ultrafine particles, similar to SHS exposure [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. Use of ENDS may occur in indoor areas where other forms of smoking are prohibited, subject to local regulations [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Organizations such as the American College of Physicians, the Forum of International Respiratory Societies, and the World Health Organization (WHO) have called for restrictions on use of ENDS in indoor and public spaces, as well as for research to determine health effects of ENDS to users and nonusers [<a href="#rid24">24-26</a>]. As of 2016 in the United States, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has extended its regulatory authority to include all tobacco products, including nicotine-containing ENDS or ENDS marketed for therapeutic purposes such as for smoking cessation [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p>Research on chemical contents and health effects of ENDS is evolving rapidly. These topics are covered elsewhere in more detail. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98400.html" rel="external">"Vaping and e-cigarettes"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6376.html" rel="external">"Control of secondhand smoke exposure", section on 'Electronic cigarette secondhand vapor exposure'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1894252"><span class="h3">Mold</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mold and dampness are common exposures in buildings and are frequently associated with upper respiratory and asthma symptoms [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. The health effects of indoor mold are mentioned briefly here and the assessment of indoor mold is covered elsewhere in more detail. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5544.html" rel="external">"Assessment of mold in the indoor environment"</a>.)</p><p>Mold can become a problem in water-damaged buildings. The most common illnesses linked to dampness and mold exposure are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rhinitis and asthma – Dampness and indoor mold have consistently been associated with increased risk of asthma, asthma exacerbation, rhinitis, and respiratory infections in both atopics and nonatopics [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p></p><p>Other mold-related disorders include [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2419.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Allergic fungal sinusitis (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/101017.html" rel="external">"Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypersensitivity pneumonitis – Occupational outbreaks of hypersensitivity pneumonitis are uncommon but do occur (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4309.html" rel="external">"Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic alveolitis): Epidemiology, causes, and pathogenesis", section on 'Ventilation and water-related contamination'</a>)</p><p></p><p>Sarcoidosis has also been described in association with water-damaged buildings and other occupational settings contaminated with mold or mycobacteria, leading to the hypothesis that microbial antigens could be a trigger for granulomatous inflammation [<a href="#rid31">31,32</a>].</p><p>In contrast to allergic and hypersensitivity reactions, serious fungal infections are rare after exposure to environmental mold in immunocompetent patients.</p><p>While there is good evidence for the association between fungal exposure and upper respiratory and asthma symptoms, the particular mechanistic underpinnings remain a subject of active investigation. A variety of fungal components such as beta-glucans, chitin, and proteases likely have important roles [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Many patients are concerned about mycotoxins, metabolites produced by some fungal species (eg, particular species of <em>Stachybotrys</em>), as a source of building-related symptoms, including headaches, difficulty concentrating, and fatigue [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. However, mycotoxins are most often nonvolatile large molecules, and thus inhalational exposure requires significant aerosolization or disruption of fungal spores. Even when inhalational exposure occurs, the health effects of mycotoxins in the context of damp and poorly maintained buildings are not well understood [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1894297"><span class="h3">Other allergens</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Allergens, other than molds, can contribute to building-related symptoms. These include allergens from dust mites, cockroaches, rodents, and plant pollen (if drawn indoors from the immediate outdoor environment). Dander from domestic animals may also be carried from homes to work and school environments on clothing. Carpeting in workplaces can harbor allergen particles for long periods of time. The adverse effects of allergens can be augmented by coexposures such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Criteria pollutants'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13525.html" rel="external">"Allergen sampling in the environment"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1894304"><span class="h3">Infectious agents</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Viral, fungal, and occasionally bacterial pathogens in buildings have been linked to outbreaks.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cold and flu viruses are the most commonly encountered infectious agents in nonindustrial indoor environments (eg, influenza spreads readily among health care workers).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tuberculosis outbreaks have been reported in workplaces, most commonly in health care facilities but also in schools and office buildings.

In that outbreak, multiple conference attendees were infected with the bacterium <em>L. pneumophila</em> that had contaminated an air-conditioning system in the conference hotel. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7029.html" rel="external">"Microbiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of <i>Legionella </i>infection"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1894311"><span class="h3">Volatile organic compounds</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are carbon-containing compounds with a high vapor pressure at room temperature. VOCs are emitted from a variety of building and consumer products and are largely responsible for the "new carpet" or "new car" smell. VOCs can emanate from many indoor materials such as paints, floor finishes, furniture, carpeting, polyurethane spray foam insulation, and other building materials.</p><p>VOCs have been implicated in building-related symptoms such as upper airway and mucous membrane irritation, headaches, difficulty concentrating, irritability, nausea, and drowsiness [<a href="#rid37">37-41</a>]. VOC exposure in concentrations typically found in new office buildings was associated with an increase in nasal neutrophils 4 and 18 hours after laboratory exposure in a small study (14 subjects) [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].</p><p>VOCs include volatile aromatic hydrocarbons, semivolatile organic compounds, and volatile aldehydes [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Common examples include formaldehyde, toluene, xylene, and benzene. Formaldehyde in indoor environments is primarily emitted by wood-based products assembled with formaldehyde-containing resins, such as plywood or particle board. Some paints and varnishes can also emit formaldehyde fumes. Formaldehyde is an airway and mucous membrane irritant, and it can cause respiratory symptoms, particularly in patients with underlying lung disease such as asthma. It is also a carcinogen associated with nasopharyngeal and sinonasal cancer in people chronically exposed [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. Indoor formaldehyde concentrations have been negatively correlated with ventilator air exchange rates [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1894318"><span class="h3">Criteria pollutants</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>"Criteria pollutants" are six common outdoor air pollutants that the EPA is required to regulate based on the Clean Air Act:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Particle pollution (or particulate matter)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ozone</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Carbon monoxide</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nitrogen oxides</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sulfur oxides</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lead</p><p></p><p>Outdoor air pollutants are an important contributor to indoor air pollution [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. Although data are most available for the six criteria pollutants, other outdoor pollutants may also become part of the indoor environment and cause symptoms. These pollutants are also important factors in indoor air quality globally. Although primary sources of pollutants may differ from country to country, several pollutants are common across countries. The WHO has published guidelines for indoor air quality that include several of these pollutants [<a href="#rid44">44</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Indoor particulate matter (PM) comes from sources such as house dust, resuspension of disrupted particles, environmental tobacco smoke, or combustion products of cooking or heating. Indoor burning of biomass fuels for heat or cooking is a common source of PM in many developing countries. Indoor PM, by itself, can cause symptoms, or particles may carry other pollutants into the respiratory tract [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Indoor PM has been associated with respiratory symptoms such as wheezing and cough.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">PM ranges in size and is classified as:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Coarse (2.5 to 10 micrometers)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Fine (0.1 to 2.5 micrometers)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Ultrafine (&lt;0.1 micrometers)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Coarse matter will deposit in the upper airway, whereas fine and ultrafine particulate can deposit deep in the tracheobronchial tree or alveoli.

Ozone is also present in indoor air, primarily from circulating outdoor air but also from appliances such as ionizing air purifiers or ozone-generating air cleaners [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Acute exposure to ozone can cause airway inflammation, decline in pulmonary function, and decline in exercise tolerance in both healthy people and those with preexisting reactive airways disease. Ambient ozone can enhance response to inhaled allergens in susceptible people [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Carbon monoxide is released into indoor air by furnaces or stoves, particularly if they are not functioning properly. Indoor open flame cooking is a common source of CO in many developing countries. In industrial settings, the most common source of CO is vehicle exhaust from garages or indoor use of equipment such as forklifts. In any setting, outdoor vehicle exhaust can enter the ventilation system, particularly if idling vehicles are parked near intake vents. Environmental tobacco smoke is also a source of CO. Low-level chronic CO exposure can contribute to exacerbations of cardiopulmonary disease and symptoms such as headaches, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, dyspnea, and neuropsychological impairment [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

In the indoor environment, nitrogen dioxide may be emitted from furnaces or stoves. Indoor levels may exceed outdoor levels if heating appliances are not vented properly [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. Nitrogen dioxide<sub> </sub>levels have also been positively correlated to ventilator air exchange rates in a building, implying that indoor concentrations are highly influenced by outdoor concentrations [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. Although data conflict on the long-term effects of low-level exposure, increased bronchial responsiveness and enhanced response to inhaled allergens have been seen in both healthy and asthmatic patients [<a href="#rid42">42,46</a>]. Sulfur dioxide can cause symptoms of wheezing and chest tightness as well as frank bronchoconstriction in individuals with asthma [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lead remains an important indoor exposure globally. Historically, leaded gasoline, lead-based solder, and lead paint have been major sources of lead in the environment. These have been greatly reduced or eliminated in developed countries, although lead paint in particular is still available in many countries. Dust from preexisting lead paint continues to be a source of respirable lead, particularly during renovations. Another example of lead in the indoor environment is indoor shooting ranges used either for recreational shooting or for training of police or other armed personnel. Elevated blood lead levels have been well documented in people frequenting such shooting ranges, both in the United States and internationally [<a href="#rid47">47-51</a>]. Lead from bullets becomes respirable during weapon firing, and lead is very efficiently absorbed through the lungs.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Adequate ventilation and cleaning of lead-contaminated dust are two important controls to limit indoor lead exposure. Elevated blood lead levels are commonly asymptomatic, but more severely affected patients may present with anemia or abdominal pain (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2773.html" rel="external">"Lead exposure, toxicity, and poisoning in adults"</a>). Elevated levels are also concerning in children whose intellectual development can be adversely affected.

Cleaning products containing a variety of noxious substances are often used in combination. Such ingredients include solvents (eg, ammonia, ethanol, isopropanol), alkalis (eg, bleach), acids (eg, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, hydrochloric acid), and antimicrobial agents (eg, glutaraldehyde, quaternary ammonium chlorides) [<a href="#rid10">10,53</a>]. Many of these compounds are strong respiratory and dermal irritants, and others, such as glutaraldehyde, can also cause allergic sensitization. The mixing of cleaning products can result in toxic byproducts, such as acute asthmatic responses or toxic pneumonitis. Notably, mixing bleach and ammonia results in the release of toxic chloramines, which can be lethal at high levels. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/536.html" rel="external">"Irritant-induced asthma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7532.html" rel="external">"Chronic nonallergic rhinitis"</a>.)</p><p>Odor perception is strongly associated with building-related symptoms, even in the absence of measurable or toxic levels of any specific compound [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. Symptoms induced by the strong odors of chemicals or perfumed personal care products are common complaints among workers. Symptoms are often "sensory irritations," meaning that an odor may trigger eye and airway irritation via the trigeminal nerve [<a href="#rid56">56</a>]. This is not an allergic reaction, although patients with asthma, allergic rhinitis, and nonallergic rhinitis have been observed to have increased odor sensitivity [<a href="#rid56">56,57</a>]. Other compounds, such as VOCs, can induce similar reactions, but cleaning products and perfumed care products are most commonly implicated. Odors may also come from environmental sources, and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have developed a <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.atsdr.cdc.gov%2Fodors%2F&amp;token=j%2BtF41plvYHq0KcVLVNCgjdAi%2FnrlRZXm%2FvywiuOoU03ebi%2Fx%2BskxzK21d7RrnsZ&amp;TOPIC_ID=15265" target="_blank">website</a> with information and resources about odors.

Much attention has been paid to the adverse health effects of burning these fuels in developing countries. However, emissions from cooking and heating can also be an important source of pollutants in the industrialized world [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Grilling over charcoal or using wood-burning stoves at home or in restaurants are examples. Reported health effects from heating and cooking emissions include asthma and other respiratory symptoms, increased risk of respiratory tract infections including tuberculosis, sensitization to aeroallergens, and cancers such as lung, cervical, and upper aerodigestive tract [<a href="#rid58">58-60</a>].

Ventilation-related problems account for as much as 60 percent of indoor air quality problems [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]. The experience of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has been similar, with roughly one-half of its indoor air quality investigations revealing a problem with inadequate ventilation [<a href="#rid63">63,64</a>]. Complaints related to poor ventilation may reflect high concentrations of indoor pollutants. Inadequate air exchange, inadequate distribution of ventilated air, and ventilation of polluted outdoor air are primary issues [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]. Improper maintenance of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems contributes to an increased prevalence of symptoms among occupants and has been linked to outbreaks of legionellosis [<a href="#rid36">36,65</a>].</p><p>In a meta-analysis of six studies comparing symptoms in workers in mechanically ventilated air-conditioned buildings with workers in naturally ventilated buildings, there was a two- to threefold increase in the prevalence of work-related headaches, lethargy, and upper respiratory/mucous membrane symptoms in those working in mechanically ventilated buildings [<a href="#rid66">66</a>]. In one study comparing workers in a "sealed" office building with mechanical ventilation to workers in a naturally ventilated building, the overall prevalence of work-related symptoms was high among workers in both buildings and somewhat increased among workers in the mechanically ventilated building [<a href="#rid67">67</a>]. These symptoms include lethargy and headache in &gt;50 percent of workers and breathlessness and chest tightness in about 20 percent. Other common symptoms included dry or itchy eyes and stuffy or runny nose.</p><p>Several studies have found an association between empirically increased ventilation rates and decreased symptoms, including headaches, respiratory symptoms, nose and throat symptoms, and skin complaints [<a href="#rid68">68-71</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11135627"><span class="h3">Measurement of carbon dioxide</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The adequacy of fresh air circulating in a building is often measured indirectly via carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels. CO<sub>2</sub> is a marker for inadequate ventilatory exchange rates. Humans are the primary source of CO<sub>2</sub>, and concentrations will vary widely based on room and building occupancy. Indoor air concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> typically range between 500 and 1500 parts per million (ppm), while outdoor concentrations are generally 350 to 450 ppm [<a href="#rid72">72</a>]. A rough guideline is that CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations should not exceed 1000 ppm in indoor environments for comfortable air quality [<a href="#rid2">2,73,74</a>]. However, CO<sub>2</sub> is an imperfect measure, and low measured levels do not rule out inadequate ventilation throughout a building.</p><p>Ventilation rates used to achieve desirable air quality levels must take into account the size and usage of the space, the number of occupants, the duration of occupancy, and the volume of the room [<a href="#rid72">72</a>]. A rough guide is that ventilation rates at or below 10 L/second per occupant are associated with increased symptoms among building occupants [<a href="#rid65">65</a>].

Renovation can generate exposures by generation of construction dusts and disruption of building materials that may contain molds, allergens, or chemical products. The age of a building can suggest specific exposures of concern that may have been used in building materials, such as asbestos, lead, or polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). PCBs, for instance, were commonly used in schools and other buildings building in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s [<a href="#rid80">80</a>]. Asbestos and PCBs exposures are implicated in long-term health effects rather than acute symptoms. Their health effects in adults generally occur in a dose-dependent fashion, but their presence may be of concern to patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1894368"><span class="h2">Green buildings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There has been a growing movement in the United States and other countries to adopt more environmentally friendly building design and construction standards, or "green" building practices (ie, building practices that have minimal impact on the ecosystem by minimizing energy and resource utilization). The Leadership in Energy and Environmental (LEED) certification program is one widely used example of rating buildings for green design. LEED heavily weights features such as energy efficiency and low-toxicity building materials. Less emphasis is placed on indoor air quality.</p><p>Although building materials and furnishings are selected for low toxicity, chemical emissions remain possible. For example, wood may be selected for low formaldehyde emissions but may result in wood with phenol emissions, which may have different health effects. Thus, while there are environmentally positive aspects for green buildings, our understanding of the impact on occupant health continues to evolve.</p><p>The growing literature on the health impacts of green buildings and health building design focuses primarily on symptoms, comfort, and productivity [<a href="#rid81">81,82</a>]. Some studies have shown perceived improvements in respiratory symptoms and stress after green renovations of low-income housing [<a href="#rid83">83</a>] or moving the workspace from a conventional to a green office space [<a href="#rid84">84,85</a>]. A 2015 review concluded that green buildings achieved better measured and perceived indoor environmental quality, although satisfaction with indoor acoustics was lower in green buildings in several of the studies reviewed [<a href="#rid86">86</a>]. However, not all studies have demonstrated improvement in perceived occupant comfort or satisfaction [<a href="#rid87">87</a>]. In other studies, there were demonstrated improvements in health outcomes.

Acute exposure to high levels of irritants (eg, a bleach spill in a hospital) is also more likely to cause significant symptoms in atopic individuals. Patients with atopy or allergy are also at higher risk of work-related rhinitis and contact dermatitis.

The demand-control-support paradigm of psychosocial work factors has been used widely in occupational health, including in the study of building-related complaints. High work demand, low job control, and low support have been related to increased prevalence of building-related complaints [<a href="#rid89">89,96</a>]. More specifically, workers who perceive having too high a workload, low stimulation from their work, very little control over their work environment (including the physical environment), and little help from coworkers tend to have more symptoms related to indoor air and work environment [<a href="#rid97">97</a>]. This holds true across gender and age groups and regardless of smoking or atopy history, although different groups may perceive their workload or level of control and support differently [<a href="#rid97">97</a>].

A more detailed investigation of the work environment will likely require cooperation from the employer. The clinician should discuss this with the patient first and get the patient's permission to contact the employer. Without the patient's permission, the clinician could contact the employer if they feel they can maintain patient privacy, but this can be difficult when discussing a specific work area or job description or in a small company. Many patients have little control over their work environments, and some may be concerned about job security. However, clinicians can often help facilitate appropriate changes.</p><p>A more involved workplace evaluation is appropriate for patients with unusual specific exposures or if the patient's job may be at risk. Involvement of an occupational and environmental medicine practitioner is appropriate in these situations. In the United States, local consultants in environmental medicine can be found through the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aoec.org%2F&amp;token=ZG1%2BPwRUU1rBex5m1Ml5lfAIA%2B4JXtDbEUxLiSfLiuI%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=15265" target="_blank">Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics</a> or the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.acoem.org%2F&amp;token=ppy6PCRiE9HJgc%2Bl6sW1nQKlj1q8HKu%2BZ%2BFCLHozlig%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=15265" target="_blank">American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine</a>’s Doctor Finder tool.</p><p>A formal workplace evaluation will typically involve a team including a clinician, an industrial hygienist, and possibly a building and ventilation engineer. The initial step is a qualitative walkthrough to view the workplace and gather information about the building (eg, usage history, renovations, qualitative evaluation of ventilation, history of health complaints, interviews of occupants) [<a href="#rid101">101</a>]. If necessary, a more detailed evaluation may involve sampling carbon dioxide levels; evaluating heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems; or sampling for other pollutants such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or specific bioaerosols.</p><p>Extensive air or surface sampling is rarely indicated and can be expensive and of little benefit. It is also rare that one single factor is identified, and often interventions to improve ventilation are helpful, even in the absence of any obvious etiologic factor [<a href="#rid101">101</a>]. Mold and allergen sampling of the environment, in particular, is costly and often undertaken prematurely or inappropriately. Molds and allergens are ubiquitous in the environment, and there are no standards for "safe" levels. Allergens in particular are not harmful unless people are specifically sensitized and reactive to them. Thus, such sampling is most likely to be clinically helpful when the patient has symptoms consistent with immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic disease (asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis) or a hypersensitivity disorder known to be related to a fungus. Not all molds or allergens can be accurately measured using the techniques available. Allergen and mold sampling are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13525.html" rel="external">"Allergen sampling in the environment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5544.html" rel="external">"Assessment of mold in the indoor environment"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2157103"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients with building-related symptoms have an underlying condition(s) such as rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and/or asthma, in the authors' experience  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91830" href="/z/d/graphic/91830.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).

The last should include any temporal or spatial relationships to work, association of symptoms with a specific work area or job task, improvement in symptoms away from work, increased use of medications (such as for allergy or asthma symptoms), more frequent medical visits, or more sick days associated with work-related symptoms. A thorough medical and occupational evaluation with detailed documentation is important for diagnosis and management as well as for issues of worker's compensation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H180448849"><span class="h2">Worker's compensation in the United States</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The threshold of establishing medical causation for workers' compensation is that it is "more probable than not" that the illness or injury is caused or exacerbated by work. Patients diagnosed with probable work-related illness should be informed of relevant workers' compensation programs, similar to work-related injuries. It is also important that the clinician share with the patient concerns about work relatedness in a timely manner, as there is usually a statute of limitations for work-related illness or injury that varies under different states' workers' compensation systems. The employee usually initiates the workers' compensation process. The clinician's role is to provide documentation of the patient's medical condition when requested. Workers’ compensation benefits play an important role in ensuring that the patient is able to receive all required medical treatments and prescription medications, including in the event of financial hardship or changes in health insurance status should they occur in the future.

Interventions that improve the indoor air quality can be very successful. These include reducing exposures (most commonly dust, cleaning products, perfumes, dampness) and optimizing ventilation systems, including fresh air intake, temperature, and humidity. Decreasing tobacco smoke exposure can also improve symptoms.</p><p>In a minority of building-related illnesses, a specific exposure is suspected to be the source of the illness.

In such cases, identifying the causative exposure is much more critical and also most likely to be successful if attempted prior to the clinician recommending complete removal from the suspected workplace.</p><p>There are many interventions to improve indoor air quality that clinicians can recommend, and patients can initiate themselves or bring to the attention of their supervisor or employer. A guide for clinicians and patients is the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s Office Building Occupant's Guide to Indoor Air Quality [<a href="#rid102">102</a>].

Such communications should not contain medical information about the patient, and language should be neutral and nonaccusatory. Recommendations, such as evaluating the ventilation system (including fresh air intake, supply, and return in different rooms), fixing water leaks, use of "green" cleaning products, or relocation until renovation work is completed can be helpful. If other workers are also symptomatic, it can be helpful for those workers also to be evaluated.
