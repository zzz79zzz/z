         Significant (defined as a greater than 50 percent angiographic narrowing) left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD) is found in 4 to 6 percent of all patients who undergo coronary arteriography [

         The diagnosis of left main coronary artery disease is usually made by coronary angiography. (See

        <p>
         Certain findings on exercise testing or, in patients with acute coronary syndromes on the electrocardiogram (ECG), are suggestive of left main coronary artery disease. These include diffuse and severe ST-segment deviation or significant ventricular arrhythmias on ECG monitoring or hypotension during exercise. For these patients, we suggest consideration of early diagnostic coronary angiography. (See

         All patients with left main coronary artery disease should receive preventative therapies known to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events, such as smoking cessation, achieving target blood pressure goals, lipid lowering therapy with statins, exercise, and proper management of diabetes.

         Revascularization with optimal preventive therapies is preferred to optimal preventive therapies alone for all patients with significant left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-9
         </a>

         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'
         </a>
         above.) CABG significantly improves survival.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most patients with significant LMCAD are symptomatic and at high risk of cardiovascular events, since occlusion of this vessel compromises flow to at least 75 percent of the left ventricle, unless it is protected by collateral flow or a patent bypass graft to either the left anterior descending coronary artery or circumflex artery. Without revascularization, three-year survival is as low as 37 percent [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. CABG, when directly compared with medical therapy, is associated with significantly better cardiovascular outcomes, including mortality. In the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study performed in the 1970s, which compared a strategy of initial CABG versus deferred CABG, there was a substantial survival advantage for patients assigned to initial CABG at two years (93 versus 71 percent) [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ] and at 11 years, but not at 18 years [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. The benefit was greatest in high-risk patients with greater than 75 percent left main stenosis and/or left ventricular dysfunction; there was a nonsignificant trend toward benefit in patients with 50 to 75 percent stenosis and normal left ventricular function [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The outcomes of patients with LMCAD treated with CABG have improved over time. Reports of those who underwent CABG after 1995 suggest that the 30-day mortality ranges between 3 and 4.2 percent and the survival at two years is approximately 95 percent [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Thirty-day mortality is now under 2 percent in some United States databases.

         </span>
         CABG has a long track record of safety and efficacy in patients with LMCAD. The application of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting to the left main coronary artery began in patients who were not candidates for CABG. Randomized trials and observational studies have suggested equivalent outcomes for death and myocardial infarction with these two forms of revascularization in some patients with LMCAD.
        </p>
        <p>
         We arrive at the following conclusions regarding the studies presented below comparing CABG with PCI with stenting. The odd ratios (OR) given below come from a 2016 meta-analysis of the four major randomized trials discussed below plus one smaller trial [
         <a href="#rid11">

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         At one year and longer, CABG and PCI appear to have similar rates of the combined end point of death from any cause, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79-1.17).
        </p>

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         As the complexity of associated coronary artery disease increases, assessed either by the SYNTAX score or as the number of vessels that need revascularization, the benefit in favor of CABG over PCI with stenting increases.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For patients with lower complexity coronary disease who can undergo PCI at an acceptable risk and with reasonable probability for success, PCI may be an acceptable or even preferred option in some patients. Our experts prefer CABG for younger patients who have low surgical risk, for whom short-term surgical outcomes are favorable and potentially favorable long-term outcomes more meaningful.

         CABG is associated with a significantly higher incidence of adverse in-hospital outcomes, including death, MI, and stroke. However, the long-term rates of death, MI, and stroke are comparable or better depending on severity of associated coronary artery disease and possibly duration of follow-up.

         The EXCEL, NOBLE, PRECOMBAT, and SYNTAX trials directly compared CABG with PCI with stenting.

There were no significant between-group differences in the three-year rates of the components of the primary end point. The secondary end point of death, stroke, or MI at 30 days occurred less often in patients in the PCI group (4.9 versus 7.9 percent) due mainly to a lower rate of MI.

Death from any cause, a secondary outcome, occurred more frequently in the PCI group (13.0 versus 9.9 percent; OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.2-6.1) due to a statistically nonsignificant greater number of noncardiovascular deaths. The rate of ischemia-driven revascularization was higher with PCI (16.9 versus 10.0 percent; OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.39-2.44). MI unrelated to the procedure (spontaneous MI) was higher for PCI.

Using Kaplan-Meier five-year estimates (median follow-up of 3.1 years), the primary endpoint of major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events (a composite of all-cause mortality, nonprocedural MI, any repeat coronary revascularization, and stroke) occurred more often with PCI (29 versus 19 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 1.48, 95% CI 1.11-1.96), attributable mainly to more frequent revascularization in the PCI group.

The event rates were 8.7 and 6.7 percent for PCI and CABG (absolute risk difference 2, 95% CI -1.6 to 5.6, respectively) and the difference was attributable to the expected higher rate of ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization in the PCI group (6.1 versus 3.4 percent).

         The application of PCI with stenting to the left main coronary artery began in patients who were not candidates for CABG. With improvement in outcomes, PCI has become a viable option for many patients with left main disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         If left main PCI is being considered, it should not be performed immediately after coronary arteriography. The patient should hear opinions from a multidisciplinary team prior to deciding on a revascularization strategy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Recommendations of others'
         </a>

         The use of PCI in patients with protected lesions is discussed below. (See

         The distal left main coronary artery is involved in the majority of cases (60 to 94 percent of lesions) and the results of PCI are worse than for lesions located at the ostium or mid-shaft [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. For patients with unprotected distal left main disease and involvement of the origins of both the left anterior descending coronary artery and circumflex, we prefer a dedicated two-stent approach in most patients in whom PCI will be performed. Based on the results of the DKCRUSH-V trial discussed below, we believe the double kissing crush technique may be the best strategy. In cases where both origins are large and free of significant disease, a planned single stent strategy may still be the best option.
        </p>
        <p>
         The overall rate of restenosis is low after stenting for LMCAD with rates of target lesion revascularization &lt;5 percent for disease limited to the ostium or mid lesions and single stent approaches into the left anterior descending coronary artery [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35

         ]. The rate of repeat target lesion revascularization is higher for distal lesions involving both origins with the circumflex origin especially vulnerable to recurrence.
        </p>
        <p>
         Outcomes in patients treated for distal disease have been evaluated in several older observational studies using first generation DES [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37-40
         </a>
         ]. In a retrospective cohort analysis that compared outcomes with one- or two-stent techniques for distal disease, the rate of all-cause death was around 15 percent, and the rate of target lesion revascularization was between 17 and 26 percent at five years [

         The optimal stenting technique for distal left main lesions is not known. In many cases, the best approach may be determined by the specific anatomy. PCI of the distal left main coronary artery is technically challenging, and patients with potentially complicated anatomy should be treated only by highly skilled interventional cardiologists. The challenges are greater for bifurcation lesions involving both origins. (See

         Provisional stenting (PS) refers to an intent to stent only the left main coronary artery with the distal end of the stent ending up in the left anterior descending coronary artery (usually) or the circumflex coronary artery. With this technique, the side branch is often "jailed."
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Balloon angioplasty is often performed on the nonstented side branch (either the circumflex or left anterior descending artery); a second sent is applied to the side branch, often with a T technique, for suboptimal balloon angioplasty results.

         The double kissing (DK) crush technique uses two stents. With this technique, both vessels are wired and an initial inflation of both origins is performed. The side branch (usually the circumflex) is stented first with a small portion (approximately 1 mm) of the stent extending into the left main coronary artery. The circumflex wire is removed and the protruding segment is crushed with an angioplasty balloon extending into the main vessel, which is usually the left anterior descending coronary artery. The circumflex is rewired and the first kissing balloon inflation is performed. A stent is then placed from left main to left anterior descending coronary artery. Following proximal optimization technique with which the left main portion of the stent is post-dilated using an appropriately sized noncompliant balloon, the circumflex is again rewired, and sequential high-pressure inflations of the left anterior descending coronary artery and circumflex are performed followed by the final kissing balloon inflation at lower pressure.

         With the T stent technique, which is generally used for a side branch that originates at a 70 to 90 degree angle from the left main coronary artery, a second stent is placed at the origin of the side branch.

         With the culotte technique, both vessels are usually wired and an initial inflation of both origins is performed. A first stent is then placed into either the left anterior descending coronary artery or circumflex and extended into the left main coronary artery to fully cover the lesion. This stent should be sized according to the distal part of the lesion and the proximal segment must then be optimized with angioplasty using an appropriately sized non-compliant balloon (proximal optimization technique). The other vessel is then rewired through a stent strut, a balloon inflation is performed to open the stent strut, and then a second stent is delivered to also extend into the left main coronary artery. The first stented vessel is then rewired through the side of the second stent. After sequential high pressure inflations within each stent, a final kissing inflation is then performed.

         Early studies suggested that outcomes were poorer when distal left main bifurcation lesions are treated by a two-stent approach (ie, crush or kissing stents) rather than with provisional stenting [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37,41
         </a>
         ]. In these early studies, the rate of target lesion revascularization (mostly by repeat catheter-based intervention with drug-eluting stents) was as high as 25 percent. Restenosis was essentially confined to distal lesions, the majority of which had been treated with stents in both branches [
         <a href="#rid27">

         ]. The primary composite end point (cardiac death, MI, and TVR at one year) occurred more often in the culotte group (16.3 versus 6.2 percent; p = 0.001), attributable mainly to an increased rate of TVR (11 versus 4.3 percent). This trial does not address if either dedicated two-stent approach is superior to provisional stenting. This question was addressed in the DKCRUSH-V trial.

The risk of target lesion revascularization was lower with the DK crush technique (3.8 versus 7.9 percent), as was the rate of (protocol-mandated) angiographic restenosis at 13 months (7.1 versus 14.6 percent).

         There are limited data on the use of PCI in patients with acute MI due to LMCAD. Older small series noted in-hospital mortality rates of 30 to 35 percent following PCI with or without stenting [

          45,46
         </a>
         ]. The cases reported represent a selected group that survived to reach the cardiac catheterization laboratory. More observational studies (2011) have reported lower in-hospital mortality rates, ranging from 11 to 21 percent [

        <p>
         The potential efficacy of PCI was illustrated in a report from an observational registry of patients with unprotected left main stenosis; 40 patients with an acute MI (37 of whom had cardiogenic shock) underwent emergency PCI (17 with stenting) [

         Some patients have "indeterminate" left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD). This term is used when left main lesion severity is difficult to quantify by angiography but appears to be approximately 50 percent. In such patients, the decision between coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and medical therapy is difficult. Adjunctive testing with either fractional flow reserve (FFR) or intracoronary ultrasonography (IVUS) has been used to guide therapy in such patients. (See

         We recommend either IVUS or FFR assessment to assist in the decision for CABG in patients with indeterminate disease. We believe these observational studies show that assessment may define a group for whom deferring surgery does not lead to worse outcomes.

         The composite outcome of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke is similar in patients with LMCAD who are treated with coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, the rate of target vessel revascularization is higher with PCI. (See
