         Family planning is an important clinical consideration in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), given that the peak incidence of this disorder is in women of reproductive age and that approximately 50 percent of pregnancies in the United States are unintended. Pregnancies in SLE patients during periods of high disease activity (particularly nephritis) or with significant disease-related damage (such as pulmonary hypertension and cardiovascular disease) are associated with high maternal morbidity and mortality and poor fetal outcomes. Furthermore, many of the medications used for the management of SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), such as

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Contraceptive choice varies for patients with SLE and APS, and depends upon clinical history including the presence or absence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL); current disease activity; the patient's age, reproductive history, and desires; and religious and cultural factors.
        </p>
        <p>
         Recommendations for individualizing the contraceptive decision for patients with SLE and/or APS will be discussed here. Rheumatologists and gynecologists each have specific expertise to contribute toward making the final decision with the patient. An overview of contraception as well as more detailed information regarding the various contraceptive methods can be found in separate topics. (See

         Despite the risks of unintended pregnancy in the setting of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), many women with SLE do not adequately use effective birth control. Survey studies examining the likelihood of unintended pregnancy and the use of effective contraception in reproductive-aged sexually active women with SLE have found that almost one-quarter have inconsistent or no use of contraception [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Women on teratogenic medications were no more likely than others to use effective contraception. An administrative database study indicates low rates of prescription contraception use by patients with rheumatic disease including SLE; in one institution, 32.1 percent of patients used prescription contraception and only 7.9 percent used highly effective methods despite a 70 percent rate of teratogenic medication use  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119765" href="/z/d/graphic/119765.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The inconsistent use of contraception in patients with SLE may partly reflect limited screening, counseling, and gynecology referral by rheumatology clinicians. One prospective study of 178 adolescents from a rheumatology practice evaluated clinician performance of behavioral screening, including screening for sexual activity, and demonstrated low rates of screening by rheumatologists (12.4 percent) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The major reported barrier to addressing contraception was limited time during the clinic visit. Other factors identified by rheumatologists included logistical issues, their discomfort with the subject area, and ambivalence about their role in behavior screening. Other studies have found that approximately one-half of adult reproductive-aged women with SLE do not receive documented contraceptive counseling [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. Additionally, older age, depressive symptoms, more active disease, and being from a White population have been associated with reduced rates of contraceptive counseling [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Racial disparities in family planning also likely play a role in contraceptive use patterns. An analysis of Medicaid claims data found that Asian American and Hispanic women had lower odds of contraception dispensing and Black women had lower odds of highly effective contraception use [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Use of pregnancy intention screening tools or structured documentation fields within the electronic medical record has been suggested to guide reproductive health discussions about contraception, but adoption by clinicians has been low [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. For example, contraception documentation within the Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness (RISE) registry was 7.9 percent for women of childbearing age with SLE and was no higher for women on teratogenic medications compared with women not taking such medications [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Additional factors likely contribute to underutilization of contraception among women with SLE. Clinicians may advise against estrogen-containing contraceptives due to concerns regarding risk of disease flare or thrombosis and may be unfamiliar with alternative long-acting reversible contraceptive methods that do not contain estrogen. Estrogen-progestin contraceptives continue to be underused in this population in spite of good data that these methods are safe in SLE patients with stable, mild disease and without the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL).
        </p>
        <p>
         Awareness of contraception and reproductive health among women with SLE is increasing. Both the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR; formerly known as European League Against Rheumatism) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) have published guidance documents regarding selection of safe and effective contraception for women with SLE [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, in the United States, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandates appropriate patient education regarding necessity of contraceptive use when initiating therapy with

         The choice of the optimal method of birth control for women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and/or antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) depends upon multiple factors, including patient values and preferences, efficacy and side effects of contraceptive methods, underlying disease activity, thromboembolic risk, and medication interactions. The rheumatologist and gynecologist both contribute to identifying these factors and ultimately making recommendations to the patient.

         The effectiveness of a contraceptive method is expressed as both theoretical or "perfect use" and actual or "typical use," with the actual effectiveness typically being lower due to inconsistent or incorrect use. Effectiveness should be taken into account when choosing a contraceptive method. Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), which traditionally include intrauterine devices (IUDs) and
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9817" href="/z/d/drug information/9817.html" rel="external">
          progesterone

         implants, are considered the most effective form of contraception  (

          figure 1
         </a>
         ). By contrast, barrier methods, which include condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides, have low rates of typical use effectiveness. (See

         The choice of contraceptive agent should take into account the underlying disease activity and severity of SLE. As an example, SLE patients with high disease activity are advised against the use of estrogen-containing contraceptives given the limited data on thromboembolic risk and risk of disease flare in patients with active disease.

         Comorbidities such as hypertension and migraine with aura should also be considered when choosing a contraceptive agent.

         A number of comorbidities associated with increased risk of thromboembolism are more prevalent in SLE patients, including a history of thrombosis or the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs; eg, lupus anticoagulant [LA], immunoglobulin G [IgG] and IgM anticardiolipin [aCL] antibodies, and IgG and IgM anti-beta2-glycoprotein I [anti-beta-2GPI]), uncontrolled hypertension or other cardiac risk factors, known cardiovascular disease, migraine with aura, stroke, and complicated or longstanding diabetes. Thus, a careful assessment of thromboembolic risk is necessary to exclude patients at greatest risk when using some of the hormonal contraceptive methods. (See

         Interactions of hormonal contraceptives with other medications used to treat SLE may lead to decreased efficacy of either the contraceptive or the alternative medication. Medications commonly used in SLE that have potential interactions with estrogen-containing contraceptives include

         Our approach to helping a woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) decide upon a contraceptive method includes counseling on the necessity for planning when it will be ideal to be pregnant, and explaining the increased risks associated with an unintended pregnancy. Family planning takes into account achieving good disease control prior to pregnancy, and using the most effective method of contraception particularly for those with severe disease-related damage, high levels of disease activity, or use of teratogenic medications. We also provide patients with guidance regarding effective and safe methods for the given clinical situation, while taking into account their specific values and preferences. Any risk associated with a contraceptive method must be weighed against the risk of unintended pregnancy for that particular patient. (See

         While other LARCs may also be safe and effective for SLE and patients with aPLs, we prefer the LNg-IUD because it has not been shown to increase thrombosis risk or have a detectable impact on bone density. By contrast, the effect of the etonogestrel-releasing contraceptive implant on bone density and thrombosis risk is uncertain. Another advantage of the LNg-IUD is that it reduces menstrual blood loss, which many women consider a benefit and is particularly helpful for patients on anticoagulation. The

         For patients who want to use an oral hormonal contraceptive, the estrogen-progestin contraceptives with ethinyl estradiol doses of 30 mcg or lower (dose used in the clinical trials) may be used in patients with stable low disease activity and documented negative aPLs. We suggest avoiding the transdermal patch as an alternative contraceptive due to the potentially higher estrogen exposure. The vaginal ring is suggested to provide serum estrogen levels comparable to those seen with estrogen-progestin pills, but there are no data on its use in SLE patients. (See

         Contraceptive implants are an alternative option to IUDs for women with SLE or aPLs who want an effective LARC and cannot take estrogen-containing preparations. The implant most commonly used in the United States is a single rod subdermal implant that is placed in the inner upper arm and releases etonogestrel (a third-generation progestin) over a three-year period. An LNg (a second-generation progestin) implant is also available in many countries but not the United States. (See

Given the slightly greater risk of venous thrombosis associated with third-generation progestins, and the lack of data for use in aPL-positive patients, we prefer use of the LNg-containing IUD over contraceptive implants in aPL-positive women. Progestin-only contraceptives are not associated with an increased risk of SLE flare. (See

The potential side effects of progestins differ according to their generation, which is pertinent for evaluation of suitability for SLE patients. All progestins can cause irregular bleeding. Second-generation progestins are associated with more androgenic side effects such as acne, hirsutism, and weight gain than are third-generation progestins; however, third-generation agents are associated with a slightly higher risk of venous thrombosis.

         Other estrogen-progestin contraceptive hormone administration methods enhance convenience, and include a transdermal patch and an intravaginal ring. The efficacy for these is similar to that of the estrogen-progestin pill, but the overall estrogen exposure appears to be increased with the patch [
         <a href="#rid29">

         Serious complications associated with estrogen-progestin hormonal contraceptives are usually vascular in nature, including venous thromboembolism, stroke, and myocardial infarction. The use of estrogen-progestin hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated in women with aPL with or without SLE due to an increased risk of thrombosis. The safety of use in patients with fluctuating aPL titers or positive aPL on anticoagulation is unknown, and thus their use is not recommended. In addition to the absolute and relative contraindications to the use of oral contraceptives for the general population, a number of comorbidities that present concern for increased cardiovascular risk are more prevalent in SLE patients, including prothrombotic factors (generally aPL) or history of thrombosis, uncontrolled hypertension or other cardiac risk factors, known cardiovascular disease, migraine with aura, stroke, and complicated or longstanding diabetes.

         A reduction in estrogen content in birth control pills has markedly decreased the high thrombosis risk associated with the earliest birth control pills. As described above, differences in the type of progestin used in estrogen-progestin hormonal contraceptives account for some variability in venous thrombosis risk among preparations. Third-generation progestins confer greater venous thrombosis risk than do second-generation progestins due to greater activated protein C resistance, while the lowest risk of venous thromboembolism is found in estrogen-progestin contraceptives containing LNg [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. Other factors such as genetic or acquired thrombophilia, smoking, age over 35 years, and obesity likewise increase the risk of venous thromboembolism in those taking hormonal contraceptives. (See

         aPLs are significant risk factors for thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity in patients with SLE as well as primary APS, and multiple case reports suggest an association of oral contraceptive use with increased risk of thrombosis in aPL-positive patients [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31-34
         </a>
         ]. A large case-control study evaluating oral contraceptives and risk of arterial thrombosis in the general population found an increased risk for both stroke and myocardial infarction in patients using oral contraceptives, which was further increased in the presence of a positive lupus anticoagulant (LA) [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. The diagnosis of APS is discussed in detail separately, but is generally defined as presence of one clinical and one laboratory criterion. Clinical criteria include thrombosis (arterial, venous, or small vessel thrombosis) and obstetric morbidity (three or more early losses, one or more fetal losses, or delivery prior to 34 weeks due to severe preeclampsia or placental insufficiency). Laboratory criteria include persistent positive LA, moderate-high titer immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgM anticardiolipin (aCL) antibody , or moderate-high titer IgG or IgM anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (anti-beta-2GPI) antibody. The risk of thrombosis associated with lower titers of aCL or anti-beta-2GPI is controversial. Thus, we generally avoid estrogen-containing contraceptives in the presence of any positive aPLs. (See

         SLE patients with stable low-level disease and without aPLs do not appear to be at increased risk for thrombosis when taking oral hormonal contraceptives.

         ]. The study design specifically excluded high-risk patients with history of thrombosis as well as those with presence of moderate- to high-titer aCL or positive LA in the absence of thrombosis. Although the trial was designed to assess the risk of disease flare, there was no increase in thrombotic complications in the oral contraceptive group versus the placebo group. Some patients in both treatment and placebo groups presumably had low-titer aCLs (not reported). In another trial of SLE patients, treatment with either estrogen-progestin (ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg / LNg 150 mcg/day) or progestin-only (LNg 0.3 mg/day) oral contraceptives resulted in similar low rates of thrombosis, 2 of 54 patients per group [

          DMPA

         The risk for thromboembolism with progestin-only contraception is very low, and they are generally safe for most SLE patients with or without positive aPLs. A meta-analysis including eight observational studies, two of which were in populations at elevated risk for thrombosis, found that the use of progestin-only contraceptive methods was not associated with any increased risk of thromboembolism compared with non-users [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39

         ]. A subgroup analysis confirmed this finding for progestin-only pills and

          DMPA

         . However, the significance of this finding is uncertain due to the low number of DMPA users. There are no good data on the etonogestrel subdermal implant in SLE or APS patients, although thrombosis risk might theoretically be slightly higher than with levonorgestrel-containing preparations due to the inclusion of a third-generation progestin.

         Guidelines from national and international organizations suggest that progestin-only methods are generally safe for use, with the benefits outweighing the risks [

However, reliance on barrier methods may be necessary during periods of acute illness, including acute thrombosis, when other methods may be contraindicated, or as an interim method until more effective methods can be safely instituted. An additional consideration is that condoms are effective for reducing the risk of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. Also, they may be used in combination with oral hormonal contraceptives as dual contraception when patients are on mycophenolate-containing medications that may interfere with efficacy of hormonal contraception.

          Contraception selection
         </strong>
         – The choice of the optimal method of birth control for women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and/or antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) depends upon multiple factors, including patient values and preferences, efficacy and side effects of contraceptive methods, underlying disease activity, other comorbidities, thromboembolic risk, and medication interactions. In addition, any risk associated with a contraceptive method must be weighed against the risk of unintended pregnancy for that particular patient. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Factors to consider'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Considerations for specific methods
         </strong>
         – When helping a woman with SLE and APS initiate contraception, we suggest the following  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef98708" href="/z/d/graphic/98708.html" rel="external">
          table 2

         ) (see

         <strong>
          People who prefer LARC
         </strong>
         – For patients who want to use a long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC), we suggest the
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="104542" href="/z/d/drug information/104542.html" rel="external">
          levonorgestrel
         </a>
         (LNg)-containing intrauterine device (IUD) over other LARC options (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). The

          LNg IUD
         </a>
         is a safe and effective option for most patients with SLE and/or positive antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs). Moreover, it has not been shown to increase thrombosis risk or worsen bone density, and it may reduce menstrual blood loss. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Intrauterine devices'
         </a>
         above and

         <strong>
          People who prefer oral hormonal contraception
         </strong>
         – For patients with stable low disease activity and documented negative aPLs who want to use an oral hormonal contraceptive, we suggest the estrogen-progestin contraceptives (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). We suggest avoiding the transdermal patch and estrogen-progestin contraceptive methods with higher estrogen exposures to minimize thromboembolic and cardiovascular risk (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). The vaginal ring is suggested to provide serum estrogen levels comparable to those seen with estrogen-progestin pills, but there are no data on its use in SLE patients. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Thromboembolic risk and estrogen'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         For patients with high disease activity, apL antibodies, or prolonged immobility (eg, following surgery), we suggest progestin-only contraceptives and IUDs (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Importantly, progestin-only contraceptives have higher rates of discontinuation due to unscheduled bleeding, so women will need to be counseled about this ahead of time. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Progestin-only contraceptives'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         We suggest avoiding estrogen-progestin contraceptives in patients with an increased risk for thrombosis.

         Women taking medications that increase serum potassium or alter kidney function (such as angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors), or women with renal insufficiency, require careful monitoring of serum potassium if taking drospirenone-containing oral contraceptives. (See

          Barrier method
         </strong>
         – Barrier methods are the least effective contraceptive method and should be reserved for situations when hormone-containing contraceptives or IUDs must be avoided or are unacceptable to the woman. (See
