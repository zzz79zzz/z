         Various forms of heart disease occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), such as heart failure (HF) and other conditions, including pericardial and myocardial disease, coronary artery disease, and disturbances in heart rhythm. Some of these conditions are more common in patients with RA than in the general population and contribute to an increased risk of death in affected patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         The pathogenesis, manifestations, evaluation, and management of HF in patients with RA are described here. Coronary artery disease and other cardiac disorders in RA are discussed in more detail separately, as are noncardiac vascular diseases in patients with RA. (See

         There is an increased incidence of heart failure (HF) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared with the general population, and HF may contribute to the shortened life expectancy observed in RA. Symptomatic HF may occur with either a reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (HFrEF) or a preserved LV ejection fraction (HFpEF); these two forms of HF were previously referred to as LV systolic dysfunction and LV diastolic dysfunction, respectively. HFrEF, HFpEF, and asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction are more prevalent among patients with RA than in the general population. Attempts to reduce the risk of HF in patients with RA may substantially improve their survival.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because most studies of HF in RA were performed prior to the distinctions of HFrEF and HFpEF, this topic review largely refers to prior descriptions of undifferentiated HF or HF associated with LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction. While the prior classifications of LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction generally correspond to HFrEF and HFpEF, respectively, these definitions are not entirely interchangeable, as the newer classifications use specific ejection fraction cutoffs to classify patients for each condition, and other features also distinguish these conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
         The distinctions between HFrEF and HFpEF, as well as differences between the terms HFpEF and diastolic dysfunction, are described in detail separately. (See

         Etiopathogenic mechanisms that can be responsible for an increased risk of heart failure (HF) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may include inflammatory mediators, antirheumatic drug therapy, ischemic heart disease, and amyloidosis:

         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In a longitudinal cohort study of 9087 patients with RA, the 10-year incidence of HF was 8.2 percent [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Elevated inflammation (defined as an erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein above the upper limit of normal) was associated with an increased risk of HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF; hazard ratio [HR] 1.45) but not HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). In another longitudinal study of 9889 patients with RA and 9889 controls, a 21 percent increased risk of HF was observed in RA versus controls, with elevated levels of C-reactive protein predicting HFpEF (HR 1.24) and HFrEF (1.17) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>

         Medications used in the treatment of RA, particularly glucocorticoids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may contribute to HF, and antimalarials are a rare cause of cardiomyopathy, but tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors do not appear to increase HF risk in patients with RA:

          Glucocorticoids
         </strong>
         – Therapeutic use of glucocorticoids has been associated with dose-dependent increased rates of HF, as well as myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality [

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In a large observational study, the risk of HF appeared to increase with the daily dose of glucocorticoids prescribed, with a rate ratio of 3.72 (95% CI 2.71-5.12) with ≥7.5 mg/day of

         or its equivalent compared with nonusers [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. The cardiovascular risk was higher for those who had continuing prescriptions than for those who had intermittent prescribing of glucocorticoids, and it was higher for those using glucocorticoids during the six months prior to the cardiovascular event versus those who used glucocorticoids at an earlier time. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7988.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         An association of glucocorticoid-related risk was illustrated in a population-based study from the Rochester Epidemiology Project that reported that rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive patients, particularly those with high cumulative exposure to glucocorticoids, high average daily dose, and recent use, were at increased risk of cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, HF, and death from cardiovascular causes [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. The RF-positive patients with high cumulative exposure had a threefold increased risk (hazard ratio [HR] 3.06, 95% CI 1.81-5.18), which persisted after adjustments for demographic features, baseline cardiovascular risk factors, and RA characteristics. By contrast, RF-negative patients were not at increased risk of cardiovascular events, regardless of glucocorticoid exposure. The observed association between glucocorticoids and HF remain challenging to study. While glucocorticoids can reduce inflammation, they can also exacerbate HF, thus confounding the association.

          NSAIDs
         </strong>
         – Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use is rarely associated with a first occurrence of HF; however, it can cause a worsening of preexisting HF. The major mechanism for HF exacerbation is an increase in afterload resulting from NSAID-induced systemic vasoconstriction, which can lead to a further reduction in cardiac contractility and cardiac output in advanced HF. The risk of HF in patients using NSAIDs is discussed in detail separately. (See

         Ischemic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of HF due to systolic dysfunction in the general population. HF is also likely to result from an ischemic cardiomyopathy in a significant percentage of patients with RA, given that the prevalence of coronary disease is increased in patients with RA compared with the general population [

        <p>
         However, among a cohort of patients with RA with a high incidence of HF, the cumulative incidence of symptomatic ischemic heart disease, including angina and hospitalization for myocardial infarction, was not significantly different from that of age- and sex-matched controls [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10

         The incidence of heart failure (HF) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is increased compared with a population of similar age and sex distribution without RA and is independent of other cardiovascular risk factors [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,10-12
         </a>
         ]. A number of population- and registry-based studies have provided estimates of the incidence, prevalence, and prognosis of HF in RA [

        <p>
         One of the largest case-control studies, from Denmark, involving 51,859 patients with RA and 256,653 age- and sex-matched controls without RA, observed an increased risk of HF for patients with incident RA both with and without ischemic heart disease over a 10-year follow-up period (hazard ratio [HR] 2.06, 95% CI 1.90-2.24, and 1.23, 95% CI 1.20-1.23, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>

         Findings in these studies have also included evidence of a higher incidence of HF among patients with RA compared with patients without RA after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors (adjusted incidence ratio 1.61, 95% CI 1.43-1.83) [

         Left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and heart failure with reduced LV ejection fraction (HFrEF) may be severalfold more common in patients with RA than in the general population, although they appear to be less common in RA than diastolic dysfunction [

         In one cross-sectional study that compared 226 patients with RA with 3960 members of the general population, LV systolic dysfunction, defined as an LV ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40 percent on echocardiography, was more common in patients with RA (5.3 versus 1.8 percent) [

          Frequency and risk of diastolic dysfunction
         </strong>
         – Typically, epidemiologic studies have used Doppler echocardiography to assess diastolic heart function. Such measurements usually consist of transmitral blood flow velocity measured in early diastole (E) and late diastole corresponding to atrial contraction (A), and the ratio of these velocities (E/A ratio); or measurements of the velocity of septal myocardium adjacent to the mitral valve annulus during systole (Sa), early diastole (Ea or E'), and atrial contraction (Aa or A') using tissue Doppler assessments (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3504.html" rel="external">
          "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"
         </a>
         ). As an example of such studies, a higher prevalence of impaired LV diastolic relaxation was found in a group of 47 patients with RA of at least five years' duration compared with healthy age- and sex-matched controls (66 versus 43 percent) [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, in another cross-sectional study, the prevalence of at least mild diastolic dysfunction was increased in patients with RA versus age- and sex-matched controls (59 versus 39 percent) [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         As in the general population, the prevalence of diastolic dysfunction increases with age. While some studies suggested that RA disease duration is a risk factor that is independent of patient age [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,21
         </a>
         ], another study showed that the prevalence of HF, predominantly diastolic, was significantly related in patients with RA to both age and disease duration [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In a series of 100 RA patients, the presence of LV diastolic dysfunction was more prevalent than LV systolic dysfunction (55 versus 9 patients), and LV dysfunction overall was related to both RA disease severity and disease duration [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Over a five-year period, the rate of progression of diastolic dysfunction was more rapid in a cohort of 160 patients with RA compared with 1391 non-RA controls [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Consistent with the high risk of progression in this population, a prospective cohort of 217 RA patients without diastolic dysfunction at baseline demonstrated a 24 percent incidence of new echocardiographic diastolic dysfunction at one year [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Multivariate analysis revealed that decreased E/A ratios in transmitral Doppler flow waveforms (but not meeting criteria for diastolic dysfunction), age, and elevated systolic pressures were independent predictors of incident diastolic dysfunction. It has been suggested that these risk factors could be used to monitor high-risk subpopulations with RA for early intervention, with the notion that subclinical LV diastolic dysfunction may represent an early risk factor for the development of HFpEF and, potentially, HFrEF in RA.

          LV hypertrophy
         </strong>
         – LV hypertrophy (LVH) is a recognized cause of diastolic HF, but it is unclear whether LV mass is higher or lower in RA patients compared with controls. In a study of 89 RA patients without clinical cardiovascular disease and 89 healthy matched controls who were examined echocardiographically, the prevalence of LVH was significantly greater in those with RA than in controls (18 versus 6.7 percent, respectively) [

         By contrast, a study of 75 RA patients and 225 matched controls, also without clinical cardiovascular disease, found that LV mass was lower in RA patients than in controls when measured using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with the mean LV mass in RA patients being 18 percent lower than in controls [

         Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with an increased mortality rate compared with individuals from the general population of the same age and sex, and several studies indicate that deaths are attributed to heart failure (HF) more often for patients with RA than for the general population. This difference appears to be the result of an increased incidence of HF in RA rather than a worse prognosis once HF develops [

         The risk of developing heart failure (HF) is increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The prevalence and/or incidence of echocardiographically determined left ventricular (LV) systolic and both LV and right ventricular (RV) diastolic dysfunction is also increased in this population.

         The etiology and pathogenesis of HF in RA are not well understood. An increased prevalence of established risk factors (ie, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia) may contribute, but RA itself appears to be an independent risk factor. (See

         Patients suspected of HF based upon symptoms and findings suggesting excess fluid accumulation and reduced cardiac output should be evaluated for HF; the diagnosis of HF is made the same way in RA patients as in other patients. (See

         The approach to the patient with HF with or without RA uses the history, physical examination, laboratory studies, chest radiograph, electrocardiography (ECG), and echocardiogram to establish the diagnosis, determine the etiology, and assess severity. (See

         Antiinflammatory and antirheumatic drug therapies, including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors, antimalarial drugs, and glucocorticoids, may play a role in precipitating or exacerbating HF. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors may exacerbate existing HF, but whether they can precipitate new HF remains uncertain. (See

         Treatment of HF is similar in patients with and without RA, but attention to the possible adverse cardiovascular effects of antiinflammatory and antirheumatic drug therapy may lead to additional diagnostic studies and/or cessation or gradual withdrawal of certain agents, particularly NSAIDs, COX-2 selective inhibitors, and glucocorticoids.
