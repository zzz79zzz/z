         Administration of the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine is routinely recommended in children, with a single booster dose of a vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) recommended for 11- to 12-year-olds, followed by tetanus toxoid and the reduced diphtheria toxoid in the form of Td or Tdap recommended at 10-year intervals throughout life  (

        </p>
        <p>
         Despite these recommendations, immunity to tetanus and diphtheria continues to wane among adults in the United States. The magnitude of this effect was illustrated in a cross-sectional survey of individuals in the United States who were examined between 1988 and 1994 [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Only 47 percent of adults over the age of 20 had protective antibody to both diseases and only 63 percent of adults with immunity to tetanus also had protective antibody to diphtheria. In comparison, 91 percent of children from 6 to 11 years of age had protective antibody to both diseases. Immunity to pertussis also wanes among adolescents and adults. (See

         The rationale and risk-benefit considerations for the administration of vaccination to prevent tetanus and diphtheria in adults will be reviewed here. Vaccination to prevent pertussis, immunizations in pregnant women, and the general principles behind adult immunization are discussed separately. (See

         Because of near universal vaccination of children with tetanus toxoid, the incidence of tetanus in the United States and other resource-abundant countries has dropped dramatically and steadily since 1940. During the period between 2001 and 2016, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that there were 462 cases of tetanus in the United States, including three neonatal cases [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Unpredictable acute injuries remain the major cause of tetanus in the United States. Adults age 65 years and older are at highest risk for both tetanus and tetanus-related death [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Despite the low rate of clinical disease, many adults are inadequately vaccinated against tetanus. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Routine adult immunization'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In contrast to resource-abundant nations, approximately 1,000,000 cases of tetanus are estimated to occur in resource-limited countries each year. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5525.html" rel="external">
          "Tetanus", section on 'Epidemiology'

         Approximately 20 to 60 percent of adults become susceptible to diphtheria because of waning vaccine-induced immunity and failure to receive recommended booster immunization. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Routine adult immunization'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite the frequent lack of immunity, there is still a low rate of clinical disease because immunization of the population has minimized the transmission of toxigenic strains. Only 13 cases of respiratory diphtheria were reported to the CDC from 1996 to 2016 (zero to five cases in any given year) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. However, unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated travelers to endemic areas are at risk for acquiring this infection. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8051.html" rel="external">
          "Epidemiology and pathophysiology of diphtheria"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For reasons that are not well understood, pockets of diphtheria are reappearing, primarily in resource-limited countries. The epidemics have involved nonimmunized or poorly immunized adults in addition to children.

         <a href="#rid2">
          2,4,5
         </a>
         ]. At least one of those doses should be with Tdap in adults aged 19 years and older who had not received Tdap previously. When indicated, Tdap should be administered regardless of the interval since the last dose of Td. Subsequently, booster doses with either Td or Tdap can be resumed 10 years later.
        </p>
        <p>
         Adults who have not been previously vaccinated against tetanus and diphtheria should receive a series of three vaccines (at least one Tdap; the other two can be either Td or Tdap vaccines) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The preferred schedule is a Tdap vaccine dose followed by a Td or Tdap vaccine dose four weeks later and another Td or Tdap vaccine dose 6 to 12 months later.

         The following figures summarize the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations for immunization of adults without and with comorbidities, respectively  (

         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Previously, ACIP only recommended a single Tdap dose, with the rest of tetanus and diphtheria vaccination to be completed with Td; in 2020, it recommended that either Tdap or Td could be used for additional catch-up or booster doses following the Tdap dose since Tdap has a reassuring safety profile and allows providers more flexibility in choice of vaccine. The CDC also provides

          guidance
         </a>
         regarding the choice of vaccine in the setting of a shortage. The use of Tdap for prevention of pertussis is discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8044.html" rel="external">
          "Pertussis infection in adolescents and adults: Treatment and prevention", section on 'Vaccination'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The rationale for universal vaccination against tetanus and diphtheria every 10 years is waning immunity. In a serologic survey in the United States between 1988 and 1994, fully protective levels of anti-tetanus and anti-diphtheria antibodies were detected in 91 percent of individuals aged 6 to 11 years but in only 47 percent of individuals 20 years or older [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Not surprisingly, protective antibody levels were more likely in adults with a history of military service, higher levels of education, higher incomes, and medical insurance [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Similar findings were noted with diphtheria immunity in a 1995 study of 1000 United Kingdom-born blood donors in North London: 38 percent were susceptible to diphtheria (serum

         ].

For patients with clean minor wounds who have received three or more doses of a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine, another dose should be given only if the last dose was given 10 or more years ago. For patients with wounds that are more severe than a clean and minor wound (such as, but not limited to, wounds contaminated with dirt, feces, soil, or saliva; puncture wounds; avulsions; wounds resulting from missiles, crushing, burns, or frostbite) who have received three or more doses of a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine, another dose should be given only if the last dose was given five or more years ago. The vaccine series should be continued through completion as necessary. If there is any doubt about whether or not an adult received the primary series, three doses of Td or Tdap (with Tdap given for at least one of the doses) should be administered; the first dose and second dose should be separated by four weeks and the third dose should be given 6 to 12 months later  (

         <a href="#rid1">

         (250 units intramuscularly [IM]) is indicated in individuals who have sustained a wound that is more severe than a clean and minor wound (eg, wounds contaminated with dirt, feces, soil, or saliva; puncture wounds; avulsions; wounds resulting from missiles, crushing, burns, or frostbite)
         <strong>
          and
         </strong>
         who have either received fewer than three doses of tetanus toxoid previously or in whom the number of previous doses is unknown.

         Appropriate tetanus prophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible following a wound but should be given even to patients who present late for medical attention. This is because the incubation period is quite variable; the incubation period of tetanus is approximately 8 days but ranges from 3 to 21 days [

         Severe systemic reactions, such as anaphylaxis, generalized urticaria, angioedema, and neurologic complications, have been reported following Td administration, but a causal relationship between the neurologic complications and vaccine administration have not been established. Patients who develop an arthus-like reaction tend to have high serum antitoxin levels and should be instructed to avoid booster doses more often than every 10 years. (See

         – Administration of the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine is routinely recommended in children, with a single booster dose of a vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) recommended for 11- to 12-year-olds, followed by tetanus toxoid and the reduced diphtheria toxoid in the form of Td or Tdap recommended at 10-year intervals throughout life  (
