         Children who require artificial airways (ie, tracheostomy for the management of chronic respiratory insufficiency or endotracheal intubation for an acute critical illness) are at increased risk for bacterial tracheopulmonary infections. Infections in these patients occur due to bacterial colonization of the artificial airway and mucosal injuries related to airway cannulation [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Tracheobronchitis in this setting is generally characterized by clinical signs of respiratory tract infection (eg, fever, cough, increased sputum production) without radiographic evidence of pneumonia.

          Ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis
         </strong>
         – Ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT, also called nosocomial tracheobronchitis) has been proposed as a clinical entity distinct from, and possibly a precursor to, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. VAT is generally characterized by clinical signs of respiratory tract infection (eg, fever, cough, increased sputum production) without radiographic evidence of pneumonia. VAT can occur in children ventilated via endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy tube placement. Though VAT is widely accepted as a distinct clinical entity in children and adults, its intermediary role in development of VAP and whether early treatment of VAT reduces risk of subsequent VAP remain uncertain. VAT in adult patients is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1644.html" rel="external">

          Artificial airway-associated tracheobronchitis
         </strong>
         – Tracheobronchitis also can occur in children who have tracheostomy tubes for airway support but who are not receiving mechanical ventilation. The term "artificial airway-associated tracheobronchitis" may be more appropriate for this category of infection, with VAT representing a substantial subset of this. Children with laryngeal diversion and tracheostoma without a tracheostomy tube also may develop bacterial tracheitis, but it is unclear if they have increased risk relative to children with intact airways.

          "Tracheobronchitis" versus "tracheitis"

         – The terms "tracheobronchitis" and "tracheitis" are often used interchangeably to describe infections associated with artificial airways. In this topic we will use the term "tracheobronchitis."

          Children who are chronically tracheostomy-dependent

         – Tracheobronchitis is common among children who are chronically tracheostomy-dependent. In studies of children with newly placed tracheostomy tubes, approximately 30 to 40 percent were readmitted to the hospital within the first 12 months for lower respiratory tract infections (ie, tracheobronchitis and pneumonia) [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17
         </a>
         ]. Pneumonia accounted for the majority of readmissions, but it is likely that many additional episodes of tracheobronchitis occurred that did not require hospital admission.

         Chest radiographs should be obtained to distinguish ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) from ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). A normal chest radiograph generally excludes VAP; however, chest radiographs lack specificity and sensitivity in detecting pulmonary infiltrates, particularly early in the course of VAP. Hence, episodes defined clinically as VAT could actually be early VAP [
         <a href="#rid18">

         Computed tomography (CT) has greater sensitivity for VAP; however, concerns regarding exposure to radiation in children undergoing CT preclude routine use of this modality in the evaluation of VAP and VAT. (See

         Peripheral blood white blood cell count (WBC) with differential is commonly obtained in patients with suspected bacterial tracheobronchitis as an indicator of infection.

         The Gram stain of the tracheal aspirate should be compared with previous cultures if any are available. Presence of microbes with morphology different from those identified in recent specimens (eg, current gram-positive cocci versus past gram-negative rods, and vice versa) raises suspicion for new bacterial infection over simple colonization [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. A negative Gram stain may be somewhat reassuring when there is otherwise low suspicion of airway infection. A positive Gram stain alone without other clinical data suggesting the presence of infection may reflect colonization [

         Quantitation (ie, ≥25 per low power field) or semiquantitation (ie, few to many, 2+ to 4+) of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) on the Gram stain also may have utility in some cases. If PMNs are absent or present only in low numbers, bacterial infection is unlikely. The presence of many PMNs, even when exceeding the 25 per low power field threshold, may occur in the absence of infection and does not help in differentiating between tracheobronchial and pulmonary infection [

          6,19

         In children who are chronically tracheostomy-dependent, viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRI) are common causes of purulent secretions and acute respiratory symptoms. Thus, viral testing of tracheal aspirates (eg, with multiplex polymerase chain reaction tests, rapid viral antigen tests, or viral culture) should be routinely performed as part of the initial evaluation of acute respiratory exacerbations in this population. In contrast, viral infections less commonly cause nosocomial VAT in children who are intubated in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). In this setting, viral testing is not routinely part of the initial evaluation, but may be useful if the initial evaluation is nondiagnostic or if there is known exposure to a viral pathogen.
        </p>
        <p>
         Viral LRIs in children with artificial airways are generally caused by the same respiratory viruses that affect children without tracheostomies (eg, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5973.html" rel="external">
          "Seasonal influenza in children: Clinical features and diagnosis"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Results of viral testing should be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical picture and results of the bacterial culture. Interpretation is fairly straightforward if the bacterial culture is negative and viral testing is positive, consistent with viral LRI. However, if both the bacterial culture and viral testing are positive, this may represent either viral LRI complicated by bacterial superinfection or viral LRI in the setting of chronic airway colonization. As previously described, quantitative culture results and review of prior tracheal cultures can be helpful in distinguishing between these (see
         <a class="local">
          'Culture'
         </a>
         above). The patient's clinical picture should also be taken into consideration. If the patient is acutely ill with considerable symptomatology (eg, high fevers, needing increased respiratory support), bacterial superinfection is more likely.

         Tracheobronchitis in children with artificial airways is a clinical diagnosis that is imperfectly defined [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19,22,23
         </a>
         ]. No single test confirms the diagnosis. For children who are chronically tracheostomy-dependent, tracheobronchitis is typically diagnosed clinically on the basis of fever and new onset purulent tracheal secretions in the absence of other causes for these finding. Sputum cultures are helpful in the management, but positive sputum cultures alone are insufficient to make the diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The most commonly used diagnostic criteria for diagnosing ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) are those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) surveillance definition [

         These surveillance criteria have limitations and they therefore lack precision. The determination of increased sputum production at the bedside can be somewhat subjective [

          18
         </a>

          18,19
         </a>

         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Chest auscultation is often unreliable in ventilated patients (eg, audible crackles may not indicate infection, infection that is present may not generate crackles audible over ventilator-related noise). Similarly, fever and other adjunctive tests such as peripheral blood white blood cell count (WBC) are not specific to respiratory tract infections or bacterial versus viral respiratory tract infections. Even positive Gram stains and quantitative bacterial cultures of tracheal aspirates provide less certainty than previously thought [

        </p>

         The goals of treatment must balance the desire to treat episodes early in order to improve patient outcomes (ie, to reduce duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay [LOS] and prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP] or systemic infection) against the desire to avoid overtreatment with antimicrobial agents, which promotes the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant microbes and increases the cost of medical care.

         A treatment course of three to seven days is generally sufficient for an uncomplicated course of artificial-airway-associated bacterial tracheobronchitis [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23,25
         </a>
         ]. Alternatively, antimicrobial therapy may be continued until a few days after resolution of respiratory tract symptoms. In a retrospective study of 118 intubated children with VAT, the likelihood of progressing to VAP was similar in those who were treated with a prolonged course of antibiotics (≥7 days) compared with shorter courses (hazard ratio [HR] 1.08, 95% CI 0.4-2.9) [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. However, the risk of acquiring multidrug-resistant organisms was increased with prolonged antibiotic duration (HR 5.15, 95% CI 1.54-7.19).

         </span>
         Based on the available studies, ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) in children does not appear to be associated with increased risk of mortality [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9,13,14
         </a>
         ]. While the lack of association suggest that VAT is not a serious illness in most cases, it is possible that these studies failed to detect an association because many had small sample sizes and may have been underpowered to detect an association. In addition, some studies likely included episodes that were not true bacterial VAT.
        </p>
        <p>
         Several studies have demonstrated an association between VAT and both longer duration of mechanical ventilation and longer pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) length of stay (LOS) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9,13,14
         </a>
         ]. The directional causality of this association is unclear. It is possible that VAT prolongs the need for mechanical ventilation and thus longer PICU LOS. However, it is also likely that children with underlying conditions requiring longer durations of mechanical ventilation are at greater risk of developing VAT.
        </p>

         There are few published reports of outcomes following tracheobronchitis among children who are chronically tracheotomy-dependent. In our experience, most of these children recover from a single episode of tracheobronchitis without lasting sequelae. Frequent or recurrent respiratory tract infections likely contribute to morbidity and mortality in this population; however, recurrent pneumonias play a more important role than do tracheal infections. In a study from a single institution of 142 tracheostomy-dependent children followed for an average of 4.1 years, there were 29 episodes of tracheobronchitis among 25 patients (18 percent) [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26

         These measures are appropriate for intubated patients in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) setting and generally do not apply to chronically tracheostomy-dependent children managed in the outpatient setting. However, some of these interventions (eg, practicing good hand hygiene, good oral hygiene, and minimizing pooling of oropharyngeal secretions) are likely to be effective in both settings. In addition, routine tracheotomy tube changes and local stoma care are important preventive measures in tracheotomy-dependent children since tracheotomy tubes may be a source for continuing bacterial contamination [

        <p>
         Data on the effectiveness of these measures for prevention of ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) in children are limited, as described below. Indirect supporting evidence comes from studies in adult patients that have demonstrated reduced rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) using some of these interventions. The approach in adult patients is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6995.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         In one study in the PICU setting, implementation of a care bundle incorporating many of the measures listed above was associated with a decrease in VAT episodes in the pre-intervention to postintervention period from 3.9 to 1.8 cases per 1000 ventilator days [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. However, another study using a similar care bundle aimed at reduction of VAP observed an increase in VAT rate from 2 to 3.2 episodes per 1000 ventilator days, while the VAP rate fell from 5.6 to 0.3 infections per 1000 ventilator days [

         <strong>
          Clinical features
         </strong>
         – Tracheobronchitis in children with artificial airways is generally characterized by clinical signs of respiratory tract infection (eg, fever, cough, increased sputum production) without radiographic evidence of pneumonia. It may be difficult to distinguish from associated lung infection (eg, ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP]) and viral infections involving the lower respiratory tract. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical features'

          Treatment
         </strong>
         – For children diagnosed with bacterial tracheobronchitis (according to the criteria above), we suggest antibiotic therapy (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Treatment'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Initial empiric antimicrobial therapy is aimed at providing coverage for the most likely pathogens (see
         <a class="local">
          'Pathogens'
         </a>
         above) and is individualized according to the severity of illness, previous culture results (if available), current Gram stain results, and local resistance patterns. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Empiric therapy'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The antibiotic regimen should be tailored when the culture and susceptibility results of the tracheal aspirate are available. The usual duration of treatment is three to seven days. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Definitive therapy'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Outcome
         </strong>
         – Among children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) is associated with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and PICU length of stay. Studies have not identified an increased risk of mortality in children with VAT. Among chronically tracheotomy-dependent children, most patients recover from a single episode of tracheobronchitis without lasting sequelae. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Outcome'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Prevention
         </strong>
         – Measures to prevent respiratory tract infections in children with artificial airways include elevating the head of bed at least 30°, providing regular oral care, and extubating as soon as possible. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prevention'
