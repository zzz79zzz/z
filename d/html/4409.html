         Lung cancer is a major cause of cancer-related mortality in men and women. Global strategies targeted at lung cancer prevention and screening have been promoted to prevent or detect lung cancer in its early stages.

         AFB uses the principle that tissue emits fluorescent light when exposed to light of a suitable wavelength to identify preinvasive and invasive lesions of the bronchial tree [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. AFB was originally developed to detect preinvasive lesions (metaplasia, dysplasia, carcinoma in situ [CIS]), with the idea that the identification and treatment of such lesions would improve the outcome from
         <strong>
          squamous
         </strong>
         cell carcinoma of the bronchus. However, the falling incidence of squamous cell carcinoma, the rising incidence of adenocarcinoma (which is now the most common lung cancer worldwide and tends not to present as an endobronchial lesion), and the low specificity of AFB have limited its use mainly to research [
         <a href="#rid4">

         </a>
         ].

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Tissues fluoresce when exposed to light of a suitable wavelength. AFB uses an appropriate fluorescence-inducing wavelength of light to illuminate endobronchial tissues. The system collects the fluorescent light and subjects it to digital processing or filtering to produce an image for the bronchoscopist. AFB systems are of sufficient sensitivity to use innate tissue autofluorescence to detect abnormalities and do not require the use of an exogenously administered chemical (fluorophore) to enhance the innate tissue fluorescence intensity.
        </p>
        <p>
         AFB systems are set up to highlight differences in red and green fluorescence from the tissues being studied. Squamous dysplasia, CIS, and microinvasive carcinoma exhibit much weaker green fluorescence and slightly weaker red fluorescence than normal tissues when illuminated by light with a wavelength of 380 to 440 nm (blue spectrum) [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The reasons for the differences in autofluorescence from abnormal bronchial epithelium are not well understood, but may be due to increased epithelial thickness, neovascularization, and/or a reduced concentration of fluorophores in abnormal tissue [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. Identification of differences in autofluorescence between normal and abnormal bronchial epithelium increases the sensitivity of detection of underlying preinvasive lesions at risk of progression to invasive carcinoma.
        </p>
        <p>
         AFB is used to identify lesions at risk of progression to invasive squamous cell carcinoma, but not of other lung cancer cell types or metastatic carcinoma lesions. Adenocarcinoma originates from alveolar cells, the stem cells of which are not found in the airways and so precursor lesions to adenocarcinoma are not found using AFB. Metastatic carcinoma to the airways from distant carcinomas are clearly visible with standard white light bronchoscopy (WLB), and so AFB plays little role in its detection.

         </span>
         Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most frequent type of lung cancer, representing approximately one-third of pulmonary malignancies. Several lines of evidence suggest that squamous cell carcinoma develops from histopathologically normal but carcinogen-exposed bronchial epithelium through a series of lesions of increasing cellular and morphological atypia, namely hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, dysplasia (mild, moderate, severe) and CIS to the development of microinvasive carcinoma and subsequently fully invasive carcinoma [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Preinvasive lesions may be single or multifocal within any individual and may fluctuate between the various histopathologic stages or skip steps as they evolve [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. Not all lesions are programmed to develop into squamous cell carcinoma and most remain indolent or regress to normal epithelium. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies preinvasive lesions using the following descriptors [

         Among the preinvasive lesions, moderate to severe dysplasia and CIS (often termed high-grade preinvasive lesions) carry the highest risk for progression to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. There are no known markers or histopathologic features of high-grade lesions that reliably predict which will progress to invasive carcinoma or the timescale over which this might occur. Several studies propose rates of progression of high-grade lesions to invasive carcinoma that range from 39 to 69 percent occurring over several months or longer [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12-16
         </a>
         ]. The presence of preinvasive lesions of the bronchus is known to be a risk factor for the development of invasive carcinoma; however, the invasive carcinoma does not necessarily develop within the index lesion or at its location within the bronchial tree.

         WLB is usually performed first, since this mimics the sequence described in studies that demonstrated the efficacy of AFB. WLB is used to identify overt carcinoma or visible lesions and allow clearance of the airways of secretions that can impact the autofluorescence imaging, and is followed by AFB. There is evidence that the order of the procedures (standard white light or AFB) has no effect on the findings, sensitivity, or specificity of the procedure; however, as scope/suction trauma can produce mucosal changes that will look abnormal on AFB, some experts recommend performing AFB prior to WLB. The airways accessible to the autofluorescence bronchoscope (which are the same as a standard modern high-definition bronchoscope) are systematically examined using both modalities. Easy switching between WLB and AFB modes on most modern devices allows lesions to be imaged with white light and then autofluorescence to allow abnormalities to be characterized as accurately as possible. Care should be taken to avoid unnecessary trauma while maneuvering the bronchoscope, since factors including cough- and suction-induced trauma and bleeding can significantly undermine fluorescent images and increase the false positive rate of AFB. Abnormalities visible using AFB have color characteristics that depend on the device used and how it is set up (ie, the color of the background normal epithelium and the color assigned to abnormalities) (see
         <a class="local">
          'Devices'
         </a>
         above). Autofluorescence bronchoscopes have a standard biopsy channel and so biopsies should be taken from areas that appear abnormal during either WLB or AFB. The imaging modality that allows the most accurate localization of the lesion is used during biopsy. The procedural technique performed for bronchoscopy and endobronchial biopsy are described separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/105799.html" rel="external">
          "Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Preparation, procedural technique, and complications"

        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, AFB (and WLB) is limited to the detection of airway epithelial abnormalities and cannot be used to detect changes deep to the endobronchial epithelium as the autofluorescence excitation light does not penetrate beyond the basement membrane. AFB is incapable of predicting the histologic diagnosis, and the AFB appearance of preinvasive lesions does not reliably indicate their histologic grade [

         AFB may be helpful in the evaluation of patients who have high-grade sputum atypia with no lesion visible on radiologic imaging [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. However, sputum atypia are rarely encountered in clinical practice since sputum cytology is infrequently performed in patients with suspected lung cancer, is not routinely used for lung cancer screening, and there are issues with pathologic interpretation. Nonetheless, when an abnormal sputum cytology result occurs in the absence of a culprit lesion on chest imaging, most often chest computed tomography (CT) combined WLB and AFB may be helpful to identify the lesion from which the abnormal cells were exfoliated.
        </p>

         The rationale for using AFB as an adjunct to WLB in this setting is based upon the observation that the identification of a culprit lesion(s) may be difficult with conventional WLB alone because abnormalities are often subtle and can occur over a wide area of the tracheobronchial tree (especially among individuals who have smoked heavily or have already had an invasive lung cancer) [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25-29
         </a>
         ]. In addition, studies of patients at high risk for lung cancer that included those with sputum atypia have reported increased sensitivity of AFB when used as an adjunct to WLB for the detection of preinvasive lesions, although these studies used old fiberoptic bronchoscopes rather than the modern high-definition bronchovideoscopes (see
         <a class="local">
          'Efficacy'
         </a>
         below). As an example, in a prospective randomized trial of high-risk patients, the highest prevalence of preinvasive lesions was reported in the 52 patients who had abnormal sputum cytology and normal radiographic imaging; in this group, combined WLB and AFB detected pre-invasive lesions nearly three times more often than conventional WLB alone (11.1 versus 4 percent), although the difference was not statistically significant [

         For patients discovered to have high-grade preinvasive lesions (ie, moderate or severe dysplasia, or CIS), the optimal therapy is unknown and there are no clear guidelines on which option provides the best outcome; thus, choosing therapy is often dependent upon clinician- and patient-preferences after careful discussion of the options, including the risks and benefits of each potential management strategy. Options include surveillance bronchoscopy, local ablative endoscopic therapy (eg, endobronchial cryotherapy or photodynamic therapy), or surgical resection. We, and other experts, suggest that high-grade preinvasive lesions can be followed with combined WLB and AFB with prompt intervention (endoscopic ablation or surgery) if there is confirmed progression to invasive carcinoma [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. This approach is supported by clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Optimal timing and duration of follow-up, however, are unknown, although the interval between surveillance bronchoscopies should probably be greater than six months based on the low progression rates reported in prior studies and the invasive nature of multiple bronchoscopies [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,32
         </a>
         ]. Such an approach should be combined with serial CT screening given the high rate of development of invasive carcinomas in sites remote from the preinvasive lesion under surveillance [

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         We recommend that in patients who have preinvasive lesions, the strategy of surveillance with WLB combined with AFB (when available), rather than intervention, is an acceptable approach that may prevent unnecessary treatments and their attendant morbidity and cost without a significant increase in risk to the patient. This approach is based upon the following rationale:

         Not all high-grade lesions progress into invasive malignancy and in fact, many spontaneously regress [

          9,13,14,16,33,34
         </a>
         ]. Although the outcome and potential for malignant development in any given lesion is unknown, one narrative review estimated that only 30 percent of high-grade pre-invasive lesions progress to invasive carcinoma, while another third spontaneously regress to normal epithelium [

         With the uncertainty regarding the outcome of individual lesions, the effectiveness of the treatments used for high-grade preinvasive lesions has been difficult to evaluate. In some studies a significant proportion of lesions have progressed to invasive carcinoma despite endobronchial therapy [

          13,35

A previous study of 169 patients who underwent bimodality screening with CT scans and AFB showed a dysplasia rate of 11.5 percent and CIS rate of 1.2 percent. Patients with abnormal nodules were three times more likely to have preinvasive lesions at AFB. In this group, 25 percent of the incident carcinomas were squamous cell histology [

Control biopsies were taken from areas that appeared bronchoscopically normal and were compared with biopsies taken from areas that appeared abnormal.

          Specificity

          19,52

         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>

         <a href="#rid23">
          23

         Examples of false-positive appearances under AFB include altered autofluorescence from areas of infection, inflammation, or trauma that give the appearance of being abnormal on AFB but on biopsy, no abnormal lesion is detected. Suction trauma and secretions can cause abnormal autofluorescence appearances, but are easy to distinguish from abnormal lesions using white light imaging. It is possible that some areas of mucosa that appear abnormal on autofluorescence but have normal epithelium on histology, which are thus considered false-positive results, actually represent abnormal epithelium that is so early in its development that it still appears histologically normal. Supporting this theory, one study found that 50 percent of the lesions that exhibited abnormal autofluorescence (but normal histology) had molecular abnormalities that were similar to preinvasive lesions and invasive carcinoma [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54

          Over estimation of the sensitivity of combined WLB plus AFB
         </strong>
         – Estimates of the sensitivity of autofluorescence may be lower than the reported rates because the true number of preinvasive lesions within the visible bronchial tree cannot be accurately determined by the methods used. The study design where control biopsies are those taken from normal-appearing areas may have underestimated the true number of preinvasive lesions, thereby increasing the false-negative rate and sensitivity.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In a study that addressed this possibility, AFB was performed prior to lobectomy [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ]. The bronchial tree was dissected from the lobectomy specimen and the number of preinvasive lesions was determined. AFB detected approximately 50 percent of the preinvasive lesions, suggesting that the true sensitivity is lower than that estimated by studies that used control biopsies.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In addition, estimates of the sensitivity of AFB may have been exaggerated in studies that calculated sensitivity from the number of biopsies that revealed abnormal histology, rather than the number of discrete lesions detected, since more than one biopsy may have been taken from a lesion [
         <a href="#rid23">

         While it has been postulated that the sequence of WLB before AFB may have biased efficacy in favor of autofluorescence, one trial where the sequence was subjected to randomization reported similar outcomes despite the sequence [

         Inevitably, as the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma has fallen over the last 40 years, it is likely that the incidence and prevalence of preinvasive lesions has fallen.

         ]. However, newer WLB devices with improved resolution, in particular high-definition bronchoscopes with more modern and sensitive imaging technology, are now available. There are no data comparing the detection of abnormalities of the bronchial epithelium with high-definition WLB against autofluorescence. It is possible that the learning effect from using autofluorescence may tune the operator to the detection of abnormalities of the bronchial epithelium using WLB. The use of WLB, particularly with a high-definition video system, may produce results similar to that of autofluorescence, but this has not been studied.

         i-scan technology uses a high-definition camera built into a white light bronchoscope that is used to obtain images of very high quality. The image undergoes post-processing and filtering to generate a real-time image. There are three modes:

         Although there are no major studies of this technology, there is the potential for improved identification of preinvasive lesions and invasive carcinomas within the airways. The device and system requires careful calibration and settings optimized to the airways to provide clinically usable imaging of the airways and bronchial epithelium.

         NBI uses two narrow bands of light (400 to 430 nm and 525 to 550 nm, blue and green) to image the bronchial epithelium during bronchoscopy. The light is taken up by hemoglobin and allows visualization of surface blood vessels and the surface structure of lesions. The technology relies on the high vessel density of preinvasive lesions to facilitate their detection within the bronchial tree. Abnormalities include three or more of capillary loops, dotted vessels, complex vascular networks of tortuous vessels, or abrupt-ending vessels [

         Optical coherence tomography (OCT) uses a probe inserted through the working channel of the bronchoscope to deliver a radial beam to the bronchial epithelium. A radial transluminal image is obtained of the bronchus, with high-resolution images of cellular and extracellular structures, and the structure and depth of lesions. Preliminary studies suggest that AFB-guided OCT may be a potential tool for the identification of preneoplastic lesions of the airway [

         <strong>
          Rationale
         </strong>
         - Autofluorescence bronchoscopy (AFB) was developed to detect precancerous lesions with the hope that the identification and treatment of such lesions would improve the outcome from squamous cell carcinoma of the bronchus. However, squamous cell carcinoma is now less common, and data have shown limited clinical usefulness of AFB at this time. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Autofluorescence bronchoscopy (detecting preinvasive squamous lesions)'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Natural history squamous cell carcinoma
         </strong>
         - Squamous cell carcinoma develops through a series of progressive steps from normal epithelium to preinvasive lesions (hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, dysplasia [mild, moderate, severe] and carcinoma in situ [CIS]) before developing into invasive carcinoma. Among the preinvasive lesions, moderate or severe dysplasia and CIS (ie, high-grade preinvasive lesions) are the most worrisome for progressing to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Natural history of preinvasive squamous lesions'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Procedure
         </strong>
         - Commercially available AFB devices use different light excitation and detection wavelengths and have different mechanisms to filter and process the image, resulting in different colors to detect abnormal tissue fluorescence  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68140" href="/z/d/graphic/68140.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         and

          image 1
         </a>
         ). The airways are systematically examined using both conventional white light bronchoscopy (WLB) and by AFB during the same session, although the sequence varies among operators. Biopsies are taken from areas that appear abnormal under either modality. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Procedural technique'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Proposed indications
         </strong>
         - There are no universally accepted indications for AFB. However, AFB may be used as an
         <strong>
          adjunct
         </strong>
         to WLB in patients with high-grade sputum atypia and normal chest imaging, patients with high-grade preinvasive lesions without evidence of invasive carcinoma, or patients with early invasive endobronchial lung cancer who require therapeutic planning. Data to support these indications are derived from small prospective studies or small randomized trials that demonstrated that combined WLB and AFB detected preinvasive lesions with greater sensitivity than WLB alone. However, this increased sensitivity comes at the expense of poor specificity due to a high rate of false-positives. The impact of AFB on clinical outcomes, such as mortality, is unknown because it has not been well studied. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Proposed indications'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Other investigational modalities
         </strong>
         - Developments in WLB (eg, high-definition video, optical coherence tomography [OCT], i-scan imaging, narrow band imaging [NBI], high magnification bronchoscopy) may have the potential to improve the detection of endobronchial preinvasive lesions and early invasive carcinomas. However, these modalities need further study. (See
