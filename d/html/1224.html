         Depressive disorders are common in children and adolescents [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2

         <a href="#rid3">

         ]. Despite its detrimental effects, pediatric depression is often undertreated.
        </p>
        <p>
         The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, assessment, and diagnosis of pediatric depression are reviewed here. Treatment of depression in youths is discussed separately. (See

         The risk for depression increases during childhood [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. As an example, a survey of more than 78,000 parents in the United States in 2007 found that among their children, the point prevalence of depression for different age groups was as follows [
         <a href="#rid2">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The one year and lifetime prevalence rates of depression are even higher. A survey of adolescents age 12 to 17 years in the United States (n &gt;45,000) in 2010 and 2011 found that the one year prevalence of major depression was 8 percent [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Another study found that the lifetime prevalence in adolescents was 11 percent [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].

         The ratio of adolescent females to males who develop major depression is approximately two to one [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ], which is similar to the ratio in adults [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. This sex difference emerges during puberty; in adolescence, the risk for developing depression is greater in girls than boys [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. In the United States, a study of adolescents age 12 to 17 years (n &gt;45,000) found that the lifetime prevalence rates of major depression in females and in males were 18 and 8 percent [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, in prepubertal children, depression appears to be more common in boys than girls. A meta-analysis of 12 community studies (n &gt;15,000 children age ≤12 years) found that the estimated prevalence of unipolar major depression was 60 percent higher in boys than girls (odds ratio 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4) [

         <strong>
          Depressed or irritable mood
         </strong>
         – Depressed mood, such as feeling low, down, sad, or blue much of the time, is a cardinal symptom of depressive disorders. Patients may manifest a depressed mood by perceiving others as antagonistic or uncaring, brooding about real or potentially unpleasant circumstances, maintaining a gloomy or hopeless outlook, believing that everything is "unfair", or feeling helpless or that they disappoint others.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         However, pediatric patients may lack the emotional and cognitive ability to correctly identify and organize their emotional experiences, and depressive disorders may express themselves with an irritable mood [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. Irritability can manifest as feeling "annoyed," “grouchy,” or "bothered" by everything and everyone. Rather than expressing sadness, patients with depressive disorders may be negative and argumentative, and pick fights as a means to convey their emotional distress. Patients may be unable to tolerate frustration and respond to minor provocations with angry outbursts.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Depressed mood appears to be more common than irritable mood in pediatric depression. A prospective study of children and adolescents with depressive disorders (n &gt;1400) found that depressed mood occurred in approximately 58 percent, depressed mood plus irritable mood in 36 percent, and irritable mood in only 6 percent [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. Although irritability is a nonspecific symptom found in many child psychiatric disorders, longitudinal follow-up studies indicate that irritability is associated with adult depressive disorders [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Mood reactivity (the capacity to be cheered up in response to positive events) occurs in depression with atypical features (eg, hyperphagia or hypersomnia), which may be more common in children. By contrast, depression with melancholic features may be more common in adolescents. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Depressive episode specifiers'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Mood reactivity can cause adolescents to seek activities and experiences to temporarily lift their moods. Examples of these activities include affiliation with peers, thrill-seeking, promiscuity, and drug use [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. The use of peer affiliation to alleviate depression is marked by an intense urgency and drive, in contrast to the normal adolescent need for peer affiliation. Depressed adolescents, particularly girls, may often co-ruminate with another depressed peer, thereby reinforcing and increasing depressive severity [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ].

         <strong>
          Diminished interest or pleasure
         </strong>
         – Loss of interest or pleasure (anhedonia) in formerly pleasurable activities is also a cardinal symptom of unipolar major depression. Patients experience events, hobbies, interests, and people as less interesting or fun than previously. Anhedonia may be expressed by describing experiences as "boring," "stupid," or "uninteresting." They may withdraw from or lose interest in friends. If they are sexually active, they may have decreased libido or interest in sex [

         <strong>
          Change in appetite or weight
         </strong>
         – Appetite and weight may decrease or increase in depression. Decreased appetite may manifest with failure to gain weight as expected, rather than weight loss. Alternatively, some patients with depressive disorders crave and eat more specific foods (eg, junk food and carbohydrates) and gain more weight than expected during their adolescent growth spurt.

          Psychomotor agitation or retardation
         </strong>
         – Psychomotor agitation refers to handwringing; the inability to sit still; pacing; or pulling or rubbing clothes, the skin, or other objects. Alternatively, depressed patients with psychomotor retardation talk or move more slowly than is typical for them; in addition, speech volume or inflection may be decreased, and the amount of speech may be diminished. Psychomotor agitation or retardation is regarded as a depressive symptom only if it is noticeable to others, in contrast to subjective feelings of restlessness or feeling slowed down. Retardation and agitation may alternate within a single depressive episode.

          Fatigue or loss of energy
         </strong>
         – Lack of energy (anergia) manifests with feeling tired, exhausted, listless, and unmotivated. Patients may feel the need to rest during the day, experience heaviness in their limbs, or feel like it is hard to initiate activities. Parent-adolescent conflicts can result if parents attribute lack of energy and motivation to laziness, an oppositional attitude, or avoidance of responsibilities. Alternatively, parents may be concerned that the patient has a general medical illness and seek a medical explanation for the anergia.

          Feelings of worthlessness or guilt
         </strong>
         – The self-perceptions of depressed children and adolescents may be marked by feelings of inadequacy, inferiority, failure, worthlessness, and guilt. Evaluation of this symptom is challenging because many youth do not directly acknowledge such negative self-perceptions. In addition, guilt about struggling with depression and its associated functional impairment is not considered a symptom of depression unless the guilt is of delusional proportions.

          Impaired concentration and decision making
         </strong>
         – Depressed youth can have problems with attention, concentration, and memory that were not present to the same degree before the depressive episode. Thinking and processing of information may be slowed. In addition, patients are indecisive, which manifests as procrastination, helplessness, or paralysis in taking action. It can take longer to complete homework and class work than before the depressive episode; school performance may thus decline. Information from the school is helpful to evaluate this symptom.

          Recurring thoughts of death or suicide
         </strong>
         – Depressed patients can experience recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of death) or suicide, or attempt suicide. Morbid thoughts are common in depressed teens and can manifest as preoccupation with music and literature that has morbid themes, or as passive suicidal ideation (eg, thoughts that life is not worth living or that others would be better off if the patient was dead). In addition, there may be active suicidal ideation of wanting to die or killing oneself, suicide plans, suicide pacts, and suicide attempts. Thoughts that contribute to suicidality include pervasive hopelessness (eg, negative expectations for the future) and a view of suicide as the only option to escape emotional pain. Risk factors, assessment, and management of suicidal behavior in children and adolescents is discussed separately. (See

         Pediatric depression is associated with adverse psychosocial outcomes in adulthood. As an example, a systematic review identified 25 prospective studies that enrolled adolescents (total n &gt;21,000) with and without depression; functioning during adulthood was assessed during an average follow-up of nine years [
         <a href="#rid40">

         Patients struggling with depression are also at increased risk for eating disorders, learning disorders, and somatic symptom disorders, and have often suffered physical or sexual abuse, or other traumas.

         The initial clinical evaluation of children and adolescents with a possible diagnosis of a depressive disorder includes a psychiatric and general medical history, mental status and physical examination, and focused laboratory tests (eg, thyroid stimulating hormone, complete blood count, chemistries, and urine toxicology to screen for substances of abuse) [

         Evaluation of depression can be difficult because of nonspecific symptoms, comorbidities, and the differential diagnosis. Depression in children and adolescents may be misunderstood by youths, parents, and professionals alike. The following points provide guidelines to consider when evaluating patients for depression:

         <span class="glyph">

         Diagnosis should be based upon a formal clinical interview with the child or adolescent that is supplemented by information from parents and teachers [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,41,58
         </a>

         The Mood and Feelings Questionnaire has a separate form that is completed by the child or adolescent and the parent; the questionnaire is validated for both children and adolescents and is in the public domain.

         Questions should be phrased in a manner that is normalizing and not stigmatizing (eg, "Everyone I know gets sad sometimes; what kinds of things usually make you sad? Would you say you're usually happy, sad, or in-between?"). Particularly for guarded children and adolescents, more direct questions with empathic responses for their unique experience usually are best tolerated once the youth trusts that it is okay to discuss such topics. Likert scales are helpful for patients who have trouble describing their experiences (eg, "On a scale of 1 to 10, how annoyed have you been lately?").

         </a>
         ], and rule out other psychiatric and general medical disorders that may cause depressive syndromes (eg, substance use disorders and hypothyroidism). If a patient has a pre-existing comorbid condition, an overlapping symptom (eg, poor concentration in a child with pre-existing ADHD) should only be counted towards the diagnosis of depression if the symptom has worsened with the advent of other depressive symptoms.

         Pediatric depression should be evaluated in the context of precipitants, stressors, and academic, social, and family functioning [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. Examples include family and contextual factors that may precipitate or prolong a depressive episode, such as parental depression, parent-child discord, history of abuse or assault, witnessing violence or peer victimization, recent loss, same sex attraction, and gender dysphoria. These factors will guide appropriate intervention, including a treatment plan that targets circumstances that maintain depression and put the adolescent at risk for future episodes.

         Children and adolescents in primary care who present with depressive syndromes that are not readily diagnosable can benefit from referral to psychiatrists or other mental health specialists for further assessment.

         Patients and/or parents may resist the diagnosis of depression and continue to seek a "medical" explanation for presenting symptoms. In these cases, it is often beneficial to join the child or adolescent or family members in their understanding of the presenting concern and extend their view with psychoeducation (eg, "You've been experiencing considerable fatigue that has been immobilizing; it is very common to feel discouraged, annoyed, or even depressed when faced with this kind of stress day in and day out.")
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Although children, adolescents, and their families may initially resist accepting a diagnosis of a depressive disorder, they often come to view the diagnosis of depression as reassuring. The explanation for the symptoms can provide a sense of control and is a significant step toward symptom relief.

Remission also occurs at a specific time of year (eg, spring). In the last two years, two depressive episodes have occurred that demonstrate the temporal relationship and no nonseasonal episodes have occurred. In addition, the lifetime number of seasonal depressions substantially outnumbers the nonseasonal episodes. Seasonal pattern is not used as a specifier if depressive episodes occur in response to a seasonally related psychosocial stressor (eg, stress at school), or if episodes occur at other times of the year as well as seasonally.

         Diagnostic criteria for minor depression typically include two to four depressive symptoms (see

          'Symptoms'
         </a>
         above), at least one of which is dysphoria or anhedonia. In addition, the symptoms cause significant distress or psychosocial impairment. In DSM-5, minor depression is classified as ”other specified depressive disorder, depressive episode with insufficient symptoms” [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29

        <p>
         A systematic review of 24 clinical or community studies found that the estimated lifetime prevalence of pediatric minor depression ranged from 5 to 12 percent, and that suicidal behavior occurred in approximately 10 percent of the individuals with minor depression [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In addition, many of the depressed youth had comorbid psychopathology (eg, anxiety disorders, conduct disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder), and functional impairment was generally comparable to that found in unipolar major depression. Compared with adolescents without minor depression, adolescents with minor depression were at increased risk for psychopathology as adults, including unipolar major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Hence, “minor” depression causes clinical impairment and should be taken seriously.

However, patients with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are angry or irritable most of the day, nearly every day, in between the angry outbursts, whereas the diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder does not require a mood disturbance between outbursts. In addition, angry outbursts in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder occur on average three times per week; in intermittent explosive disorder, verbal aggression occurs on average twice per week. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder requires 12 months of active symptoms, in contrast to intermittent explosive disorder, which requires only 3 months of symptoms.

         Substance/medication induced depressive disorder consists of a mood disturbance that is characterized by a persistently depressed or irritable mood, or diminished interest or pleasure in most activities [

         ]. The mood disturbance develops during or soon after using substances (eg, alcohol, cocaine, opiates, and amphetamines) or medications (eg, interferon, stimulants, or systemic corticosteroids) that are capable of producing the symptoms. In addition, the disturbance causes significant distress or impairs psychosocial functioning.

In addition, the disturbance results in significant distress or impairs psychosocial functioning. Onset of the mood disturbance generally occurs during the first month of the onset of the other medical condition.

         Depression can be diagnosed in the context of chronic illness if there is not a direct causal link between the illness and depression. As an example, the risk for depression is higher in patients with epilepsy, migraine, inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma, but the diagnosis of depression can be made in these conditions, taking care to differentiate somatic symptoms of depression from those of chronic illness (eg, anorexia, insomnia, fatigue, and psychomotor retardation).

         Adjustment disorder with depressed mood is marked by depression that occurs in response to an identifiable psychosocial stressor (eg, parental divorce, academic failure, or peer problems) [

         Major depression and persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) often occur in the context of psychosocial stressors, and the diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depressed mood is superseded by a depressive disorder. Clinicians distinguish a depressive disorder from an adjustment disorder not by noting whether a stressor is present, but by determining whether the patient’s symptoms are sufficient in number, severity, and duration to meet diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder.

         Adjustment disorder with depressed mood can persist beyond six months if the stressor is chronic (eg, ongoing parental conflict).

         Periods of sadness and irritability (dysphoria) in the absence of other symptoms do not warrant a diagnosis of a depressive disorder. As an example, the diagnosis of unipolar major depression requires not only that the dysphoria occurs for most of the day for nearly every day for at least two weeks, but that the dysphoria is accompanied by at least four other depressive symptoms (see
         <a class="local">
          'Symptoms'

        <p>
         Patients with other conditions, such as anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), disruptive behavior disorders, substance use disorders, and eating disorders can experience sadness and demoralization. The dysphoria of anxiety disorders is primarily limited to that experienced when an anxiogenic situation cannot be avoided. Youth with ADHD may be demoralized by rejection from parents, peers and teachers, but this should remit if the ADHD is properly treated. Substance abuse can induce depression, and depression increases the risk for substance abuse. Patients with eating disorders may be dysphoric or listless due to caloric restriction, or conversely, due to being forced to eat and achieve a normal weight.
