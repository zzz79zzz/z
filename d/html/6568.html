Thoracic trauma in adults and specific thoracic injuries in children are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/353.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6569.html" rel="external">"Overview of intrathoracic injuries in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6557.html" rel="external">"Chest wall injuries after blunt trauma in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6562.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary contusion in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among injured children, thoracic trauma occurs infrequently. In several observational series describing pediatric trauma victims, between 4 and 8 percent of children sustained thoracic injury [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>]. </p><p>Blunt mechanisms are involved in 85 percent or more of cases [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>]. Most patients are injured as passengers or pedestrians in motor vehicle crashes. Other mechanisms include falls (8 to 10 percent) and abuse (7 to 8 percent). Children with inflicted injuries usually have rib fractures and are young (typically less than three years of age) [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6613.html" rel="external">"Orthopedic aspects of child abuse", section on 'Rib fractures'</a>.)</p><p>Penetrating thoracic trauma may be caused by a gunshot wound or from stabbing/impalement:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the United States, gunshot wounds are the major cause of penetrating thoracic injury among children. A retrospective study describing reports to the National Pediatric Trauma Registry noted that 60 percent of penetrating thoracic injuries were the result of gunshot wounds, while 33 percent were from stab wounds [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a study from Australia describing the management and outcome of penetrating trauma in children, 21 percent of injuries were caused by gunshot wounds, while 70 percent were the result of knife wounds or impalement [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p>The overall mortality rate for children with thoracic trauma is between 15 and 26 percent [<a href="#rid1">1-3,8</a>]. Most children who die after sustaining a blunt chest injury do so as a result of associated injuries, while the chest trauma itself is the cause of death in the majority of children who die after a penetrating thoracic injury [<a href="#rid1">1-3,8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">ANATOMY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The thorax is composed of the following anatomic structures (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/353.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults", section on 'Anatomy and Injury Patterns'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The chest wall is formed by ribs, costal cartilage, sternum, clavicles, and intercostal muscles, with additional support from the pectoralis muscles anteriorly and the scapula posteriorly. Functionally, the chest wall is an essential part of the mechanics of respiration and provides protection for intrathoracic organs. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6557.html" rel="external">"Chest wall injuries after blunt trauma in children", section on 'Anatomy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The mediastinum is a division of the thorax that contains the heart, aorta, trachea, and esophagus.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The diaphragm forms the floor of the thoracic cavity.</p><p></p><p>Injury patterns as the result of thoracic trauma in children are different from those seen in adults. This is because of the following anatomic and physiologic characteristics:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The chest wall of a child is more compliant than that of an adult because the bones are less ossified and contain more cartilage [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. As a result, the following injury patterns are noted in children:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Significant force is required to cause rib fractures in children, as compared with adults. As a result, intrathoracic injuries frequently occur without associated rib fractures. When rib fractures are present, they often indicate underlying organ injury. In one study, mortality increased linearly with the number of rib fractures present in children who underwent trauma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6557.html" rel="external">"Chest wall injuries after blunt trauma in children", section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6557.html" rel="external">"Chest wall injuries after blunt trauma in children", section on 'Rib fractures'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Children may have serious intrathoracic trauma without obvious injuries to the chest wall [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Traumatic asphyxia and commotio cordis are more common in children [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6569.html" rel="external">"Overview of intrathoracic injuries in children", section on 'Traumatic asphyxia'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The mediastinum is more freely mobile in children than in adults. As a result, the heart and trachea may become displaced by pneumothorax, hemothorax, or diaphragmatic rupture, causing decreased venous return to the heart, decreased cardiac output, and hypotension [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Although children have significant cardiac reserves, they also have higher metabolic demands than adults. Young children also have lower pulmonary reserves than healthy adults. Consequently, once children become hypoxic, their conditions may deteriorate rapidly [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">TYPES OF THORACIC INJURY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Thoracic trauma can be characterized as blunt or penetrating. Due to the proximity of intrathoracic structures, many children with trauma to the chest will have more than one injury. In a retrospective report describing children who had sustained thoracic trauma, 44 percent had two or more chest injuries [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The types of injuries that occur as the result of thoracic trauma vary depending upon the mechanism of injury. In a series describing children with thoracic injuries reported to the National Pediatric Trauma Registry, the following patterns were noted [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Injuries that occurred commonly among children with blunt trauma included pulmonary contusions (49 percent), pneumothorax/hemothorax (38 percent), and rib fracture (35 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among children with penetrating mechanisms, frequent injuries included pneumothorax/hemothorax (64 percent), pulmonary contusion (14 percent), pulmonary laceration (10 percent), and blood vessel injury (10 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Regardless of mechanism, mortality was highest for children with injuries to the heart or intrathoracic blood vessels and for those with associated head injury.</p><p></p><p>Life-threatening thoracic injuries are uncommon among children  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79921" href="/z/d/graphic/79921.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Those that can be immediately life-threatening include tension pneumothorax, massive hemothorax, injuries to the great vessels, cardiac tamponade, and commotio cordis.</p><p>Of injuries that are potentially life threatening, the most common is pulmonary contusion, which occurs in nearly one-half of patients with identified intrathoracic injuries [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6562.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary contusion in children"</a>). Other potentially life-threatening injuries occur less frequently (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6569.html" rel="external">"Overview of intrathoracic injuries in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6557.html" rel="external">"Chest wall injuries after blunt trauma in children", section on 'Flail chest'</a>). These include [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Flail chest (1 percent)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bronchial disruption (&lt;1 percent)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intrathoracic vessel injury (3 percent)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Myocardial contusion (3 percent)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diaphragmatic injury (4 percent)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Esophageal rupture (&lt;1 percent)</p><p></p><p>Traumatic asphyxia is a rare consequence of thoracic trauma that occurs in children because of greater flexibility of the chest wall. Direct compression of the chest from crushing injury, in conjunction with a deep inspiration and closed glottis, results in a marked increase in intrathoracic pressure that is transmitted directly through the superior and inferior vena cava. A rapid increase in intracranial pressure may also occur. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6569.html" rel="external">"Overview of intrathoracic injuries in children", section on 'Traumatic asphyxia'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">ASSOCIATED INJURIES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children with thoracic trauma frequently have associated injuries. In one retrospective series describing children with thoracic trauma treated at a pediatric trauma center, 82 percent of patients had multisystem injury [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Head injuries were reported in 82 percent of children, extremity injuries in 40 percent, and abdominal injuries in 38 percent.</p><p>Among children who survive to emergency department (ED) admission, extrathoracic injuries are more often life-threatening than intrathoracic injuries. Because initial evaluation and stabilization may be focused on associated injuries, the diagnosis of potentially significant thoracic injuries is sometimes delayed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goal of the evaluation of children with thoracic trauma is to identify those with significant injuries. Life-threatening conditions (such as airway compromise, impaired respiratory mechanics, and/or hemorrhagic shock) must be rapidly identified and stabilized (primary survey)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64241" href="/z/d/graphic/64241.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The full extent of the child's injuries can then be determined with a detailed history, careful physical examination, and diagnostic testing (secondary survey)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65952" href="/z/d/graphic/65952.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p>An initial approach to the injured child that includes a description of the primary and secondary surveys, as well as prehospital preparation, is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6571.html" rel="external">"Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child", section on 'Initial approach'</a>.)</p><p>The assessment of airway, ventilatory, and circulatory function in children is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6393.html" rel="external">"Initial assessment and stabilization of children with respiratory or circulatory compromise", section on 'Initial assessment'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6316.html" rel="external">"Technique of emergency endotracheal intubation in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6387.html" rel="external">"Assessment of systemic perfusion in children"</a>.)</p><p>The remainder of this discussion will focus on the evaluation specific to children with blunt and penetrating thoracic trauma.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Initial rapid assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children with significant thoracic trauma who have respiratory or circulatory compromise at the time of initial presentation may have immediately life-threatening injuries such as tension pneumothorax, hemothorax, cardiac tamponade, or injury to the great vessels. Procedures (such as endotracheal intubation or needle thoracostomy) may be required to stabilize these injuries  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59720" href="/z/d/graphic/59720.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>), sometimes before imaging studies have been obtained. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic studies'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Airway</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Airway obstruction from secretions or blood can occur as the result of direct injury to the upper airway or in association with altered mental status, as with traumatic brain injury (TBI).</p><p>Immediate interventions may include suctioning of blood and secretions, repositioning with the jaw thrust maneuver, endotracheal intubation, and/or assisted ventilation. In rare cases of upper airway injury or obstruction in which endotracheal intubation is either contraindicated or impossible, cricothyrotomy may be necessary to establish a patent airway. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6383.html" rel="external">"Basic airway management in children", section on 'Jaw thrust maneuver'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6455.html" rel="external">"Emergency evaluation of acute upper airway obstruction in children", section on 'Rapid assessment of the airway and breathing'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Breathing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Respiratory failure that develops immediately following a traumatic event is typically caused by tension pneumothorax, open pneumothorax, or hemothorax or is related to associated injuries (such as TBI). Children with pulmonary contusion or flail chest often have some evidence of respiratory distress (such as tachypnea), but respiratory failure usually develops later.</p><p>Stabilization may include assisted ventilation, needle chest decompression (to rapidly remove air), and/or tube thoracostomy (to remove air or blood)  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59720" href="/z/d/graphic/59720.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).

Indicated interventions may include needle chest decompression, rapid infusion of isotonic fluid or blood, pericardiocentesis, or (rarely) emergency thoracotomy. (See <a class="local">'Emergency thoracotomy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Historical features that may identify children with significant injuries include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mechanism of injury</strong> – Mechanisms that may result in serious injury include high impact acceleration-deceleration mechanisms (such as motor vehicle crashes) and penetrating injuries.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vital signs at the scene</strong> – Changes in respiratory rate and heart rate may indicate deterioration in the child's clinical condition as the result of a significant injury. Hypotension is a late finding of shock in children, occurring after tachycardia and tachypnea. As a result, clinicians should not be falsely reassured by a normal blood pressure in an injured child with other abnormal vital signs.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chest pain</strong> – Children with thoracic, cardiac, or esophageal injury commonly complain of chest pain.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A complete physical examination, including vital signs with pulse oximetry, should be performed.
