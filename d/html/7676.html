It frequently coexists with medical, psychiatric, sleep, or neurological disorders. It may also be associated with acute stress, medication or substances, poor sleep habits, or changes in the sleep environment. The diagnosis of insomnia requires three main components: persistent sleep difficulty, adequate sleep opportunity, and associated daytime dysfunction.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of insomnia are reviewed here. The epidemiology, consequences, and treatment of insomnia are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7684.html" rel="external">"Risk factors, comorbidities, and consequences of insomnia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97867.html" rel="external">"Overview of the treatment of insomnia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97869.html" rel="external">"Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97868.html" rel="external">"Pharmacotherapy for insomnia in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2093124172"><span class="h1">TYPES OF INSOMNIA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Insomnia is described as short-term or chronic, depending on its duration [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1367802766"><span class="h2">Short-term insomnia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Short-term insomnia, also referred to as adjustment insomnia or acute insomnia, usually lasts a few days or weeks and occurs in response to an identifiable stressor. By definition, symptoms are present for less than three months [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Stressors can be physical, psychological, psychosocial, or interpersonal (eg, job loss, death of a loved one, divorce, argument). Symptoms usually resolve when the stressor is eliminated or resolved or when the individual adapts to the stressor. Occasionally, sleep problems persist and lead to chronic insomnia. This may occur due to the development of poor sleep habits during the acute insomnia period.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3646453791"><span class="h2">Chronic insomnia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Insomnia symptoms that occur at least three times per week and persist for at least three months are considered chronic insomnia  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117710" href="/z/d/graphic/117710.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In practice, however, most individuals with chronic insomnia report symptoms for many years. Some individuals recall an initial stressful event that triggered insomnia, but others report nearly lifelong symptoms without an identifiable trigger. Night-to-night variability and a waxing and waning course related to psychosocial stressors and psychiatric or medical comorbidities are common.</p><p>Chronic insomnia subsumes alternate or historical terms including primary insomnia, secondary insomnia, and comorbid insomnia [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2311471"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with insomnia typically complain about difficulty falling asleep and/or staying asleep. Impaired daytime function must also be reported for a diagnosis of an insomnia disorder. In many cases, comorbid psychiatric or medical disorders, medications or substances, or other sleep disorders are also present. However, the presence of comorbid disorders does not preclude the diagnosis and treatment of insomnia.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2311479"><span class="h2">Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with insomnia complain of poor sleep quality or insufficient quantity due to difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, or waking up too early. Importantly, insomnia differs from sleep deprivation in that it occurs despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep.</p><p>Patients may describe variable sleep, with one or several nights of poor sleep followed by a night of better sleep. Occasionally, patients may report having minimal sleep for several consecutive nights.</p><p>Most well-rested adults fall asleep within about 10 to 20 minutes of attempting to sleep and spend less than 30 minutes awake during the night. By contrast, adult patients with insomnia usually report taking 30 minutes or more to fall asleep (for those with sleep initiation difficulties) or spending 30 minutes or more awake during the night (for those with sleep maintenance difficulties). Early morning awakening is defined as termination of sleep at least 30 minutes prior to the desired wake-up time.</p><p>Patients with insomnia tend to overestimate the amount of time it takes them to fall asleep and underestimate their total sleep time when compared with objective data from polysomnography (PSG) or actigraphy. Although objective measures are typically used in clinical trials of insomnia therapies, they are not used routinely in patient care, and ultimately the patient's perception of their sleep problem is the major factor in guiding the evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of insomnia. (See <a class="local">'Additional testing'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H944580476"><span class="h2">Compromised daytime function</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of insomnia disorder requires that sleep difficulties be accompanied by compromised daytime function related to one or more of the following [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fatigue or malaise</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Poor attention or concentration</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Social or vocational/educational dysfunction</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mood disturbance or irritability</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Daytime sleepiness</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduced motivation or energy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased errors or accidents</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Behavioral problems such as hyperactivity, impulsivity or aggression</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ongoing worry about sleep</p><p></p><p>Patients with chronic insomnia have often developed behavioral or adjustment issues associated with chronic poor sleep. They are often worried that their lack of adequate sleep will result in significant compromise of their ability to function during the day in both social and professional settings. This concern can create a cycle that worsens the insomnia. Specifically, when patients are unable to fall asleep rapidly, they worry about loss of sleep affecting their performance, and this concern increases with time awake and simultaneously decreases the likelihood of falling asleep, while further increasing stress.</p><p>Although severe fatigue is commonly reported by patients with chronic insomnia, actually falling asleep at unwanted or unintended times during the day (ie, excessive daytime sleepiness) is uncommon and may be a sign of an alternative or comorbid sleep disorder. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14892.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Common comorbidities</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Insomnia commonly coexists with psychiatric or medical disorders, other sleep disorders, or use of certain medications or substances. At times, there is a clear temporal relationship between the insomnia and the condition that is known to disrupt sleep, whereas in many cases it is difficult to discern which condition came first  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50646" href="/z/d/graphic/50646.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p>Historically, a distinction was made between primary insomnia (ie, insomnia without comorbidities or existing independently from other disorders) and secondary insomnia (ie, associated with a comorbid condition such as depression) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. However, as it is often not possible to draw firm conclusions about the association or direction of causality between insomnia and co-occurring conditions, insomnia is no longer considered a secondary condition, and successful treatment requires attention to both insomnia and comorbidities.</p><p>Risk factors and common comorbidities of chronic insomnia are reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7684.html" rel="external">"Risk factors, comorbidities, and consequences of insomnia in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3261553345"><span class="h2">Natural history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Insomnia is often a persistent or recurrent condition, with exacerbations connected to medical, psychiatric, and psychosocial stressors [<a href="#rid3">3-7</a>]. The persistent nature of insomnia underscores the importance of interventions that teach patients ways to manage recurrent symptoms over the lifespan.</p><p>Insomnia exists throughout the lifespan. Incidence increases from childhood to adulthood and approaches adult prevalence levels in adolescence [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Risk factors for persistence include older age, female sex, low socioeconomic status, mood disorders (depression or anxiety), and increased severity of symptoms [<a href="#rid3">3,6</a>]. In a study of persistence of insomnia symptoms in over 3000 adults, 59 percent of patients with insomnia disorder consistently maintained that diagnosis for five years, while 26 percent of symptomatic patients consistently maintained that criterion for five years, and rates were higher in females [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In another cohort, among self-identified good sleepers aged 35 years and older, more than 25 percent reported at least one episode of acute insomnia per year, and 6 percent developed chronic insomnia during the following year [<a href="#rid5">5,8</a>]. Insomnia remitters had less severe symptoms initially, less depression, and less sleep preoccupation [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>Insomnia has a strong genetic component with heritability of 40 percent, a range similar to major depression and other psychiatric disorders [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7684.html" rel="external">"Risk factors, comorbidities, and consequences of insomnia in adults", section on 'Intrinsic factors and genetics'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2388220288"><span class="h1">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Insomnia should be distinguished clinically from several other common sleep complaints and conditions  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117720" href="/z/d/graphic/117720.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4078914299"><span class="h2">Short sleep duration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The amount of sleep required to support adequate alertness, performance, and health varies by age and among individuals  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106597" href="/z/d/graphic/106597.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). While most adults require approximately seven to nine hours of sleep per night, some otherwise healthy people regularly sleep less than seven hours per night without the need for catch-up sleep to feel refreshed. Such individuals often report a nearly lifelong and/or familial tendency for short sleep duration. Short sleep duration is distinguished from insomnia by the absence of daytime impairment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7715.html" rel="external">"Insufficient sleep: Definition, epidemiology, and adverse outcomes", section on 'How much sleep do we need?'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1921443985"><span class="h2">Chronic sleep insufficiency</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chronic sleep insufficiency or sleep restriction is due to volitional sleep restriction or insufficient opportunity to sleep, whereas insomnia exists despite adequate opportunity and conditions for sleep  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122800" href="/z/d/graphic/122800.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). People with sleep restriction accumulate sleep debt over time and will rapidly fall asleep if given the opportunity. This distinguishes them from most patients with insomnia, who may feel fatigued during the day, but are typically unable to fall asleep if given a chance to take a nap. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7715.html" rel="external">"Insufficient sleep: Definition, epidemiology, and adverse outcomes"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97866.html" rel="external">"Insufficient sleep: Evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2302869134"><span class="h2">Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder</strong> – Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD) is one of the most common revised diagnoses given to patients referred to sleep specialists for chronic insomnia, especially those with difficulties falling asleep. DSWPD is a circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorder that can be thought of as a pronounced "night owl" circadian preference. The peak prevalence is in adolescence.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with DSWPD have difficulty initiating sleep at conventional or desired times necessary to obtain sufficient nighttime sleep because their circadian phase is delayed, often by several hours, in relation to the environmental light-dark cycle. In addition to difficulty falling asleep at night, they experience difficulty awakening in the morning at conventional times.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with prominent sleep initiation complaints should be asked to describe what happens when they are allowed to sleep according to their desired sleep-wake schedule (eg, on weekends or vacations). Individuals with DSWPD will fall asleep and sleep normally if they wait to go to bed until the correct point in their circadian rhythm (often midnight or later). By contrast, patients with sleep onset insomnia typically describe difficulty falling asleep at any time of night.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">DSWPD can be confirmed by sleep logs or actigraphy showing a persistently delayed sleep-wake schedule on weekdays and weekends, with curtailment of total sleep time during periods of enforced morning awakenings. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97845.html" rel="external">"Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Advanced sleep-wake phase disorder</strong> – Patients with difficulty maintaining sleep or early morning awakening associated with insomnia should be differentiated from patients with advanced sleep-wake phase disorder (ASWPD). Patients with ASWPD have a circadian phase that is advanced or shifted earlier relative to the environmental light-dark cycle so that they tend to fall asleep in the early evening (eg, by 7:00 PM) and wake up in the early morning hours (eg, 3:00 to 4:00 AM), even if they have forced themselves to stay awake until the late evening. ASWPD primarily affects older adults.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">ASWPD can usually be distinguished from chronic insomnia by asking patients what happens if they allow themselves to go to bed early. While patients with ASWPD fall asleep easily at this time, those with chronic insomnia typically have difficulty sleeping regardless of the time. Patients with insomnia are also more likely than those with ASWPD to report multiple night awakenings, rather than a specific early morning awakening. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98364.html" rel="external">"Advanced sleep-wake phase disorder"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H760112882"><span class="h2">Restless legs syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Restless legs syndrome (RLS) can make it difficult to fall asleep. Patients with sleep-onset complaints should be asked whether they have unpleasant, restless feelings in their legs when they try to relax or sleep at night  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86837" href="/z/d/graphic/86837.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). RLS is a clinical diagnosis made by history and does not require additional testing, except for an assessment of iron stores. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4892.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in adults", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H546103598"><span class="h2">Sleep-related breathing disorders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some patients with sleep-related breathing disorders (eg, obstructive or central sleep apnea) may complain that they wake up frequently during the night, unaware that the awakening was preceded by a pause in breathing. Sleep disruption due to obstructive apneas throughout the night often results in significant daytime sleepiness, which is uncommon in patients with insomnia alone. By contrast, central apneas often occur at sleep onset, resulting in reports of difficulty falling asleep or returning to sleep. Central apneas occurring at the transition to sleep may not continue throughout the night and therefore may produce less daytime sleepiness than obstructive apneas. Insomnia and sleep apnea can coexist, with 30 to 40 percent of chronic insomnia patients having comorbid obstructive sleep apnea [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>Diagnostic sleep testing should be pursued in patients with suspected obstructive sleep apnea  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55633" href="/z/d/graphic/55633.html" rel="external">table 6</a>), as insomnia may resolve with successful treatment of the sleep apnea. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7706.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults", section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Insomnia is a clinical diagnosis established by history and patient report [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. The goals of the evaluation are to characterize the nature and severity of the sleep problem and identify contributing factors and comorbidities that may be relevant to successful treatment  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117720" href="/z/d/graphic/117720.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H513642722"><span class="h2">Sleep history and sleep diary</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The sleep history should elicit a detailed description of the sleep problem (ie, number of awakenings, duration of awakenings, duration of the problem) and sleep times (ie, bedtime, duration until sleep onset, final awakening time, nap times, and nap lengths) over both a 24-hour period and week. It also includes an assessment of any symptoms of disturbed sleep (eg, daytime sleepiness, fatigue), the duration of the symptoms (ie, acute or chronic), and the sleep environment.</p><p>Patients who cannot provide an adequate sleep history or who report considerable day-to-day or night-to-night variability should be asked to complete a daily sleep diary for one or two weeks  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87134" href="/z/d/graphic/87134.html" rel="external">table 7</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87859" href="/z/d/graphic/87859.html" rel="external">table 8</a>). Sleep diaries record sleep times, sleep problems, and subjective sleep quality, so that the clinician may review the information for diagnosis and to evaluate treatment efficacy without being misled by recall errors.</p><p>The sleep history may provide clues about the cause of the insomnia or factors contributing to the insomnia. It can be helpful to ask patients why they feel it is hard to fall asleep or why they wake up, as these questions often elicit important factors such as "not sleepy," pain, or anxiety. Patients with poor sleep hygiene may describe irregular bedtimes and waking times, while patients whose lifestyle is contributing to their insomnia may report exercising, smoking, or drinking alcohol or caffeine shortly before bedtime. When the bedroom environment is responsible for the insomnia, patients may describe recent changes in light, noise, or other distractions in the bedroom. Patients whose insomnia is due to a primary sleep disorder may report symptoms or signs of the sleep disorder (eg, loud resuscitative snoring in obstructive sleep apnea).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1660656182"><span class="h2">Self-report screening tools</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Tracking changes in the chronic insomnia diagnostic items  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117710" href="/z/d/graphic/117710.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) or with the sleep diary  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87134" href="/z/d/graphic/87134.html" rel="external">table 7</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87859" href="/z/d/graphic/87859.html" rel="external">table 8</a>) can be used to characterize insomnia symptom severity and follow symptoms over time.</p><p>Alternatively, validated questionnaires can be completed by patients, acknowledging the limitation that these scales and their resulting cut-off values may not always agree with formal diagnostic criteria.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106689" href="/z/d/graphic/106689.html" rel="external">table 9</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107236" href="/z/d/graphic/107236.html" rel="external">table 10</a>) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].

The self-report, two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89663" href="/z/d/graphic/89663.html" rel="external">table 11</a>) can be used as a depression screen, and those who screen positive should be interviewed for depression. The interview can be facilitated with the self-administered PHQ-9  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307" href="/z/d/graphic/59307.html" rel="external">table 12</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1721.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83887.html" rel="external">"Screening for depression in adults", section on 'Two-step approach to screening'</a>.)</p><p>The generalized anxiety disorder seven-item (GAD-7) scale  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77755" href="/z/d/graphic/77755.html" rel="external">table 13</a>) or the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory can be used to screen for anxiety in primary care. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/496.html" rel="external">"Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis", section on 'Screening, assessment, and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The history should also probe for symptoms of comorbid sleep disorders, such as sleep-related breathing disorders and restless legs syndrome. Positive responses about loud or habitual snoring and witnessed pauses in breathing during sleep raise suspicion for obstructive sleep apnea. A single question, "When you try to relax in the evening or sleep at night, do you ever have unpleasant, restless feelings in your legs that can be relieved by walking or movement?" has good predictive power for the diagnosis of restless legs syndrome. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4892.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7706.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults"</a>.)</p><p>The medication list, including timing of administration, should be reviewed for contributory agents  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50646" href="/z/d/graphic/50646.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Patients should be asked about habits including caffeine intake, tobacco before bed, drug use, marijuana, and alcohol.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2267795061"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Physical examination of patients with insomnia may reveal medical problems such as hypertension that are associated with insomnia. Other examples include excessive oropharyngeal tissue in obstructive sleep apnea, lower extremity swelling in heart failure, and an abnormal mental status in dementia. In many cases, the physical examination will be normal even if the patient has a medical or psychiatric condition that is associated with insomnia (eg, asthma, ischemic heart disease, gastroesophageal reflux, and menopause).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4048923180"><span class="h2">Laboratories</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>No routine laboratory studies are necessary in the evaluation of chronic insomnia. Selected tests may be indicated based on clinical suspicion of an important comorbidity. As examples, echocardiography, thyroid function tests, blood glucose and hemoglobin A1C measurements, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, or iron studies may be performed if heart failure, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, renal disease, or restless legs syndrome is suspected, respectively.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H513642919"><span class="h2">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>According to the third edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders Text Revision (ICSD-3-TR), insomnia is confirmed when all four of the following criteria are met  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117710" href="/z/d/graphic/117710.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The patient reports difficulty initiating asleep, difficulty maintaining asleep, or final waking earlier than desired. In children or individuals with dementia, the sleep disturbance may manifest as resistance to going to bed at the appropriate time or difficulty in sleeping without caregiver assistance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sleep difficulties occur despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The patient describes daytime impairment that is attributable to the sleep difficulties. This may include fatigue or malaise; attention, concentration, or memory impairment; social dysfunction, family dysfunction, vocational dysfunction, or poor school performance; mood disturbance or irritability; daytime sleepiness; motivation, energy, or initiative reduction; errors or accidents at work or while driving; and concerns or worries about sleep.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The sleep-wake difficulty is not solely explained by a current sleep disorder, medical disorder, mental disorder, or medication/substance use.</p><p></p><p>Chronic insomnia is differentiated from short-term insomnia if the sleep disturbance and the associated daytime dysfunction has existed for three months or longer and occurs at least three nights per week. Chronic insomnia may also be diagnosed in individuals who report:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A pattern of repeated occurrence for weeks at a time over several years, even though an individual episode may not last a full three months</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sleeping well with the regular use of a hypnotic medication, particularly when there is a concern about an inability to sleep without the medication</p><p></p><p>A diagnosis of "Other Insomnia" is used for patients who complain of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep but do not meet all of the criteria for either short-term or chronic insomnia. (See <a class="local">'Types of insomnia'</a> above.)</p><p>The degree of sleep disturbance required to assign an insomnia disorder diagnosis is somewhat arbitrary, in that it relies primarily on individuals' subjective sleep complaints [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In addition, the degree of sleep disturbance required to cause daytime impairment varies among individuals and across age groups. In general, among adults, the degree of sleep disturbance often includes either a sleep latency of &gt;30 minutes or wake periods during the night of &gt;30 minutes. Complaints of early morning awakening are substantiated by termination of sleep at least 30 minutes prior to the desired wake-up time and a concomitant reduction in total sleep time compared with the premorbid sleep pattern.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H513643475"><span class="h1">ADDITIONAL TESTING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Additional diagnostic testing is not required in most patients. Polysomnography, home sleep apnea testing, or actigraphy may be performed in selected patients based upon the history and physical.

Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for comorbid sleep-disordered breathing disorders in patients with chronic, treatment-refractory insomnia and daytime sleepiness. In these patients, the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea may be as high as 90 percent, and screening instruments such as the Berlin questionnaire may lack sensitivity [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7706.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults", section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>The multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is not typically indicated for an insomnia complaint and is only used if a central disorder of hypersomnolence (eg, narcolepsy) is suspected. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7688.html" rel="external">"Quantifying sleepiness", section on 'Multiple sleep latency test (MSLT)'</a>.)</p><p>The home sleep apnea test (HSAT) is an alternative to in-laboratory polysomnography that can be used to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea in selected patients. Although most HSATs in use do not actually measure sleep, some newer models have algorithms for estimating objective sleep time (including derived EEG measures in some cases), which may correlate better with risk for medical comorbidities and adverse outcomes in insomnia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7684.html" rel="external">"Risk factors, comorbidities, and consequences of insomnia in adults"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1333717588"><span class="h2">Role of actigraphy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Actigraphy is not routinely indicated in the evaluation of chronic insomnia but is an important adjunct to sleep diaries when a circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorder is suspected or when an objective estimate of total sleep time is needed to support clinical decision making [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>Actigraphy is a validated method of objectively measuring sleep parameters and average motor activity over a period of days to weeks using a noninvasive accelerometer, worn like a wristwatch.
