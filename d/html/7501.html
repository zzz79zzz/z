The activation of the immune system induced by rituximab to deplete B cells, together with its immunogenicity and immunosuppressive properties, are largely responsible for its adverse effects, including infusion reactions, reduced immunoglobulin levels, and increased risk of certain infections.</p><p>The mechanism of action, administration, dosing, and adverse effects of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> are presented here. The relative role and efficacy of rituximab for the treatment of RA are described in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/103866.html" rel="external">"Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults resistant to initial biologic DMARD therapy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7490.html" rel="external">"Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults resistant to initial conventional synthetic (nonbiologic) DMARD therapy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">Rituximab</a> is an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb), which targets CD20, a protein expressed on the surface of most B cells, and is thought to act primarily by depleting CD20-positive B cells. It is a chimeric antibody, composed of both mouse and human portions. B cell depletion also appears to have long-acting effects on immune cell function. (See <a class="local">'B cell depletion'</a> below and <a class="local">'Reduction in signs and symptoms of RA'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4267092182"><span class="h2">B cell depletion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">Rituximab</a> causes B cell depletion and may do so through one or more of several antibody-dependent mechanisms, including the following [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fc receptor gamma-mediated antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and phagocytosis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Complement-mediated cell lysis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Growth arrest</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>B cell apoptosis</p><p></p><p>It is uncertain which of these mechanisms is most important in the depletion of B cells in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), although data suggest that Fc receptor gamma-mediated antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent phagocytosis are the principal mechanisms. It is possible that the relative importance of some of the mechanisms of depletion induced by <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> differs depending upon the tissue location of the B cells and their maturation and activation status.</p><p>Lymphocytes of the B cell lineage undergo an orderly developmental process that includes the B cell-specific surface expression of CD20, beginning at the pre-B cell stage in the bone marrow. Expression of CD20 on the cell surface is then lost as B cells differentiate into plasma cells. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13933.html" rel="external">"Normal B and T lymphocyte development"</a>.)</p><p>Absent CD20 protein expression on the surface of plasma cells accounts for resistance of these long-lived antibody-producing cells to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a>. As a consequence of plasma cell resistance, overall immunoglobulin levels usually remain within the normal range, despite profound B cell lymphopenia that persists for months following a single course of treatment. However, hypogammaglobulinemia can occur in a minority of patients. (See <a class="local">'Hypogammaglobulinemia and infection'</a> below.)</p><p>The absence of CD20 expression in stem cells and earlier B cell precursors in the bone marrow allows repopulation of the peripheral blood and other tissues. Once <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> is cleared from the body, the early B cell emigrants from the bone marrow migrate to the secondary lymphoid tissue and reconstitute the B cell repertoire.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4195853312"><span class="h2">Reduction in signs and symptoms of RA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The exact mechanism(s) by which <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> results in reduced disease activity in RA is not known. B cell targeted therapy for RA was developed with the objective of removing B cell clones responsible for the production of pathogenic autoantibodies. A specific objective was to induce sustained remission from short-term B cell depletion, based upon the hypothesis that autoantibodies could not only produce tissue pathology but might be expected to drive their own production through a vicious cycle [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Although sustained remission has yet to be achieved, B cell depletion therapy has been found to have a major beneficial impact on RA in the short term.</p><p>Antigen presentation by B cells and cytokine-mediated interactions with stromal and accessory cells could also potentially activate autoreactive T cells, although there is some doubt as to whether this possibility is consistent with the behavior of synovial T cells in RA [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. B cells are very efficient at presenting soluble antigen that has been bound by their antigen receptor (surface immunoglobulin) during the acquisition of T cell help.</p><p>Clarification of the roles of B cells in RA is crucial to future developments in B cell-targeted therapy and optimization of this strategy. If the main role of B cells is to activate autoreactive pathogenic T cell clones through antigen presentation, patients may require continuous B cell depletion for their disease to remain under control. On the other hand, if autoantibodies play a key role in propagation of the disease, then achieving sustained remissions from short periods of depletion seems a much more realistic prospect. Exploration of more potent depleting regimens and specific approaches for blocking signals involved in B cell proliferation and differentiation may potentially increase efficacy and, in particular, duration of clinical response.</p><p>There are data that levels of autoantibodies, with the potential for roles in disease pathophysiology, are proportionally more affected by B cell depletion than total immunoglobulin levels, suggesting that these autoantibodies are produced at least in part by short-lived plasma cells. Examples of this include both rheumatoid factor (RF) in RA [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>], antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in ANCA-associated vasculitis [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>], and other autoantibodies in other disorders [<a href="#rid7">7-10</a>].</p><p>One study has also suggested that treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> may also result indirectly in substantial but reversible depletion of CD4+ T cells during the months following rituximab administration [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The relevance of these findings is supported by the observation that a lack of CD4+ T cell depletion was associated with an inadequate clinical responsive to rituximab therapy but requires further confirmation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2660952175"><span class="h1">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several conditions pose absolute or relative contraindications to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a>:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to murine proteins or any of the excipients – In the absence of another effective treatment option, we obtain consultation with an allergist for consideration of retreatment with a desensitization protocol.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Active, severe infection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients in a severely immunocompromised state.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Severe heart failure or severe, uncontrolled cardiac disease – In patients who lack other effective treatment options, we hospitalize the patient for treatment and give the infusion slowly with very close monitoring for both the first and second dose of the cycle because of the increased risk of adverse outcomes if an infusion reaction occurs in such an already compromised patient.

In patients in whom vaccination is indicated (eg, for seasonal influenza, pneumococcal, and hepatitis B vaccines), we prefer to immunize patients at least four weeks before the administration of rituximab [<a href="#rid12">12</a>] because responses to inactivated viral or bacterial vaccines may be impaired following rituximab therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/103773.html" rel="external">"Immunizations in autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease in adults", section on 'Vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity'</a>.)</p><p>In patients who have already received <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a>, vaccine responses may be blunted until B cell recovery occurs (ie, 6 to 12 months). Timing of immunization should be individualized in such patients. Thus, vaccines could be given and responses then assessed, or vaccination could be postponed until B cells have recovered, depending upon risk and the time until the expected initiation of B cell repopulation. In the case of seasonal influenza vaccine, we instruct patients to have the vaccine as soon as it is available as it is difficult to predict what will be the best timing, particularly in patients on repeated courses of treatment. The safety and efficacy of immunization in patients who will or have received rituximab, the effect of rituximab upon vaccine responses, and an overview of immunization in patients with rheumatic disease are discussed in detail separately.

However, some trials and cohort studies have suggested that a lower dose, either 500 mg given twice two weeks apart or 1000 mg given once, may also be effective; and expert opinion differs regarding the most appropriate dose for initial therapy. Responsiveness to rituximab correlates with the degree of B cell depletion at either of these doses [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. The approach to dosing in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) thus usually differs from the approach to treatment for lymphoproliferative disorders, for which the drug is often administered once weekly for four weeks or as part of each treatment cycle in combination with chemotherapy.</p><p>In patients with RA, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> infusions are typically given to those who are already receiving weekly <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a>, but can be given as monotherapy or together with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10097" href="/d/drug information/10097.html" rel="external">leflunomide</a> or other conventional standard disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients in whom methotrexate is contraindicated.

If the initial infusion is well tolerated, we start the subsequent infusion(s) of the same cycle at a rate of 100 mg/hour, and the rate can be increased by 100 mg/hour every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/hour if there is no evidence of hypersensitivity. Some centers use a more rapid infusion protocol described by the manufacturer if the first has been well tolerated without an infusion reaction.

However, when more sensitive techniques are used to identify remaining B cells, incomplete B cell depletion with rituximab appears to be more common than initially appreciated and associated with reduced efficacy.</p><p>We do not wait until patients repopulate again to retreat because of the increased risk of flare by that approach. B cell repopulation usually starts within six to nine months after treatment. In the author's experience, approximately two-thirds of patients flare as soon as the B cells start repopulating. One-third flare only a variable time later. There is a lack of agreement regarding whether CD19 counts to assess kinetics are needed clinically and to what extent they should guide practice in RA. (See <a class="local">'Retreatment of responders'</a> below.)</p><p>The frequency and consequences of incomplete B cell depletion were illustrated by a study of 60 RA patients treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> (two infusions of 1 g each given two weeks apart) in which the degree of B cell depletion was assessed by use of a high-sensitivity minimal residual disease (MRD) flow cytometry technique used to evaluate patients with leukemia [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Complete B cell depletion was defined as levels below 0.1 cells/microL using the MRD protocol and 5 cells/microL by conventional cytometry. More patients with residual B cells were identified after the first and second infusion by the MRD technique than conventional techniques (63 versus 6 percent and 18 versus 6 percent, respectively). After the first infusion, moderate to good clinical responses (by EULAR criteria) were identified more often in patients with complete compared with partial B cell depletion with the MRD technique (87 versus 59 percent at 3 months and 59 versus 21 percent at 12 months). Patients who only attained complete B cell depletion after the second infusion had outcomes similar to those in patients who never achieved complete B cell depletion.</p><p>Relapse of active RA may coincide with recovery of B cells in peripheral blood or occur at a variable time after such recovery. It is usually associated with rising autoantibody levels. This was illustrated in a report of 22 patients treated with a variety of rituximab-based regimens.

Similar to initial lymph node biopsies in patients treated for lymphoma, there was variability in the extent of depletion achieved between different patients. This variability and also the different susceptibility of the B cell subsets to depletion with rituximab could not be explained by differences on level of cellular surface expression of CD20, complement inhibitors (CD55 and CD59), or receptors for B cell activating factor (BAFF)/April (survival factors). The frequency of early-activated T cells decreased, but the frequency of late-activated T cells did not, and total levels of interleukin (IL)-21 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA; as a reflection of follicular T cell activity) remained high.

B cell depletion also appears to have long-acting effects on immune cell function. (See <a class="local">'Mechanism of action'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients should receive appropriate immunizations, depending upon their prior immunization history, at least several weeks prior to administration of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a>. Before starting rituximab, baseline testing should include serologic testing for hepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], hepatitis B surface antibody [anti-HBs], hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc]), hepatitis C, and HIV; measurement of serum immunoglobulin levels (including IgM, IgG, and IgA); serum protein electrophoresis; and a chest radiograph. (See <a class="local">'Immunization and response to vaccines'</a> above and <a class="local">'Pretreatment testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Premedication may reduce the incidence and/or the severity of infusion reactions. We use a combination of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> (1000 mg once orally), and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8860" href="/d/drug information/8860.html" rel="external">chlorpheniramine</a> (10 mg) and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9639" href="/d/drug information/9639.html" rel="external">methylprednisolone</a> (100 mg) intravenously 30 minutes prior to each infusion.

Rituximab infusions are typically given to those who are already receiving weekly <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a>.

Patients may need more than one course of treatment to achieve their maximum response. For patients who go into remission with one cycle of rituximab, we wait and retreat at first signs of disease flare. We retreat to prevent relapse/flare based upon the duration of the individual patient response to the previous rituximab cycles, usually approximately one month prior to when the disease would be expected to flare or relapse based upon the duration of the patient's previous response to rituximab.
