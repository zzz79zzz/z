This outcome has also been referred to as perioperative adverse cardiac events [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery</strong> – Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) is now recognized as a category of adverse perioperative cardiac events. MINS is defined as an elevated troponin during the first 30 days after noncardiac surgery, presumed to be of ischemic etiology. MINS occurs in 10 to 20 percent of patients and is associated with worse outcomes at 30 days after surgery. Importantly, MINS is not included as a complication in most perioperative cardiac risk tools or calculators. MINS is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/69.html" rel="external">"Perioperative myocardial infarction or injury after noncardiac surgery"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Surgical risk</strong> – The terms low, intermediate, and high risk are typically used to classify the risk associated with major adverse cardiac events in surgical procedures; these have been employed in many guidelines and studies of perioperative risk. These definitions are based on the reported rates of cardiac death, nonfatal cardiac arrest, or nonfatal MI, as follows:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>High risk – &gt;5 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Intermediate risk – ≥1 to ≤5 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Low risk – &lt;1 percent</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The utility and accuracy of such definitions is being questioned due to possibly decreasing procedural risk over time and changes in perioperative care that may affect risk. However, these estimates of risk are still used in guidelines and in risk assessment algorithms  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116645" href="/d/graphic/116645.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Incidence and risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The 2014 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guideline on Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation and Management for noncardiac surgery defined elevated risk procedures as those with a combined surgical and patient risk of major adverse cardiac events ≥1 percent [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H451134112"><span class="h1">REASONS TO ASSESS RISK</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients scheduled to undergo noncardiac surgery should have an assessment of the risk of a perioperative adverse cardiovascular event [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In some cases this assessment will be minimal, whereas in others it may be extensive. The purposes of this assessment are to:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Help the patient and health care providers weigh the benefits and risks of the surgery (see <a class="local">'Discussing risk with the patient'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Determine the need for management strategies to reduce risk (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6615.html" rel="external">"Management of cardiac risk for noncardiac surgery"</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Optimize the timing or location (eg, hospital or ambulatory surgery center) of surgery</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assess the need for more intensive postoperative monitoring (eg, intensive care unit, continuous or invasive cardiac monitoring)</p><p></p><p>Similar to other aspects of preoperative assessment, cardiac risk assessment may reveal problems that have not been diagnosed or optimally treated. Since most operations are elective, there may be time to optimize management of conditions identified during preoperative risk assessment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H327722483"><span class="h1">INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The incidence of perioperative major adverse cardiac events may be decreasing. A 2016 study using information in a large administrative database of United States hospital admissions (2004 to 2013) found that the frequency of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE; in-hospital, all-cause death, acute myocardial infarction [MI], or acute ischemic stroke) declined from 3.1 to 2.6 percent, driven by a decrease in frequency of perioperative death and acute MI [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The incidence of perioperative ischemic stroke increased from 0.52 percent in 2004 to 0.77 percent in 2013. These events were most common after vascular, thoracic, and transplant surgery. The incidence of perioperative stroke is discussed in detail separately. (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/114426.html" rel="external">"Perioperative stroke following noncardiac, noncarotid, and nonneurologic surgery", section on 'Incidence and risk factors'</a>); However, the incidence of perioperative major adverse cardiac events varies widely based on both patient factors, the intrinsic risk of the surgical procedure, and the skill and reported outcomes of the surgical center [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], thus the need for individualized preoperative assessment and risk stratification.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H424466185"><span class="h2">Patient risk factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patient risk factors for perioperative adverse cardiac events have been identified, and some have been incorporated into risk screening tools, which are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Using risk assessment tools'</a> below.)</p><p>Importantly, the determination of specific definitions for most of the risk factors have been based upon the nonsurgical literature rather than studies in surgical patients.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Existing cardiovascular disease</strong> – Patients with recent MI (prior 60 days) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>] or unstable angina, decompensated heart failure, high-grade arrhythmias, or hemodynamically important valvular heart disease (aortic stenosis in particular [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]) are at very high risk for perioperative cardiovascular complications. (See <a class="local">'Very high-risk patients'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, including peripheral artery disease or cerebrovascular disease, have an increased risk of perioperative cardiac complications for the following reasons:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>They constitute a selected population with a high incidence of significant coronary artery disease [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. In addition, left ventricular systolic dysfunction is more common in patients with cerebrovascular disease or peripheral artery disease [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In patients with underlying coronary artery disease, hemodynamic and other physiologic changes associated with surgery may predispose to myocardial ischemia. These include volume shifts and blood loss, increased perioperative myocardial oxygen demand due to the surgical stress response, and perioperative platelet activation [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Perioperative risk associated with heart failure, valvular heart disease, and atrial fibrillation is discussed separately:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/105407.html" rel="external">"Perioperative management of heart failure in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8124.html" rel="external">"Noncardiac surgery in adults with aortic stenosis", section on 'Estimation of risk of noncardiac surgery'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8131.html" rel="external">"Noncardiac surgery in patients with mitral or aortic regurgitation"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/113847.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Poor functional status</strong> – Poor functional status may increase perioperative risk, whereas good functional status has been associated with lower risk. Experts and some guidelines recommend routinely assessing functional status as part of preoperative assessment [<a href="#rid3">3,11</a>]. The Canadian Cardiology Society Guidelines do not make a recommendation for functional assessment, citing limited evidence at the time the guideline was created. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Functional status is not included in the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) or American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement (ACS NSQIP) risk <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Friskcalculator.facs.org%2FRiskCalculator%2F&amp;token=6gVWib8LYMmb6itGH0wlY%2Ff2oHJ5SEnQyuGi9bDrAXFrx3%2FrruaA8hzokn1sqFdO&amp;TOPIC_ID=6616" target="_blank">calculator</a>. Dependence, which could be a measure of function, is one parameter included in the Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA) perioperative risk calculator [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Several studies have found that patients who are unable to perform average levels of exercise (4 to 5 metabolic equivalents [METs]) may be at increased risk of perioperative complications, including adverse cardiovascular events [<a href="#rid12">12-17</a>]. Oxygen uptake and the definition of metabolic equivalents are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3465.html" rel="external">"Cardiopulmonary exercise testing in cardiovascular disease", section on 'Aerobic parameters'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Methods for assessing functional status and their ability to predict risk are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Assessing functional status or exercise capacity'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Older age</strong> – Increasing age has been associated with increased risk of perioperative cardiac complications. It is unclear whether older age is an independent risk factor or if increasing risk is due to underlying known or subclinical cardiac comorbidities (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14605.html" rel="external">"Normal aging", section on 'Cardiovascular system'</a>.).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Various age cutoffs have been used in guidelines and risk scoring tools. The Canadian Cardiology Society and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for preoperative cardiac risk assessment use age 65 as a cutoff for increased risk [<a href="#rid11">11,18</a>], However, there is likely a continuum of increasing risk with increasing age. As an example, in a database study of over 400,700 adults who underwent inpatient noncardiac surgery in Sweden, the risk of MI within 30 days of surgery increased steadily with age, from 1.64 (95% CI 1.28-2.10) in patients 65 to 69 years old to 5.47 (95% CI 4.48-6.69) in patients ≥85 years of age, compared with patients ≤65 years of age [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diabetes</strong> – Diabetes is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and has been found to be a risk factor for perioperative cardiac complications. Diabetes requiring insulin was found to be an independent risk factor for major cardiac complications in the derivation of the RCRI, whereas derivation of other risk-scoring tools (eg, American College of Surgeons Surgical Risk Calculator, Geriatric Sensitive Perioperative Cardiac Risk Index, Vascular Quality Initiative Cardiac Risk Index) have found diabetes treated with oral agents or with insulin to be associated with increased perioperative risk [<a href="#rid20">20-22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Kidney dysfunction</strong> – Chronic kidney disease increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and has been associated with increased perioperative cardiac risk. However, the level of kidney dysfunction that increases perioperative risk is unclear. Various cutoffs for kidney dysfunction have been used in the development and validation of risk scoring tools. A creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL was used for derivation of the RCRI and was found to be an independent risk factor for major cardiac complications [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. For the MICA calculator, a creatinine of &gt;1.5 mg/dL is used as a risk factor [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], and the American College of Surgeons Surgical Risk Calculator includes acute renal failure (defined as increased blood urea nitrogen plus two creatinine results &gt;3 mg/dL) as a risk factor [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. A revised version of the RCRI (the Reconstructed RCRI) uses glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;30 mL/minute as a risk factor, which was found to be a better predictor of major cardiac complications than an elevated creatinine [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4171893806"><span class="h2">Intrinsic surgical risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>By convention, the level of intrinsic surgical risk is defined by the reported rate of postoperative nonfatal MI or cardiac death. Low risk is defined as &lt;1 percent, intermediate risk as 1 to 5 percent, and high risk as &gt;5 percent  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116645" href="/d/graphic/116645.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>Higher perioperative risk is generally associated with the following types of surgeries:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intraperitoneal</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intraabdominal</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intrathoracic</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Major vascular procedures</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Longer procedures</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Those associated with greater blood loss and intraoperative fluid shifts</p><p></p><p>Lower risk is associated with the following surgeries:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Laparoscopic</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Endovascular</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Orthopedic</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Peripheral procedures</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Breast surgery</p><p></p><p>However, there are wide variations in surgical risk within these categories  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef97966" href="/d/graphic/97966.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Thus, the most accurate assessment of surgical risk may come from web-based calculators (eg, the ACS NSQIP calculator) that include very procedure-specific risk assessment and also include patient risk factors. This concept is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94539.html" rel="external">"Preoperative evaluation for anesthesia for noncardiac surgery", section on 'Surgical risk'</a>.)</p><p>Patients who undergo emergency surgery are at increased risk of an adverse perioperative cardiovascular event at any level of baseline risk [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].

A C-statistic provides information on how well a risk prediction tool or set of risk factors can discriminate between an event (eg, MI or death) and no event.

These issues are described briefly below. In general, the risk calculators are in agreement with each other; however, if there is a significant divergence, further investigation and discussion is necessary to determine which one best reflects the individual patient’s estimated cardiac risk. Additionally, the clinician must determine how they will use the indices to inform the patient with respect to key decisions regarding proceeding with surgery or any interventions or the value of further evaluation.</p><p>The perioperative risk assessment tools discussed here include differing outcomes, and differing time periods for cardiac events. As examples, the RCRI is used to score the risk of a composite outcome that would occur during postoperative hospitalization  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57075" href="/d/graphic/57075.html" rel="external">table 6</a>).

However, the percent risk provided by these tools varies widely, as they were developed in different patient populations and used different definitions of risk factors, postoperative complications, and follow-up [<a href="#rid42">42,43</a>]. Importantly, the RCRI, ACS-SRC, and MICA calculators as originally derived did not provide an estimate of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS). Some validation studies have revised estimates of risk derived from the RCRI based on studies that included patients having emergency surgery or MINS as an outcome, resulting in higher risk estimates [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].
