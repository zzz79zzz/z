         In many populations, coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cause of cardiomyopathy, and the term ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) is commonly used to describe patients with obstructive CAD and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40 percent, but there is no consensus or formal definition. The optimal treatment of patients with ICM requires management of multiple conditions that include CAD, heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction, and the common complications of cardiomyopathy (eg, arrhythmias, chronic kidney disease).
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will discuss the treatment of patients with ICM with a focus on the approach to revascularization [

        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of HF, the approach to determining the cause of cardiomyopathy, and the prognosis of patients with ICM are discussed separately:

         In patients with ICM, the goals of therapy are to prolong survival, improve quality of life, and reduce the risk of acute cardiac (eg, ventricular tachycardia, repeat myocardial infarction [MI]) and noncardiac complications (eg, chronic kidney disease).
        </p>
        <p>
         Because obstructive CAD is a potentially reversible cause of cardiomyopathy, another goal of therapy is to improve ventricular function.

         <strong>
         </strong>
         In patients with ICM, obstructive CAD is a potentially reversible cause of cardiomyopathy, and, accordingly, its management should be a priority. The approach to revascularization in patients with ICM requires a detailed assessment to determine the risks and benefits of coronary artery bypass graft surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention, or continued goal-directed medical therapy without revascularization.

         <strong>
          Management of symptoms
         </strong>
         – Patients with ICM require management of symptoms such as angina, congestion, and dyspnea. However, the approach to the management of angina in patients with ICM is different from the management of patients with isolated CAD. In patients with ICM, angina often responds to the treatment of HF, and, similarly, HF may respond to treatment of CAD. (See

          'Management of angina and heart failure'

         – In patients with ICM, the presence of CAD may alter the management of conditions such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. In addition, patients with ICM can develop unique complications that require specialized management (eg, LV aneurysm, ischemic mitral regurgitation). (See

However, revascularization may not be safe or effective due to the presence of severe HF, advanced comorbid conditions (eg, kidney disease), diffuse coronary disease, or irreversible myocardial injury. Thus, a thorough pretreatment evaluation is required to determine the risks and benefits of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or continued medical therapy without revascularization.

         Patients under evaluation for revascularization should be assessed for the presence and severity of conditions that may alter the risk or benefit of revascularization. The assessment of each condition includes an appropriate history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and imaging. The findings from the clinical assessment are used to determine the risks of revascularization and, in particular, the risk of CABG. The approach to evaluation prior to cardiac surgery can be found elsewhere. (See

         If not recently performed, patients with ICM should undergo transthoracic echocardiography as part of the evaluation for revascularization.

         Patients with ICM often have multiple comorbidities that increase the risk of CABG, and the risk of CABG directly influences the choice of revascularization (see

          'Choosing CABG, PCI, or no revascularization'

         <strong>

The use of a risk score to determine the risk of CABG is endorsed by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (ACC/AHA/SCAI) guideline for coronary artery revascularization, though the guideline provides no guidance on how to use a risk score [

          Determining the overall surgical risk
         </strong>
         – After performing a general assessment and calculating the 30-day risk of mortality for CABG, we estimate the overall risk of CABG. We consider patients at "high risk" if their general assessment identifies contraindications to surgery or if their 30-day risk of postoperative mortality, as determined by the aggregate results of testing, is more than 10 percent.

         There is no objective threshold for "high" surgical risk. Thus, some contributors to this topic do not favor the use of any specific benchmark, while other contributors to this topic use data on the benefit of CABG and from the STICH trial as benchmarks for high risk [

         Patients with newly diagnosed ICM will typically have an invasive coronary angiogram as part of the initial evaluation for cardiomyopathy, though some studies suggest assessment for CAD is underutilized [

If the degree of coronary artery stenosis is unclear, stress imaging or intracoronary pressure wire measurements may be used to determine the severity of stenosis on a case-by-case basis. (See

Notably, 25 percent of the patients did not receive management consistent with their viability test results. In a secondary analysis of the trial's data that was not prespecified, patients who were assigned to management with PET and whose providers followed the protocol for imaging-guided revascularization had a lower risk of mortality (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42-0.93).

          Role of stress imaging

         – Stress imaging may be used to help determine the cause of symptoms or to identify regions of the myocardium where revascularization is likely to be beneficial (ie, regions with significant severity and extent of ischemia). In patients with chest symptoms of unclear etiology, the presence of a moderate to large area of ischemic myocardium may help to determine whether ischemia or progressive pump dysfunction is more likely.

         Stress imaging may be of particular benefit in patients with complex CAD (eg, known occlusions, multiple prior attempts at revascularization) to determine whether significant ischemia exists in a coronary distribution amenable to revascularization, or in patients in whom the risks of CABG (or, less commonly, PCI) are particularly high. In such patients, the use of stress imaging to guide revascularization is individualized.

All patients with ICM should be evaluated by an interdisciplinary team (ie, heart team) to determine the relative risks and benefits of revascularization and alternatives to revascularization, such as continued medical therapy without revascularization, heart transplantation, or mechanical circulatory support. Ideally, the evaluation for revascularization should occur after optimization of the patient’s other HFrEF therapies (eg, diuretics, neurohormonal therapies) [

         The approach to revascularization may be influenced by the results of viability testing, the severity of LV dysfunction, the risks and benefits of advanced HF therapies (eg, transplantation, mechanical support) relative to revascularization or medical therapy, and the experience with revascularization.

         – In patients with signs or symptoms of obstructive CAD and multivessel (ie, two- or three-vessel) or left main CAD (ie, ≥50 percent stenosis of the left main coronary artery or ≥70 percent stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and proximal left circumflex disease), we suggest revascularization with CABG rather than PCI or no attempt at revascularization  (

         In patients who decide not to undergo CABG, reasonable options include no revascularization or PCI; the approach is determined by an interdisciplinary team and may be influenced by other factors. (See

         Our preference for CABG in this group of patients is based on the benefits of CABG relative to PCI or no revascularization described in trials of patients with multivessel disease and either normal or low LVEF. However, in the broader set of trials that compared the efficacy of CABG with PCI and found CABG to be superior to PCI, few patients with severe LV dysfunction were included. There are no trials of revascularization in patients with ICM who were treated with optimal modern medical therapy. As such, our approach to patients who are optimally managed with HFrEF therapies is based on an aggregate of indirect evidence that suggests that CABG is typically superior to PCI and to medical therapy alone.

         In a meta-analysis of patients (n = 11,518) with multivessel or left main CAD enrolled in trials that compared CABG with PCI, patients randomly assigned to CABG had a lower risk of all-cause mortality at five years (9 versus 11 percent; HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71-0.91) [

In the subgroup of patients with an LVEF 30 to 49 percent (n = 1586), revascularization with CABG was also associated with a lower risk of mortality (15 versus 19 percent; HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.93). In the small subgroup of patients with an LVEF less than 30 percent (n = 103), there was less certainty of a benefit with CABG (34 versus 57 percent in the PCI group; HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.4-1.6).

The trial design included features that assured a high standard of care: The participating surgeons had to demonstrate less than 5 percent mortality in 25 patients with LVEF &lt;40 percent, and the medical management of all patients was supervised by trial leadership. Among patients who received CABG in the trial, 91 percent received at least one arterial bypass graft, and 87 percent had bypass of two or more vessels. In this context, patients randomly assigned to CABG had a lower 10-year risk of all-cause mortality (59 versus 66 percent; HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73-0.97) [

         – In patients with signs (eg, inducible ischemia, decrease in LVEF) or symptoms (eg, worsening angina or HF) attributable to single-vessel CAD, we suggest single-vessel PCI rather than single-vessel CABG or no attempt at revascularization  (

         In our experience, the benefit to risk ratio of single-vessel PCI is likely greater than the benefit to risk ratio of single-vessel CABG or no attempt at revascularization, but the benefit of single-vessel PCI versus no attempt at revascularization may be small. The expert contributors to this topic agree that ICM is rarely caused by single-vessel disease, though progression of CAD in a single vessel can occur in patients with ICM. There are no high-quality data that describe the relative benefit of single-vessel PCI, single-vessel CABG, or optimal modern medical therapy; few patients with single-vessel disease and reduced LVEF were included in trials of revascularization, and the available trials predate modern medical therapy.

         In patients with NYHA class IV symptoms, the risks and benefits of revascularization should be compared with the risks and benefits of advanced HF therapies. The options for the treatment of advanced HF are discussed separately. (See

         In patients with ICM who cannot undergo cardiac surgery, the benefits of revascularization with PCI are largely unknown. The efficacy of revascularization in patients with evidence of ischemia is not well-studied; based on our experience, we believe that revascularization in this group of patients may result in fewer symptoms and less ischemic injury to the myocardium. In patients who are not candidates for CABG surgery and who do not have evidence of inducible ischemia, there are few studies that directly address the efficacy of revascularization. However, indirect data suggest that PCI may not have a benefit when compared with medical therapy alone:

         In the REVIVED trial that included 700 patients with ICM with an LVEF ≤35 percent and who had myocardial viability in at least four segments of myocardium (over 50 percent had multivessel disease) amenable to revascularization, patients randomly assigned to PCI and optimal medical therapy or to optimal medical therapy alone had similar rates of death or hospitalization after a median of 3.4 years of observation (37 versus 38 percent in the optimal medical therapy group; HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78-1.27) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13

         ]. In addition, the average LVEF was similar between the two groups 12 months after randomization (mean difference -1.6 percent; 95% CI -3.7 to 0.5 percent). The study did not have a CABG arm and did not report on the feasibility of CABG amongst the patients enrolled. In addition, the severity of HF among those enrolled was unclear, and the study included some patients (approximately 33 percent) with angina. For the latter, we would typically revascularize such patients if medical therapy had failed. These factors limit the trial’s broad application to patients with ICM typically encountered in practice.

         We typically assess the response to revascularization with clinical evaluation (eg, improvement in symptoms) and echocardiography within three months of revascularization. We do not routinely repeat stress imaging to assess for residual ischemia after revascularization; we only repeat an ischemic evaluation if there is a high suspicion for residual ischemia.

         – Beta blockers have antianginal effects and reduce mortality in patients with HFrEF.

         <strong>
          Who should undergo revascularization?
         </strong>
         – All patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) should undergo evaluation for revascularization. In combination with optimal medical therapy  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef140887" href="/z/d/graphic/140887.html" rel="external">

         ), revascularization has the potential to improve survival despite the higher risks associated with revascularization in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). (See

          'Who should undergo revascularization?'

         <strong>
          Pretreatment evaluation
         </strong>
         – Revascularization may not be safe or effective due to the presence of severe heart failure (HF), advanced comorbid conditions (eg, kidney disease), diffuse coronary disease, or irreversible myocardial injury. Thus, a thorough pretreatment evaluation is required to determine the risks and benefits of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or continued medical therapy without revascularization. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pretreatment evaluation'

          Clinical assessment
         </strong>
         – Patients under evaluation for revascularization should be assessed for the presence and severity of conditions that may alter the risk or benefit of revascularization. The assessment of each condition includes an appropriate history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and imaging. (See

          Echocardiography
         </strong>
         – If not recently performed, patients with ICM should undergo echocardiography as part of the evaluation for revascularization. (See

         <strong>
          Surgical risk estimation
         </strong>
         – Patients with ICM typically have multiple comorbidities that increase the risk of CABG, and the risk of CABG directly influences the choice of revascularization. (See

         <strong>
          Coronary angiography
         </strong>
         – Most patients who do not have a recent angiogram should undergo invasive coronary angiography to assess for the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) amenable to revascularization. (See

          Choosing CABG, PCI, or no revascularization

          General principles

         </strong>
         – In patients with ICM who are acceptable candidates for CABG surgery and who have New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I to III HF symptoms, angina, or LV dysfunction that is likely due to CAD, the choice of CABG, PCI, or no attempt at revascularization is determined by the location and extent of CAD and whether the specific vessels are amenable to CABG or PCI (ie, grafting or stenting is technically feasible) (see

         – In patients with ICM who cannot undergo CABG surgery due to the presence of high-risk features (eg, NYHA class IV symptoms, severe kidney disease), the decision to perform PCI or to continue medical therapy without PCI depends on the benefit of revascularization and the risk of PCI (see
