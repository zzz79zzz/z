         Management of mechanical prosthetic valve obstruction or thrombosis is based upon the clinical presentation (eg, symptoms and signs of heart failure) and the cause of obstruction, if present. Thrombus forming on a mechanical prosthetic valve can be nonobstructive or obstructive and either may cause thromboembolic events [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-6
         </a>
         ]. Mechanical prosthetic valve obstruction may be caused by thrombus or pannus formation. The evaluation of mechanical prosthetic valve obstruction focuses on distinguishing these two causes since thrombus may be treated by anticoagulation, thrombolysis, or valve surgery (thrombectomy or repeat valve replacement), while pannus can be treated only by valve surgery. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8121.html" rel="external">
          "Mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis or obstruction: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Infectious endocarditis is an uncommon cause of valve obstruction that should be considered during the diagnostic evaluation and treated as appropriate. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2138.html" rel="external">

         Temporizing supportive medical care for moderately to severely symptomatic mechanical valve obstruction includes respiratory support as needed, cautious treatment of hypertension, and treatment of heart failure with cautious use of diuretics to treat volume overload. If the international normalized ratio (INR) is subtherapeutic, anticoagulation with

         Patients with obstructive, left-sided mechanical valve thrombosis causing NYHA class IV symptoms or hemodynamic instability require urgent intervention. While slow-infusion, low-dose fibrinolytic regiments have significantly improved the hemodynamic success rates and pose a relatively low risk of complications, the existing protocols may still take too long for a clinical response in critically ill patients and may increase the risk of rescue surgical intervention. For most of these patients, we therefore suggest surgery rather than fibrinolysis. (See

          'Surgery'

         The urgency of surgery is based upon the acuity and severity of patient symptoms. Prior to surgery, the patient is treated with intravenous UFH with goal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 2 to 2.5 times control.

         Management of PVT involves management of the acute risk and selection of therapy for long-term management. Management options include medical therapy (anticoagulation and fibrinolysis) and surgical therapy (valve replacement). Factors influencing the choice of therapy include impact of any valve obstruction on functional status (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683" href="/z/d/graphic/52683.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         )), valve location (left- or right-sided), thrombus size, thrombus mobility, and associated functional status [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,7,8
         </a>
         ]. While thrombus size is commonly used as a factor guiding management, it should be noted that it is difficult to quantify thrombus size due to prosthesis imaging artifact and other technical limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
         The following approach is based largely on expert opinion. Randomized controlled data for the therapy of PVT are not available, and each therapeutic option has important limitations, including perioperative risk of mortality with valve surgery, risk of bleeding and systemic embolization with fibrinolytic therapy, and risk of failure to improve with intravenous (IV) heparin therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The following are in broad agreement with those in the 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association valvular heart disease guidelines [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2

         Among patients with symptomatic prosthetic valve obstruction, medical therapy for heart failure (HF) is limited to use as a temporizing measure for patients awaiting treatment of the cause of obstruction and as palliation (eg, for patients with obstructive pannus who are not candidates for valve surgery). Medical treatment of symptomatic HF may include cautious use of diuretics and other medical therapy (eg angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor), given risk of destabilization with attempted therapy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3454.html" rel="external">
          "Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: General considerations"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Limited data are available on the efficacy of medical management of HF in this setting, but the expected prognosis is poor given the known natural history of medically treated HF in patients with native valve stenosis (eg, aortic stenosis and mitral stenosis).

Six of eight patients with tricuspid PVT had complete resolution of obstruction in response to fibrinolytic therapy. One patient with tricuspid PVT treated with streptokinase had a partial response, eventually underwent repeat tricuspid valve replacement, and died three months later.

          ANTITHROMBOTIC THERAPY AFTER RESOLUTION OF VALVE THROMBOSIS

         Patients with PVT treated with antithrombotic therapy and/or fibrinolytic therapy are at risk for recurrent PVT (eg, 6 percent during a median of 10 months follow-up after ultraslow fibrinolytic therapy). Thus, these patients require careful follow-up including an optimized antithrombotic regimen.
        </p>
        <p>
         When PVT occurs despite antithrombotic therapy, a key initial step is to determine which antithrombotic agents (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">
          warfarin

          aspirin
         </a>
         ) the patient was taking and the adequacy of anticoagulation (including recent duration in the therapeutic range). The risk of bleeding complications with increased intensity of anticoagulation should also be assessed. Standard antithrombotic therapy for a mechanical valve includes low-dose aspirin (75 to 100 mg/day) plus an anticoagulant (vitamin K antagonist [VKA] or heparin). Direct oral anticoagulants (oral direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors) are
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         recommended for use in patients with mechanical prosthetic valves. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         If antithrombotic therapy was inadequate prior to valve thrombosis or thromboembolism, institution of adequate therapy, including optimization of international normalized ratio (INR) range (eg, with patient education, more frequent monitoring, management by a dedicated pharmacist-led anticoagulation clinic, or patient self-monitoring), should be the first therapeutic step [

          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – The evaluation of mechanical prosthetic valve obstruction focuses on distinguishing between thrombus and pannus since thrombus may be treated by anticoagulation, thrombolysis, or valve surgery (thrombectomy or repeat valve replacement) while pannus can be treated only by valve surgery. Infection should also be considered and excluded. (See

          Moderately to severely symptomatic left sided valve obstruction
         </strong>
         – Patients with a thrombosed left-sided mechanical prosthetic heart valve with moderate to severe (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class III or IV) symptoms of valve obstruction require immediate referral to a heart-valve team for consideration of either slow-infusion, low-dose fibrinolytic therapy or emergency surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Factors determining choice of surgery or fibrinolytics include available local surgical expertise, clinical features (surgical risk, functional class, contraindication to fibrinolysis, first versus recurrent episode of valve thrombosis), concurrent need for other surgical intervention, and thrombus size.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Patients with a thrombosed left-sided mechanical valve with severe symptoms (NYHA class IV) require urgent intervention. For most of these patients, we suggest surgery rather than fibrinolysis (
