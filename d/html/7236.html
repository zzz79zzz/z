         The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines define chronic kidney disease (CKD) as abnormalities of kidney structure or function for more than three months [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The classification of CKD is based upon the cause of CKD (C), glomerular filtration rate (GFR; G; categories G1 to G5), and albuminuria (A; categories A1 to A3)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70597" href="/z/d/graphic/70597.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). This classification also includes treatment for kidney failure (ie, GFR &lt;15 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         ) with kidney replacement therapies (KRT), such as dialysis (CKD G5D) or transplantation (CKD G1T to G5T), and kidney failure without replacement therapy, with either comprehensive or choice-restricted conservative care [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The classification of CKD is related to associated risks of various complications, such as mortality, cardiovascular disease, and kidney failure  (

          GLOBAL BURDEN OF CKD
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         According to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study in 2017, there were 698 million recorded cases of CKD (95% CI 649-752) for an estimated global prevalence in the adult population of 9.1 percent (8.5 to 9.8) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Of this, CKD G1 to G2 accounted for 5 percent, G3 for 3.9 percent, G4 for 0.16 percent, G5 for 0.07 percent (not including patients on dialysis or transplant recipients), dialysis for 0.04 percent, and kidney transplantation for 0.01 percent. However, based on a meta-analysis of 100 studies (6,980,440 patients), the global CKD prevalence could be as high as 13.4 percent (11.7 to 15.1), with a prevalence of CKD stages 3 to 5 of 10.6 percent (9.2 to 12.2) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In the GBD study in 2017, the age-standardized prevalence of CKD was 1.29 (1.28 to 1.30) times higher in females (9.5 percent [8.8 to 10.2]) than in males (7.3 percent [6.8 to 7.9]). However, the age-standardized incidence of dialysis and transplantation was 1.47 (1.46 to 1.48) times higher among males (13.7 percent [12.6 to 14.9]) than among females (8.6 percent [7.9 to 9.3]). Males are more likely to start kidney replacement therapy (KRT) partly owing to faster CKD progression [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The estimated year to year variations in CKD prevalence from 1990 to 2017 were small, at around 1.2 percent change per year (1.1 to 3.5). Notwithstanding, CKD prevalence has increased by 29.3 percent (26.4 to 32.6) in this period [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Altogether, between 1990 and 2017, 1.4 million deaths (1.2 to 1.6 deaths) were attributable to kidney disease. Globally, the CKD mortality rate has increased by 41.5 percent (35.2 to 46.5) during this period. In parallel, the CKD worldwide ranking rose from the 17th leading cause of death in 1990 to the 12th in 2017. The global age-standardized CKD mortality rate was 1.39 (1.28 to 1.30) times higher in males (18.9 per 100,000 population [17.9 to 19.5]) than in females (13.6 per 100,000 population [13.3 to 14.0]) [
         <a href="#rid3">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         CKD accounted for 7.3 million (5.4 to 9.2) years lived with disability (YLDs), 28.5 million (27.6 to 29.3) years of life lost (YLLs), and 35.8 million (33.7 to 38.0) disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Disproportionately to other stages, G5 (ie, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;15 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         ) or D (dialysis) accounted for most YLDs at 40 and 22 percent, respectively [

         In 2017, China and India accounted for one-third of the global CKD burden, with 132.3 (121.8 to 143.7) and 115.1 (106.8 to 124.1) million cases, respectively. Bangladesh, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, the United States, and Vietnam had more than 10 million CKD cases. Seventy-nine of 195 countries included in the GBD study had more than 1 million prevalent CKD cases [
         <a href="#rid3">

        </p>
        <p>
         Compared with the relative increase in the global age-standardized mortality rate of 41.5 percent, some countries of Central America and Asia have had disproportionally high increases in CKD mortality between 1990 and 2017 (by 60.9 percent [52.7 to 66.2] and 60.9 percent [53.3 to 68.9], respectively). In these countries, CKD ranked second and fifth as the leading cause of death, respectively. Interestingly, the age-standardized mortality rate in North America, a high-income region, is also high at 57.3 percent (53.4 to 61.1) [
         <a href="#rid3">

        <p>
         Age-standardized DALY rates varied more than 15-fold among countries. In 2017, the highest rates, at ≥1500 DALYs per 100,000 population, were in American Samoa, El Salvador, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, and Mauritius. The lowest, at &lt;120 per 100,000 population, were in Andorra, Finland, Iceland, and Slovenia [

         In the United States, the US Renal Data System and the Centers for Disease Control CKD Surveillance System track kidney disease burden based on several sources of information, including the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). In the latest report (2015 to 2016), CKD prevalence was 14.2 percent (12.5 to 16.0), which corresponds to approximately 31 to 34 million noninstitutionalized United States civilian residents aged 20 years or older. Of these, 15 to 18 million had evidence of CKD G3 or G4 [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Between 2001 and 2016, CKD G3 slightly increased from 6.1 to 6.4 percent. The rest had no significant changes over this period. A2 to A3 prevalence increased from 8.8 percent (2009 to 2012) to 10.1 percent (2013 to 2016). During this period, 8.6 percent of NHANES participants with eGFR &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         had evidence of albuminuria. Based on prognosis, the prevalence of moderate-, high-, and very high-risk categories has increased from 14.2 percent between 2001 and 2004 to 14.8 percent in 2013 to 2016. In the latter, the risk categories were [

         In Canada, based on a large cross-sectional study (559,745 participants) between 2010 and 2015, CKD prevalence was 71.9 per 1000 individuals, with a significant geographic variation. The highest reported prevalence was in rural compared with urban settings (86.2 versus 68.4 per 1000, respectively). Approximately 7.4 percent had CKD G3 to G5, without differences between sex. However, CKD prevalence rose from 29.2 to 244.6 per 1000 individuals in people aged 46 to 59 and 70 to 74. However, CKD prevalence slightly declined from 53.4 (2010) to 46.5 per 1000 over the study period (2014) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Indigenous populations (First Nations) had a twofold higher CKD prevalence (25.5 percent) compared with the general population. Furthermore, the prevalence of severely increased albuminuria was fivefold higher. Both metrics are comparable to patients with diabetes and/or hypertension [

         Based on data from The Latin American Society of Nephrology and Hypertension (SLANH) registry and the GBD study, the Latin American (LA) region has the highest mortality rate from CKD and is second place in YLLs [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,11
         </a>
         ]. Data from the SLANH suggest that diabetes could be the primary cause for 36 to 70 percent (Mexico and Puerto Rico) of patients with CKD receiving KRT. Moreover, some countries have a CKD hotspot termed Mesoamerican nephropathy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98844.html" rel="external">
          "Mesoamerican nephropathy"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Information regarding CKD prevalence and risk of progression (including risk factors) is scarce and even nonexistent in some LA countries. In 2008, based on extrapolated data from the NHANES III, there could have been up to 49,989,171 CKD cases in LA, predominantly in stages G1 to G3 and lesser in G4 to G5 (996,832). In Mexico, a population-based cross-sectional study of 3961 adults documented albuminuria in 8.7 percent of those with eGFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         and up to 12.5 percent among those with prior diabetes and hypertension history. By extrapolating these findings to the whole Mexican population, CKD prevalence, defined as eGFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         , was 80,788 cases per million population (pmp), with 1142 cases pmp with eGFR &lt;15 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         . In comparison, data from a National Health Survey in Chile estimated that 20.97 percent of the surveyed sample had an eGFR &lt;80 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         and 0.18 percent &lt;15 mL/min/1.73 m

         <a href="#rid12">

         ]. Like the European experience, reviewed later, there is variability in CKD prevalence across LA countries though more data are needed to explain the cause for these differences.

         The European CKD Burden Consortium, which in 2016 included 13 European countries, reported significant geographic variation in CKD prevalence (G1 to G5) in the adult population, ranging from 3.31 percent (3.30 to 3.33) in Norway (Trondelag Health Study [HUNT] study) to 17.3 percent (16.5 to 18.1) in Germany (Study of Health in Pomerania [SHIP] study) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13

Furthermore, the adjusted prevalence of CKD G1 to G5 in the general population aged 45 to 74 years ranged from 6.3 percent in Norway to 25.6 percent in Germany. Differences in the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and obesity in the general population do not fully explain this variation in CKD prevalence among the different countries [

         As previously described, CKD prevalence varies regionally, even within countries. As an example, the regional variation across 27 European countries in CKD prevalence ranged from 3.31 percent (3.30 to 3.33) in Norway to 17.3 percent (16.5 to 18.1) in Germany. Reasons for these variations are manifold but may include actual regional differences or may stem from issues related to GFR estimation (eg, type of equation used), cut-off thresholds (especially among older adults), or one-off testing assessments in several large-scale reports. The latter is particularly relevant because failure to adhere to the &gt;3-month duration criteria of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition can lead to the overestimation of CKD prevalence and high false-positive rates. Indeed, false positives may be as high as 30 percent when using eGFR and even higher for albuminuria. More often, false positives from one-off testing reports can arise when assessing young or older adult individuals and people with chronically low or high protein intake, among others [

         Inulin urinary clearance is the current gold-standard for GFR determination, but this approach is too costly and cumbersome (requires an intravenous continuous infusion and plasma samples over many hours). Plasma clearance of iothalamate or

         The effect of ancestry is crucial in GFR estimation with the MDRD or CKD-EPI equations. For African American individuals, the proposed coefficient factor of 1.21 and 1.15 has been criticized for cases with normal GFR and Africans outside the United States. Notwithstanding, without correction, the eGFR would yield 21 or 15 percent higher rates, respectively. The latter might partly explain the disparity in CKD and kidney failure prevalence. Compared with White Americans, African Americans have lower CKD prevalence but higher rates of kidney failure. For Asians, there are several proposals for correction factors. Hence, some of the CKD prevalence across these populations might be under or overestimated [
         <a href="#rid25">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         An approach that might decrease the effect of ancestry on eGFR determination is a cystatin C‑based equation, since cystatin C does not seem to be influenced by ethnicity [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. In the general population and the older adult population, eGFR determination with cystatin C might be a useful predictor of adverse cardiovascular events and mortality. However, its clinical use has not been well established, but may identify CKD patients at the highest risk for complications compared with serum creatinine [

         CKD hotspots have been defined as countries, regions, communities, or ethnicities with a higher-than-average incidence of CKD. Although specific etiologic factors have not yet been identified, most cases are due to nontraditional causes of CKD, such as infections and CKD of unknown etiology. CKD hotspots have been described in several regions of the world, including some Central American countries (the so-called Mesoamerican nephropathy), the Balkan nations, Sri-Lanka, Andhra Pradesh in India, the northern region of Australia, and some areas of New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. The premature death and disability toll in most CKD hotspots are enormous, partly due to lack of access to health care and KRT, and insufficiently trained personnel, among other factors. As an example, El Salvador has the highest mortality rate from kidney disease at a global level, and CKD is the second leading cause of death among Salvadoran males of working age [

Data from a meta-analysis of 13 renal registries and 123 countries (93 percent of the world population) indicated that, in 2010, 2.6 million people received some form of kidney replacement therapy (KRT), predominantly dialysis (78 percent) rather than transplantation. However, this study estimated that the need for KRT extended to at least 4.9 million individuals (95% CI 4.4–5.4), and perhaps as many as 9.7 million (8.5 to 11.0). The latter suggests that approximately 2.3 million people might have died prematurely due to a lack of KRT access. More importantly, worldwide demand for KRT is projected to double to 5.4 million (3.9 to 7.6 million) between 2010 and 2030, driven predominantly by increased demand in Asia [

         Australia, China, Hong Kong, Mexico, New Zealand, Thailand, and the United States have implemented public policies to promote peritoneal dialysis utilization through financial incentives. Some of these countries have implemented peritoneal dialysis-first policies to reduce costs and improve access. Compared with hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis requires less infrastructure and can cost-effectively be scaled up by manufacturing dialysate fluids locally [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. Despite peritoneal dialysis being cheaper than hemodialysis, most patients are still receiving hemodialysis. Factors contributing to low peritoneal dialysis utilization may include clinician and patient preference, patient comorbidities, greater experience with hemodialysis, late referral to nephrology, and clinician remuneration, among others. However, hemodialysis services tend to be located in larger cities and are often paid out of pocket [

         Hemodialysis is the dominant form of KRT and accounts for 80 to 90 percent of all dialysis. A study by the International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas (GKHA) Project 2019 found that hemodialysis is available in 93 percent of countries, and in-center hemodialysis remains the most frequent treatment modality for kidney failure [

         Globally, hemodialysis to peritoneal dialysis utilization ratios vary, particularly in countries where public and private sectors exist. In 2013 in South Africa, the hemodialysis/peritoneal dialysis ratio for the public sector was 48/26 percent versus 84/8 percent in the private sector [

According to the Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation, kidney transplantation is nonexistent in most of Africa and some countries of Southeast Asia. Specifically, Africa had a transplant rate of 0.4 pmp in 2015 because many countries did not have transplant programs. The United States, France, and Spain have the highest rates at 52 to 63 pmp worldwide [

         Conservative care is planned, holistic, patient-centered care for patients with G5 CKD. It includes interventions to delay kidney disease progression, minimize the risk of adverse events and complications, and active symptom management; clear communication, including advance care planning and shared decision-making; and psychosocial and spiritual support for patients and their families. Specifically, conservative care does not include dialysis. It can be either comprehensive for patients who elect not to start KRT or who are medically advised not to start KRT based on their circumstances, or choice-restricted for whom resource constraints prevent or limit access to KRT [

         To date, there is limited evidence on the prevalence and incidence of conservative care. Most international registries report the prevalence of kidney failure and cases receiving KRT. Based on a community cohort study in Canada of 1,816,824 adult patients, only 0.17 percent received conservative care [

         Early stages of CKD as well as kidney failure are both associated with high morbidity and increased health care utilization. Approximately 50 percent of dialysis patients have three or more comorbid conditions; the number of hospitalizations and hospital days are 1.9 and 12.8 per patient-year, respectively, and self-reported quality of life is far lower in dialysis patients than in the general population [

         The adverse outcomes observed among patients with kidney failure are also reported among those with earlier stages of CKD and are driven by many of the same risk factors, although the magnitude of the excess risk as compared with the general population is lower for those with milder CKD. As an example, in a retrospective analysis of 259 adult patients with CKD (defined as serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL [133 micromol/L] for females and ≥2 mg/dL [177 micromol/L] for males), hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and peripheral vascular disease were present in 87, 35, 40, and 14 percent, respectively [

Forty-seven percent of patients were hospitalized during a median follow-up of 11.4 months, and the number of hospitalizations and hospital days per patient-year at risk were 0.96 and 6.6, respectively. CVD (excluding congestive heart failure) and hypertension were the most common primary diagnoses, accounting for 24.5 percent of hospitalizations. In a multivariable regression analysis, older age and presence of cardiac disease were associated with higher risk of hospitalization, while higher albumin and higher hematocrit levels were associated with lower risk of hospitalization.

         Risk factors for hospital utilization were similar to those observed among kidney failure patients, such as older age, gender, race, cardiac disease, peripheral vascular disease, serum albumin, and hematocrit levels [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60,62-64
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The similarity in comorbid conditions and causes of hospitalization suggest that the comorbidity and complications observed in kidney failure manifest themselves well before the onset of kidney failure. Similar findings were observed in a study of patients with earlier stages of CKD referred to a nephrology service in Ontario, Canada [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The risk of cardiovascular mortality, and risk of kidney failure, disease progression, or acute kidney injury in patients with CKD progressively increases as GFR declines. In one study, GFR was estimated longitudinally from 1996 to 2000 in over 1 million enrollees of a United States integrated health care system [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66
         </a>
         ]. The adjusted risk for cardiovascular events for patients with an estimated GFR (eGFR) of 45 to 59, 30 to 44, 15 to 29, and &lt;15 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         was 1.4, 2.0, 2.8, and 3.4, respectively, and similar patterns were observed in the risk for hospitalization.

         A detailed discussion of the association between CKD and morbidity from CVD is discussed separately. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with CKD, particularly those with kidney failure, are at increased risk of mortality, particularly from CVD. In 2011 alone, more than 92,221 kidney failure patients died [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56,67
         </a>
         ]. Survival probabilities for dialysis patients at one, two, and five years are approximately 81, 65, and 34 percent, respectively [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ]. Rates for prevalent dialysis patients ≥65 years of age are nearly seven times higher than those in the general population [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2015 reported that, among 315 diseases, the rank of CKD in terms of disability-adjusted life years rose from 30 in 1990 to 22 in 2005 and 20 in 2015 [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68

         ]. This is discussed in detail separately. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         In contrast to the GBD study results, in 2020, a retrospective cohort of 548,609 participants from the Alberta Kidney Disease Network with longitudinal information on severe CKD (GFR &lt;30 mL/min) or kidney failure with or without clinical comorbidities (eg, coronary vascular disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, cancer, among others), documented significant reductions in mortality and mean hospital stay between 2004 and 2015. These reductions compared favorably to other noncommunicable diseases except for mortality at five years for kidney failure cases under KRT, which failed to improve [
         <a href="#rid69">
          69
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Likewise, another study examined excess mortality over and above the risk in the general population among patients on KRT in the United States between 1995 and 2013. Adjusted relative excess risk per five-year increment in calendar time ranged from 0.73 (0.69 to 0.77) for 0 to 14-year-olds to 0.88 (0.88 to 0.88) for ≥65-year-olds, which means that the excess risk of kidney failure-related death decreased by 12 to 27 percent over any five-year interval. Although these reductions correlated with time on dialysis and time with a functioning kidney transplant, the youngest persons with a functioning kidney transplant had the largest relative improvements [
         <a href="#rid70">
          70
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The apparent discrepancy between the GBD study results and the above two studies can be explained by methodologic differences, including patients with all CKD stages entered in the GBD study. In addition, the increases in the burden of CKD reported in the GBD study are driven by population aging and increases in population size, which do not contradict the better age-adjusted outcomes at the individual level that were reported in the other two studies.

         <strong>
          Global burden of CKD
         </strong>
         – The global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, ranging from approximately 9 to 13 percent in different studies, and is about 1.3 times more frequent in females than in males. Between 1990 and 2017, the all-age CKD prevalence increased by approximately 29 percent. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Global burden of CKD'

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Globally, the mortality rate from CKD increased by 42 percent between 1990 to 2017, driven by population aging and population growth. In parallel, CKD became the 12

          Regional differences in CKD burden
         </strong>
         – There are striking regional differences in CKD burden. This regional variation may reflect actual regional differences or partially relate to issues with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation (eg, type of equation used), cut-off thresholds (especially among older adults), or one-off testing assessments. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Burden of kidney failure
         </strong>
         – Approximately 0.1 percent of the world population has kidney failure (ie, end-stage kidney disease), and this proportion will increase over time. Despite significant growth in access to kidney replacement therapy (KRT; ie, dialysis or kidney transplantation), over 90 percent of patients with kidney failure in low- and low-middle income countries remain untreated (particularly in Asia and Africa). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Kidney failure'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Worldwide, hemodialysis is the most frequent treatment modality for kidney failure, mainly in high-income countries where the proportions of hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis are 80 to 90 percent versus 10 to 20 percent.

         <strong>
          Racial differences in kidney failure
         </strong>
         – Compared with White Americans, Black Americans have a 3.7-fold higher prevalence of kidney failure, likely a result of social determinants of health. In addition, specific apolipoprotein L1 (
         <em>
          APOL1
         </em>
         ) polymorphisms confer a substantially higher risk of kidney failure in Black individuals. (See

          Impact of CKD
         </strong>
         – Both early stages of CKD and kidney failure are associated with high morbidity and increased health care utilization. The risk of hospitalization and cardiovascular events in patients with CKD progressively increases as GFR declines (see
         <a class="local">
          'Impact of CKD and kidney failure on morbidity and mortality'
         </a>
         above). However, recent analyses on secular trends of advanced CKD and CKD on KRT suggest significant reductions in mortality and mean hospital stay over the past decades.
