The most prevalent form of SAD is winter depression, marked by recurrent episodes of unipolar depression that begin in the fall or winter and if left untreated, generally remit in the following spring or summer. Recognizing the disorder is important because SAD is common and associated with psychosocial impairment [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. In addition, acute treatment is often effective and maintenance treatment can prevent future episodes [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Among patients who were recruited for randomized trials studying treatment of winter depression, nearly 60 percent had never been treated for depression [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>This topic discusses the treatment of SAD; most of the topic is devoted to recurrent unipolar major depression with winter seasonal pattern (winter depression). The epidemiology, neurobiology, clinical features, assessment, diagnosis, and validity of SAD are discussed separately.

It is not considered a separate mood disorder; rather, SAD is a subtype of the following mood disorders [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unipolar major depressive disorder (major depressive disorder)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bipolar I disorder</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bipolar II disorder</p><p></p><p>Thus, patients with SAD have recurrent episodes of unipolar major depression  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994" href="/z/d/graphic/89994.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), bipolar major depression  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91398" href="/z/d/graphic/91398.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), mania  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91106" href="/z/d/graphic/91106.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), or hypomania  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91107" href="/z/d/graphic/91107.html" rel="external">table 4</a>); the essential feature is that onset and remission of the mood episodes occurs at characteristic times of the year [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>Subsyndromal SAD consists of recurrent periods of clinically significant mood symptoms (eg, minor depression) that occur with seasonal onset and remission; however, the symptoms do not rise to the level to meet criteria for mood syndromes such as major depression and do not substantially impair functioning [<a href="#rid1">1,6</a>].</p><p>This topic focuses primarily upon recurrent unipolar major depression with seasonal pattern because it is more common than bipolar disorder with seasonal pattern [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>].

Patients with severe major depression who are assessed with the self-administered Patient Health Questionnaire – Nine Item (PHQ-9)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307" href="/z/d/graphic/59307.html" rel="external">table 5</a>) typically score 20 or more points, and often report suicidal ideation and behavior. In addition, severely ill patients are more likely to experience complications, such as psychotic features or catatonic features, and are often referred to psychiatrists for management.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mild to moderate illness</strong> – Patients with major depression who are mildly to moderately ill often have only five or six depressive symptoms  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994" href="/z/d/graphic/89994.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) (at least five are necessary to make the diagnosis) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Symptoms are distressing but manageable, and functional impairment is not necessarily obvious to others. Patients with mild to moderate major depression who are assessed with the self-administered PHQ-9  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307" href="/z/d/graphic/59307.html" rel="external">table 5</a>) typically score less than 20 points, and often deny suicidal behavior. In addition, patients are unlikely to experience complications, such as psychotic features or catatonic features, and are typically managed by primary care clinicians or mental health clinicians other than psychiatrists.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H155707531"><span class="h2">Assessing prior response to pharmacotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Caution is warranted in assessing prior responses to antidepressant medications in patients with winter depression; a previous “response” in the spring or summer may have been a placebo response rather than a true medication response. In placebo-controlled antidepressant trials, patients with major depression (not selected for the presence or absence of seasonal pattern) are less likely to have a placebo response from November through February compared with other times of the year [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. As an example, a study examined patients with depressive syndromes (n = 432) who were not selected for seasonality and who received a 10-day course of placebo as a “washout” or lead-in to a randomized trial [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Response to placebo occurred in fewer patients during the late fall and winter months than the rest of year (15 versus 25 percent).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H184741578"><span class="h2">Monitoring</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with SAD who have recurrent unipolar major depression with seasonal pattern, we suggest monitoring response to treatment in manner similar to that for patients with nonseasonal depression.

However, a longer course of therapy may be necessary before deciding that the treatment has failed. (See <a class="local">'Administration'</a> below.)</p><p>The duration of an adequate trial of an antidepressant drug for unipolar major depression is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1725.html" rel="external">"Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment"</a>.)</p><p>Time-limited psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy, are generally administered until patients have received the entire course of therapy. As an example, cognitive-behavioral therapy adapted for SAD consists of two sessions per week for six weeks [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H349801480"><span class="h2">Managing treatment resistance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with winter depression often do not respond to first line treatment.

As part of sleep hygiene, creating a regular light-dark cycle may be important. Minimizing light exposure, especially blue light from computer monitors and televisions, in the late evening (eg, during the two hours prior to the desired time of sleep onset) may facilitate sleep onset.</p><p>Evidence for the efficacy of acute treatments for winter depression is discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a class="local">'Efficacy of acute treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H155707397"><span class="h3">First line</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with winter depression, we suggest an antidepressant drug plus artificial light (bright light therapy, dawn simulation, or both) as first line treatment. However, antidepressants alone are a reasonable alternative. The specific choice depends upon factors such as prior treatment history, severity of illness (see <a class="local">'Severity of winter depression'</a> above), safety, tolerability, cost, and patient preference. As an example, more severely ill patients may benefit from pharmacotherapy plus both bright light therapy and dawn simulation, rather than just one form of light therapy. Some patients prefer antidepressant monotherapy because of relative contraindications to bright light therapy (eg, retinal disease or use of photosensitizing medications) or because bright light therapy is inconvenient and tedious [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Dawn simulation is appealing because it is administered at the end of the night, while patients are still asleep; however, the device may wake a sleeping partner. First line treatment with pharmacotherapy plus light therapy or pharmacotherapy alone is consistent with multiple treatment guidelines (eg, American Psychiatric Association and World Federation of Societies for Biological Psychiatry) [<a href="#rid12">12,17-19</a>].</p><p>The initial drug of choice for winter SAD is typically a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>], consistent with initial treatment in the general population of patients with unipolar major depression. However, other types of antidepressants can be used instead of SSRIs [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. As an example, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9171" href="/z/d/drug information/9171.html" rel="external">bupropion</a> is a good choice for patients who want to stop smoking tobacco or want to avoid SSRI side effects, such as weight gain or sexual dysfunction. In addition, bupropion has demonstrated efficacy in preventing recurrences of winter depression (see <a class="local">'Antidepressants'</a> below). Additional information about the general treatment of unipolar major depression, including the choice of drug, doses, and side effects, is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1725.html" rel="external">"Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1725.html" rel="external">"Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment", section on 'Selecting a specific antidepressant'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with mild to moderate winter depression, light therapy (bright light therapy and/or dawn simulation) alone is also a reasonable alternative as first line therapy, and is consistent with multiple treatment guidelines (eg, American Psychiatric Association and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) [<a href="#rid12">12,13,17,18,21</a>]. Patients may prefer light therapy alone because it avoids medication safety risks and side effects. However, light therapy alone is generally regarded as inadequate for severe episodes of winter depression. The administration, safety, and side effects of bright light therapy are discussed elsewhere in this topic (see <a class="local">'Bright light therapy'</a> below), as is the administration of dawn simulation (see <a class="local">'Dawn simulation'</a> below).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H155708066"><span class="h3">Second line</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Winter depression often does not respond to first line treatment with an antidepressant drug plus light therapy. For these patients, the next step is to verify the diagnosis and adherence, and to address factors that can cause nonresponse (see <a class="local">'Managing treatment resistance'</a> above). If this step is completed and the patient remains unresponsive, we suggest switching antidepressants and continuing light therapy. If patients do not respond to one drug switch, the antidepressant is switched at least one or two more times.
