A review of observational studies estimated an annual risk of thrombosis among aPL-positive individuals, including those with a systemic rheumatic disease, of &lt;5.3 percent; the annual risk of among aPL-positive individuals without a systemic rheumatic disease was estimated at &lt;1 percent [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>].</p><p>Several studies have suggested that SLE with a high-risk aPL profile is associated with increased risk of future thromboembolic events [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>]. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A meta-analysis including 2248 patients with SLE found that patients with LA had a sixfold increased risk of VTE (odds ratio [OR] 5.61, 95% CI 3.80-8.27) compared with patients without LA, and those with aCL had a twofold increased risk (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.51-3.11) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. However, the analysis did not account for other risk factors that could contribute to VTE risk.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A cohort study of 119 patients with aPL, more than half of whom had a systemic rheumatic disease (mostly SLE), found that the presence of double or triple positive tests for aPL was a risk factor for future thrombotic events, whereas a single positive test for aPL was not [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The annual rate of first thrombotic events in individuals with any single positive aPL was 0.65 percent (which is similar to the baseline risk in a healthy population), compared with 1.27 percent in patients who were double or triple positive for aPL.</p><p></p><p>Studies evaluating the risk of thrombosis associated with a high-risk aPL profile in individuals without an autoimmune disease have shown mixed results, with some studies suggesting no increased risk during the follow-up period [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], and others demonstrating an increased risk [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. In one study that evaluated thrombosis risk in 179 individuals without SLE who had an isolated, persistently positive LA and were followed for approximately three years, seven individuals had thromboembolic events (1.3 percent per person-year) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. All seven individuals who had an event had at least one additional major risk factor for thromboembolism, suggesting a minor, if any, contribution of aPL as a risk factor for thrombosis. In another study including 104 patients with a triple positive aPL profile who were followed for a mean of 4.5 years, the cumulative incidence of first thromboembolic event after 10 years was 37 percent (95% CI 19.9-54.3 percent) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>Several, but not all, studies have reported an increased risk of thrombotic events in individuals with obstetric APS who have not had a prior thrombosis [<a href="#rid11">11-15</a>]. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a prospective observational study including 1592 individuals with a history of pregnancy loss that fulfilled obstetric criteria for APS but who had not had a prior thrombotic event, those individuals who tested positive for aPL were more likely to have a thrombotic event compared with those who tested negative for aPL [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Results were independent of whether an inherited thrombophilia variant was present. The higher rate of thrombotic events in those with aPL was observed despite the use of low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> prophylaxis in all groups.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a smaller retrospective study of 115 individuals with obstetric APS, 12 (10.4 percent) developed thrombotic events over a mean follow-up time of 10.91±4.47 years [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Most of them had an arterial thrombosis, three with stroke and six with a transient ischemic attack (TIA). An important limitation of the study was that other risk factors for thrombosis were not included in the analysis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>By contrast, a retrospective case-control study comparing 141 individuals with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss matched with 141 individuals with aPL-associated pregnancy loss did not report a statistically significant difference in the incidence of thrombotic events during the median follow-up period of 7.3 years [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3393917717"><span class="h2">Limited role of antithrombotic therapy for primary prevention</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2322373817"><span class="h3">Our approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients who have aPL but have not had a thrombosis or an APS-defining pregnancy morbidity, we suggest not routinely using antithrombotic therapy (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> or anticoagulation) for primary thrombosis prevention. This suggestion applies to individuals with SLE and individuals with APS based on obstetric criteria alone.</p><p>However, some individuals may reasonably choose to take <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> for primary thrombosis prevention, especially if they would derive other benefits such as colorectal cancer risk reduction and they are willing to accept the slightly increased risk of bleeding. The decision about whether to use aspirin or anticoagulation in aPL-positive individuals without APS during pregnancy is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6813.html" rel="external">"Antiphospholipid syndrome: Obstetric implications and management in pregnancy", section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p>This approach is based on a relatively low baseline risk of thrombosis in these individuals, low-quality evidence that either anticoagulation or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> appreciably reduces this risk, and a known increase in bleeding with either anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, although the absolute increase in bleeding risk with aspirin is very small. (See <a class="local">'Evidence for primary thrombosis prevention'</a> below.)</p><p>Our approach differs somewhat from that of the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR; formerly known as European League Against Rheumatism) guidelines, which suggest low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> for primary prophylaxis in patients with a high-risk aPL profile (defined as a finding on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart of an LA, double or triple aPL positivity, or persistently high aPL titers, in an individual with or without SLE) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Per these guidelines, low-dose aspirin can also be considered for those individuals with a low-risk aPL profile (ie, isolated aCL antibodies or anti-beta2GPI antibodies at low to medium titers or transiently positive aPL). The 16<sup>th</sup> International Congress on Antiphospholipid Antibodies Task Force on APS Treatment Trends suggests that the use of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention should be individualized [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p>The risk of bleeding from low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> is smaller than that with anticoagulation; generally, aspirin is estimated to increase bleeding risk approximately 50 percent (1.5 times) over the individual's baseline risk, with a relatively small absolute increase in the majority of otherwise healthy individuals (range 4 to 18 additional extracranial bleeds per 1000 individuals over a 10-year period, depending on baseline risk). Additional information on the potential benefits and risks of bleeding with aspirin is provided in separate topic reviews. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16291.html" rel="external">"Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer", section on 'Bleeding'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2600.html" rel="external">"NSAIDs (including aspirin): Role in prevention of colorectal cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4209962012"><span class="h3">Evidence for primary thrombosis prevention</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The evidence for primary thrombosis prevention in individuals with aPL is mixed, with limited data suggesting a possible benefit from <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 2018 Cochrane review that included 9 randomized trials involving 1044 participants with positive aPL who had not had a thrombotic event concluded that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate benefit or harm of using <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> or aspirin plus an anticoagulant in these individuals [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. However, the number of events in the trials analyzed was low overall, making the data challenging to interpret. All of the trials included were at high or unclear risk of bias. Furthermore, most of the trials compared combinations of different therapies, with only one trial (the Antiphospholipid Antibody Acetylsalicylic Acid [APLASA] study) comparing aspirin alone with placebo [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The APLASA trial is the only randomized trial to compare <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> versus placebo in individuals with persistently positive aPL but no history of thrombosis or pregnancy morbidity; in this trial, 98 individuals (approximately two-thirds with SLE) were randomly assigned to receive aspirin (81 mg daily) or placebo for a mean of 2.3 years [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Three patients in the aspirin group developed thrombosis (two venous and one arterial), compared with none in the placebo group, a difference that was not statistically significant (hazard ratio [HR] 1.04, 95% CI 0.69-1.56).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 2014 meta-analysis consisting mostly of observational studies that included 1208 individuals with aPL (some had SLE and some did not) found that individuals taking low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> had a lower rate of thrombosis (OR for first venous or arterial thrombosis 0.50, 95% CI 0.27-0.93) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. There was significant heterogeneity across studies. One subgroup analysis demonstrated that low-dose aspirin was protective against arterial but not venous thrombosis, and another subgroup analysis found aspirin was only associated with a statistically significant reduction in thrombosis in retrospective (but not prospective) studies.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There is also limited evidence suggesting a protective effect of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> for primary thrombosis prevention among individuals with obstetric APS.

In patients with a persistently positive LA test performed off anticoagulation and/or moderate to high titer aCL/anti-beta2GPI, aPL usually do not disappear during long-term follow-up. Thus, aPL should be repeated if there is a consideration to stop anticoagulation; however, the results of repeat testing should not be the only determinant of the decision.</p><p>Evidence from retrospective series shows a high rate of recurrent thromboembolism in individuals with APS who stopped anticoagulation, with estimates of approximately 50 to 70 percent, or 30 percent per year [<a href="#rid50">50-52</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Risk of a first thrombosis with aPL'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For patients who have aPL but have not had a thrombosis or an antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)-defining pregnancy morbidity, we suggest not routinely using <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> or anticoagulation for primary thrombosis prevention (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). However, some individuals may reasonably benefit from low-dose aspirin based on general population guidelines or for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. The decision about whether to use aspirin or anticoagulants in patients with aPL without APS during pregnancy is discussed separately. (See <a class="local">'Limited role of antithrombotic therapy for primary prevention'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6813.html" rel="external">"Antiphospholipid syndrome: Obstetric implications and management in pregnancy", section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial management of acute thrombosis</strong> – In individuals with acute thrombosis and suspected APS, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> is generally preferred, although a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) may reasonably be used in selected cases. We generally individualize these decisions based on the clinical likelihood of APS versus thrombosis and transiently elevated aPL. (See <a class="local">'Approach to anticoagulation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Secondary thrombosis prevention</strong> – Secondary thrombosis prevention with long-term anticoagulation is the mainstay of therapy for patients with APS due to the high rate of recurrent thrombosis. The main principles of APS management include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Baseline coagulation testing</strong> – All patients should have a baseline prothrombin time (PT) with international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) prior to starting anticoagulation. Baseline prolongation of the PT or aPTT is a laboratory artifact and does not indicate auto-anticoagulation. A test that is prolonged at baseline cannot be used to monitor anticoagulation. (See <a class="local">'Importance of baseline coagulation testing'</a> above and <a class="local">'Anticoagulant monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Long-term anticoagulation</strong> – For most individuals with APS, we suggest anticoagulation with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> rather than a DOAC (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). However, a DOAC may be reasonable in selected cases of APS, particularly for patients with lower-risk features such as a single venous thromboembolism (VTE) and single positive aPL test, or those who cannot tolerate warfarin. The individual should be made aware of the available evidence and possible reduced efficacy of DOACs relative to warfarin for APS. (See <a class="local">'Long-term anticoagulation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The approach to secondary thrombosis prevention varies depending on whether the thrombosis/thromboembolism is venous or arterial:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>VTE</strong> – For individuals with APS and VTE, we suggest anticoagulation with standard-intensity <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> (INR range 2 to 3) rather than a higher INR range (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Venous thrombosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Arterial</strong> – For most patients with APS and arterial thromboembolism, we suggest anticoagulation with standard-intensity <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> (INR range 2 to 3) plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> rather than a higher INR range and/or either therapy alone (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Some patients with arterial thrombosis who lack cardiovascular risk factors may reasonably be treated with standard-intensity warfarin alone. (See <a class="local">'Arterial thrombosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Duration of antithrombotic therapy</strong> – For most individuals with APS and an unprovoked thrombosis, we recommend lifelong anticoagulation (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). This is based on the high likelihood of recurrence without anticoagulation and the potentially devastating nature of recurrent thromboembolic events, especially arterial events. Some individuals with a clearly provoked VTE, especially in the setting of low titer aPL, may consider stopping anticoagulation after three to six months. (See <a class="local">'Duration of anticoagulation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Recurrent thromboembolism</strong> – Recurrent thromboembolism despite anticoagulation is rare but can occur. If it is confirmed that the individual was therapeutically anticoagulated at the time of the recurrent thrombosis, options include adding <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8541" href="/z/d/drug information/8541.html" rel="external">hydroxychloroquine</a> (HCQ), using a higher INR range, or switching to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). (See <a class="local">'Recurrent thromboembolism despite adequate anticoagulation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring</strong> – Routine laboratory monitoring is limited to coagulation studies (performed prior to initiating anticoagulation and during therapy to guide dosing), complete blood count (CBC), and metabolic panel to assess kidney function; this is typically done every 6 to 12 months. Repeat aPL testing is not performed unless it would alter management. (See <a class="local">'Other treatment considerations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other manifestations</strong> – Cardiac vegetations from nonbacterial thrombotic endocardial deposits (NBTE) are generally treated with anticoagulation plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> to reduce embolization risk. Individuals with white matter lesions not due to ischemic stroke may be treated with aspirin. Thrombocytopenia is not a contraindication to anticoagulation in most cases, but the cause should be evaluated in case other therapies are indicated. Kidney manifestations of APS are discussed separately.
