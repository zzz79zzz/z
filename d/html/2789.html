          INTRODUCTION

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious, preventable public health problem affecting more than 32 million Americans [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In countries around the world, 10 to 69 percent of females report physical assault by an intimate partner at some time in their life [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The term "intimate partner violence" describes actual or threatened psychological, physical, or sexual harm by a current or former partner or spouse. IPV can occur among people with any gender identities and sexual orientations and does not require sexual intimacy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Abusive relationships often begin as verbal and emotional abuse but may become physical. Most females who are victims of physical aggression experience multiple episodes of aggression over time [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. "Intimate terrorism," in which a passive victim in an abusive relationship lives in constant fear of the next episode of abuse, is the classic IPV paradigm. However, IPV may be mutual/bidirectional ("situational violence") or may take the form of "violent resistance," in which the identified victim fights back [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The underlying psychological dynamic in most types of violence is power and control of the victim by the abuser. The assumption that within a heterosexual relationship all violence is initiated by males and directed towards females is not correct, although females are far more likely to experience IPV than males [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will review the epidemiology and health consequences of intimate partner violence. Screening and diagnosis of IPV is discussed separately, as is management for patients in whom IPV is diagnosed. (See

          EVOLVING FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING GENDER AND IPV
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The majority of existing literature on intimate partner violence (IPV) preceded nonbinary gender identification in research; studies did not routinely record gender identity and sexual orientation and assumed different-gender relationships. More recent studies show IPV is at least as common in same-gender relationships as different-gender relationships, with some studies demonstrating that LGBTQ+ minorities experience higher rates of IPV compared with heterosexual and cisgender individuals [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. This topic has been updated to reflect self-identification of gender with the understanding that demographic data among historic studies may have gathered only binary gender identity information.
        </p>
        <p>
         As an example of this evolving framework, the World Health Organization (WHO) includes IPV as a part of a larger problem referred to as "gender-based violence" [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Gender-based violence (GBV) also encompasses rape by strangers, female genital mutilation, sexual harassment in the workplace, selective malnutrition of girls, and human trafficking. It emphasizes the role of society, community, and the political system, rather than individual factors, in promoting and perpetuating violence, thereby highlighting the influence communities can have on addressing violence  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86332" href="/z/d/graphic/86332.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ) (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106947.html" rel="external">
          "Human trafficking: Identification and evaluation in the health care setting", section on 'Sex trafficking'
         </a>
         ). The GBV model provides a framework to facilitate understanding IPV in societies worldwide; however, it is limited by the assumption that perpetration occurs only from males to females and that only females are victims. It also focuses more on physical and sexual, rather than emotional, types of IPV. These frameworks will evolve as ongoing research facilitates a broader understanding of IPV impact and groups affected, including survivors of all genders and sexual orientations.

         Physical violence occurs less frequently than other forms of IPV and is usually preceded by other forms of control [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Experiencing abuse in one domain may increase the risk of other types of abuse. In one study, 68 percent of physically abused females were also sexually abused [
         <a href="#rid10">

         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. "Battering" involves severe and escalating violence with terrorization and increasingly controlling behavior. "Common couple violence" is a more moderate form of IPV in which violence occurs occasionally, triggered by frustration and/or anger.

         Psychological/emotional violence involves trauma to the victim caused by threats of actions or coercive tactics. Threats of physical or sexual violence use words, gestures, or weapons to communicate an intent to cause physical harm, injury, disability, or death.
        </p>
        <p>
         Psychological violence may include humiliation, control over what a person can and cannot do, withholding information, isolating the victim from friends and family, denying access to money or other basic resources, or threatening harm to other loved ones (including pets). This type of IPV may also include stalking (repeated behavior that causes victims to experience a high level of fear) [

         Physical violence is the intentional use of physical force with the potential to cause harm, injury, disability, or death. Physical violence includes scratching, pushing, shoving, throwing, grabbing, biting, strangulating, shaking, slapping, punching, or burning. It may also include using a weapon, restraints, or one's size or strength against another person.
        </p>
        <p>
         Physical violence varies in frequency and severity, ranging from one hit to chronic severe battering.

          11
         </a>
         ]. Among females in the United States, it has been estimated that approximately 20 percent of sexual assaults, 25 percent of physical assaults, and 50 percent of stalking episodes are reported [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Even fewer IPV incidents against males are reported. There are limited data from survey studies suggesting higher rates of IPV among people with nonmajority gender identities and sexual orientations. Specifically, transgender/gender-nonconforming people experienced higher rates of violence than cisgender peers [

         The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey conducted in 2011 was performed as an anonymous random digit telephone survey, to relieve the stigma of reporting and obtain more reliable data than previously available. The survey identified the following [

         One in three females (32 percent) and one in four males (28 percent) in the United States have experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime, and almost one-half of all people have experienced psychological violence  (

         In a 2012 telephone survey of a random sample of females receiving primary care through the US Veterans Health Administration, the overall prevalence of past year IPV was 18.5 percent and was higher (11.2 to 25.5 percent) for those under age 55 years [

In almost all sites, the risk of partner-related physical or sexual violence far exceeded the risk of other violence. Physical violence only was the most common pattern of IPV, although 30 to 56 percent of females in most sites experienced both physical and sexual violence.

The proportion of female homicides attributable to IPV (38.6 percent) was six times higher than for male homicides (6.3 percent), but since homicide rates are four times higher in males than females, in absolute numbers, there are three IPV-related homicides in females for every two IPV-related homicides in males.

         Intimate partner violence (IPV) cuts across sex, racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic boundaries. Although no individual has absolute immunity from involvement with IPV, certain groups are at greater risk for IPV victimization or perpetration. Some risk factors, such as childhood physical or sexual victimization, increase the likelihood for both IPV victimization and perpetration.
        </p>
        <p>
         Contributing risk factors, while associated with a greater likelihood of IPV victimization or perpetration, are not themselves causes of IPV [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. According to an ecological model of IPV, a combination of individual, relationship, community, and societal factors contributes to the risk of being a victim or perpetrator of IPV, and these can interrelate in an intersectional way. Understanding these multilevel factors can help identify various points to target preventive interventions.

         The term "intimate partner violence" (IPV) describes actual or threatened psychological, physical, or sexual harm by a current or former partner or spouse. IPV can occur among people with any gender identity and sexual orientation and does not require sexual intimacy. (See

         Three main types of IPV are psychological, physical, and sexual. Psychological violence relates to threats of actions or coercive tactics, including stalking. Physical violence is the intentional use of physical force with the potential to cause harm, injury, disability, or death. Sexual violence includes use of force to compel a sexual act, a sexual act with a person who is unable to consent, or abusive sexual contact. (See
         <a class="local">

         Sexual and physical IPV assaults are greatly underreported. A United States survey found that 24 percent of females and 12 percent of males acknowledged a lifetime threatened or completed physical or sexual IPV. Worldwide, lifetime prevalence of physical or sexual IPV in women ranges from 15 to 75 percent. IPV was a factor in approximately 20 percent of United States homicides, with three-quarters of the victims being female. (See

         IPV often begins or escalates during pregnancy and pregnancy can result from reproductive coercion when IPV is already occurring. Other risk factors include being a young female, alcohol or drug use, being less educated, and family history or prior exposure to violence. (See
         <a class="local">

         IPV is associated with an increased incidence of medical problems and pregnancy complications, understood as biologic responses to toxic stress. IPV victims have significantly increased psychological illness, including major depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Additionally, IPV is associated with a variety of negative health behaviors, understood as maladaptive "coping mechanisms" for survival, including high-risk sexual behavior, substance use, eating disorders, and nonadherence to health recommendations.
