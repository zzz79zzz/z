The approach to acute knee pain in these patients and the evaluation of children with joint pain or swelling are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6514.html" rel="external">"Approach to acute knee pain and injury in children and skeletally immature adolescents"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6405.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the child with joint pain and/or swelling"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1234113799"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1234113807"><span class="h2">Chronic injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In children and skeletally immature adolescents, chronic injury can arise from any of the following situations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An acute injury that does not heal properly (eg, an anterior cruciate ligament tear that is not fully rehabilitated or in which surgical repair fails)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Insidious onset of pain without specific injury related to excessive activity that is beyond the body's ability to accommodate (eg, iliotibial band syndrome in a soccer player or runner)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1234113814"><span class="h2">Chronic pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pain lasting longer than six weeks is typically characterized as chronic. While the six-week threshold is arbitrary, it can be useful since many self-limited acute injuries (contusions) heal by the end of six weeks with appropriate rest. Among active children and skeletally immature adolescents, chronic pain often has a progressive pattern. As an example, a child with Osgood-Schlatter disease may initially only have pain over the tibial tuberosity at the end of a basketball practice but may progress over weeks to the point where pain develops after five minutes of playing or even at rest. </p><p>Chronic pain should also alert the clinician to the possibility of a systemic disease (eg, reactive arthritis, toxic synovitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, arthritis as part of a rheumatologic disease, or malignancy) that is presenting as bone or joint pain  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57734" href="/z/d/graphic/57734.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">HISTORY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the evaluation of a child or skeletally immature adolescent with knee pain or injury, it is important to characterize the pain, identify other musculoskeletal symptoms, identify the underlying etiology, determine if systemic symptoms are present, and assess for prior knee injury or surgery [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1234114651"><span class="h2">Pain description</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A detailed description of the pain is essential at making the correct diagnosis. The following questions help to characterize the pain:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>How long have you had knee pain?</strong> – Chronic pain is defined by a duration of six weeks or longer. The evaluation of acute complaints is discussed separately. (See <a class="local">'Definitions'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6514.html" rel="external">"Approach to acute knee pain and injury in children and skeletally immature adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Was there a clear onset of pain?</strong> – A clear onset of pain suggests an acute injury that is persisting while progressively worsening pain with insidious onset is more typical of an overuse injury or joint pain as a manifestation of systemic illness.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, in the history of the progressively worsening pain it is useful to ask if there was a specific change in training, such as the intensity, duration or frequency of training, or equipment, such as a new pair of shoe or running on a new surface or the addition of running stairs. This can be considered a clear onset of symptoms. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6405.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the child with joint pain and/or swelling", section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Where is the pain located?</strong> – The location of the pain often correlates with the specific knee structures that are damaged and helps to narrow the differential diagnosis. Chronic knee injuries often involve only one knee while systemic disease frequently presents with bilateral knee and pain in other joints. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic approach'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6405.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the child with joint pain and/or swelling", section on 'History'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>How severe is the pain?</strong> – Patients should be asked to rate their pain using any one of the age-appropriate validated pain scores. Pain out of proportion to what would be expected for the injury may indicate significant systemic illness or a chronic pain syndrome. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6254.html" rel="external">"Pain in children: Approach to pain assessment and overview of management principles", section on 'Severity assessment'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Is the pain associated with swelling in the knee? </strong>– Constant, intermittent, or activity-related swelling may be helpful in assessing for structural versus systemic etiologies. Intermittent or activity-related swelling suggests structural conditions (eg, osteochondritis dissecans), while persistent swelling is more characteristic of underlying systemic diseases (eg, juvenile idiopathic arthritis).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Do you have any hip pain or mechanical sensations? </strong>– An abnormal gait to avoid hip internal rotation can be the source of knee pain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Do you have back pain?</strong> <strong>Is there any associated numbness, tingling, or weakness in your leg?</strong> – The dermatomes of L3-S2 include the knee (L3-medial, L4- anterior, L5-lateral, S1-2- posterior). Rarely, in children and adolescents, knee pain may arise from lesions affecting these nerve roots.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Do you have any other lower extremity injuries with pain on the same or opposite side?</strong> – Knee pain may arise from alterations in gait due to injuries in other joints.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Does the pain only occur with specific activities?</strong> – Specific activities that trigger pain can be helpful in diagnosing knee pathology. As an example, pain with prolonged sitting or when climbing or descending stairs is a classic part of the history of patellofemoral pain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>How much does this pain limit activities?</strong> – This can sometimes be a more objective measure of the severity of pain in pediatric patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Does the pain occur at night?</strong> – Unilateral pain that awakens the patient from sleep can suggest a significant pathologic process, such as bone tumors or leukemia; conditions like tendinitis or patellofemoral pain rarely cause night pain. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6405.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the child with joint pain and/or swelling", section on 'Severity'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">By contrast, bilateral nocturnal pain that is paroxysmal, localized deep in the calf or thigh, described as crampy, and resolves by the morning in school-age and younger children is consistent with growing pains. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6431.html" rel="external">"Growing pains", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>What interventions have you tried for pain? Have they helped?</strong> – Pain that is improved with icing and rest, for example, is not likely to be due to a systemic process such as arthritis, infection or malignancy. Furthermore, response or lack of improvement to specific measures, such as a brace or rehabilitation exercises, can provide clues to the diagnosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>What makes the pain worse?</strong> – Specific movements or activities that exacerbate the pain can also help narrow the possible diagnoses and suggest activities to be avoided, such as what is meant by relative rest in prescribing a treatment plan.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1234114658"><span class="h2">Other musculoskeletal symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients who recall a specific event that was followed by pain, the clinician should determine the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mechanism of injury</strong> – For example, was it triggered by a specific event, or did it arise after repetitive activity? If a specific event was involved, are there videotapes of it or eyewitnesses who can describe what happened? Alternatively, the clinician can ask the patient to act out the injury to the extent that they can, in the office. For example, "Show me exactly what position you were in when it happened." If repetitive activity was involved, what was the activity? What are the training demands of the activity? Was the patient using the appropriate equipment and sports technique?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mechanical symptoms (eg, locking, popping, or catching)</strong> – Locking of the knee suggests a mechanical block, as might occur with osteochondritis dissecans, a meniscal tear, or loose piece of cartilage. Note that it is important to differentiate a true mechanical block from the feeling that the knee is stuck or might pop if moved. Patients with a mechanical block often say they can unlock the knee by massaging or moving it in a certain manner.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If the patient describes hearing an audible pop at the initial injury, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or other ligament tear is a concern. Teenagers and young adults who sustain an acute meniscal tear may also experience an audible pop at the time of injury.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Instability (eg, "giving way") or functional limitation</strong> – It is important to distinguish true mechanical instability from pain-mediated instability. True instability occurs when the knee subluxes or "gives way" during a routine activity (eg, climbing stairs, walking) without pain preceding the episode. Such instability occurs with ligament tears and patellar instability and is more likely to be accompanied by immediate pain, disability, falling to the ground, and swelling. Pain-mediated instability occurs when knee or other lower extremity pain inhibits motor nerves controlling the quadriceps muscles causing the knee to buckle. Typically, these patients do not fall to the ground, do not have subsequent swelling, and can ambulate afterward. This can occur with any number of painful conditions.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1234114665"><span class="h2">Systemic symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with musculoskeletal pain should be asked whether constitutional symptoms, such as fevers, chills, weight loss, poor growth, fatigue, or rash, accompany the pain. The presence of such symptoms suggests a systemic illness, and further investigation for infectious, rheumatologic, or neoplastic causes may be necessary. Knee pain that awakens the patient at night raises the concern for an infiltrative process (eg, a bone tumor or leukemia). </p><p>The clinician should also determine whether there is a history of tick bite or annular rash in regions endemic for Lyme disease and ask about morning stiffness as a possible manifestation of pauciarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6405.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the child with joint pain and/or swelling", section on 'History'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1234114672"><span class="h2">Prior knee injury or surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most predictive risk factor for future knee injury is a history of prior injury. Patients should be queried regarding the timeline and treatment of any past lower extremity injuries and whether they were adequately rehabilitated. For example, ask the patient if they returned to 100 percent of function. Often, "new" injuries turn out to be complications of old injuries or incompletely rehabilitated injuries (eg, patellofemoral pain from changes in running gait caused by plantar fasciitis).</p><p>Surgery is another important risk factor for evaluating knee pain. Surgical repairs can fail, leading to symptoms from recurrent injury. In addition, children and adolescents who undergo surgery that successfully restores function inevitably experience some degree of deconditioning that predisposes to new overuse injuries. This risk is greatest in those patients who undergo suboptimal rehabilitation or attempt to return to activities too quickly. In our opinion, these patients should be reevaluated first by the surgeon who did the procedure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1673393"><span class="h2">Activity level</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In order to assess the patient's stress to their knee, a careful history of their sports and physical activity is extremely important as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In which sports or activities are they participating?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What position do they play?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>How frequently are they participating in their sport (in school and outside of school)?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>How many practices per week are they participating in?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>How many games do they have per week?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Are they playing tournaments on the weekend?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is there a change in the level of activity associated with the onset of the knee pain?</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The physical examination should determine the presence of any findings of systemic disease as follows (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6405.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the child with joint pain and/or swelling", section on 'Physical examination'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ill appearance</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pallor</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Weight loss or change in the growth curve</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fever</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rash</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Erythema and/or warmth over the knee</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tenderness or swelling in other joints or over other regions of the body</p><p></p><p>Further evaluation of pediatric patients with joint pain and swelling and findings of systemic disease are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6405.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the child with joint pain and/or swelling", section on 'Diagnostic studies'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, all children and skeletally immature adolescents with chronic knee pain warrant evaluation of the hip for findings of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) or avascular necrosis (Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease), such as pain and limited range of motion at the hip. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6554.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2856.html" rel="external">"Approach to hip pain in childhood", section on 'Legg-Calvé-Perthes and secondary avascular necrosis'</a>.)</p><p>In pediatric patients <strong>without</strong> signs of systemic disease or hip pathology, a careful knee examination guided by history with attention to lower extremity malalignment, the site of greatest tenderness, patellar tracking, evidence of muscle inflexibility, inadequate strength, poor proprioception, and close evaluation of gait can frequently identify the underlying cause. Special tests are selected based upon the most likely diagnostic category, which is based in turn upon the history, including the mechanism of any injury and the location of pain. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/88813.html" rel="external">"Physical examination of the knee"</a>.)</p><p>The physical examination techniques used to diagnose ligamentous and meniscal injuries in patients with chronic knee pain are the same as those for acute injuries (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/88813.html" rel="external">"Physical examination of the knee", section on 'Assessing joint stability'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/88813.html" rel="external">"Physical examination of the knee", section on 'Tests for meniscal tear'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>McMurray, modified McMurray, and bounce home test to evaluate the menisci  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91072" href="/z/d/graphic/91072.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Valgus stress test to evaluate the medial collateral ligament (MCL)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89745" href="/z/d/graphic/89745.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Varus stress test to evaluate the lateral collateral ligament (LCL)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89745" href="/z/d/graphic/89745.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anterior drawer  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73963" href="/z/d/graphic/73963.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>), Lachman  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65914" href="/z/d/graphic/65914.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>), and pivot shift test  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52976" href="/z/d/graphic/52976.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) to evaluate the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Posterior drawer and posterior sag test to evaluate the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74928" href="/z/d/graphic/74928.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>)</p><p></p><p>Guidance about which examination techniques are most useful for diagnosing specific chronic conditions is provided in the text below and a topic devoted to the knee examination.

In many pediatric patients, the diagnosis of chronic knee pain from overuse or trauma can be determined by a skillful history and physical examination.

Patients with PFP often complain of pain when ascending or descending stairs, running, or squatting, and pain and stiffness when rising from the seated position (the "theater" or "movie-goer" sign). The onset of PFP symptoms often follows a change in training, such as increased running mileage or pace, jumping activities, adding steps to the workout, squats, longer workouts, or new training techniques.

If an athlete is participating in a sport that has a side preference (eg, basketball players often jump off one leg when shooting a layup or fencers will have more problems on the leg that they lunge onto), it would be logical to have unilateral pain. If they are in sports such as running or cycling, that stress the knee symmetrically, then unilateral symptoms should prompt a more detailed exam of the entire kinetic chain to identify any contributing asymmetries.</p><p>Pain is often poorly localized "under" or "around" the patella, and is usually described as "achy" but may be "sharp." Some patients may describe the affected knee as "giving way" or "buckling." In PFP, this perceived instability may be due to pain inhibiting proper contraction of the quadriceps, but it must be distinguished from instability arising from a patellar dislocation or subluxation, or from ligamentous injury of the knee. Although some patients may describe a "catching" sensation under the patella, true locking of the knee or effusion are signs of intraarticular pathology NOT explained by the diagnosis of PFP.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13810.html" rel="external">"Hamstring muscle and tendon injuries"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Popliteus tendinitis</strong> – Patients with popliteus tendinitis often report walking or running down steep hills. Tendinitis can usually be diagnosed clinically. Important findings include tenderness of the tendon and increased pain with resisted activity. Patients with popliteus tendinitis have tenderness to palpation in the region of the posterior inferior lateral femoral condyle that increases with resisted internal rotation of the tibia in the posterior lateral knee. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90232.html" rel="external">"Calf injuries not involving the Achilles tendon", section on 'Popliteus tendinopathy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Referred hip pain</strong> – Referred hip pain can be also be posterior. Knee examination is normal, but the hip examination is abnormal and reflects the underlying condition. (See <a class="local">'Referred hip pain'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Posterior cruciate ligament injury</strong> – Chronic posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury is rare in children. Symptoms include posterolateral pain and a feeling of instability when fully extending the knee. On physical examination, patients will display a positive posterior drawer test and/or posterior sag test. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/88813.html" rel="external">"Physical examination of the knee", section on 'Tests for PCL injury and posterior stability'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Deep venous thrombosis</strong> – Deep venous thrombosis of the popliteal vein occurs rarely in normal healthy children. When present, the physical examination findings may include warmth, swelling, redness, a palpable cord, and tenderness on compression of the site. Laboratory studies, including a D-dimer and imaging (eg, ultrasound) are necessary to make the diagnosis. The pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of deep vein thrombosis in children are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5918.html" rel="external">"Venous thrombosis and thromboembolism (VTE) in children: Risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5916.html" rel="external">"Venous thrombosis and thromboembolism (VTE) in children: Treatment, prevention, and outcome"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Referred back pain</strong> – S1 radiculopathy is a rare cause of posterior knee pain in children and adolescents. The pain radiates down the posterior aspect of the leg into the foot from the back. On examination, weakness of plantar flexion (gastrocnemius muscle) is specific. There may also be weakness of leg extension (gluteus maximus) and toe flexion. Sensation is generally reduced on the posterior aspect of the leg and the lateral edge of the foot. Ankle reflex loss is typical. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5262.html" rel="external">"Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'S1 radiculopathy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Because radiculopathy is rare in children and adolescents, plain radiographs and additional imaging, typically magnetic resonance imaging are indicated to identify the cause. Depending upon the findings consultation with a pediatric neurologist or neurosurgeon is warranted.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Urgent neuroimaging and consultation with a pediatric neurosurgeon should be performed in patients with any of the following findings:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Acute radiculopathy with progressive neurologic deficits</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Radiculopathy with urinary retention, saddle anesthesia, or bilateral neurologic symptoms or signs</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Suspected neoplasm</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Suspected epidural abscess</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bone tumors</strong> – Tumors of the bone or bone marrow (eg, primary malignant, metastatic, or benign bone tumors and leukemias) can rarely cause posterior pain and swelling alone, depending upon the location and size of the tumor. (See <a class="local">'Tumors (malignant and benign)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H106515711"><span class="h1">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, "The Basics" and "Beyond the Basics." The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on "patient info" and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Basics topics (see  <a class="medical medical_basics" href="/z/d/html/83528.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Meniscal tear (The Basics)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_basics" href="/z/d/html/85878.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Osgood-Schlatter disease (The Basics)"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10071655"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Definitions</strong> – For this topic, chronic knee pain is pain occurring during or after specific activities that has persisted for approximately six weeks or longer. In many patients, the diagnosis of chronic knee pain from overuse or trauma can be determined by the history and physical examination. (See <a class="local">'History'</a> above and <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> – The location of pain and tenderness provides a useful means of narrowing the possible causes and determining which provocative diagnostic maneuvers should be performed. The differential diagnosis organized by location of pain and by distinguishing features of conditions associated with diffuse or localized anterior knee pain are provided in the tables  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef101160" href="/z/d/graphic/101160.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef101214" href="/z/d/graphic/101214.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See <a class="local">'Pain from overuse or trauma'</a> above and <a class="local">'Conditions by location of pain'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic imaging</strong> – Plain radiographs are recommended when there are mechanical symptoms of locking or catching, when an effusion is present, when the examiner is unable to reproduce the patient's chief knee complaints, and in patients who meet any of the Ottawa knee rules criteria. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Signs of possible dangerous causes</strong> – Chronic or acute knee pain in a child or skeletally immature adolescent <strong>without</strong> inciting trauma or a history of overuse is a "red flag" that a more extensive evaluation is required. This is especially so if the pain is associated with constitutional symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, chills, malaise, weight loss, or fatigue, or if the pain is severe enough to awaken the child from sleep. (See <a class="local">'Pain with systemic symptoms'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li class="breakAll">Bernhardt DT. Acute injuries of the knee.
