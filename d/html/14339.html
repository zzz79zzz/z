The etiology, evaluation, and treatment of speech and language disorders in children are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/616.html" rel="external">"Etiology of speech and language disorders in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/619.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and treatment of speech and language disorders in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19048028"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The development of communication and language skills is one of the most important tasks of early childhood. It is the key to early learning and social skills, and to helping young children regulate their own behavior.</p><p>Primary care providers will see many infants and preschool-age children whose early expressive language development and communication skills do not appear to be progressing as expected ("late talkers"). Receptive language delays often coexist with expressive delays but may not be suspected by the clinician or caregivers until the child is older. (See <a class="local">'Prevalence'</a> below and <a class="local">'Cautions'</a> below.)</p><p>Some children with expressive language delay "catch up" during the preschool years ("late bloomers"), whereas others have persistent delay (see <a class="local">'Natural history'</a> below). Early evaluation can help to correctly identify late-talking children who will benefit from intervention and/or additional evaluation. The developmental, psychosocial, and family histories are particularly important. Most children with language delays have no associated medical or physical findings, but the absence of such findings should not delay referral for functional evaluation of suspected delay. (See <a class="local">'Primary care evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>There is no universally accepted definition of "delay" in developmental conditions, and different definitions may be used for research and treatment purposes (see <a class="local">'Definitions'</a> below). Specific program eligibility requirements should not discourage clinicians from identifying children with delays, although they may affect how information about such conditions is communicated to caregivers. Even if the child does not qualify for services, awareness of a delay can lead to closer monitoring and provision of information to caregivers about ways to promote early language skills (see <a class="local">'Prevention'</a> below). All caregivers of late-talking children benefit from guidance and close monitoring of their child's early communication development. The provision of appropriate supportive services and accommodations can help children with language delay achieve their full developmental and academic potential. (See <a class="local">'Management'</a> below and <a class="local">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19048035"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Speech</strong> – The ability to produce vocal sounds.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Expressive language</strong> – The ability to produce or use language.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Receptive language</strong> – The ability to understand language.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gestural communication</strong> – The ability to communicate nonverbally (eg, by pointing; nodding or shaking the head; using and interpreting facial expressions; using and coordinating eye contact). Gestural communication is necessary for successful interpersonal interactions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">There is growing awareness of the importance of the development of nonverbal communication in the language and social development of young children. Absence of or delay in the development of nonverbal communication skills impacts the quality of overall communication development and can be a marker for more global delays and or atypical development, such as autism spectrum disorder [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/627.html" rel="external">"Autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents: Clinical features", section on 'Impaired social communication and interaction'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Language delay</strong> – There is no universally accepted definition of "delay" in developmental conditions. For research purposes, children often are considered delayed if their performance on a standardized assessment of language is at least one standard deviation (SD) below the mean for age.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The clinical threshold for concern (ie, "red flag") generally is the age at which 90 percent of typically developing children have attained a clinically predictive skill (eg, 12 months for the use of "mama," "dada," or "papa" to call a parent). Red flags for language delay are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60203" href="/d/graphic/60203.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Treatment programs, such as early intervention (for children birth to 36 months), and early childhood special education provided through the public school system (for children ≥3 years), may have more stringent eligibility criteria for children to qualify for services. The absence of a universal standard means that children may have a developmental condition without qualifying for services in some or even many communities or settings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Examples of criteria that may be used in different states, communities, or treatment programs include [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Scores of 1, 1.5, or even 2 SD below the mean for age.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A certain percentage (eg, 25 percent, 40 percent) of delay compared with chronologic age. The percentage delay = (1 - [DA/CA]) x 100 percent, where DA is the developmental age equivalent and CA is the chronologic age. As an example, an 18-month-old child who has language skills at a 12-month level is 33 percent delayed: [1 - (12/18)] x 100 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A specific amount of delay (eg, skills that are ≥1 year behind those expected for age).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19048044"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19048052"><span class="h2">Prevalence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Approximately 10 to 15 percent of two-year-old children have language delay, but only 4 to 5 percent remain delayed after three years [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Approximately 6 to 8 percent of school-age children have specific language impairments (SLIs) [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>].</p><p>These statistics indicate that a certain proportion of young children with language delay catch up during the preschool years but also that a certain proportion of school-age children with SLI were not identified before school entry.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19048059"><span class="h2">Risk factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Knowledge of risk factors for expressive language delay may improve surveillance and screening.</p><p>Risk factors for expressive language delay include [<a href="#rid5">5,8-17</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Poverty</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Low parental educational attainment (ie, parent did not graduate from high school)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Low birth weight or prematurity, including late-preterm (ie, 34 to 36 weeks) and early term gestations (ie, 37 to 38 weeks)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Family history of language delays, language disorders, or language-based learning disabilities (eg, dyslexia)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Screen time during first year of life</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Maternal depression</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Male sex</p><p></p><p>Males are somewhat more likely than females to have SLI at kindergarten entry (8 versus 6 percent of children, respectively) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In addition, conditions that are associated with language delay (eg, autism spectrum disorder [ASD], global developmental delay/intellectual disability) are more common in males than females [<a href="#rid18">18-20</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/595.html" rel="external">"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children and adolescents: Terminology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis", section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6189.html" rel="external">"Intellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>The identification of risk factors such as poverty, low parental educational attainment, and/or maternal depression may be helpful in addressing the global needs of the child and family, as well as the need for enrichment of the early learning environment (eg, through early intervention services). (See <a class="local">'Referral options'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19048066"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are two core aspects of diagnosis for children with expressive language delay: the functional level and the cause/etiology. It is important to consider both aspects because they may have implications for treatment and eligibility for services. Community and educational programs, such as early intervention or early childhood special education, provide services based upon a child's developmental level or degree of delay (see <a class="local">'Definitions'</a> above). They also provide services to children who have certain diagnoses (eg, Down syndrome, ASD).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19048073"><span class="h2">Developmental and behavioral conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Developmental and behavioral conditions that involve expressive language delay are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71932" href="/d/graphic/71932.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). These diagnoses are made on the basis of patterns of delay or behavior.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19048080"><span class="h2">Other diagnoses and contributing factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A large number of medical, neurologic, metabolic, genetic, and environmental conditions can cause or contribute to early language delays, particularly in the context of a more global developmental condition. Selected conditions that may cause or contribute to early expressive language delay are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50911" href="/d/graphic/50911.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). For most children with isolated expressive language delays, a specific etiology beyond socioeconomic risk factors, maturational issues, or family history may not be found.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19048087"><span class="h2">Invalid explanations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinicians should be wary of the rationalizations listed below as explanations for language delay in a young child [<a href="#rid4">4,21,22</a>]. Further evaluation or referral should not be delayed on the basis of these rationalizations.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>"He's a boy, and boys talk later than girls."</strong> A variant of this rationalization is: <strong>"His father and uncle didn't talk until they turned three, and they turned out fine."</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">This rationalization is invalid because speech and language milestones develop at a similar rate in males and females before three years of age. Males actually are at increased risk for developmental conditions associated with language delays compared with females, given the higher prevalence of ASD and global delays/cognitive impairments in males. Male family members with early language delays might have benefited from evaluation and intervention if they had been available at the time.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>"She is growing up in a bilingual home."</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Bilingual exposure and confusion about language generally does not explain a frank delay in language development in early childhood. When assessing the language skills of children who are exposed to two languages, clinicians should ask about the child's most complex skills in both languages. The amount and quality of exposure to each language may affect the rate of skill acquisition [<a href="#rid21">21,23,24</a>]. Additional information about language development in bilingual children is available through the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asha.org%2Fpublic%2Fspeech%2Fdevelopment%2FLearning-Two-Languages%2F&amp;token=TAUgS90n4YTckZTC6eK%2F%2B69avIOMPWXjnngQOOeJyK0INmkcIRKCOWH%2BPMe70tirDprYXMeSN%2FNPx3yllkBWbVDlkYFDHOrrbsRg865B4%2Fk%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=14339" target="_blank">American Speech-Language-Hearing Association</a> and the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fcd-us.org%2Fmultilingual-children-beyond-myths-and-toward-best-practices%2F&amp;token=4p75J68gH%2FhPUhgMTvpKTHmXEE6sffRLrf43M%2BipvIELVrdshO6Ce2i%2FikEhXgZd6iXtIfzdpDp%2B20V99AyEPh8xHPegbuytqam9m4duBhk%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=14339" target="_blank">Foundation for Child Development</a>.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>"His older brother talks for him."</strong> A variant of this rationalization is: <strong>"I meet all of his needs as his parent; he doesn't need to talk to get what he wants."</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">This rationalization is invalid because young children are naturally driven to communicate, not merely to get their needs met, but for social interaction, which typically developing children seek from the time they are infants. The absence of a drive to communicate and engage others is a red flag for developmental delays and/or conditions involving impairment in reciprocal social interaction (eg, ASD). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/627.html" rel="external">"Autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents: Clinical features", section on 'Impaired social communication and interaction'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>"He is not saying much, but he understands everything."</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">While this may indeed be the case, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for a receptive language delay in young children with expressive language delays. (See <a class="local">'Cautions'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>"He talks fine at home, but his teacher at child care says he doesn't talk at all there, even though he doesn't mind going and has been going there for six months."</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Before this explanation is accepted, selective mutism, an anxiety disorder, must be considered. Children with selective mutism speak only in familiar settings, often only with a few close family members. Although overall language development may be normal, children with selective mutism are difficult to assess. They require intervention/therapy to address anxiety, which impacts their social-emotional and overall development. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15926.html" rel="external">"Anxiety disorders in children and adolescents: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and course", section on 'Selective mutism'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/93408.html" rel="external">"Anxiety disorders in children and adolescents: Assessment and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15927.html" rel="external">"Psychotherapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If a child with selective mutism is spending a significant part of the day not speaking (eg, in a child care program or in school), the child may also be at risk for developing an expressive language delay due to limited language practice.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19048094"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children with expressive language delay may present with delayed language milestones or behavioral problems.</p><p>Normal language milestones are provided in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58598" href="/d/graphic/58598.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). Although there is no universally accepted definition for language delay, the clinical threshold for concern (ie, "red flag") generally is the age at which 90 percent of typically developing children have attained a clinically predictive skill (eg, 12 months for the use of "mama," "dada," or "papa" to call a parent). Red flags for language delay are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60203" href="/d/graphic/60203.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Additional evaluation and/or referral may be warranted for children with red flags for language delay. (See <a class="local">'Primary care evaluation'</a> below and <a class="local">'Approach to referral'</a> below.)</p><p>Children with language delays may present with behavioral issues [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>]. Caregivers may not recognize their child's language delay but generally are keenly aware of temper tantrums and other behavioral self-regulation difficulties. For this reason, the language development of toddlers and preschool children whose caregivers raise behavioral concerns should be monitored closely.</p><p>Children with speech delays may present with associated concerns about feeding, chewing/swallowing, or prolonged drooling beyond infancy. Children with dysarthria associated with cerebral palsy or apraxia of speech may also have expressive language delays, but it may be difficult to assess their expressive language abilities due to difficulty understanding their speech articulation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/616.html" rel="external">"Etiology of speech and language disorders in children", section on 'Apraxia'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6167.html" rel="external">"Cerebral palsy: Classification and clinical features", section on 'Speech impairment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19048122"><span class="h1">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A significant percentage (as many as 60 percent) of children with isolated early expressive language delays appear to spontaneously "catch up" in their language milestones between age two and three years [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. However, early language delays may be an important marker for future language-based learning differences and difficulties, which may be accompanied by neuropsychiatric difficulties [<a href="#rid28">28-34</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/598.html" rel="external">"Reading difficulty in children: Normal reading development and etiology of reading difficulty", section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19048129"><span class="h2">Cautions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is not possible to accurately predict, at the time of identification, which children with isolated expressive language delays will catch up without special services and which will have persistent language problems [<a href="#rid4">4,21,27</a>]. Historically, the majority of children with language delays and disorders have not been identified before school entry [<a href="#rid35">35-37</a>].</p><p>Accurate prediction of persistent language difficulties is hampered by the difficulty in identifying coexistent receptive language delay, which is associated with increased risk of persistent language problems (see <a class="local">'Prognosis'</a> below). Receptive language delay may not be suspected by the clinician (or caregiver). Primary care clinicians may not objectively screen for receptive language skills, which are difficult to assess subjectively.

Early and appropriate intervention for expressive language delay can help children achieve their full developmental and academic potential. (See <a class="local">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There is no universally accepted definition of "delay" in developmental conditions. The clinical threshold for concern generally is the age at which 90 percent of typically developing children have attained a clinically predictive skill  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60203" href="/d/graphic/60203.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Risk factors for expressive language delay include poverty; parents who did not graduate from high school; prematurity or low birth weight, including late-preterm (ie, 34 to 36 weeks) and early term gestations (ie, 37 to 38 weeks); family history of language delays, language disorders, or language-based learning disabilities; maternal depression; and male sex. (See <a class="local">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Expressive language delay has a wide range of causes and contributing factors  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71932" href="/d/graphic/71932.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50911" href="/d/graphic/50911.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See <a class="local">'Developmental and behavioral conditions'</a> above and <a class="local">'Other diagnoses and contributing factors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Explanations for expressive language delay that should <strong>not</strong> allay concern or delay evaluation/intervention include male sex; bilingual household; older siblings; apparent normal receptive language skills; or use of expressive language in the home, but not at child care. (See <a class="local">'Invalid explanations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>As many as 60 percent<strong> </strong>of children with isolated early expressive language delays appear to spontaneously "catch up" in their language milestones between age two and three years. However, early language delays may be an important marker for future language-based learning differences and difficulties. It is not possible to accurately predict, at the time of identification, which children will catch up without special services and which will have persistent language problems. (See <a class="local">'Natural history'</a> above and <a class="local">'Cautions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Surveillance and screening for language delay should occur as part of routine well-child care. (See <a class="local">'Surveillance'</a> above and <a class="local">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The history and physical examination of the child with suspected language delay should focus on identification of risk factors, contributing factors, and disorders that are associated with language delay  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71932" href="/d/graphic/71932.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50911" href="/d/graphic/50911.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See <a class="local">'History'</a> above and <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Young children with expressive language delay should be referred to an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing evaluation. The laboratory evaluation should include a complete blood count and blood lead level. Genetic testing may be warranted in children who have language delay as part of a more general neurodevelopmental condition. (See <a class="local">'Hearing test'</a> above and <a class="local">'Laboratory tests'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The differential diagnosis of expressive language delay includes isolated language delay; language delay as part of a more general developmental condition; hearing impairment; and a poor linguistic environment. These disorders usually can be distinguished through developmental and behavioral history and physical examination. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The indications for referral to an early intervention program, speech and language therapist, medical specialist, or general support services depend upon the mode of identification and the level of concern of the clinician and/or caregivers. Children with suspected language delay who are identified through surveillance or screening should be promptly referred for evaluation and intervention. Referral for further screening and/or evaluation of language development is also warranted if the caregiver is concerned about language delay (even if the clinician is not). Communication skills and general development should be closely monitored if the clinician is uncertain of whether the child has an expressive language delay or if the clinician is concerned about language delay but the caregiver is not. (See <a class="local">'Approach to referral'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Caregivers can enhance or promote their child's language development by reading aloud to the child and encouraging the child to comment on pictures or the story; narrating daily activities; listening to the child and responding to their conversational lead; limiting television and media exposure; asking a lot of questions; and accompanying words with gestures to make them more understandable.
