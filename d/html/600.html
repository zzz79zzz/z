         Reading is critical to the academic, economic, and social success of children [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. However, many children complete schooling without achieving more than basic literacy [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Pediatric clinicians are well positioned to identify children at risk for reading difficulties and children who have unexpected difficulties in learning to read. Early identification and timely intervention for such children improve long-term outcome. Clinicians who use standardized, validated screens will identify at-risk children more accurately than those who rely solely on clinical judgment [
         <a href="#rid3">

         The clinical features and evaluation of reading difficulty in children will be reviewed here. Normal reading development and the epidemiology, etiology, and treatment of reading difficulty are discussed separately. (See

         A variety of terms are used to describe reading problems. Different terms may be used in different settings and by different groups (eg, educators, health care providers). Definitions for the terms that are used in this topic review are provided below. A detailed discussion of terminology is provided separately. (See

         "Reading difficulty" is defined from a normative perspective (ie, how a child performs in reading compared with peers or educational expectations) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Reading difficulty has a number of causes, including reading disability, borderline to low average cognitive abilities (ie, intelligence quotient [IQ] between 70 and 89), language disorders, intellectual disorder, and inadequate prereading stimulation or instruction.

         Reading disability is best defined as "an unexpected difficulty in learning how to read despite adequate intelligence, instruction, and motivation" [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The terms "dyslexia," "developmental dyslexia," "specific learning disorder with impairment in reading," "specific reading disability," and "reading disorder" also are used to describe this condition [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ], although a more specific definition for "dyslexia" is provided below.

         </span>
         The term "dyslexia" is used as a synonym for specific reading disability [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. The International Dyslexia Association defines dyslexia as follows [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]:
        </p>
        <p>
         "Dyslexia is a specific learning disability that is neurologic in origin. It is characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities. These difficulties typically result from a deficit in the phonologic component of language that is often unexpected in relation to other cognitive abilities and the provision of effective classroom instruction. Secondary consequences may include problems in reading comprehension and reduced reading experience that can impede the growth of vocabulary and background knowledge."
        </p>
        <p>
         This definition also has been adopted by the United States National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development. In the text that follows, "reading disability" is used synonymously with "dyslexia."

         Children who are at risk for reading difficulty/disability or who have reading difficulty/disability may present to medical attention with a variety of concerns, depending upon the age of the child and their ability to compensate for the reading problem. Early diagnosis and intervention are critical to improving outcome; three-quarters of children who have poor reading skills in third grade continue to have reading problems in high school and beyond [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Although symptoms of reading difficulty may be present in kindergarten, reading disability is seldom diagnosed before formal reading instruction begins (typically at the end of kindergarten or beginning of first grade) [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. When reading disability occurs in children with high intelligence quotient (IQ), it may not be apparent until fourth grade or even later.

          Kindergarten and first grade
         </strong>
         – The typical presentation of reading disability is that of a late-talking child who did not learn letters in kindergarten and who, by the middle to end of first grade, cannot read words and has difficulty spelling [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. The ability to name letters by the end of kindergarten is a strong predictor of reading ability in first grade [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,18,21,22
         </a>
         ].

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         During the early elementary school years, children with reading disability have difficulties with spelling and reading aloud; they read slowly, guessing at or sounding out words they do not know, and making many errors  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69787" href="/z/d/graphic/69787.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid5">
          5,23
         </a>
         ]. They do relatively poorly on tests that ask them to name a pictured item and relatively well on tests that ask them to point to the picture of the spoken word [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Higher-level cognitive functions that are not affected by reading disability and in which the child may have relatively strong skills include oral vocabulary, comprehension of stories that are heard, curiosity, imagination, understanding of new concepts, and ability to figure things out [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Children who have difficulty learning to read may avoid reading [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,24
         </a>
         ]. With less reading practice, they are exposed to fewer words and do not add new words to their sight-word lexicons at the same rate as their normally reading peers [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23,25
         </a>
         ]. If they do not receive adequate remediation, they read less and learn less from reading than do their schoolmates [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,23
         </a>

          Second grade and older
         </strong>
         – As school progresses, children with reading disability may present with a decline in school performance or difficulty keeping up. They may dislike school and develop somatic complaints (eg, abdominal pain, headache) [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. At this stage of education, the focus is on "reading to learn rather than learning to read." Difficulty with word recognition slows the learning process and takes up cognitive resources that are necessary for comprehension [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,27
         </a>
         ].

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Reading disability should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all children who present with learning problems or a complaint that the child is not doing well in school [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Caregivers and teachers may not realize that the decline in school performance is related to reading difficulty; they may attribute it to "lack of motivation" [

         Children with reading disability in the second grade and beyond may have particular difficulty learning spelling strategies (eg, prefixes, suffixes, root words), learning a second language, answering questions on multiple-choice tests, and solving word problems in math  (

         Most of these conditions can be differentiated from reading disability through history, physical examination, evaluation of hearing and vision, and psychoeducational testing. Others may require additional testing (eg, genetic studies, electroencephalogram) if clinically indicated. Reading disability is distinguished from other types of learning disorder by its circumscribed nature (intelligence and oral comprehension are not affected). The response to intervention is sometimes used to distinguish primary reading disability from reading difficulty caused by lack of exposure to reading or inadequate instruction [

         Although the formal assessment of children with reading difficulties most often occurs within the educational system, the most effective time for remediation of at-risk children occurs prior to their entry into school.

          Screening for reading difficulty
         </strong>
         – Primary care clinicians can screen for reading difficulty in the office by listening to the child read aloud from an appropriate reader (keeping a selection of primer books in the office is helpful in this regard) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Oral reading is a sensitive measure of reading accuracy, and more importantly, reading fluency [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Validated and easy-to-use screening tools that can be used in the primary care setting also are available for school-age children  (

         Examination – During the examination, the clinician can observe how the child follows commands and can judge the quantity and quality of expressive language. The physical examination of the child with reading difficulty is usually normal. However, it is important to look for signs of medical, neurologic, or genetic problems that may contribute to the reading difficulty as well as features of coexisting conditions, such as cutaneous findings or mild dysmorphic features  (

         Ancillary evaluation – Children with reading difficulty should be screened for hearing and vision problems. Hearing or vision problems, rather than reading disability, may be the underlying problem or may exist along with a reading problem (see
         <a class="local">
          'Differential diagnosis'

         Primary care clinicians can be important advocates for children with reading difficulty. They can assist caregivers with the interpretation of school evaluations, psychological evaluation reports, and negotiation of the special education system. They also can help caregivers understand the evidence base that supports (or fails to support) various interventions [

         Clinicians should work with the child's teacher and caregivers to review results of school testing and ensure the child receives additional testing, if appropriate. Having the child's caregiver(s) sign a form that authorizes the school to release information to the clinician and the clinician to release information to the school facilitates transmission of information. Many schools regularly test children with standardized achievement tests (eg, the California Achievement Tests, the Metropolitan Achievement Tests). Standardized achievement tests provide a profile of academic achievement within various subject areas. Younger children are tested on prereading skills, whereas high school students are tested on study skills and use of reference materials. These tests are designed to identify children who need further evaluation; they are not diagnostic instruments for learning disorder or reading disability.

        <p>
         Children for whom a diagnosis of reading disability is being considered should undergo comprehensive educational evaluation. Educational testing may include reading assessment or more comprehensive testing that includes measures of intelligence and academic achievement. (See

         We generally refer children with reading difficulty for multidisciplinary evaluation through their public school system. This evaluation provides information about the child's reading skills, executive function skills, verbal intelligence quotient (IQ), etc. In the United States, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires public schools to provide free assessment and intervention. Schools that use a "responsiveness to intervention" model generally provide intervention before comprehensive testing. Schools that use a discrepancy model generally test before providing services. These issues are discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/626.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Referral to a specialist (eg, developmental-behavioral pediatrician, neurologist, child psychiatrist, educational psychologist, neuropsychologist) may be warranted if the family is not satisfied with the results of the evaluation through the school system, or the clinician is concerned that the child has learning or reading problems that were not detected by the school evaluation. However, these evaluations may not be covered by insurance and can be expensive. Involvement of an educational or legal advocate may be necessary to ensure that appropriate evaluation and service are provided. The primary care clinician can provide advocacy and support to the family in these circumstances. (See

         <a href="#rid7">
          7,12

The information below is provided to help the clinician understand the components of the evaluation so that they can help the family interpret test results and determine whether additional testing is necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
         A number of standardized tests may be used  (

          table 2
         </a>
         ). An appropriate battery of tests for the early recognition of reading problems includes tests of phonology, letter names and sounds, expressive vocabulary, working memory (memory span), print conventions (eg, book orientation, print directionality, concepts of upper- and lowercase letters, punctuation), and listening comprehension [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13,63
         </a>
         ]. Each of these areas also should be evaluated in children tested beyond first grade [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Once children have begun to learn to read (around the second half of first grade), measures of decoding ability and fluency are better predictors of reading disability than measures of phonemic awareness and rapid naming [

          23

         <a href="#rid13">
          13

          23,70,71

         Tests of intelligence (ie, IQ tests) are relatively poor predictors of reading difficulty or response to reading interventions, and IQ testing is only a component of the initial evaluation of the child with reading difficulty [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. The 2004 amendments to IDEA do not allow states to require the use of IQ tests to identify children for special education services. Nonetheless, intelligence testing can contribute to a comprehensive evaluation since cognitive factors other than phonologic processing influence reading comprehension [

         Reading disability is distinguished from other disorders that include reading difficulty as a prominent feature by the circumscribed nature of the phonologic deficit [

         The "responsiveness to intervention" (RTI) model is a school-based educational strategy that emphasizes intervention over diagnosis. The RTI model is a move away from the traditional "test to diagnose" model (which has been used to limit eligibility for school-based special services to children with a defined discrepancy between ability and intelligence quotient [IQ]). The 2004 Amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act require states to permit school districts to use RTI as a means to identify children with reading disability [
         <a href="#rid72">
          72
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A fundamental tenet of the RTI approach is that individuals "should not be identified as learning disabled until a proper attempt at instruction has been made" [
         <a href="#rid73">
          73
         </a>
         ]. The RTI model takes into consideration the dimensional nature of reading disability, providing different levels of intervention to children with different abilities (eg, isolated difficulty with word recognition, isolated difficulty with language comprehension, or difficulty with both word recognition and language comprehension).
        </p>
        <p>
         RTI uses screening to identify children who are "at risk" for reading difficulties. These children receive empirically supported treatment in reading; their progress is monitored regularly [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. These changes most often consist of reading specialists who provide reading support to students in kindergarten through fifth grade who need supplementary help with reading in addition to their regular classroom reading instruction. The reading specialists work with small groups of children, early literacy groups, and individual students. They also go into classrooms to help with reading-related activities. Children who receive these services are not yet on an individualized education plan. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/614.html" rel="external">
          "Specific learning disorders in children: Educational management", section on 'Response to intervention services'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Children who respond to this intervention continue to be monitored. Those who fail to respond receive more intensive levels of service and/or undergo evaluation for learning disorder [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29,74,75
         </a>
         ]. This evaluation can be requested earlier in the process if a diagnosis of reading disability is suspected and more intensive services are required. Borderline and low average cognitive abilities (ie, IQ between 70 and 89) are a common cause of RTI-unresponsive reading difficulty [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29,76
         </a>

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         A common error in the diagnosis of reading disability in older children and accomplished young adults is the failure to recognize or measure the lack of automaticity in reading [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Tests measuring word accuracy alone may be inadequate to diagnose reading disability in the high-achieving young adult (eg, at the college, graduate, or professional-school level). Timed measures of reading (eg, the Nelson-Denny Reading Test)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57171" href="/z/d/graphic/57171.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ) are necessary to make the diagnosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Fluency'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Another important pitfall in the diagnosis of reading disability is the failure to consider and address coexisting conditions, particularly those that may affect treatment (eg, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, school avoidance).

However, the primary care clinician plays an important role in early identification, evaluation for medical and psychosocial problems that affect reading ability, and provision of support to the child and family.
