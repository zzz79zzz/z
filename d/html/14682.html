The treatment combines the clinical application of mindfulness meditation with elements of cognitive-behavioral therapy and was first developed in 2000 as an outgrowth of mindfulness-based stress reduction [<a href="#rid3">3-6</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the use of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for the maintenance treatment of patients who have remitted from one or more episodes of unipolar major depression, as well as patients with acute episodes of unipolar major depression or with residual depressive symptoms. Choosing initial treatment for patients with unipolar depression, choosing treatment for resistant depression, and choosing maintenance treatment are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1725.html" rel="external">"Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14685.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Choosing treatment for resistant depression"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14674.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Continuation and maintenance treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2239853"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is indicated for:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Maintenance treatment of euthymic patients who previously suffered one or more episodes of unipolar major depression – Evidence suggesting that the therapy is effective is discussed elsewhere in this topic.

In addition, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy can be used for patients who did not respond to other psychotherapies (eg, cognitive-behavioral therapy).</p><p>The use of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for acute unipolar major depression, treatment-resistant depression, residual depressive symptoms, and/or maintenance treatment is consistent with practice guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>], Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments [<a href="#rid9">9</a>], Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists [<a href="#rid10">10</a>], and United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. In addition, many patients with depressive syndromes prefer a psychotherapy over an antidepressant drug.</p><p>Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy has also been used to treat other disorders [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], including adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/82780.html" rel="external">"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults: Psychotherapy", section on 'Mindfulness/mindfulness-based cognitive therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2240511"><span class="h2">Contraindications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Contraindications to mindfulness-based cognitive therapy include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Attention and concentration are so impaired that the patient cannot participate in the therapy – Mindfulness meditation requires a minimal level of intact cognition.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Active suicidal ideation and no other current maintenance treatment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Untreated trauma – Treating trauma requires patients to discuss the content of traumatic experiences.

Mindfulness is purposeful, nonjudgmental attention to the present moment, which is developed through meditation and other practices [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. CBT is based upon the theory that maladaptive thoughts and behaviors lead to psychopathology; the clinician addresses these dysfunctional cognitions and the patient tries to change the resulting problematic behaviors.</p><p>There are similarities between mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and CBT. Both treatments teach patients to identify triggers and symptoms of relapse, and to develop a behavior plan for avoiding relapse. Other similarities include directing patients to observe their thoughts and to rate activities for the pleasure and sense of mastery they provide.</p><p>Both treatments also address dysfunctional, ruminative, and depressogenic thoughts (eg, “I’m so weak” or “I’ve let others down”) that are induced by distressing events [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. During an acute episode of major depression, the patient experiences dysphoria and dysfunctional thoughts, along with other symptoms. Some studies suggest a connection develops between dysphoria and dysfunctional thoughts [<a href="#rid1">1,14</a>]. Following remission, something distressing may induce sadness, which may then reactivate self-criticism and other dysfunctional thoughts about inadequacy and failure, even if they are not relevant to the current situation. Patients may believe their remission is threatened and ask, “What’s wrong with me?” This rumination may lead to a cascade of thoughts and emotions that results in relapse of depression [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>].</p><p>One of the primary distinctions between mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and CBT is that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy includes meditation. Evidence that supports using the element of mindfulness meditation for patients with depressive disorders includes randomized trials:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A meta-analysis of five trials in 499 depressed patients compared mindfulness meditation alone with active interventions that controlled for nonspecific aspects such as the amount of time and attention provided to patients; each trial lasted eight weeks [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Three to six months after treatment, improvement of depression was greater in patients who received meditation than controls; however, the clinical benefit was small [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A subsequent eight-week trial compared mindfulness meditation alone with usual care (typically CBT) in primary care patients (n = 215) with clinically significant depressive symptoms; approximately two-thirds of the patients in each group also received antidepressants [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Improvement of depression in the two groups was comparable.</p><p></p><p>Another distinction between mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and CBT is that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy emphasizes accepting dysfunctional thoughts [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]. By contrast, CBT emphasizes changing dysfunctional thoughts by gathering evidence to dispute their veracity.</p><p>The hypothesized mechanism of action for mindfulness-based cognitive therapy includes the following elements [<a href="#rid4">4,5,19-21</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Observing and accepting dysfunctional thoughts rather than avoiding or suppressing them</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decentering – Viewing one’s thoughts as momentary mental events rather than facts that reflect reality or one’s self-worth</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decreasing rumination and worry</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cultivating self-compassion</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increasing one’s ability to tolerate dysphoria</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3324297606"><span class="h2">Neurobiology and neuropsychology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mindfulness meditation may possibly be associated with functional and structural brain changes in areas involved with attention, emotional regulation, and self-awareness [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. The clinical significance of these changes may be related to findings from other studies that suggest mindfulness meditation addresses biased attention to negative life events and impairments in emotion regulation, each of which are each putative risk factors for relapse of depressive episodes [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>].</p><p>Results from neurobiologic and neuropsychologic studies of mindfulness meditation include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Neuroimaging studies have found that meditation may possibly be associated with functional and structural brain changes [<a href="#rid22">22,23,26</a>]. As an example, a randomized trial compared mindfulness meditation training with relaxation training in 35 individuals who were unemployed and experiencing stress [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Both training programs were conducted at a residential center over three days. Magnetic resonance imaging found that resting state functional connectivity (communication) between the posterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (within the default mode network) increased with meditation training, but not relaxation training. In addition, the four-month follow-up assessment found that circulating levels of interleukin-6 (a biomarker of systemic inflammation) decreased in the group that received meditation training, and increased in the group that received relaxation training.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A systematic review of 23 controlled or case-controlled studies found that mindfulness meditation may enhance attention, memory, and some executive functions (such as response inhibition) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26977533"><span class="h1">ASSESSMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinician conducting mindfulness-based cognitive therapy individually interviews prospective patients to assess their suitability and explain what occurs during therapy [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Prior to this interview, the patient should read a handout  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61850" href="/z/d/graphic/61850.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) that explains that the therapy is an acute or maintenance treatment for depression, that homework is part of the treatment, and the difficulty of facing unpleasant emotions and thoughts.</p><p>In determining whether the patient is appropriate for mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, we confirm that the patient currently has an acute episode of unipolar major depression or residual symptoms, or a prior history of unipolar major depression. The Patient Health Questionnaire – Nine Item (PHQ-9) is a well-validated, widely used, self-report measure that can facilitate assessment of the patient’s current depressive status  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307" href="/z/d/graphic/59307.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid30">30,31</a>].</p><p>Suicidal patients without any other treatment are not appropriate for mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. In addition, it is critical to ascertain if attention and concentration are so impaired that the patient cannot participate in the therapy; cognition is assessed with both the interview (eg, “Is reading a problem? Can you concentrate for long periods of time? Can you follow the plot while watching a movie?”) and mental status examination.</p><p>In assessing the patient’s commitment to attend the weekly sessions and complete the daily homework, we discuss the value of persisting with treatment if results are not immediately apparent [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. An analogy can be offered that training one’s cognition is like training a muscle; it takes practice. Similarly, depressed patients often have to take an antidepressant medication for several weeks before they notice any benefit. The intention is to enable patients to estimate their readiness for mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, rather than to persuade them to enroll.</p><p>Logistical and practical aspects of treatment are also discussed during the individual interview, including the policy for tardiness, missed appointments, and payment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26977540"><span class="h1">DELIVERING MINDFULNESS-BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is a group program that combines training in mindfulness meditation with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques. The therapy is based upon a treatment manual (book) that describes how the therapy is structured and standardizes the procedures that are used [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Each of the eight sessions, as well as the homework to be completed in between sessions, is described in detail to help clinicians implement the treatment and maintain consistency. Handouts for each session are also included.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11079120"><span class="h2">Clinician training</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Two prerequisites for leading mindfulness-based cognitive therapy groups are that the clinician practices mindfulness meditation and attends training workshops  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef88085" href="/z/d/graphic/88085.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. This limits the treatment’s availability but is intended to control its quality; our experience is that the poorest outcomes seem to result from clinicians teaching mindfulness without practicing it themselves. During mindfulness meditation, patients encounter difficulties or confusion about what is expected. Clinicians who have not experienced these challenges appear less able to help patients manage them and continue treatment [<a href="#rid4">4,32</a>]. Training in mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is available online at the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mbct.com%2F&amp;token=5yLNPmHjkOhvnhOBCCm6DJVB8Larv2Wp9PczG2IxwdE%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=14682" target="_blank">MBCT website</a> or the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmindfulnoggin.com%2F&amp;token=t3sofjE%2FetwLaL8X0EvmPm%2FYofYk39froyHAvN%2BTwCzU9U9rg7kJqPNEqR8W3N9e&amp;TOPIC_ID=14682" target="_blank">MindfulNoggin website</a>.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H545232"><span class="h2">Combined with pharmacotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is compatible with acute or maintenance pharmacotherapy [<a href="#rid33">33-35</a>]. If mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and pharmacotherapy are provided by different clinicians, they need to work together as members of the same treatment team. This should include an agreement with each other and the patient that the two clinicians will share any concerns they have and not keep secrets. Patients commonly tell the clinician providing mindfulness-based cognitive therapy that they wish to discontinue their antidepressants; these patients should be redirected to the clinician prescribing the medication.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2077158"><span class="h2">Format</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is typically an in-person group program consisting of eight weekly sessions, each lasting two hours [<a href="#rid4">4,20,36</a>]. The group typically includes 8 to 15 patients.</p><p>The skills learned during the group sessions are practiced daily in between sessions for up to one hour. Each meditation session at home should last a minimum of approximately 30 minutes [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. When meditating at home, many patients listen to audio recording that are provided as part of their therapy materials; these recordings provide guidance during the meditation session. Patients who prefer to meditate without guidance can use a timer to monitor the length of the session.</p><p>Self-help approaches have been successfully utilized to increase access to the treatment. As an example, a 16-week randomized trial compared self-help mindfulness-based cognitive therapy with self-help CBT in 410 patients with mild to moderate unipolar depression [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. All patients received a self-help workbook with instructions on implementing the techniques of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy or CBT. In addition, patients received six sessions of support from a trained practitioner. A minority of patients were receiving pharmacotherapy. Online assessments found that improvement of depression was greater with self-help mindfulness-based cognitive therapy than self-help CBT, and the clinical benefit was small to moderate.</p><p>In addition, an online, web-based version of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy that delivers the content in eight sessions has been developed for patients with limited access to the treatment [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H259630147"><span class="h2">Specific therapeutic interventions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Each session focuses upon learning mindfulness meditation and CBT concepts and skills within a group setting.</p><p>Meditation and other practices are used to develop mindfulness, ie, purposeful attention to the present moment. Patients learn to observe their thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations with curiosity and without criticizing themselves or passing judgment upon what is observed [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Sitting meditation often focuses upon breathing and the sensations of respiration. Another mindfulness practice is the body scan, which involves paying attention to different parts of the body and noticing any tension, pain, bracing, or numbing. Mindfulness is also practiced while patients stretch or walk. Each of these practices typically last for 40 minutes, but others are shorter (eg, Three-Minute Coping Breathing Space, a technique for managing rumination about a problem, and the Three-Minute Breathing Space, a technique for connecting with the present moment). In addition, mindfulness is practiced with everyday activities such as eating. Towards the end of treatment (eg, during week 6), some programs also include a one day retreat that focuses upon practicing mindfulness in a sustained manner.</p><p>Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy makes use of CBT techniques that include prescribing homework and teaching patients about depressive symptoms, dysfunctional thoughts that frequently accompany depression, and how thoughts can affect the emotional impact of an event [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The clinician also describes the CBT model of thoughts and feelings (ABC: Antecedent, Behavior, and Consequence). In addition, patients create a behavior plan to prevent relapse, which includes a list of both activating, pleasurable activities and habitual dysfunctional thoughts, as well as a letter that the patient addresses to him/herself explaining the importance of staying active, reducing self-criticism, and giving oneself credit for successes.</p><p>The group format provides several therapeutic benefits, including mutual support and decreased isolation [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In addition, patients learn from each other as they discuss their struggles with depression and dysfunctional thoughts, and their difficulties with developing attentional focus.</p><p>The last session addresses termination. The clinician asks patients to speak candidly about what they have learned, encourages them to practice mindfulness after the group meetings stop, and helps patients say goodbye [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In addition, the clinician gives each patient a small object, such as a marble or small polished stone, to remind patients of the other group members and their shared emotional experience.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2077024"><span class="h2">Managing clinical deterioration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If depressive symptoms recur in remitted patients during mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, the clinician should assess the patient outside of the group setting to determine whether and how the treatment plan should be modified. If clinical deterioration occurs because the patient misses group sessions or does not complete homework assignments, the clinician and patient should decide whether the patient can recommit to the treatment or whether alternative treatment is indicated. Alternative treatment may also be indicated if the patient is adhering to mindfulness-based cognitive therapy but is not responding; options include adding pharmacotherapy, or switching to pharmacotherapy or a different psychotherapy such as interpersonal psychotherapy. Another option is to join a new mindfulness-based cognitive therapy group after the patient has improved with alternative treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14685.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Choosing treatment for resistant depression"</a>.)</p><p>Support for continuing mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for patients with subsyndromal symptoms is discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a class="local">'Residual depressive symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26977547"><span class="h1">CONTINUING CARE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The purpose of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is to teach skills that patients will use beyond treatment termination. The risk for recurrence of major depression persists for years after recovery from an episode, and patients are thus encouraged to practice mindfulness indefinitely (much as hypertensive patients are vigilant for high-sodium foods). Several resources are available to support the ongoing practice of mindfulness.
