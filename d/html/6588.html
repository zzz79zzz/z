        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Maximizing the distance from the exposure source is the most effective protective strategy. For all patients with radiation exposure and/or contamination, evacuation from the source or incident site and reducing further exposure (eg, radiation fallout, contaminated soil or food, or radiation from medical imaging) are of prime importance. For contaminated patients, reduction of time of exposure is further addressed by measures to reduce internal and external contamination. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Exposed and contaminated patients'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Radiation incidents usually involve high-energy gamma radiation at the incident site. Effective shielding can be accomplished with lead aprons, barriers, shields, and/ or glasses. However, hospital personnel can usually achieve adequate levels of protection during the care of radiation casualties by wearing modified universal precautions consisting of disposable gowns, surgical caps, shoe covers, N-95 masks, and double gloves.

         <a class="local">

         </span>
         Management of radiation exposure, for an individual or a community, requires knowledge of the principles of radiation safety, advance preparation, and planning at both the regional and health care facility levels. The hospital should develop a medical response plan for a nuclear or radiologic emergency as part of an all-hazards emergency management plan and ensure that it is practiced and regularly revised based upon periodic drills. This plan is required for hospital certification in many countries. Rehearsal of and familiarity with these protocols help to educate medical staff about radiation safety and their roles and responsibilities during a radiation incident. Emergency departments that are eligible to receive victims of radiation accidents must be prepared to manage large numbers of victims.

         – The Geiger-Mueller (GM) survey meter detects alpha, beta, and gamma radiation and can rapidly identify the presence of contamination. Ideally, the hospital should have enough instruments to provide radiation monitoring of patients and health care providers in external triage, the external assessment and minor injury treatment area, emergency department decontamination and treatment rooms, and any other hospital sites where contaminated patients will receive care.

          9
         </a>
         ]. Selected devices can alarm when a preset dose limit is reached, which alerts the health care worker and radiation safety personnel to stop further radiation exposure. Some personal dosimeters can also be used as survey meters. Dose limits for emergency workers are set by government agencies. Film badges are not recommended because they do
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         provide real-time measurements. However, they can provide documentation of cumulative exposure if real-time dosimeters are not available. Finger ring dosimeters are also used if the dose to the hands or fingers is expected to be higher than to the torso (eg, during removal of radioactive shrapnel).

Hospital response plans should designate a radiation safety officer who is responsible for equipment maintenance, proper training of radiation safety personnel and health care workers prior to an event, overseeing patient radiologic surveys, staff and facility monitoring of radiation levels, storage and disposal of decontaminated materials, and ensuring that contamination is eliminated during the event. Hospital staff from Departments of Radiology, Nuclear Medicine, or Radiation Oncology typically have the proper expertise to serve as radiation safety officers. Training of designated emergency department providers as members of the radiation safety team can ensure 24-hour onsite radiation monitoring capability.

         While caring for patients with radiologic contamination, health care providers should always wear personal protective equipment to prevent radioactive substances from contacting or entering the body. Recommended personal protective equipment depends upon the type of hazard that is likely to be encountered. Higher levels of protection are necessary if bloodborne pathogens or chemical agents are present. Examples of personal protective equipment for first receivers of patients with chemical contamination are discussed separately. (See

         Facility response depends upon the number of expected patients and the time to their arrival. Upon notification of a radiologic emergency (mass-casualty event), receiving facilities should secure all entrances and hospital grounds, establish a security perimeter, and set up a decontamination zone that is outside the clean parts of the facility [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Disaster plans should be activated with broad notification of hospital personnel to ensure adequate staff and equipment to handle patient care. Facility incident command and close communication with local emergency management authorities should be established.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unlike chemical and biologic events, radiologic contamination can be rapidly detected and is much less likely to pose a risk of serious harm to health care providers unless the patient is heavily contaminated or the hospital is in the zone of contamination [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Thus, hospitals should be prepared to accept radiologically contaminated patients from emergency medicine services and to encounter patients who are self-referred and potentially contaminated [

          External triage site
         </strong>
         – Moving triage outside of the facility and away from the emergency department during a mass-casualty incident helps to prevent overwhelming numbers of patients from presenting directly to the emergency department, a situation that can compromise patient care for the most severely ill or injured individuals and lead to uncontrolled contamination of health care providers, equipment, and the facility [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Potential locations include a parking deck, pop-up awning, or tent located away from the emergency department. The triage site should permit rapid setup and have sufficient staffing, supplies, and radiation monitoring capability to sort patients by medical severity (eg, immediately life-threatening, urgent, mild or no injuries, expectant [comfort measures only]) and radiologic contamination (contaminated versus uncontaminated). (See
         <a class="local">

        </p>

         The flow of contaminated patients should not impede care of life-threatening illness or injury but should control the further spread of radiologic contamination. All decontamination areas should permit privacy and have access to temperature-controlled water to avoid hypothermia, especially in infants, children, and older adults. A radiation safety specialist should be on hand to monitor levels of radiation and help prevent further contamination of clean areas [

         The plan should explicitly direct that patients with immediately life-threatening conditions be brought directly to the emergency department resuscitation area prior to radiologic survey and decontamination [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. These patients should be protected from further exposure by covering the face with an oxygen mask and the rest of the body with a clean sheet. The stretcher in the resuscitation room should be covered with two sheets. If time allows (eg, when given notice of arrival by emergency medical services), waterproof floor coverings can be taped to the floor of the treatment room and along a path (eg, one side of the hallway) from outside of the emergency department to the treatment room. Whenever possible, nonessential equipment should be removed from the room. Ideally, all handles, switches, and essential equipment should be covered with masking tape, paper tape, or other nonpermeable clear covering that is sealed with tape to limit the degree of room contamination.

         </strong>
         the patient is brought into the clean area of the emergency department or other parts of the hospital. During mass-casualty emergencies, uninjured patients and those with minor injuries should undergo external decontamination in a site that is separate and remote from the emergency department. Essential equipment in each decontamination area includes hoses with low-flow shower nozzles, GM counters, personal protective equipment, towels, patient gowns or scrubs, sheets, and clean stretchers for patient transfer to the uncontaminated area. Plastic bags, waste containers, and lead containers must also be available for storage and disposal of contaminated material  (

         Whenever possible, stable, contaminated patients with urgent injuries should enter the treatment facility through a separate entrance and be brought to a designated decontamination room that is separate from the rest of the emergency department [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The entryway should be covered with paper or waterproof sheets that are taped to the ground or floor. Areas such as autopsy rooms, casting areas, or isolated areas of the emergency department can be used. Although separation of the ventilation system from the rest of the facility is desirable, contamination through the ventilation system is very unlikely.

         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. A buffer zone between the contaminated and uncontaminated areas helps to prevent the spread of radioactive material. Designated personnel should remain in this area to transfer material from "clean" to "dirty" by taking uncontaminated material from the clean side and directly handing it to personnel in the contaminated area without individual-to-individual contact.

         provide real-time measurements. However, they can provide documentation of cumulative exposure if real-time dosimeters are not available. The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements recommends a maximum of 1 sievert [Sv] (100 roentgen equivalent in man [rem]) of exposure for volunteer providers in lifesaving emergency situations and 0.25 Sv (25 rem) in less urgent situations [

         Preliminary decontamination (ie, removal of clothing, washing of the victim) often begins in the field and can remove 90 to 95 percent of external contamination and limit additional radiation injury. However, not all patients may arrive after decontamination. Individuals who have been contaminated but

         Timely triage should establish the severity of mechanical trauma, burns, and other injuries. The nature and intensity of radiation exposure should also be estimated, if possible. Whenever possible, all triage participants should be volunteers. Health care providers should work in teams and be monitored for radiation exposure with physical dosimetry under the direction of the radiation safety officer. (See

         When managing low numbers of patients from a radiologic event, emergency triage can be performed as for any other patient presenting for emergency care. However, triage should occur outside of the facility (eg, in the ambulance or ambulance bay). Patients with immediately life-threatening conditions should be brought directly to the emergency department resuscitation area for stabilization. These patients should be protected from further exposure by covering their face with an oxygen mask or face shield and the rest of their body with a clean sheet. The stretcher in the resuscitation room should be covered with two sheets. If time allows, the facility should be prepared to minimize contamination as described above. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Facility response'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         If contaminated, stable patients should undergo decontamination in the area designated by the facility plan. Whenever possible, these patients should enter the treatment facility through a separate entrance and be brought to a designated decontamination room that is separate from the rest of the emergency department [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,12

         A variety of field triage algorithms for use during a radiation emergency exist for incident management, such as Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment ("START" and "JumpSTART") or Sort, Assess, Life-saving interventions, Treatment/Transport ("SALT"). Emergency department staff should familiarize themselves with the triage guidelines used in their region.

          First, decontaminate open wounds
         </strong>
         – Contaminated wounds can lead to rapid incorporation of radioactive substances into the body and are a high priority. Embedded metallic fragments can be highly radioactive and should be removed with tongs or forceps rather than the fingers (to increase the distance to the exposure source) [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. "Hot" particles are microscopic particles that can be highly radioactive and difficult to detect and/or dislodge, but such particles can sometimes be localized by placing a thick piece of lead between the suspected site and the radiation detector; if the particle is properly localized, the radiation count should decrease. Localized particles can usually be removed by mechanical means, although sometimes punch biopsy of the skin is necessary. Debris from wounds should be stored in lead containers and surveyed for radioactivity.

         Once radioactive shrapnel or other foreign bodies are removed, these wounds should be managed similarly to infected wounds with some modifications; the area around the wound should be cleansed and covered with waterproof surgical drapes.

          Finally, decontaminate intact skin and hair
         </strong>
         – Decontamination of intact skin should proceed from areas with highest to lowest radioactivity. Clean wounds should be covered with waterproof dressings to avoid contamination during irrigation. Decontamination should be performed with sponging of lukewarm water and a mild soap; cold water should be avoided because it closes the pores and can trap radioactive materials, while hot water should be avoided because it opens the pores and causes vasodilation, increasing the risk of absorption [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Care should be taken to avoid further abrasion or erythema of the skin, which also may increase absorption [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,13
         </a>
         ]. Areas that are sponged should be resurveyed frequently until the counts are consistent with background levels (eg, two to three times background level) or decontamination results in no further decrease in radiation measurements.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Hair may need to be clipped if washing is insufficient for decontamination; it should not be shaved because shaving may cause open wounds and internal incorporation of radioactive substances. Liquids and materials used for decontamination should be stored in marked containers for disposal.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         After decontamination, the patient should be dried and placed on a clean stretcher or in a wheelchair that is pushed by an individual who was not involved in the decontamination. The patient can then be evaluated by emergency department personnel for further care [
         <a href="#rid2">

        <p>
         All equipment used in decontamination should be surveyed before leaving the decontamination area. Individuals who leave the decontamination area should follow a clearly marked path in order to minimize cross-contamination. Personnel leaving the decontamination area should deposit all gloves, masks, hats, scrub suits, and shoe covers into marked, designated receptacles before leaving. The radiation safety specialist should collect dosimeters after they have been labeled with appropriate identifying information [
         <a href="#rid1">

        </p>
        <p>
         Once patient decontamination is complete, all tape and protective coverings should be removed and disposed of in labeled bags, and the area should be rechecked. As they exit the decontamination room, decontamination personnel enter the buffer zone, where they remove their outer protection, turning the garments inside out. They label their dosimeter badges and turn them in to the radiation officer [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>

         Nasal swabs and excreta (urine and feces) should be examined for radioisotopes to detect internal contamination via ingestion, inhalation, or absorption through the skin or mucous membranes [

Patients with external contamination who have undergone endotracheal intubation are also considered to have internal contamination. Clothing should be placed in labeled bags, and equipment used to transport or care for the patient should remain separate and can be surveyed for radiation and decontaminated if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
         If internal contamination has occurred or is suspected, samples of feces, urine, wound secretions, or emesis should be obtained as soon as possible upon arrival to the treating facility. Urine and feces should continue to be tested for four days [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. If internal contamination has occurred, urine and feces may contain radioactive material, creating a potential contamination hazard, and appropriate precautions must be taken. Any patient with wound contamination or who has imbedded radioactive fragments should undergo evaluation for internal contamination. The swabs should be placed in bags, labeled with the anatomic collection site, and assessed for radioactivity with a GM counter or alpha-radiation detection device. Hospital staff must take appropriate precautions while handling these samples as they may be radioactive.

         Management of internal contamination varies with the radioactive element and its chemical form. Isotope identifiers are available from state radiation departments, National Guard Civil Support Teams, and some hazardous materials (HAZMAT) units. Absorption can be prevented by binding the substance in a resin or forming a complex with it, reducing absorption from the bowel, and/or facilitating elimination by decreasing bowel transit time or forcing diuresis [

          Radioactive iodine
         </strong>
         – Patients who were potentially exposed to radioactive iodine may be treated with supersaturated potassium to block thyroid deposition. Potassium iodide is most effective when administered soon after exposure. For this reason, it may be stockpiled near sites at heightened risk (eg, within a 10-mile radius of nuclear power plants) [

          5,16,17

Most patients with grade ≥3 hematologic toxicity should be managed in a critical care setting, such as a transplantation unit or intensive care unit, while those with grade ≥3 cutaneous complications may benefit from management in a specialized burn unit. In addition, patients with trauma and radiation exposure have a "combined injury" with a worse prognosis than the same level of trauma or radiation exposure alone, which may elevate the anticipated medical support needed [

         For patients whose evaluation found no evidence of radiation exposure, management should be based on the nature and extent of other injuries. Unless other physical injuries require hospitalization, the patient can generally be discharged for outpatient follow-up. All patients, including those who have insignificant or no exposure, may have significant psychosocial needs, and reassurance and counseling should be offered to all individuals [

         It is important to recognize that even if a patient did not suffer radiation injury or other trauma, anxiety from being present at a radiation exposure event or witnessing other patients' injuries may cause significant psychological trauma. Fear that is out of proportion to the actual danger is common and is fostered by misconceptions about the health effects of radiation [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Anxiety is increased because exposure to ionizing radiation cannot be perceived by the affected individual, and the onset of symptoms is generally delayed. Emotional stress and anxiety caused by perceived radiation exposure may cause nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea that can be indistinguishable from effects of radiation exposure.

         For some patients with evidence of substantial radiation exposure (eg, aplasia, early onset of mental status changes, vomiting, or skin burns), blood for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing should be obtained before the lymphocyte count falls, in the event that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be required.

         Assessment of the extent of radiation injury based upon physical findings and laboratory studies can help to determine the most appropriate site for evaluation and management. There is no consensus regarding the optimal tool for assessment of radiation injury, and no studies have directly compared various models. Consultation with physicians who have expertise in radiation biodosimetry (eg, nuclear medicine or radiation oncology specialists), whenever available, is advised.

          Infection prevention
         </strong>
         – Radiation injury causes susceptibility to local and systemic infection due to immune suppression, neutropenia, and breaches in cutaneous and mucosal barriers. Bacterial infections are the most common cause of infections in this setting, but individuals are also at risk for fungal and viral infections. Susceptibility to infections rises with ANC &lt;500/microL and longer duration of neutropenia  (

         Patients with fever (ie, ≥38.0°C [100.4°F]) or other evidence of infection and neutropenia (ANC &lt;500/microL) should receive empiric broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics within 60 minutes of triage and at full doses, adjusted for renal and/or hepatic function. A diagnostic evaluation should be obtained quickly but should not delay administration of empiric antibiotic treatment. Recommendations for management, including antibiotic choice, are described separately. (See

         HCT is not generally recommended for the management of patients with hematopoietic syndrome; it should be offered to only those individuals who have failed to improve hematologically after ≥2 weeks of supportive hematologic care (eg, cytokine therapy and transfusions)
         <strong>
          and

         who have no serious injury to other organ systems (eg, gastrointestinal [GI], neurovascular, or cutaneous systems) and have a suitable donor [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30,31
         </a>
         ]. There is no consensus regarding specific guidelines for use of HCT in this setting, and a decision to proceed with transplantation must be individualized based upon severity of injuries, comorbid illnesses, graft availability, adequate medical infrastructure, institutional practice, and patient preference. This decision should weigh the benefits of hematopoietic recovery and immune reconstitution against the risks of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and other transplant-related toxicity. It is strongly influenced by the level of radiation exposure. Patients exposed to &gt;7 to &lt;10 Gy are most likely to benefit from allogeneic HCT. For patients with lower levels of exposure and toxicity, transfusion, cytokines, and management of infectious risks may be sufficient, whereas patients with &gt;10 Gy exposure are likely to die from multiorgan failure independent of hematopoietic toxicity.
        </p>
        <p>
         A well-matched sibling or unrelated donor is the preferred graft source, but alternative sources (eg, umbilical cord blood, haploidentical donor) may expand the pool of candidates for allogeneic HCT in this setting. For some patients a syngeneic (ie, identical twin) or autologous graft (eg, certain at-risk military personnel who had cells stored for emergency purposes, patients with stored stem cells as a potential backup for treatment of a prior malignancy, patients with their own umbilical cord blood in long-term storage) is available.
        </p>
        <p>
         Existing evidence suggests that the outcome of HCT for hematopoietic syndrome is poor. Review of HCT in three radiation accidents reported that most transplant recipients developed nonhematopoietic organ failure. A separate review of radiation incident registries indicated that, of 31 patients who underwent HCT, 27 patients died and the remaining four patients survived with a rejected allograft [

         There is no optimal schedule of follow-up for all patients after radiation injury, and monitoring should be individualized based on the manifestations and complications of radiation injury and should respond to the concerns of the individual. While acute radiation syndrome (ARS) is typically resolved within the first two months, monitoring for long-term sequelae (eg, cancer surveillance) should be implemented.

         Victims of radiation accidents experience a great deal of psychologic stress related to perceived radiation injury and concern about future cancer risk [

         Children who received radiation exposure to the thyroid gland should have their thyroid glands checked regularly. The frequency and method of follow-up of irradiated patients depends upon their estimated risk and the clinical findings at the initial evaluation. (See
