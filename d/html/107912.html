         Individuals with hoarding disorder feel a need to save or collect objects and experience persistent difficulties parting with possessions, regardless of their value. Possessions congest and clutter their living areas, compromise the use of these spaces, interfere with the individual’s daily life, and cause clinically significant distress.
        </p>
        <p>
         Hoarding disorder was newly included in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ], replacing the conceptualization of extreme hoarding in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) as a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. As a more recently specified mental disorder, there is less research available on hoarding disorder and its treatment compared with many disorders.
        </p>

         The treatment of hoarding disorder in adults is reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of hoarding disorder are reviewed separately. OCD in adults is also reviewed separately.

         Individuals with hoarding disorder may have poor or absent insight or delusional thinking. They may not seek help and they may be resistant to accepting treatment. We use the following methods to engage these individuals in treatment while addressing health and safety concerns. (See

         We assess and, if appropriate, address the risks of hoarding early in the treatment (eg, first or second session). Individuals with hoarding disorder are often unaware of the dangers associated with hoarding (eg, fire hazards, falling, unsanitary conditions, infestation). Education may provide motivation for change. (See

         We involve relatives or other significant supports when possible. Individuals with hoarding disorder may be isolated, suspicious of others, and unwilling to accept treatment. Trusted supports can enhance trust, lessen barriers to treatment (eg, poor or absent insight), and improve engagement in treatment.

         We often arrange home visits to assess the need for social and support services. We arrange services for all individuals with limited ability to care for themselves. For example, in individuals with hoarding disorder that are unable to attend medical appointments or take medications without assistance (eg, due to clutter, disorganization), we often involve social or support services. If vulnerable individuals are living in the home (eg, children or disabled persons) and thought to be at risk, we involve the appropriate agencies as part of the overall care plan.

         Excessive accumulation may be a presentation of other psychiatric disorders (eg, psychotic disorder, dementia, obsessive-compulsive disorder) and a differential diagnosis is crucial to guide treatment decisions. Additionally, individuals with hoarding disorder may have comorbid psychiatric disorder such as mood or anxiety disorders, which may negatively affect response to treatment [

         We establish goals early in the treatment. Treatment goals may vary based on the level of functioning of the patient, the presence of comorbidities, and the level of psychosocial support. Examples of goals include not acquiring more objects for a specified period of time, or organizing the objects to assess need. We typically reassess and, when needed, revise our treatment plan every three to six months. (See

         </span>
         The cognitive-behavioral model of hoarding theorizes that problems with acquiring, saving, and clutter result from vulnerability factors (such as genetic influences and early life events) interacting with other factors such as information processing deficits and beliefs about possessions  (

         CBT for hoarding disorder is a multimodal, psychosocial intervention based on the cognitive-behavioral model of therapy. It has been developed specifically to address hoarding. The availability of this intervention is limited to a handful of specialist academic centers and by lack of therapists trained in its delivery. When CBT specific to hoarding disorder is unavailable, we typically prefer peer groups as the next option. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14612.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         CBT for hoarding disorder is typically delivered over 7 to 12 months. Weekly office sessions and home visits every two to four weeks generally range from 12 to 35 total sessions. We typically offer an individual format; however, group formats are also shown to be effective [

          Motivational interviewing methods

         – We employ motivational interviewing methods such as open-ended questions, reflective listening statements and complex reflections in the administration of CBT for hoarding. Motivational interviewing allows for introspection, addresses ambivalence about the treatment, and conveys a sense of understanding to the patient. (See

         Clinical trials investigating CBT (individual or group CBT) for hoarding disorder have reported mixed results. Interpretation of results has been limited by small sample sizes, heterogenous treatments, and high drop-out rates [

          7-15

        </p>
        <p>
         In a meta-analysis of 16 studies, including 505 individuals with hoarding disorder, subjects treated with CBT (12 to 41 weeks) showed improvements in hoarding symptoms from pretreatment to posttreatment and pretreatment to three- to six-month follow-up (effect sizes g = 1.11 and 1.25 respectively [
         <a href="#rid9">

         ]).
        </p>
        <p>
         Furthermore, in another trial, 323 adults with hoarding disorder were randomized to either 15 weeks of group peer-facilitated (G-PFT) therapy or 16 weeks of group psychologist-led CBT (G-CBT) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Both treatments appeared to be effective at reducing hoarding symptom severity (effect sizes: G-PFT 1.20; G-CBT 1.21), with similar effect between groups. The treatment gains were maintained for up to the three months in follow-up. Interpretation of data was limited by a high dropout rate (ie, nearly 30 percent). Other trials appear to support these findings [

         We prefer mutual help groups for individuals who cannot access or refuse cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Mutual help groups may contribute to symptom reduction in individuals with hoarding disorder [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,13
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in a clinical study of 38 patients with hoarding disorder, individuals were randomized to a 13-week support group versus wait list (control). Individuals in the support group experienced a greater mean symptom reduction compared with the wait list control group (31 versus 2 percent) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10

         In some communities, no psychosocial treatments are available (eg, CBT, mutual help groups). There is no evidence to support the use of pharmacotherapy in individuals with hoarding disorder without comorbidities. In individuals with comorbid conditions, such as depression, we treat with pharmacotherapy. (See

         For individuals who present with hoarding disorder with prominent comorbid conditions such as an anxiety or a mood disorder, we often initiate treatment with a combination of CBT (preferably CBT for hoarding) and pharmacotherapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. As there is a lack of data supporting the efficacy of this approach, we base our treatment on the efficacy of antidepressants in treating psychiatric disorders such as anxiety or mood disorders and our clinical experience.

         Cognitive remediation is a behavioral intervention designed to improve cognitive abilities. It has been used to improve cognitive abilities in individuals with traumatic brain injury and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Cognitive remediation involves training in a specific set of tasks designed to improve cognitive abilities (information processing, attention, working memory, executive functioning) or social functioning. This contrasts with CBT which aims to change the cognitions and behaviors related to hoarding difficulties.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinical trials provide limited evidence of efficacy for cognitive remediation. For example, in one trial, 58 individuals with hoarding disorder were randomized to cognitive remediation and exposure sorting therapy (CREST) versus case management [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Subjects managed with CREST showed greater improvements on self-reported measures of hoarding (Saving Inventory-Revised [SI-R]) than the case management group (38 versus 25 percent decrease). However, improvements on other clinician-rated scales were similar in both groups. In another trial, 17 individuals with hoarding disorder were randomly assigned to computer assisted cognitive remediation versus relaxation control [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. At eight-week follow-up, similar effect was seen on measures of hoarding severity between groups.

         We typically offer a trial of pharmacotherapy in cases where psychosocial treatments are unavailable or in those who are resistant to all psychosocial interventions. However, there are no randomized trials supporting pharmacotherapy for individuals with primary hoarding disorder and data from uncontrolled trials are inconclusive regarding efficacy. For individuals with comorbid conditions such as mood or anxiety disorders, pharmacotherapy may be helpful.

         Strategies for the treatment of hoarding disorder have not been standardized. Much of the existing research was conducted in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and hoarding symptoms rather than with DSM-5 hoarding disorder [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. For example, in a meta-analysis of case series and uncontrolled trials of pharmacologic treatment for individuals with pathological hoarding, of the 92 individuals in the trial only 27 met DSM-5 criteria for hoarding disorder [
         <a href="#rid18">

          Principles of treatment
         </strong>
         – Individuals with hoarding disorder feel a need to save or collect objects and experience persistent difficulties parting with possessions, regardless of their value. Possessions congest living areas and compromise use of these spaces. This interferes with the individual’s daily life and causes clinically significant distress.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         We educate individuals with hoarding disorder about the risks of hoarding such as fire safety and unhealthy living conditions. We attempt to involve significant relations or other support services and establish goals early in the treatment. Additionally, we assess for comorbid disorders such as mood disorders. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Principles of treatment'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) as first-line treatment
         </strong>
         – We suggest first-line treatment of hoarding disorder with CBT for hoarding disorder rather than medication or other psychosocial interventions (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The cognitive-behavioral model of hoarding theorizes that excessive acquiring and saving result from vulnerability factors (eg, genetic influences, early life events) interacting with beliefs about possessions, information processing deficits, and maladaptive emotional responses. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Conceptual model'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Components of CBT for hoarding include motivational interviewing methods (eg, open-ended questions and reflective listening), goal setting, skills training, graduated exposure, and cognitive restructuring. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Administration and components'

         <strong>
          Reassessing treatment for poor response to CBT
         </strong>
         – We reassess our treatment in individuals with poor response to CBT. Reasons such as insufficient emphasis on graduated exposure to acquiring or discarding objects are addressed. Additionally, we verify the presence or lack of comorbid conditions. (See

          Individuals who cannot access or refuse CBT

         – We prefer mutual help groups for individuals who cannot access CBT or refuse treatment with CBT. (See

         <strong>
          Individuals with prominent comorbid conditions
         </strong>
         – We typically initiate treatment with CBT or other psychosocial intervention plus medication management with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor in individuals with untreated comorbid mood or anxiety disorders. (See

         <strong>
          Treatment resistance
         </strong>
         – We typically offer a trial of pharmacotherapy for individuals who remain resistant to psychosocial interventions. However, there are no randomized trials supporting pharmacotherapy for individuals with primary hoarding disorder. Efficacy data from uncontrolled trials are inconclusive. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pharmacotherapy'

         <strong>
          Subsequent treatment for treatment responders
         </strong>
         – We provide individuals who respond to treatment with strategies to prevent relapse. These include learning how to manage stressful situations or other potential triggers for new acquisition behaviors, increasing socialization, keeping an active lifestyle, participating in ongoing peer groups, address outstanding medical conditions and, when possible, returning to the workforce.
