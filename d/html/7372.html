         Struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) stones are often referred to as "infection stones" since they are strongly associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs) with urea-splitting organisms. They may grow rapidly over a period of weeks to months and, if not adequately treated, can develop into a staghorn or branched calculus that fills the entire kidney collecting system. If left untreated, this can lead to deterioration of kidney function and end-stage kidney disease. In addition, since the stones often remain infected, there is a risk of developing sepsis. Thus, most patients require definitive surgical treatment.

         This topic will review the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and management of struvite stones. Other aspects of kidney stones in adults are discussed elsewhere:

         The epidemiology of struvite stone formation is, in part, sex dependent [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Women are more likely to form pure struvite stones (3:1) because females are more likely to develop an upper urinary tract infection (UTI). Other patients susceptible to UTI, such as those with a neurogenic bladder, urinary diversion, or indwelling Foley catheter, also may form pure struvite stones [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. In France, the prevalence of stones containing any struvite decreased from 11.1 percent in the 1980s to 6.1 percent in the 2000s [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. In Rochester, Minnesota, only 1 percent of first stones contained struvite [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Improving care of patients at high risk for UTI has shifted the epidemiology of stones in such patients. As an example, in a cohort of 33 immobile patients with musculoskeletal anomalies (traditionally at high risk for struvite stones), the proportion of stones due to infection was only 18 percent; the rest were calcium or uric acid stones [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In addition, a 2011 study of 52 patients with staghorn calculi revealed that just 44 percent were struvite [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].

         Struvite stones are composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and calcium carbonate-apatite [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Normal urine is undersaturated with magnesium ammonium phosphate, and struvite stone formation occurs only when ammonia production is increased and the urine pH is elevated, which decreases the solubility of phosphate. The only situation in which this occurs in humans is with an upper urinary tract infection (UTI) with a urease-producing organism, such as
         <em>
          Proteus mirabilis
         </em>
         ,
         <em>

         ) plus carbon dioxide (CO

        <p>
         In comparison to those patients with pure struvite stones, many males and some females have mixed calcium oxalate and struvite stones. It is presumed that the primary event in this setting is calcium oxalate stone formation, with secondary upper UTI and struvite deposition. In these patients, a comprehensive medical evaluation will uncover the underlying metabolic defect(s) responsible for calcium stone formation [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Patients with pure struvite stones may also benefit from a metabolic evaluation in addition to benefiting from a determination of the cause of the upper tract infection. (See

         Symptoms directly attributable to struvite stones are uncommon. More often, patients will present with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), mild flank pain, or hematuria and will be found to have a persistently alkaline urine pH (&gt;8), often with multiple magnesium ammonium phosphate crystals in the urine sediment (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108401" href="/z/d/graphic/108401.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ), and a complex kidney stone on kidney ultrasound or plain film of the abdomen. The stone may grow rapidly over a period of weeks to months and, if not adequately treated (including complete removal and treatment of the infection), can develop into a staghorn or branched calculus filling the entire renal pelvis and calyces (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62009" href="/z/d/graphic/62009.html" rel="external">
          image 1

         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         A persistently infected stone often leads to focal areas of parenchymal scarring with loss of cortex (chronic pyelonephritis). Some patients may develop xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, an unusual variant of chronic pyelonephritis in which there is massive destruction of the kidney by granulomatous tissue containing lipid-laden macrophages (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8058.html" rel="external">
          "Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis"
         </a>
         ). Passage of a struvite stone is rare. When passed and collected or removed surgically, chemical analysis of these stones may falsely report the absence of struvite [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. Thus, if the suspicion is high in the appropriate clinical setting, struvite may be present even if not identified by the analyzing laboratory. (See

         Confirmation of the diagnosis of struvite stones requires a stone composition analysis demonstrating the presence of struvite. However, since most patients with struvite stones do not spontaneously pass their stones, a stone analysis is not usually available to the clinician prior to making treatment decisions, except in those with prior documented struvite stones. In patients without a prior history of struvite stones, the diagnosis of struvite stones should be suspected if the patient has one or more of the following features (see

         Patients with confirmed struvite stones should undergo a metabolic evaluation, similar to the evaluation performed in patients who form other types of stones. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7377.html" rel="external">
          "Kidney stones in adults: Evaluation of the patient with established stone disease", section on 'Complete metabolic evaluation'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The reasons are as follows:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●

         Reporting of struvite as a component of a kidney stone sent for analysis is unreliable [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ], and it is therefore possible that retrieved stones may have formed in the upper urinary tract due to factors other than infection with urease-producing bacteria.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         In addition, the entire stone is not typically removed as a single piece, so not all components of the stone may be identified if a single piece is sent for analysis. Thus, it is possible that there was a more common type of stone present in the kidney (eg, calcium oxalate) that became secondarily infected with urease-producing bacteria and the struvite stone grew over the original stone. Because struvite stones can grow quickly and become quite large, it is possible that the original stone nidus may not be included in a sample that is sent to the laboratory for analysis.

         Surgical therapy is usually required to successfully treat struvite stones. Adjunctive medical therapy following surgery, which usually consists of short- or long-term antibiotic therapy and, in selected patients, treatment with a urease inhibitor (

         Patients who present with obstructing stones and urinary tract infection (UTI) or acute kidney injury require emergency intervention for urgent decompression of the collecting system. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         For most patients with struvite stones who do not require emergency intervention, we suggest surgical stone removal followed by medical therapy, rather than medical therapy alone. Given that the majority of these complex stones contain bacteria, the only way to subsequently sterilize the patient's urine is to completely remove all stone material. Patients who are too ill to tolerate, or who refuse, stone removal surgery may be managed conservatively with medical therapy alone (ie, antibiotic therapy and urease inhibition). However, medical therapy alone is rarely successful. (See

         There are no randomized trials comparing surgical with medical therapy for the treatment of struvite stones. However, several observational studies have suggested that conservative therapy of struvite stones, compared with surgical therapy, is associated with higher mortality and progressive deterioration of kidney function [

         In one series of 185 patients with a staghorn calculus, the 10-year mortality rate was 28 percent among those receiving conservative therapy, compared with 7.2 percent among those receiving surgical therapy [

         A retrospective analysis of 177 consecutive patients with a staghorn calculus found that death from kidney-related causes occurred in 67, 3, and 0 percent of patients who refused treatment, were treated without complete clearance of stone fragments, or had complete clearance of fragments, respectively [

         The major surgical options for struvite stones include percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL), ureteroscopy (URS), shock wave lithotripsy (SWL), or open surgery. Ultimately, surgical therapy should result in complete stone removal. A more detailed discussion of these techniques is presented elsewhere. (See

         ) and normal collecting system anatomy (eg, no hydroureteronephrosis), SWL, with placement of adequate drainage of the kidney prior to the procedure (usually a ureteral stent), is an alternative option; however, PNL is still preferred for these patients. If PNL is not available or contraindicated, staged URS (ie, performed in separate, planned sessions) can be performed as an alternative option.

         Complete stone removal of infected struvite stones is imperative since the only way to clear the patient's infection is to remove the stone in its entirety. Thus, PNL is the preferred surgical approach for most patients with struvite stones because of its significantly higher stone-free rate (SFR) compared with SWL or URS and its lower morbidity compared with open surgery [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,20-23

         In a trial that randomly assigned 50 patients with complete staghorn stones to SWL monotherapy or combined therapy with PNL followed by SWL, the SFR was 74 percent with combined PNL and SWL and 22 percent with SWL [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20

         A randomized trial that compared open surgery and PNL in 79 patients with complete staghorn stones found comparable SFRs between the two procedures (49 versus 66 percent at hospital discharge and 74 versus 82 percent at follow-up for PNL and open surgery, respectively), but patients undergoing PNL had fewer intraoperative (16 versus 38 percent) and postoperative (19 versus 31 percent) complications, shorter hospital stay (6.4 versus 10 days), and earlier return to work (2.5 versus 4.1 weeks) [

         Preoperative imaging for patients undergoing surgical stone removal for struvite stones is similar to that for patients undergoing surgery to remove other stone types. We obtain a noncontrast computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis to define the anatomy and guide the surgical approach. In addition, if there is concern for a nonfunctioning or poorly functioning kidney, we obtain a nuclear renal scan to evaluate kidney function in the affected kidney. If poor function (&lt;15 percent on nuclear renal scan) is confirmed and the contralateral kidney has relatively normal kidney function, nephrectomy of the affected kidney is a reasonable option.

         Identification of the urease-producing organism causing upper UTI and struvite stone formation is important in guiding postoperative antimicrobial therapy. However, there is no high-quality evidence or consensus agreement regarding the optimal site to obtain a culture. While many clinicians base their antibiotic decisions upon the results of urine cultures obtained from the bladder, others prefer urine cultures sampled from the renal pelvis during percutaneous puncture of the pelvicaliceal system or cultures of extracted stones. We obtain preoperative urine cultures but also obtain a stone culture during the time of stone removal in case the patient develops postoperative sepsis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The results of a stone culture obtained at the time of surgery may help guide antibiotic therapy if the patient develops a postoperative infection or urosepsis. In one study of 328 patients who underwent PNL or URS for kidney or ureteral stones, of whom 11 developed postoperative sepsis, the urine culture upon hospital readmission correlated with stone culture in 64 percent of cases and with preoperative urine culture in only 9 percent [

         We obtain postoperative imaging at two to three months after surgery to assess for the presence of residual fragments and for possible urinary tract obstruction. Periodic monitoring with imaging should then be obtained every 6 to 12 months since new stone formation can occur, occasionally affecting the contralateral kidney. We prefer digital pelvic tomosynthesis (DT) paired with kidney ultrasound to assess for residual stone fragments and obstruction, respectively. If DT is not available, an alternative approach is to obtain abdominopelvic radiograph paired with kidney ultrasound or a low-dose, noncontrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis. A discussion of the imaging modalities used for diagnosing and monitoring kidney stones is presented separately. (See

         Patients with struvite stones may require repeat procedures (with the same or a different modality) to completely remove residual stone fragments if the patient develops recurrent UTI or experiences stone growth. In general, endoscopic procedures (PNL or URS) are preferred for the management of residual struvite stone fragments since these techniques enable direct extraction of infected stone material. However, there are no data comparing the use of different surgical procedures for residual struvite stone fragments.
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with residual struvite stone fragments that cannot be accessed endoscopically, we treat with a urease inhibitor (eg, AHA) to help slow struvite stone growth and inhibit recurrent infection. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Urease inhibition in select patients'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The presence of residual struvite stone fragments after surgical stone removal increases the risk for recurrent stone disease. As an example, the persistence of fragments &gt;5 mm in size at three months is associated with a high incidence of progressive stone growth (seven of nine patients [78 percent] in one series) [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. By comparison, the stone-free and infection-free rates at three years are approximately 90 percent if all fragments are removed during the initial therapy. Thus, all attempts to render a patient completely stone free should be made. (See

         Following surgical stone removal, adjunctive pharmacologic measures to prevent stone recurrence and growth of residual stone fragments include antibiotic therapy and, in select patients, a urease inhibitor. Such therapies can also be used in patients who are unable to tolerate, or refuse, surgical therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients on medical therapy alone, routine surveillance with kidney ultrasound should be performed every four to six months to monitor stone growth if the patient is medically eligible for a stone removal procedure.

         In general, the medical treatment of struvite stones is rarely successful (see

          'Surgical therapy for most patients'
         </a>
         above). Bacteria live within interstices of the stone where antimicrobial agents may not penetrate and create a persistently alkaline local environment, promoting stone growth. Nevertheless, if a bacterium has been identified in culture, chronic administration of a culture-specific antimicrobial agent can sometimes prevent further stone growth and should be initiated. One retrospective study of 29 patients who were managed conservatively found that two-thirds of the patients maintained stable kidney function and there was only one admission for pyelonephritis over a mean of two years [

In addition, there is no high-quality evidence to guide the optimal choice of agent or timing or duration of therapy, and clinical practice varies [

         In patients undergoing surgical stone removal for struvite stones, our approach to antibiotic therapy is as follows:

         Prior to surgery, we obtain a urine culture and treat as appropriate with culture-specific antimicrobial therapy. Although patients should ideally have a sterile urine prior to stone removal, bacteriuria within those with struvite stones may not be cleared until the patient is stone free. (See

         Perioperatively, we administer a single dose of oral or intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis (such as

         Postoperatively, we administer continuous prophylactic antibiotics to all patients with documented struvite stones for three to six months. We typically give
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9704" href="/z/d/drug information/9704.html" rel="external">
          nitrofurantoin

          trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
         </a>
         (TMP-SMX; one-half of a single-strength tablet once daily). If the patient's urine remains uninfected after three to six months of prophylaxis, we discontinue antibiotic therapy. If the patient continues to have positive urine cultures in spite of prophylactic antibiotics, we switch to an alternative regimen of prophylactic antibiotics. An alternative approach is to periodically monitor a urine culture after surgery (eg, monthly for three months) and treat as appropriate with culture-specific antibiotics. However, there are no data supporting one of these antibiotic approaches over the other. (See

         Urease inhibitors, such as AHA, can cause complete, noncompetitive inhibition of urease production, thereby slowing struvite stone growth. However, these agents are associated with significant side effects that frequently limit their use. Thus, we reserve the use of AHA for patients who have residual stone fragments following surgical stone removal, with recurrent struvite stones, or who are unable to tolerate, or refuse, surgical stone removal.
        </p>
        <p>
         If treatment with AHA is initiated, we administer 250 mg twice daily for as long as it can be tolerated without significant side effects. A complete blood count with reticulocytes should be obtained after two weeks of treatment and at three-month intervals during the treatment to monitor for bone marrow suppression, hemolytic anemia, and reticulocytosis. In addition, close monitoring of hepatic function is also advised.
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence in support of the use of AHA comes from three randomized trials that collectively show that struvite stone growth can be arrested in approximately 80 percent of AHA-treated patients compared with only 40 percent of placebo-treated patients [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31-33
         </a>
         ]. However, treatment with AHA has not been shown to reduce existing stone burden. In addition, 20 to 60 percent of patients receiving AHA experience significant side effects such as palpitations, edema, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, loss of taste, hallucinations, rash, abdominal discomfort, anemia, and reticulocytosis (all reversible).

         – Irrigation (chemolysis) of the collecting system, with solutions such as a citric acid mixture (Renacidin), to dissolve remaining fragments of infected stones, particularly after PNL, has been advocated by some clinicians.

          General principles
         </strong>
         – Struvite stones are composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and calcium carbonate-apatite. Such stones are often referred to as "infection stones" since they only form in the setting of urinary tract infections (UTIs) with urea-splitting organisms (such as
         <em>
          Proteus mirabilis
         </em>
         ). (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Clinical manifestations
         </strong>
         – Symptoms directly attributable to struvite stones are uncommon. Most frequently, patients will present with symptoms of a UTI, mild flank pain, or hematuria. Severe pain is uncommon unless significant obstruction is present. The stone may grow rapidly over a period of weeks to months and, if not adequately treated, can develop into a staghorn or branched calculus filling the entire renal pelvis and calyces. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations'

         <strong>
          Diagnosis and evaluation
         </strong>
         – Confirmation of the diagnosis of struvite stones requires a stone composition analysis demonstrating the presence of struvite. In patients without a prior history of struvite stones, the diagnosis should be suspected if the patient has a history of recurrent or persistent UTIs, persistently alkaline urine pH (&gt;8), magnesium ammonium phosphate crystals present in the urine sediment (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108401" href="/z/d/graphic/108401.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ), or a staghorn calculus identified by abdominal imaging (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62009" href="/z/d/graphic/62009.html" rel="external">
          image 1

          image 2

         ). Struvite stone formers should undergo a metabolic evaluation, similar to the evaluation performed in patients who form other types of kidney stones. (See

         <strong>
          Surgical therapy
         </strong>
         – Patients who present with obstructing stones and UTI or acute kidney injury require emergency intervention for urgent decompression of the collecting system. For most patients with struvite stones who do not require emergency intervention, we suggest complete surgical stone removal, rather than medical therapy alone (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Patients who are too ill to tolerate, or who refuse, stone removal surgery may be managed conservatively with medical therapy alone. However, medical therapy alone is rarely successful. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Surgical therapy for most patients'

         </span>
         For most patients with struvite stones who are undergoing surgical stone removal, we suggest percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) as first-line surgical therapy, rather than shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) or other surgical options (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). However, for patients who have a smaller stone volume (&lt;500 mm
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         ) and normal collecting system anatomy, SWL is an alternative option. If SWL monotherapy is used, a stent should be placed to ensure adequate drainage of the kidney. (See

         Open surgery should not be offered as first-line surgical therapy. However, open surgery can be considered for patients with a large stone burden or in individuals with severe obesity in whom endoscopic and fluoroscopic techniques are difficult. (See
