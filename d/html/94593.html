The optimal position may require a compromise between the best position for surgical access and the position the patient can tolerate. The chosen position may result in physiologic changes and can result in soft tissue injury (eg, nerve damage, pressure-induced injury or ulceration, or compartment syndrome).</p><p>This topic will discuss the basic principles for positioning and specific concerns for a variety of positions. Postoperative visual loss, which may be related to patient positioning, is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/93507.html" rel="external">"Postoperative visual loss after anesthesia for nonocular surgery"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3391373196"><span class="h1">GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3032668888"><span class="h2">Trial positioning</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When possible, the position during surgery should be one that would be comfortable with the patient fully awake. Patients should be questioned about limited range of motion and their ability to lie comfortably in the expected position. If questions arise, the patient should be placed in the anticipated position as a trial before sedation or induction of anesthesia.</p><p>If the operating table will be tilted either top to bottom, side to side, or moved into the sitting position (eg, during breast reconstruction) during surgery, the anticipated position should be practiced before skin preparation and draping, to make sure supports and straps are secure and that the patient tolerates the position physiologically.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3348886797"><span class="h2">Physiologic changes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All positions used for surgery can cause cardiovascular and pulmonary changes. Both general and neuraxial anesthesia can affect the normal compensatory mechanisms that maintain cardiovascular stability and can cause changes in ventilation and perfusion that can result in hypoxemia. In addition, compression of tissue or vascular structures related to positioning can cause regional ischemia. The physiologic effects of specific positions are discussed individually. (See <a class="local">'Physiologic effects of supine position'</a> below and <a class="local">'Physiologic effects of Trendelenburg positioning'</a> below and <a class="local">'Physiologic effects of reverse Trendelenburg position'</a> below and <a class="local">'Physiologic effects of lithotomy positioning'</a> below and <a class="local">'Physiologic effects of lateral decubitus positioning'</a> below and <a class="local">'Physiologic effects of prone positioning'</a> below and <a class="local">'Physiologic effects of sitting position'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2466152097"><span class="h2">Nerve injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Perioperative peripheral nerve injury can result in temporary or permanent sensory or motor deficits, paresthesias, or pain, and in some cases, these injuries are related to patient positioning. General considerations for perioperative nerve injuries are discussed here. Nerve injuries related to specific positions are discussed in subsequent sections.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2472091543"><span class="h3">Incidence of perioperative nerve injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Nerve injury after anesthesia is a rare event, and the true incidence is unknown. Related literature consists mostly of case reports, retrospective reviews, and malpractice claims data. A review of over 380,000 surgical cases in one institution, using quality assurance, closed claims, and billing code databases, reported an incidence of perioperative nerve injury unrelated to surgery of 0.03 percent [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Peripheral nerve injuries are an important medical legal issue. The mechanisms for peripheral nerve injury are incompletely understood, and they may occur despite optimal positioning procedures (see <a class="local">'Mechanisms of nerve injury'</a> below). In an analysis of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Closed Claim Database, nerve injury accounted for 12 percent of malpractice injury claims between 1990 and 2013 for patients who had general anesthesia [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Nearly one-half of the claims for nerve injury had no obvious etiology, and 91 percent were thought to be associated with appropriate anesthetic care, compared with 58 percent of other claims. In another analysis of Anesthesia Closed Claims Project database for surgical procedures from 2000 to 2014, spine surgery claims comprised &gt;10 percent of claims, and were associated with severe permanent disability primarily from nerve and eye injuries [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Prone positioning and surgical duration ≥4 hours were associated with permanent disabling injuries in patients who underwent spine surgery.</p><p>Peripheral nerve injury is a complex phenomenon that may occur during any type of anesthesia, including procedures performed outside of the operating room. Theoretically, patients who are awake or lightly sedated without regional anesthesia should be at lower risk of position-related nerve injury since they would be able to move an uncomfortable extremity. However, upper extremity nerve injury has been reported during neuraxial anesthesia and during monitored anesthesia care [<a href="#rid1">1,4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H154811101"><span class="h3">Mechanisms of nerve injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The mechanisms for perioperative nerve injury are incompletely understood and may involve local mechanical insult related to positioning (compression and stretch), ischemia, and/or inflammation. Nerve injury may also be related to preexisting patient factors (eg, preexisting subclinical neuropathy, diabetes, hypertension, body habitus), or as yet undetermined factors. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5282.html" rel="external">"Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes", section on 'Etiologies'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14170.html" rel="external">"Traumatic peripheral neuropathies", section on 'Traction/stretch'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14170.html" rel="external">"Traumatic peripheral neuropathies", section on 'Contusion/compression'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5278.html" rel="external">"Overview of lower extremity peripheral nerve syndromes", section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Some nerves are at particular risk for position-related injury, either because of a superficial course that is vulnerable to compression (eg, peroneal nerve at the fibular head, ulnar nerve in the ulnar groove at the elbow), or because of potential stretch (eg, brachial plexus with the neck rotated).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1065606433"><span class="h3">Risk factors for nerve injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Risk factors for perioperative peripheral nerve injury unrelated to the surgical procedure include longer surgical procedures, extremes of body weight, older age, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes [<a href="#rid1">1,4,5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1447824048"><span class="h3">Prevention of nerve injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Perioperative peripheral nerve injury is difficult to predict and difficult to prevent. In 2018, the ASA issued an updated practice advisory for prevention of perioperative peripheral neuropathies [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The task force that created this document based their recommendations on observational studies, case reports, and expert opinion; recommendations emphasize proper padding and positioning, and are summarized in a table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111465" href="/d/graphic/111465.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Prevention of skin and tissue injury'</a> below.)</p><p>Somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) monitoring is used for early detection of neurologic compromise during surgery, and may detect positioning related nerve ischemia [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. Early detection is appealing, as most perioperative nerve insults are potentially reversible and treatable [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Standard SSEP monitoring is logistically challenging, and is not feasible for routine monitoring for peripheral nerve injury, though it may be beneficial for high-risk patients and high-risk surgical procedures (eg, cardiac or shoulder surgery) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91216.html" rel="external">"Neuromonitoring in surgery and anesthesia", section on 'Somatosensory evoked potentials'</a>). Pilot studies involving the use of a novel automated SSEP device during cardiac [<a href="#rid9">9</a>] and shoulder surgery [<a href="#rid10">10</a>] have been promising, but further studies are needed to determine diagnostic accuracy and outcome benefit.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1003861530"><span class="h3">Management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are limited effective treatment options for peripheral nerve injury. Limited and heterogenous studies in animals and humans suggest that hyperbaric oxygen may be a possible therapy for injuries due to tissue ischemia [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Optimal treatment regimens are unknown, and further study is required before suggesting its use. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been suggested via animal and human subjects as a possible treatment option.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H989439938"><span class="h2">Skin and tissue injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Immobilization places patients at risk for skin and underlying tissue injury during anesthesia, particularly during longer surgical procedures. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2885.html" rel="external">"Prevention of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury", section on 'Repositioning and frequency'</a>.)</p><p>Skin breakdown, pressure-induced injury, and ulceration are possible and, rarely, compartment syndrome. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/358.html" rel="external">"Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities", section on 'Trauma without fracture'</a> and <a class="local">'Particular concerns with lithotomy position'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3001302452"><span class="h3">Incidence of tissue injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pressure-induced injury is common among hospitalized patients in general and among surgical patients in particular. The incidence of these injuries in surgical patients varies widely by clinical setting, and is reported at between 10 and 37 percent during the hospital stay [<a href="#rid12">12-15</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2884.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and risk assessment of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In one study, 208 patients who had surgery lasting more than four hours were prospectively followed for the development of pressure ulcers [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Effective preventive measures for pressure ulcers were not used, and 21 percent of patients developed pressure ulcers; 53 percent occurred on the heels, and 16 percent occurred in the sacral area.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a single institution prospective observational study of 287 patients undergoing elective spine surgery in the prone position, by postoperative day two 24.6 percent of patients developed pressure ulcers, most commonly of the upper extremities [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2796547289"><span class="h3">Risk factors for tissue injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multiple perioperative risk factors have been identified for development of perioperative pressure injuries, based on retrospective reviews and observational studies. Risk factors include high preoperative Braden scale score  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68532" href="/d/graphic/68532.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), extremes of body mass index (BMI), older age, total surgery time, hypotension and vasopressor administration, diabetes, high ASA risk score and intraoperative acidosis [<a href="#rid12">12,17</a>]. These risk factors overlap with the risk factors for intraoperative nerve injury.</p><p>However, risk factors specifically related to intraoperative management may be different. In a retrospective observational cohort study the electronic anesthesia and medical records of approximately 2700 critically ill surgical patients were reviewed [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Pressure injury occurred in 10.7 percent of patients and was associated with intraoperative blood product administration but not with operative case length, hypotension, or use of vasopressors.</p><p>Epidural analgesia has rarely been reported to lead to serious heel ulcers, even in young and fit patients without other risk factors, both in the postoperative period [<a href="#rid19">19</a>] and during labor [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Motor block associated with overly dense epidural block may restrict lower extremity movement, and sensory block can prevent discomfort related to pressure. For this and other reasons, the lowest effective doses of epidural drugs should be used, patients should be reminded to move their legs, and all care providers should routinely examine pressure points for signs of tissue damage.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H475576096"><span class="h3">Prevention of skin and tissue injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pressure redistribution is the most important factor in preventing pressure-induced injuries and may be accomplished by appropriate use of pressure-reducing devices and surfaces, frequent repositioning of the patient's head and limbs as possible, and proper patient positioning. Tissue pressures are greatest over bony prominences where weight-bearing points come in contact with external surfaces (eg, heels, occiput, sacrum, iliac crests, ischial tuberosity), and these sites should be padded or free. In addition, plastic connectors in intravenous tubing, stopcocks, and the wires and connectors of monitoring devices are potential points of pressure injury. All of these devices should be padded where they may press against skin, especially when extremities are wrapped or tucked. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2884.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and risk assessment of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury", section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>In the operating room, a variety of padding materials are used to disperse pressure with the goal of avoiding tissue damage  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112451" href="/d/graphic/112451.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112452" href="/d/graphic/112452.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112450" href="/d/graphic/112450.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). It is not clear whether any particular type of padding material is better than others for prevention of tissue injury. High specification reactive or viscoelastic foam (ie, memory foam) and gel pads/supports should be used, rather than standard pads or firm supports (eg, blankets or towels). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2885.html" rel="external">"Prevention of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury", section on 'Support surfaces'</a>.)</p><p>Egg crate foam may not be as effective as other padding materials, because it compresses over time and under heavy body parts. For short periods of time and under lighter body parts, foam may be as effective as gel or visco-elastic material.</p><p>Multilayer soft silicone foam dressing, such as Mepilex border sacral dressings (MöInlycke Health Care), have been shown to reduce pressure ulcers in the critical care setting when placed in particularly susceptible locations [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>Based on the type of surgery and necessary position, specific bony prominences may be at risk. We often place foam dressings on these particular bony prominences, such as the iliac crests during prone spine surgery.</p><p>For prevention of heel ulcers, elevating the leg so that the heel does not contact the mattress is the most effective preventive measure for bedridden patients [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>] and may be applicable in anesthetized patients as well. This can be accomplished with pillows placed beneath the knees. (See <a class="local">'Particular concerns with the supine position'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1380594751"><span class="h2">Postoperative visual loss</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Postoperative visual loss, usually due to posterior ischemic optic neuropathy, occurs most commonly after spine surgery in the prone position but may also occur after other prolonged procedures, including those performed in the head down position (eg, robotic gynecologic and urologic procedures). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/93507.html" rel="external">"Postoperative visual loss after anesthesia for nonocular surgery", section on 'Postoperative posterior ION'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H630052605"><span class="h2">Operating tables</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Movement of the operating room table while the patient is on it should be avoided. If the table must be moved, the patient should be secured and surrounded by operating room personnel on all sides to avoid having the patient shift or fall. The surgical table weight limits should be strictly followed; weight limit specifications are usually much lower if the table is tilted side to side or top to bottom. In addition, weight limits are lower if the patient is placed on the table in reverse orientation (ie, head placed at the foot of the table) because the patient's weight is no longer centered over the base  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111332" href="/d/graphic/111332.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2973240759"><span class="h1">SUPINE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the supine (or dorsal decubitus) position, one or both arms may be abducted out to the side on arm boards or tucked next to the patient's body  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112650" href="/d/graphic/112650.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>). When the arms are adducted, they may be placed on padded arm supports or tucked using the lift sheet that goes under the patient. (See <a class="local">'Particular concerns with the supine position'</a> below.)</p><p>A true horizontal supine position may place strain on the back, does not put the hips and knees in a neutral position, and may be poorly tolerated by awake patients. Therefore, the hips and knees should be flexed slightly by placing a pillow under the knees or configuring the operating table into a slight beach chair position.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2738577481"><span class="h2">Physiologic effects of supine position</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are minimal horizontal gradients in the vascular system in the supine position. Heart rate (HR) and peripheral vascular resistance are generally lower in the supine position compared with the sitting and prone positions. If the legs are elevated, venous return to the heart and cardiac output increases [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p>The supine position affects pulmonary physiology, primarily related to cranial displacement of the diaphragm by abdominal contents. Changing body position from upright to supine reduces functional residual capacity by 0.8 to 1 L (ie, from approximately 3.5 L to 2.5 L) and induction of anesthesia causes another decrease by 0.4 to 0.5 L [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. A reduction in lung compliance, airway closure, and atelectasis can result. In addition, ventilation perfusion mismatch may occur during mechanical ventilation. Perfusion increases in dependent lung regions, while ventilation is more evenly distributed. Such changes are usually well tolerated by healthy patients but may be problematic for patients with obesity, pulmonary disease, and older patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/93386.html" rel="external">"Mechanical ventilation during anesthesia in adults", section on 'Lung protective ventilation during anesthesia'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/93386.html" rel="external">"Mechanical ventilation during anesthesia in adults", section on 'Goals for lung protective ventilation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14932.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for the patient with obesity", section on 'Ventilation management'</a>.)</p><p>Patients in advanced stages of pregnancy, or with a large mobile abdominal mass, may be at risk for aortocaval compression and hypotension in the supine position and may benefit from leftward tilt with a wedge under the right hip. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4480.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for cesarean delivery", section on 'Intraoperative positioning'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4057248013"><span class="h2">Nerve injuries associated with supine positioning</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The arms should be positioned to minimize the chance of brachial plexus and ulnar nerve injuries, recognizing that the majority of perioperative nerve injuries occur despite what is considered optimal positioning. Guidelines for arm positioning are based on anatomical considerations, expert opinion, and equivocal evidence, which mostly consists of case reports and small trials [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. We agree with generally accepted recommendations that the arms should be abducted less than 90 degrees, to avoid stretching the brachial plexus across the head of the humerus in the axilla.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ulnar nerve</strong> – The optimal position for the forearm with the arm abducted is unclear, though the goal should be to eliminate or minimize pressure on the ulnar nerve in the ulnar groove at the elbow. This may be accomplished with supination or a neutral arm position and should be individualized based on patient anatomy [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In one study of awake volunteers, both supination and the neutral position of the forearm resulted in less pressure over the ulnar nerve than pronation [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Arms adducted along the patient's side are usually placed in a neutral position, with the palm facing the patient. Similar to positioning with the arms abducted, no particular forearm position has been shown to reduce nerve injury. When the arms are abducted, the padded arm board should support the upper arm at the same level as the operating table mattress, to avoid impingement at the edge of the mattress. The forearm should be slightly flexed to avoid hyperextension at the elbow  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110789" href="/d/graphic/110789.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Radial nerve</strong> –<strong> </strong>The radial nerve is rarely injured but is theoretically at risk for compression as it runs in the spiral groove of the humerus in the posterior upper arm, between the heads of the triceps muscle.

Most commonly, with level prone positioning, there is a reduction in cardiac index, which has been attributed to reduction in venous return to the heart and reduced left ventricular compliance as a result of increased intrathoracic pressure [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. Abdominal compression in the prone position can cause vena caval compression, reduction in venous return with resultant hypotension, venous stasis, and increased pressure in the epidural venous plexus.

Lateral rotation of the head and neck can stretch the roots of the cervical plexus and the neurovascular bundle at the head of the humerus and can compress the nerves and vessels between the clavicle and first rib.

The variant of the sitting position that is used for shoulder surgery is often called the beach chair position  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113969" href="/d/graphic/113969.html" rel="external">figure 24</a>).

Advantages for the surgeon include improved surgical exposure [<a href="#rid63">63</a>] and possibly reduced blood loss during neurosurgical procedures [<a href="#rid64">64</a>], and access to the shoulder with improved mobility of the joint, and less blood in the surgical field for orthopedic surgeries.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H400335488"><span class="h2">Physiologic effects of sitting position</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cardiovascular effects</strong> – Cardiovascular changes are the most important physiologic effects of the sitting position. Venous pooling in the lower extremities, along with the vasodilation and myocardial depression that accompany general anesthesia, can produce a decrease in cardiac preload, stroke volume, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and cerebral perfusion pressure [<a href="#rid65">65</a>]. Hemodynamic changes can be mitigated by intravenous fluid administration, positioning with the hips flexed and the legs elevated, compression stockings, and gradual, incremental head elevation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cerebral perfusion</strong> – A number of cases of stroke, ischemic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and death have been reported in patients who had shoulder surgery in the beach chair position [<a href="#rid66">66,67</a>]. The incidence of catastrophic neurologic injury in this setting is unknown and appears to be very low [<a href="#rid68">68,69</a>]. The incidence of more minor neurologic injury is also unknown.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Efforts to prevent neurologic injury in the beach chair position have focused on the maintenance of cerebral perfusion and oxygenation. The effects of the sitting position on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation are complex and are not completely understood. As the head is raised above the heart in unanesthetized patients, cerebral perfusion pressure decreases by approximately 15 percent, and systemic vascular resistance increases by 50 to 80 percent to compensate [<a href="#rid70">70</a>]. General anesthesia usually blunts such compensatory mechanisms, and cerebral hypoperfusion can result [<a href="#rid35">35,65</a>]. Hypocapnia associated with mechanical ventilation results in cerebral vasoconstriction and may further reduce cerebral perfusion [<a href="#rid71">71</a>].

However, there is wide individual variation in the range of autoregulation [<a href="#rid72">72</a>], among surgical patients in general, and in patients in the beach chair position in particular [<a href="#rid73">73</a>]. In some patients (eg, patients with chronic hypertension, older patients) the set point for autoregulation is increased [<a href="#rid74">74</a>]. Thus, a MAP significantly higher than 50 mmHg may be required to prevent cerebral ischemia in the sitting position, and without definitive evidence to support a specific goal blood pressure, we maintain a MAP &gt;70 mmHg for patients in this position.

Several studies have reported a high incidence of cerebral desaturation, measured by near infrared spectroscopy, in patients placed in the beach chair position for shoulder surgery [<a href="#rid75">75-78</a>]. In one study, cerebral oxygen saturation (SctO2) was measured in 140 patients who underwent shoulder surgery, one-half in the beach chair position and one-half in the lateral decubitus position. Cerebral desaturation events, defined as ≥20 percent decrease from baseline or absolute value ≤55 percent) occurred in 80 percent of patients in the beach chair position compared with 0 percent in the patients in lateral decubitus position [<a href="#rid78">78</a>]. There were no difference is hemodynamic variables.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Management of ventilation during anesthesia is known to affect cerebral blood flow and may affect cerebral oxygenation in the beach chair position. In one study including 56 anesthetized patients in the beach chair position, increasing end tidal carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) from 30 to 45 mmHg, combined with increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen from 0.3 to 1.0, resulted in an increase in regional cerebral oxygenation from 68 to 75 percent [<a href="#rid77">77</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The clinical implications of cerebral desaturation events are unclear, and cerebral desaturation events have not been correlated with neurologic injury. One prospective observational study of patients who had intravenous general anesthesia for shoulder surgery found that cerebral desaturation events were associated with worse scores on two of three neurobehavioral tests at 24 hours after surgery [<a href="#rid79">79</a>]. Postoperative cognitive function, measured with the Mini Mental State Examination, was similar between groups. Further study is required before recommending the routine measurement of cerebral oximetry for patients in the beach chair position.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Goal blood pressure</strong> – Definitive, evidence-based guidelines for management of blood pressure, with the goal of maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion in the sitting position, have not been established. This issue is particularly important when surgeons request induced hypotension to improve surgical conditions. We suggest correcting MAP measurements for the hydrostatic difference between the blood pressure cuff and the brain for patients in the sitting position, and we aggressively treat blood pressure values below 80 percent of the preoperative resting values, while maintaining a MAP &gt;70 mmHg. We aim for the patient's baseline blood pressure for older patients, hypertensive patients, and others at risk for cerebrovascular disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">It is widely accepted that blood pressure should be measured at the level of the brain (ie, the transducer zeroed at the external auditory meatus) when intraarterial pressure monitoring is used and that noninvasive blood pressure should be corrected for the difference in hydrostatic pressure between the cuff and the brain. This would mean that for every 1 cm difference between the cuff and the auditory meatus, MAP would be 0.77 mmHg lower at the brain than measured by the cuff (ie, 1 mmHg for every 1.25 cm). Using this calculation, a patient in the beach chair position with the external auditory meatus 30 cm above the midpoint of the blood pressure cuff, MAP at the brain would be unacceptably low, at approximately 47 mmHg, with a MAP of 70 mmHg as measured by the cuff.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Effect of anesthetic technique</strong> – Cerebral desaturation events may be less likely during regional anesthesia in the beach chair position compared with general anesthesia [<a href="#rid80">80-82</a>]. In one observation study, cerebral desaturation (ie, SctO2 decrease &gt;20 percent from baseline) occurred in 58 percent of patients who had general anesthesia in the beach chair position, compared with no desaturation events if regional anesthesia was used [<a href="#rid83">83</a>]. The reasons for less cerebral desaturation with regional anesthesia are unclear but may include better preservation of blood pressure and higher partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) during regional anesthesia. Cerebral desaturation with general anesthesia may be unrelated to effects on blood flow. In one study, cerebral blood flow was measured by carotid Doppler in 40 patients randomly assigned to general or regional anesthesia for shoulder surgery [<a href="#rid84">84</a>]. MAP was maintained at &gt;70 mmHg, and there was no difference in cerebral blood flow between the two groups.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">We prefer to use regional anesthesia when possible for shoulder surgery in the beach chair position.
