Because biochemical marker screening for Down syndrome involves measuring levels of the same markers that perform well for detecting trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome, the second most common autosomal trisomy among live births), biochemical marker screening tests provide risk assessment for both of these chromosomal abnormalities. Some biochemical marker screening tests also provide risk assessment for trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome). Testing for cell-free DNA in maternal blood is another method for screening for Down syndrome, as well as trisomies 18 and 13 and other genetic abnormalities. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/458.html" rel="external">"Prenatal screening for common aneuploidies using cell-free DNA"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/134618.html" rel="external">"Cell-free DNA screening for fetal conditions other than the common aneuploidies"</a>.)</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of issues relating to prenatal screening for and diagnosis of Down syndrome. The clinical and genetic characteristics, medical care, and prognosis for children with these syndromes are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/452.html" rel="external">"Congenital cytogenetic abnormalities", section on 'Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome)'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2917.html" rel="external">"Down syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2938.html" rel="external">"Down syndrome: Management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H94717330"><span class="h1">RATIONALE FOR SCREENING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Protocols for prenatal screening for Down syndrome have been implemented because:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The prevalence of trisomy 21, 18, and 13 in live births in the United States in the absence of screening, diagnosis, and termination is approximately 1 in 500, 1 in 4000, and 1 in 7000, respectively. Corresponding rates in the late first trimester are 1 in 340, 1 in 1100, and 1 in 3500, respectively. Prevalence increases with advancing maternal age  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75423" href="/z/d/graphic/75423.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). There are no strong data to suggest that these rates vary by other epidemiological factors, but available data are limited by multiple confounders [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The burden of disease for the affected individual and their family can be significant.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Accurate prenatal diagnostic tests are readily available.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prenatal diagnosis gives parents options: an opportunity to plan for the birth of an affected child or pregnancy termination.</p><p></p><p>There is little high-quality information regarding the personal and family risks of screening. Adverse psychological effects include fear of discovering an affected fetus and anxiety about possible complications from diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, particularly procedure-related loss of an unaffected fetus. Most parents are anxious when they receive a screening test result indicating increased risk of aneuploidy, even though the result is not definitive/diagnostic. Anxiety is reduced when a diagnostic procedure shows an unaffected fetus [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], but patients who experience a false-positive screening result (screening showed an increased risk but the fetus was unaffected) are less likely to choose screening in a subsequent pregnancy [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Patients may also have anxiety about the possibility of a falsely reassuring result (false-negative, ie, screening did not detect an increased risk for an affected fetus).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H94717344"><span class="h1">COUNSELING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The key principle when counseling patients about prenatal screening for Down syndrome is to provide easily understood, complete information that allows them to make informed screening and diagnostic testing decisions based upon their values, beliefs, and the issues that they feel most important [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. It should be clear that any testing is voluntary.</p><p>Counseling should be nondirective (without pressure or coercion as to what the patient's decision should be) so that patients can balance the risks, limitations, and benefits of prenatal screening and diagnosis with the issues involved in raising a child with a chromosomal abnormality versus pregnancy termination or releasing the child for adoption. </p><p>Basic information on prenatal screening and diagnosis can be given to patients individually, in a group session, or with decision aids. In a randomized trial of the three approaches, couples were most satisfied with individual counseling, but those in group sessions showed a significantly greater increase in knowledge from pre- to postintervention questionnaires than those assigned to the other two approaches [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Provision of written information targeted at the eighth grade reading level is desirable to ensure that patients have a clear understanding about all of the relevant issues.</p><p>Patients weigh information provided during counseling differently and come to individual decisions regarding whether to undergo prenatal screening and which test to have. Referral to a genetic counselor or a medical geneticist can be helpful for addressing patients' concerns and facilitate their decision-making process for diagnostic testing.</p><p>The following specific information related to prenatal screening is discussed, as appropriate, during pre- and postscreening visits [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An explanation of the difference between a screening test and a diagnostic test.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The option of diagnostic testing instead of screening.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The option of no testing at all.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Potential consequences of prenatal screening and diagnosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A description of the performance of available screening and diagnostic tests, including limitations and detection rates for Down syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities.

A 2020 survey of US laboratories found that over 1.3 million pregnancies were screened using biochemical markers [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Although this represents an estimated 62 percent reduction in serum screening compared with a similar 2012 report [<a href="#rid10">10</a>], it still represents about one-third of all US pregnancies.

In 2020, first-trimester screens, second-trimester screens, and screening tests utilizing results in both trimesters accounted for 36, 48, and 16 percent of US serum screening tests, respectively [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2959825032"><span class="h3">First-trimester combined test</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The combined test includes both sonographic determination of NT and determination of biochemical markers associated with aneuploidy: pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and free-beta or total hCG. In most patients, both ultrasound and biochemical marker screening are performed at 11+0 to 13+6 weeks of gestation. However, some protocols allow for earlier collection of the serum sample (beginning at 9+0 weeks) with the ultrasound performed later (10+3 to 13+6 weeks). If the combined test is offered, chorionic villus sampling (CVS) should be available for definitive prenatal diagnosis. Waiting several weeks after a screen-positive combined test result to have an amniocentesis at 15 weeks of gestation or later should be avoided.

Patients whose screen does not place them at very high risk go on to complete the second-trimester portion of the test.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The advantage of this approach is that patients at highest risk benefit from early detection of affected fetuses while those at lower risk benefit from the high detection rate and low false-positive rates gained by adding the second-trimester screening markers.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3880873871"><span class="h2">Cell free DNA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A screening test utilizing cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in maternal blood is also a reasonable option for screening and has become more common over time. The methods used and the disorders that can be identified vary widely. All screen for the common autosomal trisomies (21, 18, 13). Many also offer screening for fetal sex and sex chromosome abnormalities such as 45X, 47XXY, 47XYY and 47XXX. Some whole-genome methods screen for rare autosomal trisomies such as trisomy 16. Some cfDNA tests have the option of screening for specific and larger microdeletions such as 22q11.2, 1p36 deletions and microdeletions responsible for Prader-Willi, Cri-du-chat, and Angelman syndromes. As the screening targets expand, the false-positive rate will increase and the positive-predictive values will tend to decrease due to the low prevalence of these conditions.</p><p>Two prospective observational studies have provided support for offering cfDNA screening to all pregnant patients who desire screening [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. In one of these studies, over 15,000 pregnant patients presenting for aneuploidy screening at 10+0 to 13+6 weeks of gestation at 35 international centers underwent both serum biochemical marker screening with measurement of NT and cfDNA screening regardless of their baseline risk of aneuploidy (mean maternal age 31 years) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. cfDNA screening had higher sensitivity for detection of Down syndrome (38/38 [100 percent] versus 30/38 [78.9 percent]), a lower false-positive rate (0.06 versus 5.4 percent), and a higher positive predictive value (80.9 versus 3.4 percent). Other studies have affirmed the high sensitivity and specificity of this test in both high- and low-risk populations [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists supports consideration of cfDNA for all pregnant patients as a screening test option [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].

There are limited data regarding screening in triplet pregnancies. These pregnancies can be offered cfDNA screening, with the caveat that the test failure rate may be as high as 20 percent. However, performance when the test is successful may approach that reported in twin pregnancies [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].

A secondary screening test aims to collect additional information about risk that screen-positive patients can use in deciding whether to proceed to diagnostic testing or forgo further testing because the additional information of the secondary test has greatly reduced the risk reported by the initial screening test.</p><p>For patients who have not undergone a cell-free DNA (cfDNA) test for initial screening, secondary screening is best performed with this test. Because of the high sensitivity and very low false-positive rate of cfDNA tests, many patients with false-positive biochemical marker tests will be reclassified as screen-negative with minimal risk of misclassification of true positives. Patients who choose secondary screening with a cfDNA test and are secondary screen-positive should be offered an invasive test for definitive diagnosis because false-positive results are still possible (&lt;0.1 percent [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]).</p><p>Alternatively, a patient who screens positive on a biochemical marker-based test may decide that they want a definitive diagnosis as quickly as possible, which can be provided by invasive testing (chorionic villus sampling, or amniocentesis) and a karyotype or chromosomal microarray analysis. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef100492" href="/z/d/graphic/100492.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). After a positive screening test, it is helpful for parents to meet with a genetic counselor to inform them of their diagnostic and management options and answer questions.</p><p>Biochemical marker screening tests should not be repeated [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Repeat testing of the entire population would result in only a small increase in detection rates but is not justified because of the expense and risk of false reassurance or confusion. Repeat biochemical marker testing limited to only screen-positive patients can reduce the false-positive rate, but a small percentage of affected pregnancies will be incorrectly reclassified as screen-negative. However, it is prudent to double-check the laboratory form to make sure the patient's age, weight, gestational age, and other important factors, such as family history, were recorded correctly, as these can affect the risk calculation. If an ultrasound examination has not been done, it should be performed to confirm gestational age and exclude other causes of a screen-positive test (eg, multiple gestation, some congenital anomalies).

In the second trimester, amniocentesis is performed to obtain fetal cells (amniocytes) and a conventional karyotype analysis is generally obtained. A rapid targeted result may be available within two days, but complete karyotype results from cultured cells take approximately 8 to 14 days. When performed at a high-volume, experienced center, the procedure-related pregnancy loss rate for amniocentesis and CVS is estimated to range from approximately 1 in 300 to 1 in 1000 (0.1 to 0.3 percent) [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].

In addition, patients should have the option of choosing an invasive procedure for primary diagnostic testing (ie, without initial screening), regardless of maternal age. A primary diagnostic test is a reasonable choice for those at high risk of Down syndrome. Patients can also choose to decline screening and diagnostic testing.

Diagnostic testing by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or secondary screening by cfDNA must be available to follow-up screen-positive results. An additional measurement of alpha-fetoprotein or ultrasound screening is recommended in the second trimester for detection of open neural tube defects. (See <a class="local">'First-trimester combined test'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Quadruple test</strong> – The quadruple test was the most commonly used serum-based Down syndrome screening test in the United States in 2020. It is the best screening test for patients who present for prenatal care in the second trimester. It provides screening for both Down syndrome and open neural tube defects. (See <a class="local">'Second-trimester quadruple test'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Full integrated test</strong> – Among serum-based screening tests, the full integrated has the highest detection rate for Down syndrome, the lowest rate of procedure-related losses per patient screened  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119540" href="/z/d/graphic/119540.html" rel="external">table 4</a>), and includes screening for open neural tube defects. The serum integrated test has the highest detection rate for any serum screening test in which nuchal translucency measurement is not used. (See <a class="local">'Tests integrated across the first and second trimesters'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Stepwise sequential screening</strong> – Stepwise sequential screening offers the advantages of the integrated test but allows those patients at very high risk (&lt;2 percent) to receive an early diagnosis. (See <a class="local">'Tests integrated across the first and second trimesters'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management of screening results</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Screen-positive result</strong> – A screen-positive result means the fetus is at increased risk of Down syndrome (or some other condition). After a positive screening test, it is helpful to have the parents meet with a genetic counselor to inform them of their diagnostic and management options, including information about the natural history of the specific condition.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">After a positive biochemical or ultrasound marker screening test, cfDNA testing may be offered as a secondary screening test. Because of the high specificity and sensitivity of the cfDNA test, many patients with false-positive biochemical marker tests will be reclassified as screen-negative with minimal risk of misclassification of true positives. Alternatively, patients may choose to have a diagnostic test. (See <a class="local">'Screen-positive test result'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Patients who undergo cfDNA screening as their initial screening test and are screen positive should be offered invasive testing for definitive diagnosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Screen-negative result</strong> – A screen-negative result means the fetus is at low risk of Down syndrome as defined by a specific laboratory cutoff. No further testing is indicated, although a negative screen cannot completely exclude the possibility of Down syndrome. A negative screen also does not exclude the possibility of a fetus with a chromosomal abnormality other than Down syndrome but detectable with diagnostic testing. cfDNA and first-trimester screening tests do not provide a risk assessment for open neural tube defects. (See <a class="local">'Screen-negative test result'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prenatal care and course of pregnancy in cases of Down syndrome</strong> – Ongoing pregnancies with fetal trisomy are at increased risk for fetal demise. For Down syndrome, it is estimated that the risk of fetal demise between chorionic villus sampling and delivery is 30 to 50 percent, between diagnostic amniocentesis and delivery is up to 30 percent, and between 24 weeks and delivery is 7.4 percent, excluding planned pregnancy terminations. (See <a class="local">'Risk of spontaneous fetal demise'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care are provided according to usual obstetric standards. Ultrasound examination at 18 to 22 weeks is the optimum time to evaluate the fetus for congenital anomalies (particularly cardiac abnormalities) associated with Down syndrome. (See <a class="local">'Pregnancy management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H94717465"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Jacob A Canick, PhD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Cuckle H, Benn P.
