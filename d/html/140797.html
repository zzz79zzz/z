         Sarcomas are malignant tumors that arise from skeletal and extraskeletal connective tissues, including the peripheral nervous system. They can arise from mesenchymal tissue at any site.
        </p>

         This topic will discuss radiation therapy (RT) techniques for the management of primary soft tissue sarcoma (STS) arising in the extremities and superficial trunk (chest wall, flank, abdominal wall, and paraspinal musculature). Other topics on the presentation and management of STS are discussed separately.

         The intent of radiation therapy (RT) is to achieve a maximal dose to the tumor while minimizing the exposure of RT-sensitive critical structures to high doses. RT techniques have evolved from the use of three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) to more advanced approaches, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), which more optimally targets tumors that are composed of complex concavities or wrap-around critical structures [
         <a href="#rid1">

         For most patients with primary soft tissue sarcoma (STS) of the extremities and superficial trunk and an indication for RT, we suggest IMRT rather than other RT techniques (conventional external beam radiation therapy [EBRT] or brachytherapy) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Studies demonstrate that the delivery of conformal RT using IMRT produces superior dose distributions compared with 3D-CRT for both dose conformity around the tumor and dose reduction to specified critical normal structures. IMRT is also associated with improved local control relative to EBRT [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ] or brachytherapy [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. However, IMRT may increase low-intermediate doses to some normal tissues that otherwise might not be irradiated [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Data supporting the efficacy and tolerability of IMRT in patients with extremity STS are as follows:

         In one observational series of 319 patients with extremity STS, IMRT was compared with conventional EBRT [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. IMRT was associated with a higher five-year local control rate relative to conventional EBRT (92 versus 85 percent), despite the fact that patients treated with IMRT had higher-grade lesions and more close or positive margins [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. IMRT also did not increase treatment-related morbidity rates relative to conventional EBRT and demonstrated lower rates of grade ≥2 radiation dermatitis (31 versus 49 percent). Although IMRT was associated with higher rates of grade ≥2 nerve damage, the risk was low overall (3.5 versus 1.6 percent).

         In a phase II study of 70 patients with lower extremity STS, the use of preoperative IMRT designed to spare the surgical flap reduced the risk of acute wound healing complications, especially when the radiation planning target volume did not extend into the planned surgical flap, and allowed more primary wound closures [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>

         Brachytherapy is used less frequently at most centers, as observational data suggest lower rates of local disease control relative to IMRT [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Brachytherapy may be appropriate in select situations when a short radiation treatment time is preferred, and a technically acceptable brachytherapy catheter placement can be achieved intraoperatively. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/109748.html" rel="external">
          "Surgical resection of primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities", section on 'Brachytherapy'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Brachytherapy minimizes the radiation dose to surrounding normal tissues, maximizes the dose delivered to the tumor, and shortens treatment times relative to preoperative or postoperative EBRT. In the usual schedule, treatment is completed within six days and requires one hospitalization. Afterloading catheters are placed in a target area of the tumor operative bed, defined by the surgeon, and spaced at 1 cm intervals to cover the entire area of risk. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/109748.html" rel="external">

         The addition of adjuvant brachytherapy to surgery alone improved local control in a randomized phase III trial. However, observational data suggest that brachytherapy has lower rates of local disease control relative to IMRT. Data are as follows:

         In a phase III trial, 164 patients with a completely resected extremity or superficial trunk STS (45 low-grade, 119 high-grade) were randomly assigned to either postoperative low dose-rate brachytherapy (45 Gy) or no brachytherapy [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. At a median follow-up of 76 months, the addition of adjuvant brachytherapy to surgery improved five-year local control rates (82 and 69 percent), but this advantage was seen only in patients with high-grade (five-year local control 89 versus 66 percent) and not the low-grade subtypes. There was no difference in distant metastasis or disease-specific survival for the two treatment arms, regardless of histology.

         In a subsequent retrospective study of 134 patients with localized soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities, IMRT was associated with improved five-year local control rate relative to brachytherapy (92 versus 82 percent), despite the fact that patients treated with IMRT had somewhat worse prognostic tumor features [
         <a href="#rid4">

        <p>
         Proton beam RT has been used to deliver highly conformal RT doses to sarcomas of the base of the skull and spine, as well as pediatric rhabdomyosarcomas. Since experience is limited, it is not clear if there is an advantage for protons for all patients with extremity STS. Although proton beam RT may be effective in select patients (eg, those with large proximal thigh tumors and/or lesions closely approximated to joints [
         <a href="#rid11">

         For primary soft tissue sarcoma (STS) of the extremities and superficial trunk, radiation therapy (RT) should be carefully planned so that the tissues being irradiated are only those judged to be at risk for malignancy. To use smaller planning target volumes, the part to be irradiated must be securely and reproducibly immobilized. We use custom immobilization devices prepared for each patient. This may require casting, especially for hand, foot, or elbow sites. For some sites, the part is placed in standard plastic supports, and the extremity fastened tightly in place using a hook and loop fastener (eg, Velcro). Others describe their experience with vacuum lock bags [
         <a href="#rid12">

         Preoperative radiation is delivered to a single clinical target volume. Although controversial, a reduced field is sometimes delivered postoperatively in the setting of a histologically positive margin. For postoperative radiation, we use a "shrinking treatment volume technique" with a series of progressively smaller target volumes, with the highest dose being administered to the tumor bed itself.

         Data are evolving to determine the optimal clinical target volume (CTV). Prior to the routine use of MRI, radiation fields traditionally included a generous longitudinal margin of 5 to 10 cm beyond the gross tumor. However, CTVs have reduced over time, based on subsequent studies demonstrating good local control and toxicity profiles [

          17

         For preoperative RT, the gross tumor volume (GTV) is defined using T1-weighted, gadolinium-enhanced MRI. An anatomically constrained (ie, does not need to extend into bone or beyond a fascial barrier) 1.5 cm radial and 3 to 4 cm craniocaudal expansion (along the long axis of muscle) are suggested for the CTV that, if feasible, should also include any tumor-associated edema seen on the T2-weighted MRI. If local control for the treatment approach used in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0630 remains high at further follow-up, smaller target volumes might be considered [

         For postoperative RT, a similar expansion on the "tumor bed" is recommended for the elective CTV, which should also include the surgically manipulated tissues, as well as the surgical scar and drain site, if feasible. (See

         Studies are ongoing to evaluate the effect of reduced CTVs on efficacy and long-term toxicity. Data on carefully selected patients treated with surgery alone show excellent local control in tumors with the closest negative surgical margin of 1 cm or more [

         ]. Sarcoma cells were identified histologically in the tissues beyond the tumor in 10 of 15 cases. In 9 of 10 cases, the tumor cells were in areas of edema as imaged on T2-weighted MRI scans. In six cases, tumor cells were located within 1 cm of the tumor margin, and in four cases, malignant cells were found at a distance greater than 1 cm and up to a maximum of 4 cm.

PTV expansion was 5 to 7 mm, and &gt;95 percent of the dose was delivered to the PTV. The median preoperative RT dose was 50 Gy. Postoperative boost of 10 to 20 Gy was given to 12 patients (six with positive margins and six with close margins).

         No local recurrences were observed in patients whose surgical margins were &gt;1 mm. However, three patients (all with positive margins) experienced local failure as first relapse (two isolated, one with distant failure), and two additional patients (all with margin &lt;1 mm) had late local failure after distant metastasis. The local failures were within the CTV in three patients and within and extending beyond the CTV in two.

If this caused the field to extend beyond the compartment, the field could be shortened to include the end of a compartment plus a margin of 1 cm. The radial margin from the lesion for low-grade tumors and for intermediate- and high-grade tumors &lt;8 cm was 1 cm, and it was 1.5 cm for intermediate- and high-grade tumors &gt;8 cm, including any portion of the tumor not confined by an intact fascial barrier, or uninvolved bone or skin surface.

         A randomized study (VORTEX) also suggested that reducing the CTV of tissue treated with postoperative RT results in similar clinical outcomes when compared with larger target volumes. In this study, 216 patients with extremity STS who were candidates for tumor resection and postoperative RT were randomly assigned to either an initial larger CTV extending 5 cm proximally and distally on the tumor bed or 1 cm beyond the scar (whichever is longer in the craniocaudal direction) and a minimum margin of 2 cm axially to 50 Gy, followed by a reduced field with a 2 cm craniocaudal margin on the tumor bed GTV and minimum margin of 2 cm axially for another 16 Gy; or to the single reduced field for the entire 66 Gy [

         Hypofractionated radiation therapy refers to the use of larger daily doses (&gt;2 Gy) delivered over a shorter time (less than five weeks) than conventional fractionation (50 Gy, 2 Gy per fraction). Several hypofractionated regimens, such as ultrahypofractionation and moderate hypofractionation, are under investigation as preoperative radiation therapy regimens for non-metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Some regimens appear promising, but further studies and longer follow-up are necessary to confirm safety and efficacy.

          Indications for radiation therapy
         </strong>
         – For patients with primary soft tissue sarcoma (STS) of the extremities and superficial trunk, the indications for preoperative and postoperative radiation therapy (RT) are discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7734.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of multimodality treatment for primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and superficial trunk", section on 'Radiation therapy'

         <strong>
          Goals of radiation therapy planning
         </strong>
         – For patients with primary STS of the extremities and superficial trunk who receive RT, treatment should be carefully planned so that the tissues being irradiated are only those judged to be at risk for malignancy. Principal tasks for developing the RT treatment plan include achieving the most conformal dose distribution that covers the target volume while maximally sparing adjacent normal structures, among others. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Radiation treatment planning'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Radiation therapy techniques
         </strong>
         – For most patients with STS of the extremities and superficial trunk who receive RT, we suggest intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) rather than other RT techniques (conventional external beam radiation therapy [EBRT] or brachytherapy) (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). This approach offers superior dose distributions (for both dose conformity around the tumor and dose reduction to specified critical normal structures) and is associated with higher local control rates. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Intensity-modulated radiation therapy'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Brachytherapy may be appropriate in select situations when a short radiation treatment time is preferred, and a technically acceptable brachytherapy catheter placement can be achieved intraoperatively. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Brachytherapy'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Preoperative radiation therapy
         </strong>
         – For patients treated with preoperative RT, we suggest using the standard dose of 50 Gy administered in 25 fractions over five weeks (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ), followed four to six weeks later by a conservative resection. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Preoperative treatment and doses'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          No preoperative RT
         </strong>
         – For patients undergoing resection and postoperative RT only (ie, no preoperative RT), treatment usually begins approximately four to six weeks following surgery once the surgical wound has healed. The following final total postoperative doses are used (see
         <a class="local">
          'Postoperative techniques and doses'

          Preoperative RT with positive surgical margins

         – For patients treated with 50 Gy preoperative RT followed by resection with positive microscopic surgical margins alone, we do not offer a postoperative RT boost, as data are controversial for its utility in this setting.
