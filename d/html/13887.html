A systematic approach is necessary to reach a correct diagnosis and to identify serious underlying etiologies. The patient’s age, underlying disease conditions, visual history, and history of possible injury must be determined. The extent of the visual impairment, the rapidity of its onset, and the association with other systemic findings are vital pieces of information. </p><p>This topic will review the causes of vision change (eg, diplopia, blurry vision). The approach to a child with vision loss is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6441.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to acute vision loss in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23489632"><span class="h1">CAUSES OF DIPLOPIA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When a child complains of diplopia, a prompt evaluation should be initiated. Younger children may not be able to complain of diplopia. Instead, they may squint, cover one eye with their hand, or use an abnormal head posture for viewing. Diplopia may be binocular or monocular (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5238.html" rel="external">"Overview of diplopia", section on 'Diplopia'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Binocular diplopia is present with both eyes open and absent when either eye is closed. Binocular diplopia reflects conditions in which the visual axes are misaligned. In general, most patients will close the eye with the poorer vision or, if vision is equal, the eye with the dysfunctional muscle. Binocular diplopia will be discussed here.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Monocular diplopia is present if the diplopia occurs when a person is viewing with only one eye. This condition is less common and is typically caused by corneal surface irregularity, crystalline lens anomalies, or refractive error.</p><p></p><p>The extraocular muscles are innervated by cranial nerve III except for the superior oblique (cranial nerve IV) and the lateral rectus (cranial nerve VI) muscles  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62010" href="/z/d/graphic/62010.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Any condition that results in palsy of the third, fourth, or sixth cranial nerves can cause binocular diplopia [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p>Other potential etiologies include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Conditions associated with transient loss of control of eye movements (eg, ocular migraine, seizures, drug intoxication [eg, ethanol, benzodiazepines, sedative-hypnotic medications])</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mass lesions of the orbit (eg, orbital tumors, hematoma, or infection)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ocular muscle weakness, restriction, or malfunction (eg, myasthenia gravis, tick paralysis, botulism, orbital floor fracture with entrapment) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decompensated phoria (tendency for eyes to converge or diverge), a form of acquired strabismus in which a child with an ocular phoria has worsened to a fixed ocular tropia (a persistent ocular misalignment) that is manifest and can cause acute, constant, or intermittent diplopia (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6269.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of strabismus in children"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21270644"><span class="h2">Third cranial nerve palsy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Third nerve palsy in children often is congenital (intrauterine or birth-related events) but may occur after postnatal trauma, infection, inflammation, tumor, or childhood migraine  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71965" href="/z/d/graphic/71965.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6258.html" rel="external">"Third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy in children", section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with acquired third nerve palsies usually complain of the sudden onset of binocular horizontal, vertical, or oblique diplopia, oftentimes with an ipsilateral ptosis. Children with congenital third nerve palsies may not complain of diplopia because they ignore or suppress the second image or because they have superimposed amblyopia; often they are brought to medical attention by their parents/caregivers, who have noticed ptosis or strabismus. Patients with third nerve palsy may have one or more of the following findings (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6258.html" rel="external">"Third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy in children", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ptosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59305" href="/z/d/graphic/59305.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Primary position exotropia (eye turned out) which worsens with gaze toward the paretic medial rectus muscle  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55347" href="/z/d/graphic/55347.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ipsilateral hypertropia (eye is turned up) or hypotropia (eye is turned down), depending on which of the extraocular muscles is most affected</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Complete third nerve palsies usually are associated with a large-angle exotropia and hypotropia (eye is down and out)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21270681"><span class="h2">Fourth cranial nerve palsy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common causes of fourth nerve palsies in children are congenital, traumatic, and idiopathic. Fourth nerve palsies may also accompany intracranial mass lesions (eg, tumor, abscess, hemorrhage)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80378" href="/z/d/graphic/80378.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6268.html" rel="external">"Fourth cranial nerve (trochlear nerve) palsy", section on 'Causes of isolated fourth nerve palsy'</a>.) </p><p>Children with fourth nerve palsies may complain of binocular (ie, present with both eyes open) vertical, torsional diplopia. Objects viewed in primary position or especially in down-gaze may appear double (eg, when going down a flight of stairs so that the child does not know which step to select). </p><p>On examination, an ipsilateral hypertropia (the involved eye is deviated upward) is present because the action of the superior oblique muscle (to move the eye down and in) is weak. The deviation is greater when gaze is in the direction that utilizes the involved muscle. Thus, a right fourth nerve palsy causes greater hypertropia in left gaze and when using an ipsilateral head tilt. The patient may adopt an anomalous head position to avoid diplopia because torsional and vertical diplopia often improve with head tilting to the side opposite the paralyzed muscle  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63202" href="/z/d/graphic/63202.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6268.html" rel="external">"Fourth cranial nerve (trochlear nerve) palsy", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21270688"><span class="h2">Sixth cranial nerve palsy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Dysfunction of the sixth cranial nerve (abducens nerve) can result from lesions occurring anywhere along its path between the sixth nucleus in the dorsal pons to the lateral rectus muscle within the orbit. The lesions may be congenital or acquired  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80526" href="/z/d/graphic/80526.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6256.html" rel="external">"Sixth cranial nerve (abducens nerve) palsy", section on 'Etiologies'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with sixth nerve palsies typically complain of binocular (ie, requires both eyes to be open) horizontal diplopia that worsens with gaze toward the paretic lateral rectus muscle. However, children may not complain of diplopia. Early in the course, strabismus may be present only in the gaze toward the paralyzed side, but with time, the strabismus (ie, esotropia) may be present when gazing straight ahead (primary position) and even in the opposite gaze. The degree of esotropia and abduction deficit are markers of severity of the paresis or palsy and/or secondary contracture of the ipsilateral medial rectus muscle. </p><p>The ocular examination typically reveals a primary position esotropia (eye turned in), worse in gaze toward the paretic muscle (lateral incomitance), and an ipsilateral abduction deficit. The face often is turned toward the paralyzed side to avoid the gaze toward the symptomatic lateral rectus muscle. Other manifestations depend upon the location of the lesion along the course of the nerve  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55159" href="/z/d/graphic/55159.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6256.html" rel="external">"Sixth cranial nerve (abducens nerve) palsy", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21270702"><span class="h2">Migraine</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Migraine headaches are a relatively common cause of visual change in children. Migraine with brainstem aura (formerly basilar-type migraine) is typically occipital, associated with visual disturbances, and accompanied by blurred or tunnel vision, dizziness, ataxia, diplopia, and vomiting. Headache and nausea after such an episode are the rule, but occasionally may be absent. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6202.html" rel="external">"Types of migraine and related syndromes in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3352.html" rel="external">"Migraine with brainstem aura"</a>.)</p><p>Recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy, formerly called ophthalmoplegic migraine, occurs primarily in children and affects the third cranial nerve causing ptosis, pupillary dilation, diplopia, and blurred vision. It may be due to recurrent bouts of demyelination and can take days to weeks to resolve. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3355.html" rel="external">"Overview of craniofacial pain", section on 'Recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16531495"><span class="h2">Seizures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Seizures may also present with visual changes, for example, diplopia, which sometimes manifest as a migraine-like episode. Visual disturbances may also be the only clinical manifestation of childhood occipital epilepsy, but are more commonly associated with more typical seizure activity [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16531502"><span class="h2">Toxic ingestion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children who are intoxicated with benzodiazepines, sedative-hypnotic agents, ethanol, or opioids may have disconjugate gaze and double vision.

Diplopia is variably seen with other types of cerebral venous thrombosis. Underlying etiologies include prothrombotic states, either congenital (eg, antithrombin III deficiency) or acquired (eg, hyperviscosity syndrome); oral contraceptive usage; sinusitis or intraocular infection; Crohn disease [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]; or malignancy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1103.html" rel="external">"Cerebral venous thrombosis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16531604"><span class="h2">Orbital fractures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Blunt orbital trauma (eg, baseball striking the orbit) may cause fracture of the orbital floor ("blowout fracture") with entrapment of orbital fat and sometimes the extraocular muscles, typically the inferior rectus muscle  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53238" href="/z/d/graphic/53238.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). Visual impairment may be limited to double vision when looking in a certain direction, particularly upward and limitation of upward gaze in the affected eye  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79690" href="/z/d/graphic/79690.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). Inspection may show enophthalmos as well. Careful examination of the globe for associated injuries (eg, corneal abrasion, hyphema, corneal or scleral laceration) is also necessary. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6546.html" rel="external">"Orbital fractures", section on 'Orbital floor fracture'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16531612"><span class="h2">Orbital cellulitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Orbital cellulitis can present with double vision in the setting of periorbital swelling and tenderness, erythema, proptosis, pain upon extraocular movement, and rarely, with advanced disease, acute vision loss from compressive optic neuropathy. Orbital cellulitis is most commonly caused by an extension of acute bacterial sinusitis although it may complicate ophthalmic surgery, orbital trauma, and infections of the tear ducts, teeth, or middle ear. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3414.html" rel="external">"Orbital cellulitis", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16531741"><span class="h2">Graves' ophthalmopathy (orbitopathy)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>This condition is also known as thyroid-related ophthalmopathy. Diplopia may occur in children and adolescents with Graves' disease because of initially increased inflammation and accumulation of hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans in the extraocular muscles and retro-orbital connective and adipose tissue  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72169" href="/z/d/graphic/72169.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>) and later restrictive connective tissue changes in the extraocular muscles. Other clinical findings include one or more of the following: a sense of irritation in the eyes; excessive tearing that is often made worse by exposure to cold air, wind, or bright lights; eye or retro-orbital discomfort or pain; blurring of vision; and occasionally loss of vision. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7825.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of thyroid eye disease", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16531620"><span class="h2">Myasthenia gravis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare cause of diplopia in children. The clinical manifestations vary from subtle blurring of vision to severe diplopia. As with all symptoms of myasthenia, the symptoms vary depending on how much use of the muscles is available. Weakness of the eye muscles in MG can also produce ptosis, the degree of which is variable, switching from one eye to the other on separate examinations and occasionally increasing with sudden exposure to bright light. Most patients with MG do not complain of eye pain or headache. Fatigability and variability of clinical findings are characteristic.</p><p>Physical examination may reveal unusual eye movements that do not conform to the anatomy of one nerve or muscle. The pupils are always spared in MG, helping in the differentiation from other disorders, such as botulism. The diagnosis and treatment of myasthenia gravis is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5242.html" rel="external">"Ocular myasthenia gravis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21270710"><span class="h2">Tick paralysis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are more than 800 known species of argasid (soft-shelled) and ixodid (hard-shelled) ticks, and over 40 individual tick species are capable of producing salivary toxins that can cause paralysis in humans and animals. The tick species that cause most cases of human tick paralysis in the United States and Canada are <em>Dermacentor andersonii</em> (the Rocky Mountain wood tick), and <em>D. variabilis</em> (the American dog tick). Tick paralysis occurs four to seven days after a female tick has been feeding on the human host. Paralysis may involve the ocular muscles causing diplopia. It is typically associated with paresthesias, fatigue, and muscle weakness, which progresses to unsteady gait and ascending complete paralysis. However, unilateral and isolated paralysis has also been described.

Conjunctivitis in children is most commonly infectious. Etiologies commonly include non-typable <em>Haemophilus influenza</em>, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, and many different viruses, the most severe of which is adenovirus. Onset is variable, but usually occurs over one or two days, and vision is not greatly impaired. Infectious conjunctivitis may be associated with corneal abrasions due to eye rubbing. Conjunctivitis must also be differentiated from infectious keratitis (inflammation of the cornea). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6907.html" rel="external">"Conjunctivitis", section on 'Classification and epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Allergic conjunctivitis is an IgE mediated Type I hypersensitivity reaction which is sometimes associated with asthma and eczema.

Some patients may not be able to recall a specific event. A younger child may just start crying and holding the eye. Contact lens wearers are at increased risk for developing infectious keratitis. Corneal abrasions may be caused by superficial ocular foreign bodies that are trapped under the eyelids, particularly the upper lid, and cause injury during blinking.
