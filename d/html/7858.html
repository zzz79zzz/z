Thus, a significant number of patients who are undergoing surgery may have concomitant thyroid disease. Although most patients with well-compensated thyroid disease do not need special consideration prior to surgery, patients who have a newly diagnosed thyroid disorder around the time of surgery require a discussion of the risks and benefits of proceeding with surgery.</p><p>The issues surrounding thyroid disease in patients undergoing nonthyroid surgery are discussed here. The management of patients with hyperthyroidism undergoing thyroid surgery is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7880.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of hyperthyroidism", section on 'Preoperative preparation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H492117"><span class="h1">IS PREOPERATIVE MEASUREMENT OF TSH NECESSARY?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Despite the relatively high prevalence of thyroid disease in the general population, we believe there is no need to screen for thyroid disease during the preoperative medical consultation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4816.html" rel="external">"Preoperative medical evaluation of the healthy adult patient"</a>.)</p><p>However, if the history and physical examination are suggestive of thyroid disease, it is reasonable to try to make the diagnosis since it can have effects upon perioperative management. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7847.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7893.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of and screening for hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults"</a>.)</p><p>For patients with known thyroid disease taking thyroid medication, monitoring of thyroid function on at least an annual basis is part of routine care. Adjustments in dosing are made as needed to maintain euthyroidism. In these patients with well-compensated thyroid disease, we and others believe that additional testing prior to surgery is unnecessary, as long as the patient is on a stable dose of medication and euthyroidism was documented within the past three to six months. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7855.html" rel="external">"Treatment of primary hypothyroidism in adults", section on 'Dose and monitoring'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7876.html" rel="external">"Thionamides in the treatment of Graves' disease", section on 'Monitoring'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">HYPOTHYROIDISM</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1974630010"><span class="h2">Clinical manifestations that may impact perioperative outcome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hypothyroidism affects many bodily systems that might influence perioperative outcome [<a href="#rid1">1</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7846.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism"</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The systemic hypometabolism that is associated with hypothyroidism results in a decrease in cardiac output that is mediated by reductions in heart rate and contractility.

In addition, one approach to management is to base therapeutic decisions on the severity of hypothyroidism (see <a class="local">'Management'</a> below). However, the definitions of mild, moderate, and severe hypothyroidism can be vague, and definitions may differ between experts or studies. We find the following definitions useful:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Severe hypothyroidism</strong> – Includes patients with myxedema coma; with severe clinical symptoms of chronic hypothyroidism such as altered mentation, pericardial effusion, or heart failure; or those with very low levels of total thyroxine (T4) (eg, less than 1.0 mcg/dL) or free T4 (eg, less than 0.5 ng/dL) [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Moderate hypothyroidism</strong> – Includes all other patients with overt hypothyroidism (elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], low free T4) without the features of severe hypothyroidism.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mild hypothyroidism</strong> – Includes patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, defined biochemically as a normal serum free T4 concentration in the presence of an elevated serum TSH concentration.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Surgical outcomes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Observational studies evaluating surgical outcomes in patients with subclinical or overt hypothyroidism generally show few adverse effects in patients with mild (subclinical) or moderate hypothyroidism, but adverse outcomes increase with the severity of hypothyroidism.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mild (subclinical) hypothyroidism</strong> – There are few data on surgical outcomes in subclinical hypothyroid patients. In a prospective study comparing postoperative outcomes (after coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) in patients with known preoperative subclinical hypothyroidism (elevated TSH with normal free T4) and euthyroid patients, there were no significant differences in major adverse cardiovascular events or other outcomes (wound problems, mediastinitis, leg infection, respiratory complications) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Similar results were reported in a study of outcomes after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, a Chinese study of 548 patients with subclinical hypothyroidism compared with euthyroid controls found slight, statistically significant increases in impaired wound healing (3.7 versus 1.1 percent) and duration of inotropic support (4 versus 3 days) following coronary bypass surgery [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Another Chinese study of 123 patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and TSH &gt;10 mIU/L found an increased incidence of postoperative infection following knee arthroplasty [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Moderate overt hypothyroidism</strong> – Several studies have investigated the safety of general anesthesia and surgery in patients with untreated or inadequately treated hypothyroidism [<a href="#rid2">2,8-13</a>]. Surprisingly few adverse effects were reported, although the hypothyroid patients had a higher frequency of peri- and postoperative ileus, hypotension, hyponatremia, impaired wound healing, prolonged mechanical ventilation or reintubation, prolonged inotropic support, and central nervous system dysfunction than did the euthyroid patients. They also had less fever during serious infections and increased sensitivity to anesthesia and opiate pain medications.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">As examples:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>One study investigated anesthetic and surgical outcomes in 59 hypothyroid patients and 59 paired euthyroid controls [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. There were no differences between the groups in duration of surgery or anesthesia, lowest temperature and blood pressure recorded during surgery, need for vasopressors, time to extubation, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, incidence of arrhythmias, pulmonary and myocardial infarction, sepsis, need for postoperative respiratory assistance, bleeding complications, or time to hospital discharge.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Another study investigated perioperative complications in 40 patients with mild to moderate hypothyroidism compared with 80 matched controls [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The hypothyroid patients had more intraoperative hypotension in noncardiac surgery and more heart failure in cardiac surgery. They also had more postoperative gastrointestinal and neuropsychiatric complications and were less likely to mount a fever with infection. However, in this study, there were no differences in perioperative blood loss; duration of hospitalization; or the prevalences of perioperative arrhythmia, hypothermia, hyponatremia, delayed anesthetic recovery, abnormal tissue integrity, impaired wound healing, pulmonary complications, or death.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Retrospective and prospective studies of cardiac patients found no adverse outcomes in cardiac patients with mild to moderate hypothyroidism who had cardiac surgery or catheterization without thyroid replacement [<a href="#rid9">9,13</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a Chinese study, 189 patients with known hypothyroidism and thyroid function tests consistent with overt hypothyroidism within two weeks of coronary artery surgery were compared with euthyroid controls [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Hypothyroidism was associated with impaired wound healing (11.8 versus 0.9 percent), increased mechanical ventilation (17 versus 15 hours) and reintubation (2.1 versus 0.4 percent), longer inotropic support (4 versus 3 days), and longer postoperative stay (4 versus 3 days).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Severe hypothyroidism</strong> – Older case studies in the anesthesia literature reported intraoperative hypotension, cardiovascular collapse, and extreme sensitivity to opioids, sedatives, and anesthesia in undiagnosed patients with more severe hypothyroidism, including myxedema [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. In some case reports, myxedema coma is described as a rare postoperative complication in patients with unrecognized severe hypothyroidism [<a href="#rid16">16-19</a>]. This represents a medical emergency with a high mortality rate. The hallmarks of myxedema coma are decreased mental status and hypothermia, but hypotension, bradycardia, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, and hypoventilation are often present as well. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7822.html" rel="external">"Myxedema coma"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the absence of clinical trial data, the management of patients with recently diagnosed hypothyroidism who require surgery is based upon observational data and clinical experience. We base therapeutic decisions on the severity of hypothyroidism.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26596261"><span class="h3">Subclinical hypothyroidism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We suggest not postponing surgery in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (elevated serum TSH, normal free T4). This suggestion is based upon the studies in patients undergoing CABG and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) described above [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Surgical outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p>The degree of thyroid test abnormality that warrants treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9557" href="/z/d/drug information/9557.html" rel="external">levothyroxine</a> is controversial. Selecting individuals for treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7883.html" rel="external">"Subclinical hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults", section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Moderate (overt) hypothyroidism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our approach in patients with moderate hypothyroidism is based upon whether the surgery is urgent or elective and, in addition, upon the retrospective studies cited above [<a href="#rid2">2,8</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Surgical outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Elective surgery</strong> – We suggest postponing elective surgery until the euthyroid state is restored.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Urgent surgery</strong> – We suggest that patients with moderate, overt hypothyroidism undergo urgent surgery without delay, with the knowledge that minor perioperative complications might develop.</p><p></p><p>When a diagnosis of moderate hypothyroidism is made preoperatively, thyroid hormone replacement should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis is made. Generally, young patients are started on close to full replacement doses of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9557" href="/z/d/drug information/9557.html" rel="external">levothyroxine</a> (T4) (1.6 mcg/kg daily), while older patients or patients with cardiopulmonary disease are started on 25 to 50 mcg daily with an increase in dose every two to six weeks. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7855.html" rel="external">"Treatment of primary hypothyroidism in adults", section on 'Initial dose'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Severe hypothyroidism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is a lack of outcome data to direct the care of severely hypothyroid patients in the perioperative period.

If there is concern about existing or precipitating myxedema coma (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54836" href="/z/d/graphic/54836.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), we prefer to treat patients with both triiodothyronine (T3) and T4 to rapidly normalize thyroid function (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7822.html" rel="external">"Myxedema coma"</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>T4 is given in a loading dose of 200 to 300 mcg intravenously followed by 50 mcg daily.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>T3 is given simultaneously in a dose of 5 to 20 mcg intravenously followed by 2.5 to 10 mcg every eight hours depending upon the patient's age and coexistent cardiac risk factors.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Use of an arterial line and Swan-Ganz catheter should be considered if cardiopulmonary disease exists.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Consider adrenal insufficiency</strong> – Rarely, Addison disease will be present in a patient with primary hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In addition, patients with central (secondary) hypothyroidism may have inadequate pituitary adrenal reserve as euthyroidism is restored. If the status of the pituitary adrenal axis is uncertain and deficiency is considered likely, patients should be given stress doses of corticosteroids until the integrity of the axis is ascertained. If the clinical situation permits (ie, surgery can be delayed for an hour), a cosyntropin stimulation test should be performed prior to administering steroids. If the results of the cosyntropin test are normal, stress steroids are not needed and can be discontinued if already given. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/157.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in adults", section on 'ACTH stimulation tests'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/154.html" rel="external">"Determining the etiology of adrenal insufficiency in adults", section on 'Establish the level of defect'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Postoperative concerns</strong> – In the postoperative period, the patient's fluid and electrolyte status, especially the serum sodium, will need to be followed closely. In addition, a high index of suspicion for the development of an ileus, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and an infectious process without the presence of a fever is required.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Cardiovascular surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with hypothyroidism who are scheduled to undergo cardiovascular interventions or surgery require special consideration. The risk of precipitating or worsening unstable coronary syndromes with thyroid hormones conflicts with the concern that untreated hypothyroidism might worsen heart failure or hypotension in the cardiac surgical patient [<a href="#rid9">9,13</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Surgical outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p>Angina is not an absolute contraindication to thyroid hormone replacement if the patient has symptomatic hypothyroidism. In patients with angina treated medically, the dose of T4 should begin with 25 micrograms/day and is increased 25 micrograms every two to six weeks, depending upon response. Most patients with angina have coronary artery revascularization first, and T4 is prescribed afterwards [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In most patients, angina has resolved after revascularization and before T4 has been prescribed, allowing the safe initial administration of a T4 dose that is approximately 50 to 75 percent of the full replacement dose based on body weight and adjusted four to six weeks later. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7855.html" rel="external">"Treatment of primary hypothyroidism in adults", section on 'Older patients or those with coronary heart disease'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Preexisting hypothyroidism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with a history of hypothyroidism receiving chronic T4 therapy who undergo surgery and are unable to eat for several days do not need to be given T4 parenterally. If oral intake cannot be resumed in five to seven days, then T4 should be given intravenously or intramuscularly. The dose should be approximately 70 to 80 percent of the patient's usual oral dose because that is approximately the fraction of oral T4 that is absorbed. We typically give 80 percent. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7855.html" rel="external">"Treatment of primary hypothyroidism in adults", section on 'Surgical patients'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1177151786"><span class="h1">SUSPECTED HYPOTHYROIDISM IN HOSPITALIZED/SERIOUSLY ILL PATIENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Assessment of thyroid function in hospitalized or seriously ill patients can be difficult. Patients who are seriously ill often have abnormal thyroid function tests that may or may not be clinically significant [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. These patients need to be distinguished from those who have clinically significant thyroid dysfunction. In general, thyroid function should not be assessed in seriously ill patients unless there is a strong suspicion of thyroid dysfunction. When thyroid dysfunction is suspected in critically ill patients, measurement of serum TSH alone is not appropriate for the evaluation of thyroid function. Instead, measurement of TSH, total T4, free T4, T3, and sometimes reverse T3 is necessary. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7817.html" rel="external">"Thyroid function in nonthyroidal illness"</a>.)</p><p>The changes in thyroid function during critical illness include the following (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61095" href="/z/d/graphic/61095.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The majority of hospitalized patients have a low serum T3 concentration.

Beta blockers should be continued until the patient's thyroid disease is under control. Intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9829" href="/z/d/drug information/9829.html" rel="external">propranolol</a> (0.5 to 1 mg over 10 minutes followed by 1 to 2 mg over 10 minutes every few hours) can be used to control fever, hypertension, and tachycardia intraoperatively. (See <a class="local">'Beta blockers'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Thionamides</strong> – In addition, once the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease or toxic adenoma/multinodular goiter is established, we suggest starting a thionamide (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>), with the aim of controlling hyperthyroidism in the postoperative period. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9627" href="/z/d/drug information/9627.html" rel="external">Methimazole</a> (10 mg two to three times daily or 20 to 30 mg once daily) is usually preferred to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9830" href="/z/d/drug information/9830.html" rel="external">propylthiouracil</a>, except during the first trimester of pregnancy, because of its longer duration of action (allowing for single daily dosing) and a lesser degree of toxicity. (See <a class="local">'Thionamides'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Potassium iodide for severe hyperthyroidism</strong> – If hyperthyroidism is severe and the need for surgery is urgent, we suggest adding <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9798" href="/z/d/drug information/9798.html" rel="external">potassium iodide solution</a> (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>) (SSKI, one to five drops three times daily) one hour <strong>after</strong> thionamides. Iodide must always be used cautiously. Iodide will not exacerbate hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease in iodine-replete areas, but iodide may worsen hyperthyroidism in patients with toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter if thionamides are not given continuously and, preferably, in divided doses. For patients who are unable to continue oral thionamides, thionamides can be prepared for rectal administration (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79245" href="/z/d/graphic/79245.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Iodine'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Intolerance to thionamides</strong> – For patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism who are allergic to or are intolerant of thionamides, the combination of beta blockers and iodine can be used for preoperative preparation; corticosteroids and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9258" href="/z/d/drug information/9258.html" rel="external">cholestyramine</a> can be added if the hyperthyroidism is severe. Patients with toxic adenoma/multinodular goiter who are allergic to or are intolerant of thionamides should be treated with beta blockers alone, as iodine may worsen hyperthyroidism.
