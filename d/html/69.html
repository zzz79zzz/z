         The stress of surgery can lead to myocardial ischemia or infarction via multiple mechanisms including coronary artery plaque rupture and myocardial demand ischemia. Due to the effects of anesthesia and analgesia, patients with myocardial injury may not present with the usual symptoms of myocardial ischemia or infarction (eg, chest discomfort, electrocardiogram [ECG] changes); many patients only exhibit an elevated troponin level.

         This topic will focus on the evaluation, diagnosis, and distinct aspects of management of patients with perioperative myocardial infarction or myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS). This topic also reviews surveillance for these disorders.

         In patients with myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS), myocardial injury is either due to a supply-demand mismatch, often in the presence of underlying obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), or an acute thrombus [

         A study that evaluated patients who had perioperative myocardial infarction (n = 30) with matched cases who had a spontaneous myocardial infarction (n = 30) identified coronary thrombus with optical coherence tomography as the culprit lesion in 13 percent of patients with perioperative myocardial infarction and 67 percent of patients with spontaneous myocardial infarction [

         Three large prospective cohort studies in which adjudicators attempted to evaluate each case of elevated troponin found that most patients (over 85 percent) with troponin elevations after surgery did not have evidence of a nonischemic etiology (eg, sepsis, pulmonary embolism) and thus elevated troponin was likely due to myocardial ischemia mediated by chronic obstructive CAD or acute thrombus [

         </span>
         In adults ≥45 years of age who undergo inpatient noncardiac surgery (ie, spent at least one day in the hospital), myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) occurs in 15 to 20 percent. Among patients who fulfill the diagnosis of MINS, 20 to 30 percent will also fulfill the diagnostic criteria of perioperative myocardial infarction as defined by the fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction criteria. Only a minority of patients (&lt;15 to 20 percent) with perioperative myocardial injury have nonischemic causes of myocardial injury (eg, sepsis).
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the exact incidence of perioperative myocardial injury and MINS varies based on the risk of myocardial injury in the populations studied, different criteria used to establish the presence of MINS, and the changing sensitivity of troponin assays. For example, among patients with MINS, perioperative myocardial infarction accounts for approximately 40 percent of cases when a non-high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (cTn) assay is used and 20 to 30 percent of cases when a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assay is used [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. The apparent decrease in the fraction of patients with perioperative myocardial infarction results from an increase in the number of patients diagnosed with elevated troponin but without other signs or symptoms of myocardial infarction.
        </p>
        <p>
         The risk of myocardial injury after outpatient surgery is not well studied.
        </p>
        <p>
         Large prospective cohort studies that evaluated the incidence of postoperative myocardial injury, MINS, and postoperative myocardial infarction using high-sensitivity assays (the standard assay in most of the world) include [

         In a prospective study of 2018 patients (2546 noncardiac surgeries) undergoing noncardiac surgery who were ≥65 years of age or ≥45 years with history of CAD, peripheral artery disease, or stroke, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) was prospectively measured before and after surgery [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Perioperative myocardial injury (defined as an absolute increase in hs-cTnT of ≥14 ng/L above the preoperative value) occurred in 397 patients (16 percent), MINS occurred in 342 patients (13 percent), and perioperative myocardial infarction occurred in 117 patients (5 percent). At 30 days, mortality in those with elevated hs-cTnT was 8.9 percent and in those without elevated hs-cTnT was 1.5 percent.

         In the second VISION cohort of 21,842 patients ≥45 years old, hs-cTnT was measured during the first three postoperative days [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Based on the association between hs-cTnT and mortality identified in the data, the authors defined an elevated postoperative hs-cTnT as a value 20 to &lt;65 ng/L with an absolute change of at least 5 ng/L between measurements or a single hs-cTnT level ≥65 ng/L. Using this definition, perioperative myocardial injury was detected in 4385 patients (20 percent), MINS was detected in 3904 patients (17.9 percent), and perioperative myocardial infarction was detected in 846 patients (3.9 percent).

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Among patients with MINS, 3633 patients (93 percent) did not experience an ischemic symptom. Among patients who had a perioperative myocardial infarction, 575 patients (68 percent) did not experience an ischemic symptom. These patients would have likely gone undetected without perioperative troponin screening.

         Patients with perioperative myocardial infarction may have symptoms (rarely) and signs similar to the broad group of patients with an acute coronary syndrome. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/184.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         However, due to the influence of agents with anesthetic, analgesic, or amnestic effects, symptoms of myocardial infarction are often muted, atypical, or absent. Due to variable ECG monitoring, ECG signs of myocardial infarction are often not recorded. As an example, in the international POISE-1 trial, among 415 patients who had a perioperative myocardial infarction, approximately 65 percent of patients did not experience ischemic symptoms [

         In patients who present with typical signs or symptoms of myocardial infarction after surgery, the evaluation of these findings is similar to patients who present with typical signs or symptoms of myocardial infarction in other settings. (See

         Since patients undergoing surgery are at risk for complications that mimic myocardial infarction (eg, pulmonary embolism), patients with undifferentiated signs or symptoms that may represent a new cardiovascular diagnosis (eg, chest discomfort, arrythmias) should undergo appropriate testing for alternative diagnoses as appropriate.

         In patients who underwent postoperative screening and have an elevated troponin level, the approach to evaluation is similar to that in patients who have other signs or symptoms of myocardial infarction. The following tests are obtained:

        </p>
        <p>
         To confirm or exclude the presence of acute perioperative myocardial injury, we compare multiple troponin values and any preoperative values available. (See

          'Diagnosis'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to these tests for myocardial infarction or injury, other tests may be required to evaluate for other causes of elevated troponin (eg, pulmonary embolism) appropriate for patients who recently had surgery. (See
         <a class="local">

         In patients in whom the diagnosis remains uncertain after evaluation of symptoms, ECGs, and repeat troponin assays, additional noninvasive studies (eg, echocardiography, radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging, cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging [CMR]) may be required to confirm or exclude the presence of myocardial infarction. The approach to additional testing in patients who recently underwent surgery is similar to that in patients in the general population, which is discussed separately. (See

        <p>
         In patients diagnosed with myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery who recover from surgery, it is reasonable to obtain stress or anatomic imaging to assess for obstructive CAD unless another clear explanation for an elevated troponin level is present. However, there are no prospective studies that describe the yield of such testing.

         Our approach to surveillance is motivated by studies that suggest that perioperative surveillance detects subclinical postoperative myocardial injury in more than 20 percent of patients undergoing inpatient surgery, the important prognostic relevance of these events and the need to identify these patients for long-term follow-up, and our experience that detection of such events alters patient management. There are no trials of perioperative screening that establish its efficacy. However, without perioperative troponin screening, &gt;90 percent of patients with MINS and &gt;65 percent of patients with perioperative myocardial infarction would escape detection. Patients with MINS should be evaluated for cardiovascular risk factors, treated for any contributing conditions (eg, anemia), considered for medical therapy, and appropriately evaluated for obstructive CAD (eg, stress echocardiography, stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion, coronary computed tomographic angiography).

         In patients who will undergo outpatient surgery (ie, will not stay in the hospital for at least one day) or will undergo inpatient surgery but who do not have high-risk features for postoperative myocardial injury, we do not perform postoperative surveillance. In this group of patients, we only obtain tests for myocardial ischemia or infarction if signs or symptoms are present.

         Some experts suggest that lower-risk patients, such as those with risk factors for cardiovascular disease (eg, smoking, hypertension, or dyslipidemia) not included in the RCRI, should undergo surveillance given the worse short- and long-term outcomes associated with perioperative myocardial infarction [

There are no large trials in patients with perioperative NSTEMI to guide the choice of revascularization strategy. There is indirect evidence from patients with "spontaneous" NSTEMI and small studies from single centers:

Mortality at 30 days was 11.3 percent; the 30-day death rates in the STEMI and NSTEMI cohorts were 31.2 and 8.5 percent, respectively.

         Overall mortality at 30 days and one year was 5.2 and 15 percent, respectively. Risk factors for 30-day mortality after PCI were a bleeding event after PCI (odds ratio [OR] 4.33), peak troponin T level (OR 1.2), and underlying peripheral artery disease (OR 4.86). Important risk predictors for long-term mortality were bleeding after PCI, renal insufficiency, and vascular surgery. The small sample size and retrospective nature of this study limit its external validity.

Some contributors to this topic give an initial dose of 75 mg of aspirin, while others give a higher dose (up to 325 mg) if the risk of bleeding is low. After the initial dose, we begin long-term therapy with aspirin 75 to 81 mg daily. We initiate therapy with a high-dose statin (eg,

         – The evidence for aspirin and statin therapy in patients with MINS is based on indirect data from patients with "spontaneous" (ie, nonoperative) acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and observational data in patients with MINS. In an observational sub-study of POISE-1, aspirin and statin use were each associated with a reduction in the risk for 30-day mortality among patients who had suffered a perioperative myocardial infarction (adjusted OR for aspirin 0.54, 95% CI 0.29-0.99 and adjusted OR for statins 0.26, 95% CI 0.13-0.54) [

          Beta blockers and RAAS inhibitors

         One study included a propensity-matched sample of 66 patients with MINS and 132 patients without MINS who underwent major vascular surgery [

         , statin, beta blocker, or ACE inhibitor) and 23 patients did not receive therapeutic intensification after MINS. The primary endpoint of 12-month survival without a major cardiac event (ie, death, myocardial infarction, coronary artery revascularization, or pulmonary edema requiring hospitalization) was lower in those receiving therapeutic intensification (hazard ratio [HR] 2.80, 95% CI, 1.05-24.2). However, the small sample size limits the broad application of this observation.

Clinicians provided a new prescription for a beta blocker to 12 percent of these patients, an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) to 5 percent, and a statin to 8 percent. At six-month follow-up, a new prescription for either a beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, ARB, or statin was associated with lower risks of ACS and heart failure but not death. The retrospective nature of this trial limits its external validity.

         110 mg twice daily or placebo. The rate of the primary outcome (ie, a composite of vascular mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonhemorrhagic stroke, peripheral arterial thrombosis, amputation, and symptomatic venous thromboembolism) was lower with dabigatran than with placebo (11 versus 15 percent; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55-0.93). The rates of individual events that comprised the composite outcome were of varying severity (eg, death, venous thromboembolism). The rates of individual components of the primary outcome were similar (eg, all-cause mortality 11 versus 13 percent, myocardial infarction 4 versus 5 percent).

         In patients with myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) who do not have evidence of NSTEMI or STEMI, we typically schedule the patient for follow-up in clinic within two weeks of discharge. This visit is used to manage any cardiovascular risk factors (eg, hypertension, diabetes), monitor any therapy (eg, low-dose oral anticoagulation, statin), and determine the need for imaging to detect obstructive CAD.
        </p>
        <p>
         In most patients with MINS, we obtain noninvasive stress imaging or anatomic imaging of the coronary arteries (CT) to assess for CAD. This approach is based on our experience and our preference to exclude or identify the presence of CAD. The choice of test is discussed separately. (See

          Elevated screening troponin
         </strong>
         – In patients who underwent postoperative screening and have an elevated troponin, the approach to evaluation is similar to patients who have other signs or symptoms of myocardial infarction. We obtain an ECG, chest radiography, and repeat troponin in two to three hours. (See

          Role of additional testing
         </strong>
         – In patients in whom the diagnosis remains uncertain after evaluation of symptoms, ECGs, and repeat troponin assays, additional noninvasive studies (eg, echocardiography, radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging) may be required to confirm or exclude the presence of myocardial injury. (See
         <a class="local">

         When patients diagnosed with myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) recover from surgery, it is reasonable to obtain stress or anatomic imaging to assess for obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) unless another clear explanation or an elevated troponin level is present.

         – Patients with any of the factors listed above are at high risk of MINS. In this population of patients, we suggest postoperative surveillance with troponin levels rather than no surveillance. Postoperative surveillance consists of troponin assays obtained 6 to 12 hours after surgery and on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3. (See

         – In patients with perioperative ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in whom the risk of bleeding with anticoagulation is acceptable, the approach to STEMI management is similar to that in other patients with STEMI. In patients whose risk of bleeding is excessively high, medical therapy (eg, anticoagulation) and the use of angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are individualized. (See
