         An approach to reviewing a genetic test report is summarized in the checklist  (

         Testing involves two steps: determining the genotype and interpreting the pathogenicity of the variant(s).

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         It is important to review which gene(s) were analyzed and which variants in those genes were tested, as some tests use comprehensive sequencing whereas others only screen for selected genes and/or selected variants.
        </p>
        <p>
         The pathogenicity of each variant is classified by the testing laboratory into one of five categories based on information available to them at the time  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122646" href="/z/d/graphic/122646.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The classification for many variants continues to be updated, especially for variants of uncertain significance (VUS), as more evidence regarding pathogenicity (or lack thereof) becomes available. The uncertainty reflects the current state of information and knowledge available, rather than the accuracy of genotyping or the likelihood of disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         If there is concern about the classification, such as for a VUS, obtain an updated interpretation periodically (eg, annually). This can be done by checking a database such as
         <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fclinvar%2F&amp;token=wEsKVFvqlKzpT%2BqOtddW%2Fy3%2BLj0shalBW%2BL1ZyL4trzGy12ipcVcj41059JRLkL3&amp;TOPIC_ID=129098" target="_blank">
          ClinVar
         </a>
         , contacting the laboratory, or consulting a clinical geneticist, genetic counselor, or other specialist (see
         <a class="local">
          'Locating a genetics expert'
         </a>

         </a>
         ); there is no gold standard approach. Some laboratories routinely provide updates and others require a request. Likely benign and benign variants are not reported (or are reported as negative). Many VUSs are reclassified as benign.

        <p>
         Discussion should include the range of cancer risks, possible interventions for surveillance or risk reduction, and implications for at-risk family members. (See
         <a class="local">

        </p>
        <p>
         Counseling may require additional visits or referral to a genetic counselor, clinical geneticist, or oncologist. Acting upon genetic test results is usually not an emergency; the individual can be reassured that management decisions can be deferred until questions have been answered.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach is largely consistent with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), and British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) recommendations for surveillance and risk reduction [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5

         ]. The type of cancer and age of onset in a family member may also inform screening (eg, screening at an earlier age if a family member has an earlier age of onset).
