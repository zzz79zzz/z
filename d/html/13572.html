The innate immune system constitutes the body’s first-line barriers and rapid-response mechanisms against microbial invasion.</p><p>This topic will review the cells, proteins, and receptors that comprise the innate immune system, the functional differences between innate and acquired immune responses, and the mechanisms by which the two systems interact. Disorders of innate immunity and more specific topics on individual types of cells and receptors are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3985.html" rel="external">"Toll-like receptors: Roles in disease and therapy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3968.html" rel="external">"Complement pathways"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2295867437"><span class="h1">CRITICAL FUNCTIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Medzhitov and Janeway defined innate immunity as a system of rapid immune responses that are present from birth and not adapted or permanently heightened as a result of exposure to microorganisms, in contrast to the responses of T and B lymphocytes in the adaptive immune system [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/1-3">1-3</a>]. The innate immune system protects the host during the time between microbe exposure and initial adaptive responses. The importance of such a system can be appreciated by considering that the generation time of most bacteria is 20 to 30 minutes, whereas the development of a specific adaptive immune response with antibody and T cells takes days to weeks. Essential functions of the innate immune system include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Detection of microorganisms and first-line defense against invasion and infection. (See <a class="local">'Microbial detection through pattern recognition'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Maintenance of "immunologic homeostasis," the balance between the proinflammatory mechanisms of host defense and the antiinflammatory responses that return the host to a healthy baseline. The cardinal signs of inflammation (tumor, rubor, calor, and dolor [swelling, redness, heat, and pain]) are products of the protective action of innate immunity. To limit damage to the host, these responses must also be terminated when no longer needed. (See <a class="local">'Homeostasis in the innate immune system'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Activation and instruction of adaptive immune responses. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3975.html" rel="external">"The adaptive humoral immune response"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3980.html" rel="external">"The adaptive cellular immune response: T cells and cytokines"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H849689414"><span class="h1">COMPONENTS OF INNATE IMMUNITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>These host defense components are evolutionarily ancient, found in all multicellular organisms, and expressed in humans as conserved elements (homologs) shared with other vertebrates and, in some form, with insects, plants, fungi, and bacteria [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/4-9">4-9</a>]. Components of the innate immune system include those of the host itself and also its<strong> </strong>resident microbes, the microbiome. Embedded in the list of host components below is a vast array of cells, receptors, and molecules that are involved in eliminating enemies of host survival and a similar spectrum of components involved in returning the body's physiology to its baseline. These elements are grouped into units of biological function that capture the extraordinary breadth of mechanisms that evolution has brought forward as the system of innate immunity.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H828022069"><span class="h2">Host components</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Physical barriers – Tight junctions between skin cells, epithelial and mucous membrane surfaces, mucus itself, and blood vessel endothelial cells that prevent pathogen penetration of the intestines [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/10-13">10-13</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Antimicrobial enzymes in epithelial and phagocytic cells (eg, lysozyme)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inflammation-related serum proteins (eg, complement components, C-reactive protein [CRP], and lectins [carbohydrate-binding proteins])</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs; defensins, cathelicidins, and many more) on the surfaces of cells and within phagocyte granules</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An interferon (IFN) gamma-stimulated cytosolic apolipoprotein that can kill cytosolic bacteria (apolipoprotein L3 [APOL3]) [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/14">14</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cell receptors that sense microorganisms and signal a defensive response (eg, Toll-like receptors [TLRs])</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cells that release cytokines and other mediators of the inflammatory response (eg, macrophages, mast cells, natural killer [NK] cells, innate lymphoid cells [ILCs])</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cytokines, cell-cell communicating and signaling proteins that mediate and regulate immunity, inflammation, and hematopoiesis, including chemokines, IFNs, interleukins (ILs), lymphokines, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/15">15</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Phagocytes (neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inflammasomes, central signaling systems that regulate the innate inflammatory response</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The microbiome of the host</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1439498336"><span class="h2">The microbiome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The microbiome, the collection of bacteria, fungi, and viruses that live in and on the body, may also be considered a component of the innate immune system as it profoundly impacts mechanisms of host defense [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/16-31">16-31</a>]. The body's microbial composition directly influences the maturation of the immune response and its continued effectiveness, protects against pathogen overgrowth, and modulates the balance between inflammation and immune homeostasis [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/21,32-37">21,32-37</a>]. For<strong> </strong>example, skin microbes interact with the immune system to promote wound healing [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/31,38">31,38</a>]. Nonpathogenic coagulase-negative staphylococci on the skin produce an antimicrobial peptide that can inhibit growth of pathogenic <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. These protective strains are deficient in atopic dermatitis [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/39,40">39,40</a>]. Oral microbiota can form symbiotic biofilms that balance pH levels and suppress pathogen growth in the mouth [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/41">41</a>]. There are now convincing data that the gut microbiome influences the nervous system, and there are efforts to determine the mechanism and to develop drugs capable of acting on the brain [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/42-45">42-45</a>].</p><p>The term "dysbiosis" refers to an underlying impairment of the functions that regulate gut homeostasis reflected as a change in the composition, diversity, or metabolites of the microbiome from a healthy pattern to a pattern associated with disease or a predisposition to disease, including Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/21-23,46-53">21-23,46-53</a>]. Antibiotic use is the classic cause, and <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection is a common, serious expression. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been an effective method of treatment, though not without risk [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/54-57">54-57</a>]. FMT has also improved remission rates of inflammatory bowel disease and chronic bacterial vaginosis [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/56-60">56-60</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2631.html" rel="external">"Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome in adults", section on 'Other therapies'</a>.)</p><p>Dysbiosis is believed to play a role in development of<strong> </strong>obesity, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, food allergy, asthma, and atopic dermatitis [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/22,34,61-64">22,34,61-64</a>]. Because of its role as an orchestrator of biologic processes, the microbiome offers an attractive target for therapeutic intervention [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/65">65</a>]. Manipulation of the gut microbiome through dietary change has been used with some success to treat type 2 diabetes [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/66,67">66,67</a>], malnourished children [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/68-70">68-70</a>], and immunotherapy-refractory melanoma [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/71-73">71-73</a>]. The microbiome-derived metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) promotes immune activation and boosts immune checkpoint blockade in pancreatic cancer [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/74">74</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3252531824"><span class="h1">INNATE VERSUS ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The innate immune system recognizes microbes directly through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which are receptors specific for molecular components unique to microorganisms. The genes encoding PRRs are passed from parent to offspring. Phylogenetic studies have indicated that genes for PRRs and other components of the innate immune system have been gradually modified over generations by natural selection [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/1,3,4">1,3,4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In contrast, each T and B lymphocyte acquires a structurally unique receptor during development, yielding a vast repertoire of cells with individualized receptors. From this repertoire, cells exposed to their unique microbial or other foreign antigen expand as a clone of cells directed at that specific antigen. As the clone expands, both the tightness (affinity) of the binding and the specificity for its particular antigen increase. Thus, the most useful receptors are selected and improved in the host over time. However, the "learned" immune responses and refinements made to the adaptive system cannot be passed on to an individual's progeny. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3980.html" rel="external">"The adaptive cellular immune response: T cells and cytokines"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3975.html" rel="external">"The adaptive humoral immune response"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3748601456"><span class="h2">Training of innate immunity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The principle of "cross protection" in host defense was first demonstrated in the 1960s. Innate macrophages that had been "activated" during infection to one pathogen were modified so that they were able to kill a second, unrelated organism more effectively. This heightened state waned rapidly once the pathogen (primary stimulus) was eliminated [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/75">75</a>]. Later work showed that macrophages could be "primed" (imprinted) for enhanced expression of microbicidal mechanisms and pathogen killing by exposure to microbial components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/76">76</a>] and that small amounts of LPS can prime neutrophils for increased expression of microbicidal mechanisms on exposure to a variety of stimuli [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/77">77</a>].</p><p>It is now clear that cells of the innate immune system can be <strong>trained</strong> by past infection, exposure to vaccines such as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), or contact with microbial components such as LPS so that they have an enhanced response to the original or another trigger. The trained state is conferred by epigenetic reprogramming of transcriptional pathways, not gene recombination [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/78-81">78-81</a>]. The lifespan of trained monocytes and neutrophils is short, but marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can conserve epigenetic memory of previous infections and are long-lived, with self-renewal properties that maintain lifelong production of innate immune cells [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/82">82</a>].</p><p>The principle of cross protection as expressed by trained innate immune cells has obvious implications for clinical medicine [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/83">83</a>]. Randomized trials in Guinea-Bissau have shown that <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="102736" href="/z/d/drug information/102736.html" rel="external">BCG vaccine</a> administered at birth to low-weight infants significantly reduced death from infectious disease within the first month and first year of life [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/84">84</a>]. BCG given to volunteers four weeks prior to administration of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10051" href="/z/d/drug information/10051.html" rel="external">yellow fever vaccine</a> significantly reduced the viral load after inoculation with the vaccine virus [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/85">85</a>]. Trained innate immunity harnessed in this way has the potential to aid cancer therapies, sepsis-associated immune paralysis, and perhaps even resistance to novel viral outbreaks such as that by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/86">86</a>]. Large-scale epidemiologic studies suggest that national programs in BCG vaccination reduce the mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/87,88">87,88</a>]. National programs in vaccination with BCG, measles, or oral polio vaccine have also decreased all-cause mortality or respiratory infections in adolescents or older adults [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/89">89</a>].</p><p>The inflammatory response that is essential for resistance to infection is abated by an antiinflammatory response as the host begins to win the battle. In this same sense, epigenetic changes like those that drive protective cross-specific immunity drive an antigen-nonspecific suppression of immunity. Although this response is useful in the short term, its persistence has the potential to dampen the response to future infection [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/89">89</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9420986"><span class="h1">MICROBIAL DETECTION THROUGH PATTERN RECOGNITION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Innate immune responses to infection are largely mediated by a variety of proteins that recognize and interact with components that are specific to microbes. These proteins are grouped in their broad biologic context as "pattern recognition receptors" (PRRs) to emphasize their common function in host defense. The molecular components of microorganisms recognized by PRRs are called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PRRs also recognize damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) released as a consequence of tissue injury from inflammation or other causes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3870241245"><span class="h2">Pathogen-associated molecular patterns</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>PRRs are capable of distinguishing between self-tissues and microbes by recognizing highly conserved PAMPs. Each type of PAMP is characteristic of a specific group of microbes.</p><p>All PAMPs have certain features in common:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>They are produced only by microbes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>They are typically invariant structures shared by entire classes of pathogens.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Their structures are usually fundamental to the integrity, survival, and pathogenicity of the microorganisms, such that a microbe cannot mutate its PAMPs to avoid the host's defense mechanisms and still survive.</p><p></p><p>Bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]), a component of the outer membrane of all gram-negative bacteria, is a prototypical PAMP. Endotoxin contains lipid A, a highly conserved structure of the lipid bilayer of the outer bacterial cell membrane that confers many of endotoxin's biologic activities [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/90">90</a>]. Lipid A specifically interacts with Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 (see <a class="local">'Toll-like receptors'</a> below). Other examples of PAMPs include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Membrane components common to large categories of bacteria, such as peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acids, and mannans</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unmethylated microbial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Double-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) of viral origin</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Glucans, polysaccharides, or proteins that are common to microbes but not to animals or humans</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2969771230"><span class="h2">Damage-associated molecular patterns</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>DAMPs or "alarmins" are nuclear, mitochondrial, or cytosolic molecules released from host cells as a result of infection, tissue injury, or cell necrosis. These molecules include high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), S100 proteins, heat-shock proteins, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
