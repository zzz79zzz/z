         Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a clinical syndrome in which patients have signs and symptoms of HF as the result of high left ventricular (LV) filling pressure despite normal or near normal LV ejection fraction (LVEF; ≥50 percent) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-5
         </a>
         ]. Most patients with HFpEF also display normal LV volumes and an abnormal diastolic filling pattern (ie, diastolic dysfunction) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,6-8
         </a>
         ]. Patients without signs and symptoms of HF but who have evidence of diastolic dysfunction on echocardiography do not meet the criteria for HFpEF.
        </p>
        <p>
         HFpEF should be distinguished from other causes of HF with an LVEF ≥50 percent  (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The treatment and prognosis of patients with symptoms of HFpEF will be reviewed here. Issues related to the etiology, prevalence, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and pathophysiology of HFpEF are discussed separately. The management of asymptomatic patients with evidence of diastolic dysfunction but without symptoms of HF is reviewed elsewhere.

         For patients with HFpEF, the goals of treatment are to reduce HF symptoms, increase functional status, and reduce the risk of hospital admission. There is no clear evidence that pharmacologic therapy, diet, or other therapies reduce the risk of mortality in patients with HFpEF.

         The severity of HF symptoms and comorbid conditions (eg, chronic kidney disease) determines the frequency of clinical evaluation, which ranges from one to six months. Each follow-up evaluation should include assessment for changes in symptoms, weight trends, blood pressure readings, new symptoms of comorbid conditions, and medication intolerance. For most patients, electrolytes and kidney function are routinely obtained every six months to assure the safety of diuretic therapy and other medications used to treat HFpEF. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors'

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with worsening signs or symptoms of HF, it is often necessary to evaluate for cardiac (eg, rhythm disorders, progressive ischemic heart disease) and noncardiac (eg, worsening diabetes, hypothyroidism) causes of HF exacerbation. Further details on the assessment of acutely decompensated HF can be found elsewhere. (See

        <p>
         For some patients with symptoms and conflicting clinical data (eg, increasing dyspnea, decreasing weight), we obtain a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) level, but we do not obtain BNP levels as part of routine monitoring. (See

         Conditions commonly associated with HFpEF include hypertension, atrial fibrillation (AF), coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, obesity, anemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and sleep-disordered breathing [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. In general, these conditions are managed using approaches similar to those used to treat the general population or other forms of HF; there is no evidence for HFpEF-specific management of these conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
         When management of a comorbid condition competes with the management of HFpEF, we prefer to use treatments that reduce mortality for the comorbid condition rather than use a HFpEF-specific therapy (eg, angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors are preferred over
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="102505" href="/z/d/drug information/102505.html" rel="external">
          sacubitril-valsartan
         </a>
         for diabetes); none of the HFpEF-specific pharmacotherapies have been shown to reduce mortality. In many patients, the second-line or third-line therapies for a comorbid condition overlap with therapy for HFpEF (eg, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 [SGLT2] inhibitors), as discussed immediately below and elsewhere in the topic.

         – In patients with HFpEF who do not have a compelling indication for a specific antihypertensive therapy, diuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) can be used for the initial treatment of hypertension (see

          'Preferred therapies for symptomatic patients'

          Patients with compelling indications for specific antihypertensive therapies

         – Many patients with HFpEF have hypertension and other comorbid conditions (eg, diabetes, CKD) that should be treated with first-line therapies for those conditions (typically ACE inhibitors or ARBs), which should be used before starting HFpEF-specific therapies such as an MRA. (See

          Blood pressure goals

         – The typical blood pressure goal for patients with HFpEF is similar to the blood pressure goal for the general population. However, if a patient with HFpEF has uncontrolled symptoms of HF or repeated HF hospitalizations despite reasonable control of blood pressure, we reduce the goal blood pressure. When treating to a lower blood pressure goal, we carefully monitor dose adjustments; patients with HFpEF can have an exaggerated hypotensive response to vasodilator therapy [

         Despite the beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with HFpEF, these agents are not considered initial therapy for hyperglycemia in the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes. Initial therapy in most patients with type 2 diabetes should begin with diet, weight reduction, exercise, and

We typically consult with the patient’s diabetes care provider before initiating an SGLT2 inhibitor. Patients using insulin or insulin secretagogues (eg, sulfonylureas, glinides) may require a dose reduction with initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.

         <span class="glyph">

         We typically start the SGLT2 inhibitor first and then add the MRA two weeks later if the patient tolerates initial therapy. We do not withhold a second agent if HF symptoms resolve or if the BNP decreases in response to initial therapy. However, there are no direct data to suggest that use of both therapies has an additive effect in reducing the risk of HF hospitalization. (See

         In patients in whom starting an SGLT2 inhibitor or an MRA would interfere with an existing treatment, we only start a HFpEF-specific therapy if the benefit of the HFpEF-specific therapy is greater than the benefit of the therapy that it would replace. The need to consider this tradeoff is commonly encountered in patients with diabetes and/or CKD:

         In patients who already receive treatment for type 2 diabetes, an SGLT2 inhibitor should be added to treat HFpEF if its addition does not replace a medication that is more effective for the treatment of diabetes and does not increase the risk of hypoglycemia. We recommend consulting with the patient’s diabetes care provider before making any change to the patient’s hyperglycemic regimen. (See

         For patients with untreated diabetes, initial pharmacologic therapy to reduce glucose levels depends on the degree of hyperglycemia. SGLT2 inhibitors have less glycemic efficacy than other agents, but they are an option for patients who have contraindications or intolerance to preferred first-line therapies. Further information on the role of SGLT2 inhibitor treatment for patients with diabetes can be found elsewhere. (See

         In patients with diabetes and/or CKD who take an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), an MRA can be added to existing therapy with an ACE inhibitor or ARB but should not replace therapy with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The preference for renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [RAAS] inhibitor therapy over MRA therapy is based on the long-term benefits of RAAS inhibitors in the treatment of diabetes and CKD (eg, reduction in the risk of mortality, stroke, progression of kidney disease); MRA therapy for HFpEF is only associated with a reduction in HF hospitalizations.

Hospitalization for HF was less frequent in the spironolactone group (12.0 percent) compared with the placebo group (14.2 percent; HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69-0.99), but other components of the primary outcome occurred at similar rates in the two treatment groups.

The choice of dose reduction or discontinuation depends on the circumstances causing hyperkalemia, which include the MRA dose (if the dose is high, then dose reduction may be reasonable), the presumptive cause of elevated potassium level (MRA or other cause), and the ability to closely monitor follow-up values. If simultaneous MRA and ACE inhibitor (or ARB) use was the likely cause of hyperkalemia, the choice to stop the MRA or ACE inhibitor is based on the indication for the ACE inhibitor.

          Implantable hemodynamic monitoring
         </strong>
         – For highly selected patients with HFpEF who have refractory New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to III HF symptoms and multiple hospitalizations despite traditional chronic disease management, a remote, wireless, pulmonary artery (PA) pressure monitoring device is an option. The use of this device is highly individualized based on the patient’s comorbidities and disease severity, as well as their values and preferences.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Remote PA pressure monitoring requires implantation of a small, remote sensor in the PA during a procedure similar to a right heart catheterization. Once home, the patient uses a pillow with a built-in receiver to obtain daily PA pressure readings, which are then transmitted and displayed to the patient’s team. The goal of monitoring is to manage the patient’s volume status using trends in PA pressures as a surrogate measure of ventricular filling pressures. One study suggested that changes in PA pressure occurred prior to an exacerbation of HF by 19±17 days for patients with HFpEF and by 29±22 days for patients with HFrEF [

          Pacing
         </strong>
         – In patients with HFpEF, trials of pacing interventions were either not effective or had positive effects and small sample size. Thus, patients with HFpEF should only undergo pacemaker implantation or pacemaker programming appropriate for any existing rhythm abnormality. (See

         Patients included in trials of pacing differ considerably based on the intended effect of pacing (eg, augmentation of cardiac output with exercise, increasing backup heart rate at rest). Trials of pacing in patients with HFpEF include:

         In a single-center trial that included 107 patients with stage B or C HFpEF with a preexisting AAI or biventricular pacing system, patients assigned to a backup pacing rate determined by an equation ("personalized accelerated pacing") had improved quality of life when compared with a lower rate limit set to 60 beats per minute (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Score 26 to 9 versus 19 to 27, p&lt;0.001) [

         In patients with HFpEF, morbidity and mortality rates are higher than in the general population, and the most common cause of death is cardiovascular.

          Morbidity

         – Morbidity outcomes in HFrEF and HFpEF are similar [

          52-57

         ]. These include the rate and frequency of hospitalization for HF, symptomatic status as measured by abnormalities in myocardial oxygen consumption, six-minute walk distance, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire scores, and other quality-of-life indicators. Therefore, patients with HFpEF have a morbidity burden equivalent to that in patients with HFrEF.

          Mortality
         </strong>
         – The prognosis of patients with HFpEF (ie, symptomatic HF) is less well defined than that of patients with HFrEF. Population-based data from hospitalized patients have shown similar mortality rates in patients with HFpEF and HFrEF [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53,58
         </a>
         ]. However, a large meta-analysis that included community-based studies and trials observed lower mortality in HFpEF compared with HFrEF (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.68, 95% CI 0.64-0.71) [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>
         ]. Since diastolic dysfunction is common in subjects in the age group at risk for HFpEF, it is possible that HFpEF may be over-diagnosed in patients with echocardiographic evidence of diastolic dysfunction and a clinical syndrome that mimics HF (but not due to HF) such as pulmonary disease, obesity, kidney disease, or deconditioning.

        <p>

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Independent predictors of mortality in patients with HFpEF in different studies include older age, male sex, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, lower LVEF, the extent of coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, diabetes, impaired renal function, the degree of diastolic dysfunction as assessed by Doppler echocardiography, elevated plasma natriuretic peptide levels, pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dysfunction, AF, and increased red cell distribution width [

          Causes of death

         – For most patients with HFpEF who have New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to III symptoms and an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP; ie, BNP &gt;100 pg/dL or N-terminal pro-BNP [NT-proBNP] &gt;300 pg/dL), we suggest treatment with
         <strong>
          both
         </strong>
         a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) rather than no HFpEF-specific therapy (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">
          Grade 2B
         </a>
         ). We also suggest both agents rather than either drug alone or treatment with other agents (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="102505" href="/z/d/drug information/102505.html" rel="external">

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         We typically start the SGLT2 inhibitor first and then add the MRA two weeks later if the patient tolerates initial therapy. We do not withhold a second agent if HF symptoms resolve and/or BNP decreases in response to initial therapy. (See

         Our suggestion for SGLT2 inhibitors and MRAs as first-line therapies for patients with HFpEF is based upon clinical trials demonstrating that these agents reduce the risk of hospitalization in this population; a mortality benefit has not been demonstrated.
