It does <strong>not</strong> discuss indications for testing and is not intended to replace clinical judgment in the decision to test or in the care of the tested person. These subjects are discussed separately [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2734962599"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2279979104"><span class="h2">How to read the report</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The checklist provides important caveats for genetic testing  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122437" href="/z/d/graphic/122437.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Any result obtained for research or by direct-to-consumer testing that has clinical implications for the tested individual or their relatives should be repeated in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory or comparable accreditation body in other jurisdictions, with verified patient identification.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2732488800"><span class="h2">Genetics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder and is the result of pathogenic variants in <em>ATP7B</em>, a gene encoding a copper transport protein, ATP7B, on chromosome 13. ATP7B is a P-type ATPase expressed mainly in the liver and present in some other tissues at lower amounts. ATP7B binds copper at its N-terminal domain and is responsible for the transmembrane transport of copper using ATP as an energy source. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3626.html" rel="external">"Wilson disease: Epidemiology and pathogenesis", section on 'Copper metabolism'</a>.)</p><p>Biallelic, pathogenic (disease-causing) variants affecting <strong>both </strong><strong><em>ATP7B </em></strong><strong>alleles</strong> are required to develop Wilson disease. Typically, one pathogenic variant is inherited from each parent. Over 500 different pathogenic variants in the <em>ATP7B</em> gene have been identified in patients with Wilson disease. The p.His1069Gln (p.H1069Q) variant is one of the most common pathogenic variants, with an allelic frequency of 10 to 40 percent (30 to 70 percent among individuals from Central, Eastern, and Northern Europe). Most patients are compound heterozygotes, carrying different pathogenic variants on each copy of chromosome 13. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3626.html" rel="external">"Wilson disease: Epidemiology and pathogenesis", section on 'Genetic defect in Wilson disease'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H37173631"><span class="h2">Disease associations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical manifestations of Wilson disease are predominantly hepatic, neurologic, and psychiatric, with many patients having a combination of symptoms as a consequence of copper accumulation [<a href="#rid2">2</a>] </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H623890205"><span class="h3">Hepatic disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The liver is the initial site of copper accumulation in patients with Wilson disease. Hepatic manifestations range from asymptomatic biochemical abnormalities, often with steatosis, to acute hepatitis and acute liver failure (with an associated Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia), chronic hepatitis, and cirrhosis. In most patients some degree of liver disease, even if only histologic change, is usually present at the time Wilson disease is diagnosed. However, there is an increasing number of individuals diagnosed by molecular genetic testing at a very young age (less than three years of age) where there may not be any histologic change present. </p><p>The signs, symptoms, laboratory findings, and imaging findings in patients with hepatic Wilson disease vary with the degree of liver damage. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83837.html" rel="external">"Wilson disease: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history", section on 'Liver disease'</a>.)</p><p>Signs and symptoms of hepatic Wilson disease include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abdominal pain </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Jaundice </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hepatomegaly </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Splenomegaly </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ascites </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Upper gastrointestinal bleeding </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stigmata of chronic liver disease </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mental status changes due to hepatic encephalopathy </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1500537905"><span class="h3">Neurologic manifestations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neurologic manifestations of Wilson disease include dysarthria, dystonia, tremor, gait abnormalities/ataxia, parkinsonism, and drooling. Initially, only one symptom may be present, but as the disease progresses, complex combinations of neurologic signs and symptoms may develop. Patients with neurologic manifestations may have concurrent hepatic disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83837.html" rel="external">"Wilson disease: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history", section on 'Neurologic involvement'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3933759056"><span class="h3">Behavioral and psychiatric symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Behavioral and psychiatric symptoms are more common in patients with neurologic involvement than in patients with hepatic involvement. Symptoms include depression (reported in 20 to 30 percent of patients with Wilson disease), personality change, incongruous behavior, and irritability. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83837.html" rel="external">"Wilson disease: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history", section on 'Psychiatric symptoms'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2880811906"><span class="h3">Hemolysis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Infrequently, Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia may be the initial symptom of Wilson disease; hemolysis occurs episodically. Hemolysis is not uniformly associated with acute liver failure but often occurs concurrently. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83837.html" rel="external">"Wilson disease: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history", section on 'Hemolysis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2701349069"><span class="h3">Ocular manifestations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Kayser-Fleischer rings are brownish rings seen on slit lamp examination that are due to fine, pigmented, granular deposits of copper in Descemet's membrane in the cornea. </p><p>Kayser-Fleisher rings are thought to indicate copper within the central nervous system, and they dissipate over time with treatment directed towards the removal of copper. Kayser-Fleischer rings are a characteristic feature of Wilson disease; they are seen in approximately 98 percent of patients with neurologic manifestations but only 50 percent of patients with hepatic-only manifestations. </p><p>Sunflower cataracts are another ocular manifestation of Wilson disease that occur when copper accumulates in the lens. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83837.html" rel="external">"Wilson disease: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history", section on 'Ocular involvement'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H406739908"><span class="h3">Other manifestations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Wilson disease can also cause abnormalities related to copper deposition in other organs.

Discontinuation of therapy can lead to disease progression with development of acute liver failure or other symptoms related to copper deposition. Treatment should be conceptualized as being given in two phases: initial therapy to stabilize the patient by removing tissue copper that has accumulated and then preventing reaccumulation (maintenance)  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef133267" href="/z/d/graphic/133267.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1497767057"><span class="h2">Dietary measures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>During the initial phase of treatment, patients should avoid consuming food with high copper content, in particular shellfish, nuts, chocolate, mushrooms, soy products, and organ meats. Dietary restriction is insufficient as sole therapy for Wilson disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3591.html" rel="external">"Wilson disease: Management", section on 'General measures'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3804179319"><span class="h2">Treating copper overload</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3639199433"><span class="h3">Asymptomatic patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In asymptomatic patients, we recommend treatment with a chelating agent (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9747" href="/z/d/drug information/9747.html" rel="external">D-penicillamine</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10019" href="/z/d/drug information/10019.html" rel="external">trientine</a>). Zinc may be used in patients who lack organ damage and are reluctant to use or cannot tolerate a chelating agent. During initial treatment with zinc, liver biochemical tests should be monitored at least every four months and a chelating agent considered as an alternative or in conjunction with zinc if transaminases show signs of disease worsening. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3591.html" rel="external">"Wilson disease: Management", section on 'Drug dosing and administration'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1850207997"><span class="h3">Symptomatic patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Symptomatic patients should be treated with a chelating agent until stable. Patients typically require 6 to 18 months of higher-dose treatment, after which, if they demonstrate improvement and disease stabilization, they can be transitioned to maintenance therapy with lower doses of a chelator or with zinc. </p><p>Liver transplantation may be needed for patients who present with acute liver failure and in those with decompensated liver disease unresponsive to drug therapy. Liver transplantation for neurologic complications remains controversial. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H641462249"><span class="h3">Monitoring on therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with Wilson disease require careful monitoring while on treatment.

Partners of individuals with Wilson disease and partners of carriers (heterozygotes) may elect to undergo genetic testing to determine if any pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in <em>ATP7B</em> are present that would confer a risk of Wilson disease in offspring, with the recognition that not all variants of <em>ATP7B</em> leading to disease have been identified. If there is a risk for Wilson disease, some may elect to conceive using donor gametes or in vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic testing (PGT). Testing is also available during a pregnancy or after birth.</p><p>Pregnancy appears to be safe in patients on <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9747" href="/z/d/drug information/9747.html" rel="external">D-penicillamine</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10019" href="/z/d/drug information/10019.html" rel="external">trientine</a>, but the dose is reduced to approximately 30 to 50 percent of the prepregnancy dose during the first trimester and until delivery, since these drugs are known to be teratogenic in animal models and higher doses may impair maternal wound healing should a cesarean section or episiotomy be required. Those patients on zinc treatment should continue it throughout pregnancy without a change in dose. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3591.html" rel="external">"Wilson disease: Management", section on 'Pregnancy and lactation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3694794204"><span class="h3">At-risk relatives</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>First-degree relatives of an individual with Wilson disease are at risk for inheriting the variant. This includes relatives of a tested individual who is homozygous for a pathogenic variant and relatives of a tested individual who is compound heterozygous for two different pathogenic variants. If the pathogenic variants in an affected family member are known, molecular testing for previously identified familial variants allows for early diagnosis and initiation of therapy in siblings prior to the development of symptoms.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Offspring of an individual with homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in <em>ATP7B</em> will typically inherit one of the variants. If the other parent also carries an <em>ATP7B</em> variant, it is possible for the offspring to be homozygous or compound heterozygous for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in <em>ATP7B</em> and, thus, affected with Wilson disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Full siblings of an individual who has homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in <em>ATP7B</em> typically have a 25 percent chance of also having homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in <em>ATP7B </em>and a 50 percent chance of being a carrier (heterozygote) with a single <em>ATP7B </em>variant if they have the same biological parents.</p><p></p><p>If indicated, testing should generally be deferred in asymptomatic individuals until the tested individual's results have been reviewed and caveats are addressed. In those less than 18 years of age, testing should be performed in concert with parents or guardians to allow for proper informed consent.
