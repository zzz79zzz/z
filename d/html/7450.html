Menopause is associated with a marked decrease in ovarian estrogen production. This results in low serum <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9422" href="/z/d/drug information/9422.html" rel="external">estradiol</a> concentrations and vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) in the majority of women. Estrogen is an effective treatment for relief of hot flashes and for other menopausal symptoms as well. Approximately 50 percent of postmenopausal women eventually develop symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy, including vaginal dryness and dyspareunia, now collectively termed: genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM).</p><p>The treatment of menopausal symptoms with menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) will be reviewed here.

Some experts use the term "hormone therapy" (HT) rather than MHT, and in the past, the term used was "hormone replacement therapy" (HRT). Unopposed estrogen therapy is sometimes referred to as ET and combined estrogen-progestin therapy as EPT. However, we prefer the general term MHT to describe estrogen therapy with or without progestin [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The primary goal of MHT is to relieve hot flashes. Other symptoms associated with perimenopause and menopause that respond to estrogen include sleep disturbances, mood lability/depression, and, in some cases, joint aches and pains. Our approach to MHT is consistent with clinical practice guidelines, including the 2022 Menopause Society position statement [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p>Women being treated for menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes require systemic estrogen; women being treated only for genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) should be treated with low-dose vaginal estrogen rather than systemic estrogen. The use of vaginal estrogen for GSM is reviewed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5443.html" rel="external">"Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy): Treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3430297306"><span class="h2">Estrogens</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All types of estrogen are effective for relieving hot flashes [<a href="#rid2">2-7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7390.html" rel="external">"Menopausal hot flashes", section on 'Menopausal hormone therapy'</a>.)</p><p>In a meta-analysis of 24 trials of menopausal estrogen in 3329 postmenopausal women, the frequency of hot flashes decreased more in those receiving estrogen (weighted mean difference -18 hot flashes per week compared with placebo; 95% CI -22.86 to -12.99; 75 percent reduction) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The severity of hot flashes also decreased more with estrogen compared with placebo.</p><p>In a second meta-analysis, equivalent doses of different estrogens (17-beta <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9422" href="/z/d/drug information/9422.html" rel="external">estradiol</a> [oral 1 mg/day or transdermal 0.05 mg/day] and conjugated estrogen 0.625 mg/day), appeared to be equally effective for the treatment of hot flashes [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. These doses eliminate hot flashes completely in approximately 80 percent of women and reduce the frequency and severity in the remainder [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1822461382"><span class="h3">Route</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Estrogen is available in many forms: oral, transdermal, topical gels and lotions, and vaginal rings. In some countries, estrogen can also be given as a subcutaneous implant  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78136" href="/z/d/graphic/78136.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The potency and therefore the doses of these estrogen preparations differ, but they differ little in their ability to alleviate hot flashes. Ultimately the choice of preparation/dose is based upon patient preference, drug availability, and cost. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7446.html" rel="external">"Preparations for menopausal hormone therapy", section on 'Estrogen preparations'</a>.)</p><p>We most often start women on either a transdermal or oral preparation. We prefer 17-beta <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9422" href="/z/d/drug information/9422.html" rel="external">estradiol</a> over other estrogens such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9424" href="/z/d/drug information/9424.html" rel="external">conjugated equine estrogens</a> (CEE) because it is structurally identical (bioidentical) to the main estrogen secreted by the ovary. Oral estrogens should be avoided in women with hypertriglyceridemia, active gallbladder disease, or known thrombophilias such as factor V Leiden (with or without a personal history of venous thromboembolism [VTE]). Transdermal estrogen is also preferred for women with migraine headaches with auras [<a href="#rid8">8-11</a>]. However, the baseline risk of both VTE and stroke is very low in otherwise healthy, young, postmenopausal women. Therefore, if a patient prefers an oral preparation over a transdermal one (cost or personal preference), we consider oral estrogen to be safe. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7446.html" rel="external">"Preparations for menopausal hormone therapy", section on 'Estrogen preparations'</a>.)</p><p>Additional differences between oral and transdermal preparations include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Oral estrogen has more favorable effects on lipid profiles (increased high-density lipoprotein [HDL] and decreased low-density lipoprotein [LDL]), but there is no evidence that this results in long-term clinical benefit. As noted, oral estrogens are associated with increases in serum triglycerides. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7409.html" rel="external">"Menopausal hormone therapy and cardiovascular risk", section on 'Lipids'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Oral estrogens also increase sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) more than transdermal preparations, which results in lower free testosterone concentrations. This could theoretically result in a negative impact on libido and sexual function, but this has not been proven.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Oral estrogen increases thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) and decreases bioavailable thyroxine (T4) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7845.html" rel="external">"Drug interactions with thyroid hormones", section on 'Drugs that influence thyroid hormone binding in serum'</a>). Oral estrogens also increase cortisol-binding globulin (CBG), resulting in an increase in total serum cortisol. Interpreting serum cortisol values in a woman taking oral estrogen can therefore be misleading. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/160.html" rel="external">"Dexamethasone suppression tests", section on 'Sources of error'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3142916273"><span class="h3">Dose</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>"Standard" doses of estrogen given daily, such as 17-beta <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9422" href="/z/d/drug information/9422.html" rel="external">estradiol</a> (oral 1 mg/day or transdermal 0.05 mg/day) are adequate for symptom relief in the majority of women [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>]. An exception is younger women after bilateral oophorectomy. They often require higher doses (eg, 2 mg oral estradiol or 0.1 mg transdermal estradiol or their equivalent) for the first two to three years after surgery; the dose can subsequently be tapered down. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7446.html" rel="external">"Preparations for menopausal hormone therapy", section on 'Dose equivalents'</a>.)</p><p>In the past, a "one-size-fits-all" approach to estrogen dosing in postmenopausal women was used, eg, all women were started on the same dose ("standard doses"). This was most commonly CEE 0.625 mg in the past, but <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9422" href="/z/d/drug information/9422.html" rel="external">estradiol</a> preparations are more commonly used now. If symptoms were relieved, the dose was continued indefinitely. However, the current approach is to start with lower doses, such as transdermal estradiol (0.025 mg) or oral estradiol (0.5 mg/day), and titrate up to relieve symptoms. This approach does not apply to women with primary ovarian insufficiency, who require a higher daily dose. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7426.html" rel="external">"Management of primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)", section on 'Importance of estrogen therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Lower doses are associated with less vaginal bleeding, breast tenderness [<a href="#rid12">12</a>], fewer effects on coagulation and inflammatory markers, and a possible lower risk of stroke and VTE than standard-dose therapy [<a href="#rid2">2,13</a>]. The lowest available transdermal <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9422" href="/z/d/drug information/9422.html" rel="external">estradiol</a> dose is 0.014 mg; it is approved for prevention of bone loss. However, approximately 50 percent of women derive some benefit for hot flashes [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H426930501"><span class="h2">Progestins</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All women with an intact uterus need a progestin to be added to their systemic estrogen to prevent endometrial hyperplasia, which can occur after as little as six months of unopposed estrogen. Women who have undergone hysterectomy should <strong>not</strong> receive a progestin, as there are no other health benefits other than prevention of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. In most cases, women taking only vaginal low-dose estrogen do not need to take a progestin. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7427.html" rel="external">"Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks", section on 'Endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5443.html" rel="external">"Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy): Treatment", section on 'Use of an opposing progestogen'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H251869671"><span class="h3">Dosing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our first choice of progestin is oral natural micronized <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9817" href="/z/d/drug information/9817.html" rel="external">progesterone</a> (200 mg/day for 12 days/month [ie, a cyclic regimen that is designed to mimic the normal luteal phase of premenopausal women] or 100 mg daily [continuous regimen]) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. We advise taking progesterone at bedtime as some of its metabolites are associated with somnolence. There are reasons to believe that natural progesterone is safer for the cardiovascular system (no adverse lipid effects) and possibly the breast. Women taking lower doses of estrogen (eg, 0.014 mg transdermal <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9422" href="/z/d/drug information/9422.html" rel="external">estradiol</a>) require very little progestin (a 12-day course every 6 to 12 months [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7409.html" rel="external">"Menopausal hormone therapy and cardiovascular risk", section on 'Effects of progestins'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7392.html" rel="external">"Menopausal hormone therapy and the risk of breast cancer", section on 'Type of progestin'</a>.)</p><p>The most extensively studied formulation for endometrial protection is the synthetic progestin used in the WHI, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9600" href="/z/d/drug information/9600.html" rel="external">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> (MPA; 2.5 mg daily). While MPA is endometrial protective, it was associated with an excess risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and breast cancer when administered with conjugated estrogen in the WHI. In addition, regimens using continuous versus cyclic MPA may be associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7392.html" rel="external">"Menopausal hormone therapy and the risk of breast cancer", section on 'Effect of progestins'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3411255030"><span class="h3">Frequency</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Women taking standard doses of estrogen require monthly progestins. Other progestins that have been used include quarterly regimens (progestin administered only every third month). However, quarterly progestin administration is <strong>not</strong> considered to be adequately protective and cannot be recommended for women taking standard doses of estrogen. Women taking lower doses of estrogen (eg, 0.014 mg transdermal <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9422" href="/z/d/drug information/9422.html" rel="external">estradiol</a>), however, require very little progestin (two 12-day courses every six months). Vaginal <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9817" href="/z/d/drug information/9817.html" rel="external">progesterone</a> inserts are sometimes tried, but endometrial safety data are also limited [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7427.html" rel="external">"Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks", section on 'Endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3825835667"><span class="h2">Side effects</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Common side effects of estrogen include breast soreness, which can often be minimized by using lower doses. Some women experience mood symptoms and bloating with progestin therapy. Vaginal bleeding occurs in almost all women receiving cyclic estrogen-progestin regimens and is common in the early months of a continuous estrogen-progestin regimen. Lower-dose estrogen-progestin continuous regimens are less likely to be associated with bleeding. (See <a class="local">'Progestins'</a> above.)</p><p>Some women are unable to tolerate cyclic progestin administration (with any type of oral progestin) because of the mood side effects and bloating. In addition, cyclic progestins almost always result in monthly withdrawal bleeding, which can be a lifestyle concern for many women. For any of these concerns, we suggest switching to a continuous regimen of progestin. This maneuver often resolves the issue of mood symptoms and bloating. However, for women who are newly menopausal, breakthrough bleeding can be anticipated. (See <a class="local">'Endometrial monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>For women who are unable to tolerate either a cyclic or continuous oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9817" href="/z/d/drug information/9817.html" rel="external">progesterone</a> regimen, alternatives include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vaginal use of micronized </strong><strong>progesterone</strong> – Vaginal, rather than oral administration of micronized <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9817" href="/z/d/drug information/9817.html" rel="external">progesterone</a> capsules is easier to tolerate for some women. Vaginal micronized progesterone may provide higher levels of endometrial progesterone exposure than oral progesterone.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs</strong> – Some clinicians choose off-label use of the lower-dose levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (IUD). Discussions about this approach are typically between the patient and their provider. Lower doses of levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs for use in menopausal women are available in many countries, but are not labeled for this use in the United States. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7446.html" rel="external">"Preparations for menopausal hormone therapy", section on 'Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Conjugated estrogen/bazedoxifene</strong> – Another option is the combination of bazedoxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), with conjugated estrogen. This product is available for the treatment of menopausal vasomotor symptoms and osteoporosis prevention. In this combination, the SERM bazedoxifene prevents estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia so that administering a progestin is not necessary. Potential candidates include women with moderate-to-severe hot flashes who have breast tenderness with standard EPT or women who cannot tolerate any type of progestin therapy because of side effects. Like other SERMs, the risk of VTE is increased with bazedoxifene. No additive effect on VTE has been observed with the CEE/bazedoxifene, but longer studies are needed to fully address this risk. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7390.html" rel="external">"Menopausal hot flashes", section on 'Bazedoxifene/conjugated estrogen'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4080154889"><span class="h2">Changes in practice post-WHI</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Decline in MHT prescriptions</strong> – Use of MHT has decreased approximately 80 percent since the initial publication of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) results in 2002 [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Definitions and goals'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Goals</strong> – The primary goal of MHT is to relieve vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes). Other symptoms associated with perimenopause and menopause that respond to estrogen include sleep disturbances, depression/anxiety, and, in some cases, joint aches and pains. (See <a class="local">'Definitions and goals'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Estrogen is also indicated for the management of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM); however, low-dose vaginal estrogen should be used rather than systemic estrogen. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5443.html" rel="external">"Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy): Treatment", section on 'Vaginal estrogen therapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient selection</strong> – For healthy, peri/postmenopausal women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms impacting sleep, quality of life, or ability to function, and who are within 10 years of menopause (or &lt;60 years of age), we suggest MHT (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). For most women, the benefits of MHT outweigh the risks  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87938" href="/z/d/graphic/87938.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Exceptions include women with a history of breast cancer, coronary heart disease (CHD), a previous venous thromboembolic (VTE) event or stroke, active liver disease, or those at high risk for these complications. (See <a class="local">'Is my patient a candidate for MHT?'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7390.html" rel="external">"Menopausal hot flashes", section on 'Menopausal hormone therapy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7427.html" rel="external">"Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks", section on 'Estimates of risk in women 50 to 59 years'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We no longer use MHT for the prevention of chronic disease (osteoporosis, CHD, or dementia). However, there are some data to suggest that use of estrogen within the first 10 years after clinical menopause may reduce the risks of CHD and mortality. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7427.html" rel="external">"Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks", section on 'Estimates of risk in women 50 to 59 years'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preferred regimens</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Estrogens</strong> – All types and routes of estrogen are equally effective for hot flashes. We prefer 17-beta <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9422" href="/z/d/drug information/9422.html" rel="external">estradiol</a> over other estrogens (such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9424" href="/z/d/drug information/9424.html" rel="external">conjugated equine estrogens</a> [CEE]) because it is structurally identical (bioidentical) to the main estrogen secreted by the ovary. We suggest against the use of compounded bioidentical hormone therapy (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Concerns include the lack of efficacy and safety data, and the contents, dose, quality, and sterility of these products are not subject to regulatory oversight. (See <a class="local">'Estrogens'</a> above and <a class="local">'Compounded bioidentical hormone therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The transdermal route is particularly important in women with hypertriglyceridemia, active gallbladder disease, or known thrombophilias such as factor V Leiden (with or without a personal history of VTE). The baseline risk of both VTE and stroke is very low in otherwise healthy, young postmenopausal women. We therefore consider oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9422" href="/z/d/drug information/9422.html" rel="external">estradiol</a> to be a safe and reasonable option for patients who prefer an oral preparation over a transdermal one (cost or personal preference). (See <a class="local">'Route'</a> above.)  </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Progestins</strong> – For women with an intact uterus who are starting MHT and therefore require a progestin, we suggest micronized <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9817" href="/z/d/drug information/9817.html" rel="external">progesterone</a> as our first-line progestin (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). It is effective for endometrial hyperplasia, is metabolically neutral, and does not appear to increase the risk of either breast cancer or CHD, although data are limited. (See <a class="local">'Progestins'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Duration of MHT</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Standard recommendations for duration of use are three to five years. For women who experience recurrent, bothersome hot flashes after stopping estrogen, we initially try nonhormonal options. However, if this approach is unsuccessful and symptoms persist, we resume MHT at the lowest dose possible in carefully selected women with persistent, severe hot flashes. (See <a class="local">'Standard recommendations'</a> above and <a class="local">'Extended use of MHT'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7390.html" rel="external">"Menopausal hot flashes", section on 'Nonhormonal pharmacotherapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) should continue MHT until the average of menopause, eg, age 50 to 51 years, to decrease the risk of premature CHD, stroke, osteoporosis, and dementia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7426.html" rel="external">"Management of primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)", section on 'Duration of therapy'</a>.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">“The 2022 Hormone Therapy Position  Statement of The North American Menopause Society” Advisory  Panel.
