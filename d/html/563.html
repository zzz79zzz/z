         Wheezing is a common manifestation of respiratory illness in adults. While wheezing typically brings to mind airway obstruction from bronchoconstriction or excessive mucus production and/or poor clearance due to asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), wheezing is also caused by a spectrum of other processes that cause airflow limitation [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>
         ]. These processes may be present on their own or may coexist with asthma or COPD, contributing to difficult to control symptoms. When evaluating wheezing, it may be helpful to recall the adage, "All that wheezes is not asthma [or COPD]; all that wheezes is obstruction."

         An overview of wheezing illnesses in adults, other than asthma or COPD, is presented here. The diagnosis of asthma, COPD, and wheezing illnesses in children are discussed separately. (See

         A wheeze is a continuous musical sound that can be produced by oscillation of opposing walls of an airway that is narrowed almost to the point of closure [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-7
         </a>
         ]. Wheezes are usually high pitched, consist of single or multiple notes, occur during inspiration or expiration (more commonly expiration), and originate from airways of any size, from the large extrathoracic upper airway to the intrathoracic small airways. Stridor refers to a monophonic, harsh, and grating sound that is loudest over the anterior neck and is typically high-pitched and predominantly inspiratory [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Stridor is sometimes characterized as a type of wheeze due to the overlapping sound signal frequencies of wheeze and stridor [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,6
         </a>

         While asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are the most common causes of wheezing, a variety of other conditions can produce airflow obstruction and thereby expiratory and/or inspiratory wheezing (

          Anaphylaxis
         </strong>
         – The abrupt onset of stridor and respiratory compromise, associated with generalized urticaria, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula, or hypotension, is a classic manifestation of anaphylaxis triggered by food, insect sting, medication, or radiographic contrast. In the context of anaphylaxis, stridor is caused by laryngeal edema. (See

         <strong>
          Vocal cord edema or paralysis
         </strong>
         – Following tracheal extubation, patients may develop vocal cord (also known as vocal fold) edema or paralysis (

          picture 1
         </a>
         ). In patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis, the vocal cords may be adducted to a median position and cause airflow obstruction that is greater during inspiration than expiration. During expiration, the paralyzed cords open due to the force of airflow during exhalation. In adults, bilateral vocal cord paralysis is most often a consequence of neck surgery or translaryngeal tracheal intubation, but can also be a consequence of a broad spectrum of neurologic disorders.

         <strong>
          Paradoxical vocal cord motion
         </strong>
         – Paradoxical vocal cord motion (PVCM) refers to inappropriate movement of the vocal cords (also called vocal folds), resulting in functional airway obstruction. This condition was previously referred to as the vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) syndrome. PVCM has been associated with psychosocial disorders, stress, exercise, perioperative airway and neurologic injury, gastroesophageal reflux, and irritant inhalational exposures. Patients often present with inspiratory and/or expiratory wheezing. Some patients have concomitant asthma or have been misdiagnosed with asthma. The diagnosis of PVCM is confirmed by laryngoscopy (sometimes following exercise) showing abnormal adduction of the true cords (during inspiration, throughout the respiratory cycle, or rarely just during expiration). The glottic aperture may be obliterated except for a posterior diamond-shaped passage. (See

Bronchial tumors of the central airways include adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and neuroendocrine tumors, such as typical and atypical carcinoids and small cell carcinomas. Some extrathoracic carcinomas metastasize to the airway (eg, hypernephroma, breast, thyroid, colon, melanoma). (See

         Our first step in evaluating a patient with wheezing is to determine the severity of respiratory compromise and the rapidity of worsening of any associated shortness of breath. For patients with rapid onset of respiratory distress associated with wheezing or stridor, the key initial steps are to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation based on pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas measurement. Supplemental oxygen is administered, and a rapid assessment made to determine the most likely cause. If asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are likely, nebulized bronchodilator treatment is immediately given. If there is evidence of anaphylaxis, subcutaneous

          epinephrine
         </a>
         should be given.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with impending respiratory failure and suspicion of central airway obstruction (eg, due to stridor, tachypnea, lack of response to inhaled bronchodilator), endotracheal intubation by an experienced clinician may be necessary prior to a diagnostic evaluation if the initial measures have failed to improve the situation. If endotracheal intubation cannot be performed immediately, inhalation of a helium-oxygen mixture with a helium concentration of at least 40 percent may allow temporary stabilization of respiratory status. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/541.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For severe tracheal obstruction, use of an open ventilating rigid bronchoscope may be necessary. At the time of intubation, the larynx and vocal folds are examined for evidence of mass or paralysis. After intubation, the intrathoracic airway can be examined by flexible bronchoscopy through the endotracheal tube. Resolution of wheeze with intubation suggests that the area of obstruction is in the upper airway and may be extrathoracic. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         For patients not needing emergent intubation, a high resolution chest computed tomography (CT) with three-dimensional airway reconstruction can help identify and characterize any central airway obstruction. Direct visualization of the airway is often needed to diagnose the specific cause. The diagnosis and management of central airway obstruction are discussed separately. (See

         Asthma should be considered likely when patients present with episodic wheezing and other symptoms, such as cough and dyspnea, that respond favorably to conventional asthma medications (eg, inhaled bronchodilators). However, partial clinical improvement after bronchodilators is not always indicative of asthma. (See

         Wheezes are defined as high-pitched, continuous sounds lasting for at least 250 msec. They generally are louder than normal breath sounds. The acoustic characteristics of the wheeze, such as timbre and the timing of the wheeze in the respiratory cycle, may provide some helpful information about potential causes, although none of these characteristics reliably distinguishes asthma from other conditions.

However, monophonic wheezes can also be produced by disorders involving the extrathoracic large airways. Stridor is also a monophonic sound, but its intensity over the upper airway and occurrence during inspiration help distinguish it from lower airway monophonic wheezing [

When a patient presents with stridor, urgent airway evaluation is indicated and should be performed by clinicians with substantial experience in airway management. Upper airway obstruction due to tumor or stenosis with an airway diameter &lt;8 mm usually causes dyspnea on exertion; when the diameter is &lt;5 mm, stridor is usually evident [

         In a given patient, certain characteristics may help identify the area of narrowing that is giving rise to the sound, such as whether wheezes are focal or diffuse, or are heard loudest over the anterior neck or the posterior or anterior chest. However, transmission of the wheeze sound is better through airways than through lung parenchyma and the chest wall, so wheezes may sound louder over the anterior neck than the chest wall even though they originate in the lower airway [

Occasionally, a clue to the cause of airway obstruction is found on physical examination of the neck, when lymphadenopathy, thyroid enlargement, or a surgical scar is identified. Inflammation of the cartilage of the nose or ears may alert the clinician to possible airway narrowing or collapsibility due to relapsing polychondritis.

         For patients who do not meet criteria for asthma or COPD or do not respond to a trial of bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory medication, a careful examination of the flow volume loop is in order. The upper airway is divided into intra and extrathoracic components by the thoracic inlet, which is about 1 cm above the suprasternal notch on the anterior chest. During the respiratory cycle, the intrathoracic airway diameter is affected by changes in pleural pressures across the airway (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55931" href="/z/d/graphic/55931.html" rel="external">
          figure 3B
         </a>

          figure 3A
         </a>
         ). Lesions that are fixed are not affected by these changes in pressure and affect flow during inspiration and expiration. Thus, the flow volume loop can be used to help determine whether airflow obstruction is caused by an intrathoracic or extrathoracic obstruction and also distinguish whether the obstructing lesion is variable or fixed (ie, the severity of obstruction changes during inspiration and expiration) based on the following features (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1465.html" rel="external">

         Variable obstruction – It is possible to distinguish extrathoracic from intrathoracic upper airway lesions if the obstruction is variable (ie, the obstructing process responds to the normal transmural pressure changes). A variable extrathoracic obstruction (eg, vocal cord paralysis) is typically apparent only during a maximal inspiratory effort (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63544" href="/z/d/graphic/63544.html" rel="external">

          figure 6
         </a>
         ). The maximal expiratory flow-volume curve and expiratory spirometry are usually normal in this setting, because the extrathoracic airway will be pushed open during expiration. In contrast, a variable intrathoracic obstruction (eg, distal tracheomalacia) is most apparent during maximal expiratory effort (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63544" href="/z/d/graphic/63544.html" rel="external">
          figure 4

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In addition to visual inspection of the graph, the ratio of inspiratory to expiratory flow rates can help distinguish variable extrathoracic from intrathoracic upper airway lesions [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. Inspiratory flow rates are normally greater than expiratory flow rates when compared at lung volumes in the lower two-thirds of the vital capacity. When a variable extrathoracic lesion is present, inspiratory flow rates are lower than expiratory, such that the ratio of forced inspiratory flow at 50 percent of vital capacity (FIF50)/forced expiratory flow at 50 percent of vital capacity (FEF50) is less than one.

         Fixed lesions – It is difficult to localize fixed upper airway obstruction to an extrathoracic (eg, laryngeal tumor) or intrathoracic (eg, tracheal stenosis due to well-formed scar) location because fixed lesions do not allow the airway to respond to normal transmural pressure changes (

          figure 4
         </a>
         ). However, fixed central airway obstructions give the flow-volume loop a characteristic box shape (flow limitation during inspiration and expiration) that suggests the obstruction is in the large rather than small airways. Airflow is uniformly impeded during inspiration and expiration, causing flattening of both the maximum inspiratory and expiratory curves because there is no difference between the amount of narrowing in inspiration and expiration [

         Mainstem bronchial obstruction – Unilateral mainstem bronchial obstruction can cause several different patterns on the flow-volume loop, including restriction (when occlusion is complete), mixed obstruction and restriction, a biphasic expiratory loop, or flattening of the initial portion of the expiratory flow curve.

         The results of the flow volume loop can help guide the next steps in the evaluation. When intrathoracic obstruction of the central airway is suspected, imaging studies (eg, multidetector chest computed tomography [CT]) generally precede direct visualization. As an example, variable central obstruction might lead to inspiratory and expiratory CT imaging to look for tracheomalacia. (See

         On the other hand, when the flow volume loop suggests extrathoracic obstruction, laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy is often the next step. (See

         Performing flow volume loops (instead of expiratory spirometry alone) during bronchoprovocation challenge testing may provide a clue to possible paradoxical vocal cord motion (PVCM). While patients with PVCM may develop flattening of the inspiratory portion of the flow volume loop in response to pharmacologic bronchoprovocation challenge, direct laryngoscopy is required to confirm the diagnosis.

         A conventional chest radiograph is appropriate in most adults with new onset or refractory wheezing. Conventional chest radiographs, with particular attention to the trachea and central airways, should be performed in all patients with the combination of wheezing, acute respiratory distress, and lack of response to inhaled bronchodilator therapy. In addition, a chest radiograph is obtained in patients with a focal persistent wheeze or persistent/recurrent wheezing that is not clearly due to asthma or COPD.
        </p>
        <p>
         The conventional chest radiograph is generally insensitive for central airway lesions, although it can sometimes identify central airway narrowing involving long segments of the trachea (eg, relapsing polychondritis, tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica, amyloidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, tumors). Narrowing of short segments of the trachea (eg, malignant and benign tumors, extrinsic compression, and granulomatous processes) is difficult to identify on the conventional chest radiograph. Similarly, the chest radiograph is not a good screening test for bronchiectasis or bronchiolitis in adults, although increased bronchovascular markings and "tram tracks" may be seen in bronchiectasis. The imaging characteristics of tracheal lesions, bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis are discussed separately. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Additional imaging studies of the chest, such as computed tomography (CT), high-resolution CT, or dynamic CT are ordered based on the results of the chest radiograph and pulmonary function tests. Chest CT with contrast can identify vascular rings, aneurysms of the major vessels, mediastinal masses, or lymphadenopathy that compress the trachea extrinsically. Axial CT can often identify long segments of tracheal stenosis, but short segments of tracheal stenosis can be missed. Two and three dimensional reconstruction of the central airway images from high-resolution multidetector CT (MDCT) has been reported to identify airway lesions missed on standard chest and tracheal CT images [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30

         ]. (See

        <p>
         Paired end-inspiratory and expiratory MDCT views (dynamic CT) of the trachea can be used to detect tracheomalacia and hyperdynamic airway collapsibility. Tracheal collapsibility is assessed based on changes in the shape and cross-sectional area of the trachea between full inspiration and forced exhalation. Flattening of tracheal rings due to tracheomalacia gives a crescent shape to the trachea, while hyperdynamic airway collapse has intact tracheal rings with bulging of the posterior tracheal wall into the airway lumen (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89247" href="/z/d/graphic/89247.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). In general, the cross-sectional area of the trachea is measured at a defined level (eg, 1 cm above the main carina and 1 cm above the aortic arch) to allow comparison between full inhalation and exhalation. A reduction in cross-sectional area of 50 percent or greater during normal, nonforced breathing is consistent with tracheomalacia [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. However, a broad range of forced expiratory tracheal collapse such as during the expiratory phase of coughing has been noted among normal individuals. (See

         High-resolution CT of the smaller airways and lung parenchyma can detect bronchiectasis and sometimes will identify mosaic ground glass attenuation suggestive of constrictive bronchiolitis. A focal area of bronchiectasis may reflect recurrent aspiration and lead to evaluation for impaired swallowing or gastric reflux with aspiration. (See

         Flexible or rigid bronchoscopy may be necessary to confirm a diagnostic suspicion of a tracheal or bronchial mass, foreign body, or tracheomalacia. During bronchoscopy, biopsy samples can be obtained and foreign bodies can be removed. The decision about whether to use flexible or rigid bronchoscopy usually depends on the anticipated location and severity of tracheal lesions, and also whether a therapeutic intervention (eg, stent, laser resection) is planned.

         Suspected central airway obstruction – For patients with impending respiratory failure (ie, impaired oxygenation by pulse oximetry, increased arterial tension of carbon dioxide), endotracheal intubation by an experienced clinician should precede a diagnostic evaluation. If endotracheal intubation cannot be immediately performed, inhalation of a helium-oxygen mixture may provide temporary stabilization of respiratory status. For severe tracheal obstruction, use of an open ventilating rigid bronchoscope may be necessary. In these patients, the diagnostic evaluation proceeds concomitantly with steps to provide adequate ventilation. (See

          Pulmonary function testing

For patients who do not meet criteria for asthma or COPD or do not respond appropriately to a trial of bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory medication, a careful examination of the flow volume loop is in order. The flow volume loop can be used to help determine whether the obstruction is fixed or variable and whether it is likely to be intrathoracic or extrathoracic (
