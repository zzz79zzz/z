The immature brain, particularly in the neonate and young infant, differs from the adult brain in the basic mechanisms of epileptogenesis and propagation of seizures. It is more prone to seizures, but seizures are more apt to disappear as the child grows.</p><p>This topic presents an overview of the initial treatment of seizures and epileptic syndromes in children.

A decision must be made about initiating chronic antiseizure medication treatment if a potentially reversible acute cause is not found during the evaluation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6218.html" rel="external">"Seizures and epilepsy in children: Clinical and laboratory diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6218.html" rel="external">"Seizures and epilepsy in children: Clinical and laboratory diagnosis", section on 'Setting in which episodes occur'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1871642427"><span class="h2">Unprovoked seizure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The term "unprovoked seizure" refers to a seizure of unknown etiology as well as one that occurs in relation to a preexisting brain lesion or progressive nervous system disorder (often referred to as a remote symptomatic seizure). Unprovoked seizures are distinct from seizures due to an acute condition such as a toxic or metabolic disturbance, fever, head trauma, or acute stroke (ie, acute symptomatic seizures). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6199.html" rel="external">"Seizures and epilepsy in children: Classification, etiology, and clinical features", section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p>The approach to starting antiseizure medication therapy for a first-ever versus a second unprovoked seizure is reviewed in the sections that follow.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1539283048"><span class="h3">First unprovoked seizure</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In most cases, we refrain from starting antiseizure medication therapy for a child with a first unprovoked seizure. This approach is consistent with the current practice of most neurologists. Similarly, a consensus statement from the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) states that in an otherwise well infant, a policy of "wait and see" with close follow-up monitoring is reasonable after a first afebrile seizure [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Even if the child has a static encephalopathy, treatment can be withheld until a recurrence pattern is established.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Antiseizure medication treatment may be warranted after a first unprovoked seizure for select children with specific epilepsy syndromes [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. As an example, treatment with a broad spectrum antiseizure medication would be indicated for a teenager with a first-time generalized tonic-clonic seizure whose EEG showed 4 to 6 Hz generalized spike and slow wave activity, confirming the diagnosis of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). In addition, the risk of seizure recurrence is higher in children with a potential remote symptomatic etiology, particularly if the seizure was focal and the electroencephalogram (EEG) or brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is abnormal; in such cases, the benefits of immediate antiseizure medication therapy may outweigh the risks.</p><p></p><p>In all cases, the decision should be individualized, weighing the risks of recurrent seizure against the potential risks and benefits of antiseizure medication therapy and incorporating patient values and preferences. Treatment is reasonable when the benefits of reducing the risk of a second seizure are greater than the risks of pharmacologic adverse effects [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2635600978"><span class="h4">Factors influencing the decision</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The main factors to consider in deciding whether or not to treat a child with a first-time unprovoked seizure include:</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The risk for recurrent seizures, which varies based on clinical factors. (See <a class="local">'Risk of seizure recurrence'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The relative risk reduction that can be expected from immediate antiseizure medication therapy. Limited data in children suggest that early versus delayed antiseizure medication therapy reduces the short-term risk of a recurrent seizure but does not appear to affect the long-term prognosis of epilepsy. Specifically, starting antiseizure medication treatment after a first unprovoked seizure does not confer additional benefit for long-term seizure control compared with starting after a second seizure [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Effects of early versus deferred therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The risks of not treating, which include another seizure with its attendant risk of injury and psychologic stigma (including restrictions on driving and work environment in teenagers and young adults) and, infrequently, status epilepticus.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The risks of chronic antiseizure medication therapy, which includes possible effects on school performance and behavior, allergic reactions, and systemic toxicity. The financial burden of chronic antiseizure medications, office visits, and laboratory tests should also be considered.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h4">Risk of seizure recurrence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The child who is neurologically normal, has no history of a prior neurologic illness, and has an unprovoked seizure with no evident acute cause has an approximately 25 percent risk of having another seizure in the next year and a 45 to 50 percent risk over the next three years [<a href="#rid4">4-7</a>].</p><p>Clinical factors associated with an increased risk of recurrent seizures include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prior neurologic insult (ie, remote symptomatic seizure)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Focal seizure</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Significant brain MRI findings</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abnormal EEG</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Family history of epilepsy</p><p></p><p>The magnitude of risk associated with each one of these factors varies, and the additive effects of multiple risk factors have not been clearly established. In a large prospective study of 283 children with a first-time unprovoked seizure, neurologically normal children with no history of prior neurologic illness had a 24 percent risk of having a seizure in the next year [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. The one-year recurrence risk increased to 37 percent in children with a prior neurologic insult (remote symptomatic), such as cerebral palsy, and increased to 70 percent in patients who had two seizures separated by at least 24 hours. Most but not all of the children in this study were not treated with an antiseizure medication.</p><p>In the same study, the one-year recurrence risk was 41 percent if the EEG was abnormal (epileptiform activity, focal or generalized slowing) compared with 15 percent in children with a normal EEG [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>In another study, significant MRI findings, present in 16 percent of children, were associated with a twofold higher incidence of recurrent seizure by 27 months (80 versus 44 percent) and were more predictive of short-term seizure recurrence than EEG findings [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>Status epilepticus as the presenting seizure may be another risk factor for recurrent seizures, although the available data are less consistent [<a href="#rid4">4,9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1539283591"><span class="h4">Effects of early versus deferred therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In adults, immediate antiseizure medication therapy after a first-time unprovoked seizure reduces the risk of recurrence by approximately 35 percent at one to two years postseizure [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]; more limited data in children suggest that the short-term benefits of antiseizure medication therapy are similar to those in adults.</p><p>Withholding treatment until after the second seizure does not alter the long-term prognosis of epilepsy, however. A study that randomly assigned 419 patients with a first tonic-clonic seizure to immediate antiseizure medication therapy or treatment only after a second seizure found that immediate treatment reduced the short-term relapse rate [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. However, at one and two years, the number of patients who remained seizure free in the early-treatment and delayed-treatment groups were similar (83 to 87 percent at one year, 60 to 68 percent at two years). A similar study of 1443 patients (38 percent were ≤19 years old) found that immediate antiseizure medication treatment reduced the short-term (one- to two-year) risk of seizure relapse, but had no effect on the long-term risk of relapse [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The benefit of immediate treatment was lost by four years after a first seizure and by six years after multiple seizures.</p><p>The long-term risk of mortality after a single seizure appears to be quite low, and there is no evidence that treatment after an initial seizure has any impact on mortality. In a cohort study of 407 children with a first unprovoked seizure, four had a seizure-related death over a 14-year observation period [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Each of these had multiple seizures that were not fully controlled with antiseizure medication treatment; none died prior to initiation of antiseizure medication therapy, and two had been treated after the first seizure that was status epilepticus.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1539283280"><span class="h3">Second unprovoked seizure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We start antiseizure medication therapy for most children who present with a second unprovoked seizure, since seizure recurrence indicates that the patient has a substantially increased risk for additional seizures (ie, epilepsy) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>There are some exceptions, however. Many parents and caregivers elect no antiseizure medications if the seizures are infrequent and/or mild. However, the definitions of "infrequent" and "mild" are subjective and may vary among parent and caregivers. By contrast, children with absence seizures, atonic seizures or drop attacks, and infantile spasms are virtually always treated, since they usually present to the clinician with an already established pattern of frequent seizures.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1539283287"><span class="h2">Acute symptomatic seizure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An acute symptomatic seizure (also referred to as a provoked seizure or reactive seizure) is a seizure that occurs in close temporal association with an acute systemic illness or brain insult. Children who have a seizure in the setting of an acute illness (eg, acute infection, acute head injury) have a low risk of seizure recurrence compared with other children with a first seizure [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. When a seizure is associated with a specific underlying acute etiology, seizure recurrence is likely only if the underlying etiology recurs. Examples include seizures associated with febrile illnesses, metabolic derangements (eg, hyponatremia), and concussion.</p><p>Management of acute symptomatic seizures should be focused on correction of the acute provoking illness or anomaly and preventing its recurrence. Children with an acute symptomatic seizure may not require antiseizure medication therapy. Exceptions include hospitalized children who are recovering from an acute illness that triggered seizures (eg, correctable conditions such as severe electrolyte disturbances with dehydration, arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D, previously called central diabetes insipidus), syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone secretion [SIADH]); they may be loaded and maintained on an antiseizure medication for several days to a week or two, but antiseizure therapy is usually stopped before hospital discharge. Children with acute seizures due to meningitis or encephalitis are more likely to stay on antiseizure medication therapy for a little longer after hospital discharge. Children with acute posttraumatic seizures after a concussion often do not require any antiseizure therapy. Children with severe traumatic brain injury requiring intensive care will usually receive maintenance antiseizure medication coverage regardless of whether they have had seizures.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1539294071"><span class="h2">Febrile seizure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children presenting with a first-time febrile seizure have an approximately 30 to 35 percent chance of having another febrile seizure during early childhood. Although antiseizure medications have been shown to lower the risk of recurrent febrile seizures, given the benign nature of febrile seizures, the risks of side effects from antiseizure medications generally outweigh the benefits for most patients. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/96573.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prognosis of febrile seizures", section on 'Role of preventive therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h1">SELECTION OF AN ANTISEIZURE MEDICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is an ever-growing list of antiseizure medications and nonpharmacologic therapies available to manage childhood epilepsy [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Traditionally, the medications have been separated into "older" and "newer" groups based upon their historic regulatory approval and availability. Typically, when a medication is first approved for epilepsy, it receives an "on-label indication" for add-on (adjunctive) therapy for partial-onset seizures in adults. Then, as experience grows and other studies are done, the use of the drug may expand to other seizure types and younger age groups.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1539283924"><span class="h2">Seizure-related considerations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The antiseizure medication chosen for initial therapy should be one that is effective for a particular seizure type or syndrome [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. The initial work-up should include an attempt to determine the specific type of seizure the child experienced and, if possible, the epilepsy syndrome. The optimal choice of antiseizure medication depends on the type of seizure and the epilepsy syndrome. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6199.html" rel="external">"Seizures and epilepsy in children: Classification, etiology, and clinical features"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6162.html" rel="external">"Epilepsy syndromes in children"</a>.)</p><p>For some epilepsy syndromes, available data support choosing certain antiseizure medications over others as first-line therapy. Examples include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Corticotropin (ACTH) for infantile spasms (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6186.html" rel="external">"Infantile epileptic spasms syndrome: Management and prognosis", section on 'Corticotropin (ACTH)'</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13288" href="/z/d/drug information/13288.html" rel="external">Ethosuximide</a> or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12873" href="/z/d/drug information/12873.html" rel="external">valproate</a> for childhood absence epilepsy (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14450.html" rel="external">"Childhood absence epilepsy", section on 'Treatment'</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12873" href="/z/d/drug information/12873.html" rel="external">Valproate</a> for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17192.html" rel="external">"Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy", section on 'Valproate'</a>)</p><p></p><p>For other types of epilepsy, such as focal epilepsy due to a remote symptomatic cause or mesial temporal sclerosis, there are no clear differences in efficacy among various antiseizure medications, and clinicians generally choose first-line therapy based on other drug-related factors such as side effects, cost, and dosing intervals. <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12910" href="/z/d/drug information/12910.html" rel="external">Levetiracetam</a>, which has broad-spectrum activity and has minimal drug interactions, has become a common choice for first-line treatment of early-life epilepsy, although other drugs are equally reasonable and the choice should be individualized [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Drug-related considerations'</a> below.)</p><p>In some cases, particularly for generalized epilepsy syndromes, seizures may be aggravated by the administration of a narrow-spectrum antiseizure medication, when a broad-spectrum antiseizure medication is more appropriate  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78021" href="/z/d/graphic/78021.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). As examples, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13113" href="/z/d/drug information/13113.html" rel="external">carbamazepine</a> and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12702" href="/z/d/drug information/12702.html" rel="external">phenytoin</a> have been reported to worsen absence and myoclonic seizures in individuals with idiopathic generalized epilepsy [<a href="#rid19">19-22</a>].

Single-drug therapy is the goal of epilepsy treatment. Monotherapy is associated with better compliance, fewer adverse effects, less potential for teratogenicity, and lower cost than is polytherapy. Drug interactions are avoided and pharmacokinetics are simplified.</p><p>In the absence of clear differences in efficacy among various antiseizure medications, clinicians must choose first-line therapy primarily based on pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, and consideration of drug-drug interactions.

(See <a class="local">'Selection of an antiseizure medication'</a> above and <a class="local">'Initiation of antiseizure medication therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Follow-up and monitoring</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>For specific medications</strong> – Serum antiseizure medication levels are informative for certain antiseizure medications but not others, and some antiseizure medications (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12873" href="/z/d/drug information/12873.html" rel="external">valproate</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13113" href="/z/d/drug information/13113.html" rel="external">carbamazepine</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12664" href="/z/d/drug information/12664.html" rel="external">oxcarbazepine</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12851" href="/z/d/drug information/12851.html" rel="external">topiramate</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12612" href="/z/d/drug information/12612.html" rel="external">zonisamide</a>, and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13101" href="/z/d/drug information/13101.html" rel="external">vigabatrin</a>) require monitoring based on specific dose-related or idiosyncratic adverse effects, as noted in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68462 graphicRef80434" href="/z/d/graphic/68462.html" rel="external">table 2A-B</a>). (See <a class="local">'Follow-up and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>For worrisome adverse events</strong> – Vigilance for adverse events is warranted for any child receiving chronic antiseizure medications  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59755" href="/z/d/graphic/59755.html" rel="external">table 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78896" href="/z/d/graphic/78896.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). A seemingly benign illness that lasts for more than a few days should prompt a complete blood count (CBC) and/or liver function studies. Vomiting (the most common early symptom of hepatotoxicity or pancreatitis), prolonged unexplained fever, easy bruising, extreme fatigue or lethargy, flu-like symptoms, unexplained worsening of seizures, change in mental status, and abdominal pain should lead to further investigations. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring for adverse events'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>For depression and suicidality</strong> – Increased suicidality has been linked to several antiseizure medications. Patients taking antiseizure medications should be monitored for emergence or worsening of suicidal ideation or depression. (See <a class="local">'Psychiatric and behavioral health screening'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment failure</strong> – Most children with epilepsy achieve reasonably good seizure control with antiseizure medication monotherapy or polytherapy, but some are refractory despite numerous medications. Medical treatment failure is often apparent early in the course of treatment. In these cases, referral to a comprehensive epilepsy center is appropriate to explore additional therapeutic options, including epilepsy surgery, vagus nerve stimulation, and the ketogenic diet. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/101361.html" rel="external">"Seizures and epilepsy in children: Refractory seizures"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>When to consider medication withdrawal</strong> – Withdrawal of antiseizure medication therapy should be considered in most children after 18 to 24 months without seizures, regardless of the etiology of the seizures. The likelihood of recurrence after a two-year period without seizures is approximately 30 to 40 percent. Antiseizure medications should be tapered rather than halted abruptly.
