         Exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) takes place in many different microenvironments (ie, distinct places where time is spent). For children, the home is a dominant locus of exposure. Elimination of smoking in an environment appears to be the only effective means of preventing SHS exposure in that location [

         Strategies to prevent SHS exposure and the role of the health care provider are reviewed here. The adverse health effects of SHS and related issues are discussed separately:

         The contributions of various microenvironments to personal SHS exposures depend upon the amount of time spent in each setting and on the concentrations of SHS in those environments. The contributions of different microenvironments also depend upon age, sex, and other sociodemographic factors that determine time-activity patterns and the SHS concentrations in them.

         For children, the home is a dominant locus of exposure. (See

         For adolescents and adults, public environments including the workplace and social environments may be significant loci for SHS exposure, depending on coverage by clean indoor air regulations and laws. In the United States, smoking is no longer allowed in most workplaces and public places. Therefore, the home environment is a critical locus of exposure for most adults as well as children. With the rising use of vaping (via electronic cigarettes [e-cigarettes] and other nicotine delivery devices) and heat-not-burn products, concern about secondhand exposure to emissions from these products is a new issue. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Public smoking bans'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The concentration of SHS in a particular indoor environment depends upon the intensity of smoking (the strength of the source), the rate of exchange of air in the space with outdoor air or other "clean" air, and the presence and effectiveness of any air cleaning devices. For public and commercial buildings, ventilation requirements are set by code, generally following the standards published by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). The ventilation standard assumes that adequate indoor air quality cannot be achieved if smoking is allowed, even with additional ventilation, a view reaffirmed in a position statement by ASHRAE [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Air cleaning also is not sufficient if smoking is allowed. Elimination of smoking in an environment appears to be the only effective means of preventing SHS exposure in that location [

         Distinct SHS control strategies are directed at different environments. Public places, workplaces, and transportation environments are subject to regulation, whereas the home is not. Education lays the groundwork for good compliance with legislation and regulation and, in some areas (eg, the home), is the only intervention strategy that is available. Smoking, and therefore exposure to SHS, is an important social determinant of health and source of health disparities in the United States [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. The disparities are attributable to several structural forces, including targeting of vulnerable groups by the tobacco industry, disparate enforcement of age-for-sale laws, and barriers to health care and smoking cessation resources.
        </p>
        <p>
         Health care professionals should educate their patients and support legislation and regulations designed to protect nonsmokers and promote clean air. Regulatory strategies prohibiting smoking, when they exist and are enforced, decrease population exposure to SHS. Indirect regulatory forces (eg, increased cigarette taxes, controls on cigarette advertising) can help address source control in the home, the major environment where SHS exposure still occurs in the United States [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         SHS exposure has greatly decreased in the United States, suggesting that these control strategies are having beneficial effects [

          7,8
         </a>
         ]. According to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the percentage of nonsmoking children with detectable serum cotinine concentrations (&gt;0.05 ng/mL) decreased from 87 percent in 1988-1991 to 36 percent in 2015-2016, with a similar downward trend in nonsmoking adults [

         In general, health care providers should advise against purchase of an air cleaning device for the home as a strategy for controlling SHS exposure. Various devices are available for air cleaning, but none is sufficient to achieve healthy indoor air where there is smoking.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cleaning air of SHS poses a technical challenge because of the strength of tobacco combustion as a source of indoor air pollution and the myriad gases and particles that are included in SHS. Available devices range from complex and expensive systems that are incorporated into the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems of buildings to simple tabletop devices and "smokeless ashtrays" that are purported to control SHS exposure at its source.
        </p>
        <p>
         For any air cleaning device to be effective, it must be able to clean a sufficient volume of air in relation to the total volume of the space where it is operating. Few devices are able to clean sufficient volumes of air to be effective in managing smoking indoors, particularly if complete control is the goal. Small devices, like smokeless ashtrays and many tabletop units, offer inadequate cleaning capacity. Devices can only be effective for SHS if they include both filters or electrostatic precipitators to remove particles and a sorbent, such as activated charcoal, to remove gases. Although a few such devices are available, they tend to be very expensive and are only partially effective; no device can achieve healthy indoor air where there is smoking. A trial addressed the feasibility of using air cleaners in the homes of women who were pregnant or had an infant [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. The use of two air cleaners reduced the level of small particles in the air but did not create a smoke-free environment. Thus, while air cleaners may be helpful in some circumstances (eg, reducing exposure to wildfire smoke), they are not a solution to SHS. A smoking policy for the home is the preferred solution.

         Most smokers in the United States are now aware of the risks of tobacco to health and also have a general knowledge of the risks of SHS exposure. However, they may not be sufficiently informed about specific risks that might affect their decision to expose children or other household members to SHS. Personalizing the risks, through education of the smokers in the household, may increase the effectiveness of counseling. Smokers may not know that SHS exposure can cause lung cancer and cardiovascular disease in their spouses or contribute to asthma and otitis media in their children. (See

The 2020 United States Surgeon General Report on Smoking Cessation has an overall conclusion that smoking cessation by pregnant women benefits both the health of the mother as well as the fetus and newborn [

         ]. However, many pediatric health care providers lack confidence in their ability to counsel parents and caregivers about their smoking and have not routinely done so, although they often ask about child exposure to smoking and the presence of smokers in the household [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26

          24,25,27

         The home environment is the most important locus of SHS exposure for children. In a nationally representative sample in the United States, the mean serum level of cotinine (the principal nicotine metabolite) was nearly 20-fold higher among children exposed to SHS in the home compared with those not exposed in the home [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. The increase in cotinine level associated with home exposure was greatest for infants and young children.

         The air quality of homes is not subject to direct regulation by any entity, and, consequently, effective educational strategies are needed to reduce exposures in homes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Smokers should be supported in quitting smoking for the benefit of their own health as well as the health of those around them. For those smokers who are unable or unwilling to quit, a policy should be established to have smokers smoke outside of the home [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22,30
         </a>
         ]. Allowing smoking in the house, but with restrictions, does not provide maximum protection. In cross-sectional surveys of households containing smokers and infants or toddlers, urinary cotinine levels were lower among children from households where smoking was not permitted in the house than among those from households using less strict harm-reduction measures [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31,32
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Among households of smokers in the United States, the proportion that do not allow smoking within the house varies by region, ranging from 69.4 percent in Kentucky to 93.6 percent in Utah (median 83 percent) [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. This rate is dramatically increased compared with the early 1990s, when the prevalence of home smoking bans ranged from 25.6 percent in Kentucky to 69.4 percent in Utah (median 43 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         Exposure to SHS decreased steadily from 1988 through 2011 but then plateaued [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. In 2013 to 2014, almost 40 percent of children ages 3 to 11 years, including 66 percent of Black children, were exposed to SHS, as measured by serum cotinine concentrations. As of 2015, one in five households still permitted smoking inside of the home and family vehicle [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. Self-imposed home smoking bans, however, may be incomplete or have limited success with long-term adherence. A cross-sectional study among parents of young children in low-income communities in Massachusetts showed that adoption of a complete ban or partial household smoking ban was associated with lower air nicotine levels in the homes, but adherence was not stringent [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Intermediate steps to reduce exposure include restricting smoking to a particular room with good ventilation, smoking after the children have gone to bed, and smoking away from children and other nonsmokers. By themselves, neither air cleaning nor increasing ventilation is a sufficient control measure. These measures may reduce the concentrations of gaseous and particulate components of tobacco smoke, but they do not completely eliminate them. Indoor air in homes exchanges with outdoor air largely through natural diffusion. The air exchange rate cannot be substantially and sufficiently increased by opening windows and doors and has been reduced in many homes by efforts to increase energy efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
         A number of studies have evaluated interventions to reduce SHS exposure in the home and promote parental smoking cessation, with mixed results. For example, a 2015 systematic review of studies from 2000 through 2014 identified 28 articles on smoking cessation and SHS reduction [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. Results were mixed and heterogeneous. Some trials have demonstrated positive results [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23,38-44
         </a>
         ], while others have not produced significant reductions in child exposure or in persuading parents to stop smoking [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45-49
         </a>
         ]. Those interventions showing the greatest sustained positive effect provided behavioral counseling delivered to individuals in the home [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23,39,50
         </a>
         ], in small groups, or through the school [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40,41,51
         </a>
         ]. As an example, cessation curriculum was effective in achieving sustained smoking abstinence and reduced SHS exposure of children [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. Several of these randomized studies also showed some benefit from clinician-delivered advice with provision of printed self-help materials [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38,41,52,53
         </a>
         ], though the effect is less than that seen with motivational counseling and may decrease after the intervention without consistent reinforcement [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23,54-56
         </a>
         ]. Another study showed benefits from a comprehensive program that included feedback about home air quality, behavioral intervention, and nicotine replacement for parents [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. One study found that a decision aid embedded in the electronic medical record effectively increased screening and counseling regarding child SHS exposure and increased smoking cessation by the parents [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ]. These studies suggest that structured clinician-delivered treatment that is only minimally more time intensive than usual care may provide substantial benefit using supportive, motivation-oriented messages and consistent follow-up reinforcement. (See
         <a class="local">
          'The role of the health care provider'

        </p>
        <p>
         There is increasing attention to the spread of SHS within multifamily buildings [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ]. Some municipalities implemented ordinances addressing smoking in such housing. In early 2017, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development prohibited the use of certain combustible tobacco products, including cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and hookahs, in public housing properties [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. Public housing agencies were required to adopt a smoke-free policy in mid-2018, affecting approximately two million people.

         Thirdhand smoke (THS) exposure refers to exposure to smoke components and their metabolic byproducts from contact with surfaces that have adsorbed smoke. The smoke leaves a residue of nicotine and other toxic substances in household dust and on surfaces. Although not yet well studied, there is concern that contact with THS will result in absorption of toxins through the skin or ingestion from contamination of the hands. Inhalation of re-suspended dust is another potential route for entry into the body [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59-61
         </a>
         ]. Young children, especially those whose parents or caregivers are smokers, are particularly at risk for exposure to THS, given their increased contact with materials, such as carpeting, that are contaminated by THS compared with adults [
         <a href="#rid62">
          62
         </a>
         ]. Although direct health effects from THS have not been established, many of the toxins that are deposited on surfaces are group 1 carcinogens, raising concerns about chronic exposure even if it is at low levels. The persistence of these substances in the home environment represents an unappreciated health hazard through dermal exposure, dust inhalation, and ingestion. In fact, odors and toxic chemicals from tobacco smoke may linger in homes for months or even years after smoking behaviors ended. To mitigate THS in the home, repainting or replacement of drywall, carpeting, and other tobacco smoke-affected materials may be necessary. A thorough, professional cleaning of the home may also help to mitigate THS [
         <a href="#rid63">
          63
         </a>
         ]. It is important to note, however, that the efficacy of these mitigation methods for the long run is still unknown; particularly if there has been long-term smoking in the home [
         <a href="#rid63">
          63

         <a href="#rid64">
          64
         </a>
         ]. Discussion of this exposure risk may be a further incentive for households to adopt home nonsmoking policies. Homebuyers and renters should inquire about prior smoking in homes they may occupy [

         There is growing use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and other devices that provide a nicotine-containing vapor. There has been limited study of the impact of e-cigarette emissions on air quality and on deposition of nicotine on surfaces where they may persist. Research suggests that e-cigarettes expose bystanders to significant concentrations of aerosolized nicotine [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66,67
         </a>
         ]. Moreover, high levels of fine and ultrafine particles that are similar to tobacco particles can be observed in indoor environments where e-cigarettes have been used [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68
         </a>
         ]. In addition, an increasing number of reports describe poisonings among children due to ingestion or dermal exposure of the nicotine liquid in cartridges or refills [
         <a href="#rid69">
          69
         </a>
         ]. Research indicates that while most dual e-cigarette and cigarette users have smoke-free home policies, they are less likely than cigarette users to have smoke-free car and comprehensive vape-free policies, indicating that dual users may perceive e-cigarette vapor as safe for children [
         <a href="#rid70">
          70
         </a>
         ]. Parents or caregivers who use e-cigarettes should be encouraged to adopt comprehensive (car and home) vape-free policies. Further research is needed regarding health risks of secondhand vapor exposure, but emerging evidence and toxicologic considerations indicate that there may be risks to the fetus and children [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71

For workers exposed to SHS during the workday, the degree of smoke exposure may be comparable with sharing a home with a smoker, depending on the extent of smoking and building characteristics.

         A study from Scotland suggests important long-term improvements in cardiac disease that may be attributable to a nationwide ban of smoking in workplaces and other public spaces [
         <a href="#rid75">
          75
         </a>
         ]. After the smoking ban was enacted in 2006, there was a 14 percent reduction in admissions for acute coronary syndrome among smokers, a 19 percent reduction among former smokers, and a 21 percent reduction among nonsmokers. Reductions in coronary events were also seen in Rome after the institution of a smoking ban [

         There has been a remarkable shift in workplace smoking in the United States. Three decades ago, smoking was ubiquitous in workplaces; now, the majority of workplaces are designated as smoke-free. Model workplace smoking policies may involve either an outright ban or restriction of smoking to designated areas; some companies ban smoking altogether on their properties. In implementing a workplace smoking policy, smokers should be provided with opportunities to participate in smoking cessation programs, and informed communication is needed for all employees.
        </p>
        <p>
         The efficacy of workplace smoking policies has been documented in studies involving measurement of airborne nicotine and also of the biomarker cotinine. One study demonstrated that policies banning smoking in the workplace are the most effective and generally lower all airborne nicotine concentrations to less than 1 mcg/m
         <sup>
          3
         </sup>
         (

          figure 1
         </a>
         ). By contrast, mean concentrations measured in workplaces that allow smoking generally range from 2 to 6 mcg/m
         <sup>

         in restaurants, and 1 to 6 mcg/m
         <sup>

         in the workplaces of blue-collar workers [
         <a href="#rid84">
          84
         </a>
         ], which compares with mean nicotine concentrations from 1 to 3 mcg/m
         <sup>

         </sup>
         that have been measured in the homes of smokers. These data are from the 1990s and are not necessarily representative of the workplace conditions of today. However, for those workers who are exposed to SHS during the workday, levels of cotinine are comparable with those coming from exposure at home. Elimination of workplace smoking is the only method to fully protect nonsmokers from exposure to SHS [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         To date, the United States lacks a federal regulation on SHS exposure in the workplace. A Healthy People 2020 objective is to establish laws in all 50 states and the District of Columbia that would make all indoor public places and worksites completely smoke-free [
         <a href="#rid85">
          85
         </a>
         ]. As of 2020, 36 states had enacted statewide bans on smoking in public and/or private workplaces [
         <a href="#rid86">
          86
         </a>
         ]. Several of these states have exemptions (eg, for casinos or very small workplaces). A 2015 national survey found that 10 percent of nonsmoking workers still reported frequent exposure to SHS (defined as twice a week or more) in the workplace, with prevalence of 20 to 30 percent in some industries (eg, repair and maintenance, trucking, construction, and forestry) [
         <a href="#rid87">
          87
         </a>
         ]. The prevalence of SHS exposure in the workplace was somewhat lower in states with comprehensive smoke-free laws (8.6 percent) compared with those with less comprehensive (12.2 percent) or no smoke-free laws (11 percent).

         Since the mid-1980s, regulation in the United States has been increasing at the local and state level to restrict or eliminate smoking in public places, including municipal buildings and shopping malls. Most jurisdictions now have such regulations in place, although enforcement varies. At a minimum, smoking is restricted to designated areas in restaurants. In many states, such as California, smoking is not allowed in restaurants or bars. Although arguments were raised in the past by the hospitality and tobacco industries concerning the economic impact of such restrictive policies, the experience in California and elsewhere has not shown negative effects of smoke-free policies on revenues. Hospitals also are smoke-free in the United States. Transportation environments are smoke-free across the country, and cigarette smoking has been prohibited on all domestic airplane flights since 1989.
        </p>
        <p>
         Model policies and regulations have been developed and made available by many organizations, including the American Lung Association. Exposure can be completely eliminated by banning smoking indoors. Simply segregating smokers and nonsmokers within the same airspace may reduce the exposure of nonsmokers to SHS but does not eliminate it [
         <a href="#rid88">
          88
         </a>
         ]. A study performed in restaurants in Albuquerque, New Mexico during the late 1980s showed that nicotine could be readily found in nonsmoking sections, often at levels similar to those found in smoking sections [
         <a href="#rid89">
          89
         </a>
         ]. Depending upon the specific details of the heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system in a building, air from a room in which smoking is taking place may be mixed with air distributed to other rooms.
        </p>
        <p>
         An increasing number of states and municipalities in the United States have passed laws establishing 100 percent smoke-free workplaces, restaurants, and bars [
         <a href="#rid90">
          90
         </a>
         ]. Some municipalities have restricted smoking outdoors on public property. With increasing restriction of smoking indoors, nonsmokers are now likely to report SHS exposure outdoors and to link this exposure to odor and irritation. Updated lists of smoking restrictions in the United States are maintained by advocacy organizations [
         <a href="#rid90">
          90
         </a>
         ]. Nonetheless, as of 2015, one-half of the United States population is not protected by state or local laws prohibiting smoking inside of hospitality venues [

         Evidence shows that smoke in a private vehicle is an important source of smoke exposure for children and adults. Studies show that smoke concentration may be quite high in vehicles while people are smoking [
         <a href="#rid91">
          91
         </a>
         ]. Regulations have been passed in several places to protect children against in-vehicle exposure. As examples, since 2007, the state of California has banned smoking in vehicles with a minor under age 18, while the state of Arkansas prohibits smoking in a motor vehicle carrying a child under age six years old who weighs less than 60 pounds and is in a car seat. Since the ban was implemented in California, self-reported smoke exposure of students progressively decreased and decreased more rapidly than national trends [

          Epidemiology

         – Exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) is declining in the United States, but approximately 40 percent of children have biochemical evidence of SHS exposure. There are persistent disparities in the levels of exposures. (See

         <strong>
          Counseling
         </strong>
         – Counseling should include specific and personalized messages to parents and caregivers about risks of SHS and strategies for smoking cessation. These messages are particularly important and may be more effective during important life events, such as pregnancy, birth of a child, or early childhood. A majority of smoking parents report that they want to quit and are open to smoking cessation advice from their child's pediatrician. (See

          Smoking cessation for household members

         – The home environment is the most important source of exposure to SHS for children. Smokers should be supported in quitting smoking for the benefit of their own health as well as the health of those around them. Clinician support for smoking cessation includes direct counseling, referral, and, sometimes, pharmacotherapy. (See

          Household smoking bans

         – In homes of smokers who are unable or unwilling to quit, a complete ban on indoor smoking is helpful; partial restrictions on smoking in the home are less effective. Air cleaning devices are generally

         – THS exposure refers to contact with smoke components and their metabolic byproducts on surfaces that have adsorbed smoke as well as off-gassed components. Although direct health effects from THS have not been established, many of the toxins that are deposited on surfaces are carcinogens, raising concerns about chronic exposure through dermal exposure, dust inhalation, and ingestion.

          Public smoking bans
         </strong>
         – Policies that ban all indoor smoking in workplaces and public places are highly effective in reducing smoke exposure and are an important goal of health advocacy. For workers exposed to SHS during the workday, the degree of smoke exposure may be comparable with sharing a home with a smoker. Only complete bans of indoor smoking are effective; simply segregating smokers and nonsmokers within the same airspace may reduce the exposure of nonsmokers to SHS but does not eliminate it. (See
