It is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability. The clinical features vary depending upon mutation state (full mutation versus premutation), sex (males with a full mutation are more likely to have intellectual disability than females), degree of methylation of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 gene (hypermethylation worsens outcome), and variation of gene expression across tissues due to mosaicism, as shown in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73067" href="/z/d/graphic/73067.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>This topic will discuss preconception/prenatal screening and prenatal diagnosis for fragile X syndrome. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, postnatal diagnosis, and postnatal management of the disorder are reviewed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2924.html" rel="external">"Fragile X syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2925.html" rel="external">"Fragile X syndrome: Management in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2137054540"><span class="h2">FMR1 gene and protein</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 gene (<em>FMR1</em>) is located on the X chromosome at Xq27.3 and most commonly has approximately 30 cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) trinucleotide repeats, with a "normal" range of approximately 5 to 44 CGG repeats. <em>FMR1 </em>produces the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP).</p><p>As long as <em>FMR1</em> has ≤44 CGG repeats, gene transcription produces an adequate level of FMRP (ie, a level not associated with adverse phenotypic effects) and this region of the X chromosome remains stable, passing from generation to generation without significant alteration. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3639896243"><span class="h2">Fragile X syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Fragile X syndrome is primarily caused by expansion in the number of CGG repeats within <em>FMR1</em>; rarely, other pathogenic variants are detected within the clinical spectrum, including splice site, missense, deletion, nonsense, and frame shift variants [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Deletions or point mutations within <em>FMR1</em> account for only 1 percent of cases [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. </p><p>As repeat size increases, stability decreases, thereby facilitating further increases in the number of repeats in the <em>FMR1</em> region during gametogenesis (discussed below). The lower and upper repeat length boundaries are generally described as:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Normal – 5 to 44 CGG repeats</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intermediate expansion – 45 to 54 CGG repeats</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Premutation – 55 to 200 CGG repeats </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Full mutation – &gt;200 CGG repeats</p><p></p><p>Expansion of CGG repeats within the premutation range (55 to 200 CGG repeats) increases the quantity of mRNA with toxic effects [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Expansion of CGG repeats to a full mutation (&gt;200 CGG repeats) promotes hypermethylation of <em>FMR1</em>, resulting in impaired transcription and reduced production of FMRP, which may adversely impact prenatal and postnatal brain development and postnatal ovarian function.</p><p>The appropriate distinction between intermediate and premutation length is uncertain, but clinically relevant because intermediate expansion does not have a clinical phenotype, is not associated with the phenotype of premutation carriers, and does not expand directly to a full mutation in gametes, whereas females (but not males) with a premutation are at risk of expansion to a full mutation in gametes [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>There is no cure for fragile X syndrome. Active areas of therapeutic research include manipulating the excessive methylation and replacing the deficient levels of FMRP [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. However, symptoms can be managed by individualized education programs, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, behavioral therapy, and pharmacotherapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2925.html" rel="external">"Fragile X syndrome: Management in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H882526095"><span class="h2">FMR1 expansion during gametogenesis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The risk for <em>FMR1</em> expansion in gametes depends on the sex of the parent, repeat size, frequency of adenine-guanine-guanine (AGG) trinucleotide interspersion, and pedigree. Postzygotic mitotic CGG length changes have also been reported; discordance for CGG repeat number between identical twins is assumed to be due to this mechanism [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2357149998"><span class="h3">Oocytes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Progressive generational expansion of CGG repeats occurs if two X chromosomes are present, as typically noted in females (46,XX). Expansion in the number of CGG repeats within the <em>FMR1</em> gene may be as few as one repeat or over 100 repeats. Expansion during oogenesis is supported by the finding of full <em>FMR1</em> expansions in the ovaries of premutation carriers. Whether this occurs during meiosis 1 or 2 remains unresolved [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. </p><p>The following variables affect the frequency of expansion to a full mutation: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Number of CGG repeats – Among females with a premutation &gt;90 CGG repeats, the likelihood of further expansion to a full mutation (ie, over 200 repeats) during oogenesis is at least 90 percent  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64429" href="/z/d/graphic/64429.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. The frequency is much less with fewer repeats. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Conservatively, the upper limit of the intermediate range may be considered 54 repeats, where 55 is a "potential" premutation and 56 to 200 is a premutation. In one study, females with 45 to 54 repeats had a 6.6 percent risk of expansion during oogenesis, but none expanded to a full mutation in one generation [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Reports of expansion to a full mutation during oogenesis among females with 55 to 59 CGG repeats are very rare (one case at 56 CTG repeats and two cases at 59 CTG repeats). When assessed by a cohort study and not case reports, the risk of the smallest premutations (55 to 59 CGG repeats) expanding to full mutations is &lt;1 percent. (See <a class="local">'Post-test counseling'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pedigree – The frequency of expansion to a full mutation is higher when a full mutation exists in the individual's pedigree [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The frequency is lower when the pedigree does not exhibit individuals with known fragile X syndrome, developmental delay, or autism spectrum disorder.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>AGG trinucleotide interspersion – The frequency of CGG expansion to a full mutation is higher in individuals with a low frequency of AGG trinucleotide interspersion in the variable region. Because AGG acts as a stabilizer for the region, fewer AGG interspersions allows destabilization of the region and increases the likelihood of expansion [<a href="#rid12">12-16</a>]. In one study, 53 percent of full mutation expansions occurred from maternal alleles with no AGG interruptions, 43 percent occurred from maternal alleles with one AGG, and only 4 percent occurred from maternal alleles with two AGGs [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. </p><p></p><p>Contraction from a premutation to a normal allele is rare, but has been reported in mother-to-female offspring transmission. The role of AGG regions, which mitigate the expansion risk of the <em>FMR1, </em>do not appear to affect contraction rates [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3579761059"><span class="h3">Sperm</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In males, sperm cells only carry premutation alleles, even when the male has a full mutation. In contrast to oocytes, expansion of a premutation to a full mutation does not occur in sperm [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Males with a premutation ("transmitting males") pass sperm with a premutation to all of their female offspring (who always inherit their father's X chromosome) and to none of their male offspring (who never inherit their father's X chromosome). In contrast to mother-to-female offspring transmission where contraction of the premutation is rare, one-third of female offspring who inherit a premutation from their father have contraction in the size of the expansion.</p><p>The molecular processes behind contraction of CGG repeats within the <em>FMR1</em> gene remain unclear. Strand mismatch and DNA polymerase slippage are considered two likely contenders, and other molecular changes may play a role. The timing of these changes remains unknown, but evidence suggests the contraction can occur during both meiosis and mitosis [<a href="#rid8">8,18-20</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3784361128"><span class="h2">Factors affecting phenotype</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The fragile X syndrome phenotype depends on several factors, including the individual's sex, the number of CGG repeats, degree of <em>FMR1</em> methylation, and variation of gene expression across tissues due to mosaicism (either in repeat size or methylation), as shown in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73067" href="/z/d/graphic/73067.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). These factors play a role in the production of FMRP and lower protein levels result in a more severe phenotype.</p><p>The individual's sex chromosome composition (46,XY; 46,XX or variations) is an important factor because males have only one X chromosome and thus have the expanded CGG region in each of their cells. Females have two X chromosomes, one of which is normally silenced such that for any cell, the expanded CGG region is transcriptionally active from only one of their two X chromosomes. Since one of their X chromosomes is randomly inactivated, the overall number and distribution of cells with an expanded region is variable in females and results in a wide range of effects (from no discernable effects to classic fragile X syndrome characteristics). There is no accurate way to predict the phenotype in females with a full mutation.</p><p>Premutations are now recognized as the physiologic basis for fragile-X premutation-associated conditions (FXPAC). At the premutation level of expansion, the increased mRNA is thought to be the primary toxic agent with mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal death consistent across the FXPACs. The symptoms are wide ranging but generally fall into one of the following categories: fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), and fragile X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (FXAND) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p><em>FMR1 expansion</em> mosaicism (cells from the same patient have different numbers of CGG repeats and different methylation profiles) is common, resulting from the instability of the <em>FMR1 </em>region and postzygotic removal of part of the expansion [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. For example, almost half of individuals with fragile X syndrome possess some cells with full <em>FMR1 </em>mutation regions and other cells with premutation regions. </p><p>A detailed description of the drivers of phenotype and the spectrum of clinical features of fragile X syndrome is available separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2924.html" rel="external">"Fragile X syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h1">PRECONCEPTION AND PRENATAL SCREENING</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H540637165"><span class="h2">Rationale</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Preconception or prenatal screening for fragile X premutations and full mutations is performed to identify individuals at risk for conceiving a child with clinical manifestations of fragile X syndrome. The prevalence of <em>FMR1</em> premutation ranges from 1 in 250 to 813 male individuals to 1 in 110 to 270 female individuals, reflecting variation among populations globally [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. When this information is available before pregnancy, carriers have an opportunity to seek interventions for avoiding pregnancy with an affected fetus, if desired. (See <a class="local">'Preconception reproductive options'</a> below.)</p><p>After pregnancy is established, carriers may choose to undergo prenatal diagnosis for fetal fragile X premutations and full mutations so they can prepare for the birth of an affected child or terminate a pregnancy with an affected fetus. (See <a class="local">'Prenatal (fetal) diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h2">Screening</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Targeted approach</strong> – A careful assessment of individual and family history is performed to identify persons with sufficient likelihood of premutation or full mutation carrier status to warrant screening. We use the following criteria for offering targeted fragile X screening or referral for diagnostic testing:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Individuals seeking reproductive counseling who have a family history of fragile X syndrome (confirmed <em>FMR1 </em>premutation or full mutation), intellectual disability, or autism spectrum disorder of undetermined etiology.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Individuals of either sex with intellectual disability or developmental delay of undetermined etiology, or autism spectrum disorder.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Young females with elevated levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, especially with a family history of premature ovarian insufficiency (menopause before age 40), fragile X syndrome, or a relative of either sex with intellectual disability of undetermined etiology.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Individuals with late-onset intention tremor or ataxia (usually after age 50), especially with a history of infertility, family history of movement disorders, fragile X syndrome, or intellectual disability of undetermined etiology.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Broad genetic carrier screening panel approach – </strong>For individuals without a family history or specific ethnicity considerations, after pretest counseling we now offer an American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) tier 3 panel (inclusive of fragile X) to attain equity in screening across an increasingly varied general population [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Pretest counseling'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">ACMG now promotes a tiered approach (tiers 1 to 4) to genetic carrier screening with progressively more conditions included in the higher tiers [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. The tiers were designed with a goal of equity across a diverse heritage population in the United States. Fragile X is included in tier 3, with ACMG recommendations to offer tier 3 or 4 in either the preconception or prenatal settings. Carrier panels designed for one population (such as persons of Ashkenazi Jewish descent) are highly sensitive and specific but perform less well in the general United States population with increased admixture of cultures, ethnicities, and races. Broader carrier screening panels, such as ACMG tiers 3 and 4 (as opposed to tiers 1 and 2), include a wide range of inherited conditions with better representation of a general population with increasingly diverse heritage. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Is there a role for universal screening?</strong> – Some authorities suggest routinely offering fragile X carrier laboratory screening to all females, given the high test sensitivity (99 percent), the potential impact of the full mutation in offspring, and the relatively high premutation carrier rate (ranging from 1 in 257 for females with a negative family history of intellectual disability, developmental problems, or autism spectrum disorder, to 1 in 86 for females with a positive family history [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]) [<a href="#rid11">11,27</a>]. Concerns about general population reproductive screening for fragile X syndrome include the complexities of pre- and post-test counseling, the challenges in predicting expansion of the premutation, counseling regarding health risks of premutation carriers, and the broad phenotype in the full mutation female fetus. Each of these concerns is undergoing continued review as reproductive genetic carrier screening expands for other conditions. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Universal fragile X carrier laboratory screening is <strong>not</strong> recommended for males. Their male offspring will not inherit their X chromosome, though all daughters will carry a premutation. Further CGG expansion does not occur in sperm, and some evidence suggests premutations become smaller when passed from a father to his female offspring [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1157884001"><span class="h2">Pretest counseling</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pretest counseling remains an essential component of all reproductive genetic carrier screening and can be performed virtually, in person, and/or with written materials. Pretest counseling for genetic carrier screening should address:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Potential variation in the identified condition</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Possible identification of a parental condition with medical implications, and </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inability to detect all genetic alterations contributing to a specific condition </p><p></p><p>These three considerations are particularly notable for fragile X carrier screening. An important component is making sure that patients understand that the prognosis of a female fetus with a full mutation remains difficult to predict, given the spectrum of presentation from normal to classic fragile X syndrome and lack of available phenotypic predictors. Secondly, fragile X carrier screening is unique in the association of specific clinical manifestations with premutation carriers (female and male) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Notably, FXPAC is undergoing extensive clinical and biologic investigation to further refine the molecular basis, clinical variability, and contributors to phenotype. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3989881798"><span class="h2">Laboratory testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The gold standard for fragile X testing is polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by Southern blot: </p><p>PCR can determine the size of the CGG region. It can accurately identify a normal allele and premutation and assess size differences between large premutations and small full mutations. However, as the region expands to a larger, full mutation, PCR often is unable to discern the margins of the expansion accurately. In such cases, Southern blot is performed to further refine size and, importantly, the methylation status. Southern blot is not performed as the first-line test because it requires substantially more DNA than PCR and is more time consuming to accomplish.</p><p>Given the noted limitations with PCR and Southern blot testing, modifications and alternatives to PCR testing continue to emerge. A triplet repeat-primed PCR (TP-PCR) modification provides comparable detection to the two-step PCR and Southern blot testing process. In 2020, a commercial PCR-based interpretation of methylation test (AmplideX Fragile X Dx and Carrier Screen Kit) became available for screening for fragile X premutations in various populations [<a href="#rid29">29-31</a>]. This PCR-based methylation assessment has been reported to be as effective as Southern blot analysis. Intended initially for premutation carrier screening, use as a diagnostic test is being pursued. An alternative approach has also emerged with optical genome mapping (OGM), which may be able to overcome the challenges of multiple, repeated short segments by using labeled, ultra-long DNA molecules. Initial work on <em>FMR1</em> was reassuring, supporting further development [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p>AGG trinucleotide genotyping may be performed, as it may be useful for counseling females with intermediate and premutation expansions [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See <a class="local">'FMR1 expansion during gametogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p>It is important to note that routine investigations for developmental delay/intellectual disability/autism spectrum disorder, such as chromosome microarray and exome or whole genome sequencing, do not typically detect fragile X syndrome.

A full mutation is passed on as a premutation. A premutation is usually passed on as a premutation, but contraction may occur: One-third of female offspring who inherit a premutation from their father undergo contraction in the size of the expansion.

There are potential clinical sequelae to offspring and future generations when either parent is a carrier, although the most severe offspring phenotype only occurs when the mother is the carrier. Offering prenatal (fetal) diagnosis to females with as few as &gt;55 CGG repeats, however, is a conservative approach since few cases (at least three) of expansions to full mutations arising from repeats at this lowest level in females have been reported. (See <a class="local">'Prenatal (fetal) diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>Offering prenatal (fetal) diagnosis when the father is a carrier is also a debated approach since his male offspring will not inherit his X chromosome, though his female offspring will be premutation carriers in the absence of contraction.

Methylation of the promoter of <em>FMR1</em> region occurs typically at 11 weeks of gestation but can be variable. While haplotype testing can track which maternal X chromosome is inherited by the fetus, methylation of the expanded region is a secondary event and its exact timing is controversial. Even in individuals with a full mutation, there can be mosaicism within their tissues for the extent of methylation. Follow-up amniocentesis later in gestation may be considered to determine methylation status to better predict the offspring phenotype if a large premutation or small full mutation is identified.</p><p>Determining the exact size of the expansion region by analyzing cell-free DNA in a sample of maternal blood is currently unreliable but may be possible in the future with advances in this methodology.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H860752914"><span class="h2">Interpretation of findings at prenatal diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Given the complexity of this disorder, the results of prenatal testing and offspring prognosis should be provided to parents in consultation with a genetic counselor or other clinicians with expertise in the genetics and clinical findings in fragile X syndrome  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73067" href="/z/d/graphic/73067.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot techniques used for carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis are not always informative in PGT because premutations and full mutations of the <em>FMR1</em> allele are highly refractory to PCR amplification of DNA from only a single cell, and a single cell does not contain sufficient DNA for Southern blot analysis. In addition, female carriers may have impaired ovarian reserve, which hinders the ability to harvest an adequate number of oocytes for in vitro fertilization and subsequent embryo transfer, all of which are necessary components of PGT [<a href="#rid36">36,37</a>]. However, examination of maternal alleles for markers closely linked to the <em>FMR1</em> allele can provide helpful information for determining which of the X chromosomes has passed to her male or female offspring. By examining each maternal X chromosome for variations in gene markers (short tandem repeats [STR]) closely linked to <em>FMR1</em>, the STR marker results of the mother become a surrogate for the fragile X site. Such an approach can be used before methylation changes occur, such as in preimplantation embryos and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) analysis of first trimester trophoblast tissues [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].

If the risk of expansion to a full mutation is low and only a minority of females with a full mutation would be severely affected, some prospective parents may elect not to proceed to invasive testing by CVS/amniocentesis if the fetus is female. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H551894783"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
