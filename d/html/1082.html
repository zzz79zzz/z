Thus, approximately nine nonfatal strokes or deaths were avoided for every 1000 treated patients. These effects were similar in the presence or absence of atrial fibrillation.

As an example, the MATCH trial, with over 7500 patients who were treated and followed for 18 months, found that the combined use of aspirin and clopidogrel did not offer greater benefit for stroke prevention than either agent alone but did substantially increase the risk of bleeding complications [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].

We favor aspirin and clopidogrel as this combination will generally cost less. There is limited evidence from a subgroup analysis of the csps.com trial from Japan supporting treatment with DAPT using <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8872" href="/d/drug information/8872.html" rel="external">cilostazol</a> in combination with aspirin or clopidogrel and started as early as eight days after stroke onset [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. However, this study has important limitations, including post hoc design, unblinded treatment, homogeneous population studied, and early stopping of the trial. Higher-quality data are needed to determine the effectiveness of cilostazol in this setting, and for now we do not use cilostazol as a component of early DAPT.</p><p>Some randomized trials have defined minor ischemic stroke as those with an NIHSS score ≤3 [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>], while others have used an NIHSS score ≤5 [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>]. UpToDate contributors to this topic generally define minor stroke by a NIHSS score of ≤5. However, the volume of infarcted tissue should be accounted for, since the risk of hemorrhagic transformation is likely related more closely to infarct size than to the NIHSS score. Some patients with an NIHSS score ≤5 may have a relatively large volume of infarcted tissue. In such cases, clinical judgment applies, and antiplatelet monotherapy may be preferred over DAPT.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Meta-analysis</strong> – A 2018 meta-analysis pooled data from three eligible trials and over 10,400 patients with acute high-risk TIA or acute minor ischemic stroke who were assigned to DAPT using <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> or to aspirin alone started within 24 hours of symptom onset [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to early anticoagulation (within 48 hours after a minor or moderate stroke or on day six or seven after a major stroke) or later anticoagulation (day three or four after a minor stroke, day six or seven after a moderate stroke, or day 12 through 14 after a major stroke) using a DOAC. Stroke severity was determined by imaging size: an infarct of &lt;1.5 cm was considered minor; an infarct in the distribution of a cortical superficial branch of the anterior, middle, or posterior cerebral artery was considered moderate; a larger infarct in the distributions of those arteries or an infarct &gt;1.5 cm in the brainstem or cerebellum was considered major.</p><p>The ELAN trial found a nonsignificant trend towards benefit with earlier anticoagulation [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. At 30 days, the composite outcome (recurrent ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, major extracranial bleeding, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, or vascular death) occurred in 29 participants in the early anticoagulation group compared with 41 in the later anticoagulant group (2.9 versus 4.1 percent, risk difference -1.18 percent, 95% CI -2.84 to 0.47). Recurrent ischemic stroke in the early and later groups occurred in 14 and 22 participants respectively (1.4 versus 2.5 percent, risk difference -1.14, 95% CI -2.41 to 0.13), while the rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was 0.2 percent in both groups. While not definitive, these findings suggest that early DOAC use is safe and may reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke. Limitations to the ELAN trial include small number of events, a low median NIHSS score (3) at randomization, and exclusion of patients on therapeutic anticoagulation at baseline.</p><p>For patients with atrial fibrillation in whom the start of anticoagulation will be delayed by more than 48 hours (eg, those with large acute infarction), we start <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> as soon as possible after the diagnosis of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ischemic stroke is confirmed if there are no significant bleeding complications; anticoagulation can be resumed according to indication (and aspirin stopped) according to the guidance above if the patient is stable.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1968470700"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.
