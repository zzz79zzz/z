         Orthopedic complications of sickle cell disease (SCD) include vaso-occlusive bone pain, osteonecrosis, and infections (osteomyelitis and septic arthritis). Individuals with SCD are functionally asplenic and are at risk for infections that may be life-threatening. Other noninfectious bone and joint complications can cause severe pain and immobility that significantly interfere with functioning and quality of life.
        </p>
        <p>
         These complications can be challenging to distinguish, especially in individuals with chronic vaso-occlusive pain. However, it is critical to make the correct diagnosis to provide appropriate treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic discusses the orthopedic complications of SCD, including our approaches to distinguishing among them and determining the optimal management strategy.

         Bone or joint pain can be caused by vaso-occlusion, avascular necrosis of bone and associated fractures, or infection (eg, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis). These causes and our approach to distinguishing among them are discussed in the following sections.
        </p>
        <p>
         Like other disease manifestations in SCD, orthopedic complications are more frequent and tend to present at an earlier age in individuals with more severe genotypes (homozygous hemoglobin SS [Hb SS] or sickle beta
         <sup>
          0
         </sup>
         thalassemia) than in those with less severe genotypes (hemoglobin SC [Hb SC] disease or sickle beta
         <sup>
          +
         </sup>
         thalassemia). However, exceptions may occur. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7115.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of compound sickle cell syndromes"

         </span>
         Acute vaso-occlusive pain episodes are the hallmark of SCD and one of the most common manifestations requiring medical attention. Pain also accounts for the majority of hospitalizations in people with SCD. Pain can present from infancy (often as dactylitis) throughout life. Acute pain can occur as often as daily or weekly, or there may be long periods without any pain events.
        </p>
        <p>
         The mechanisms of acute vaso-occlusion and the evaluation and management of acute and chronic vaso-occlusive pain are summarized in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106388" href="/z/d/graphic/106388.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ) and discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7135.html" rel="external">
          "Pathophysiology of sickle cell disease"

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Acute vaso-occlusion can predispose people to develop other orthopedic complications because the loss of the normal bone marrow architecture (due to the replacement of fat with hematopoietic cells needed to compensate for chronic hemolytic anemia) can lead to cortical thinning and bony collapse [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].

          Pain in long bones
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The long bones are the most commonly affected site for acute vaso-occlusive pain, which is likely caused by ischemic pain, as illustrated in the figure  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef118095" href="/z/d/graphic/118095.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). However, virtually any bony structure containing red (erythropoietic) marrow, including the ribs, sternum, vertebral bodies, and skull, can be affected [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. In SCD, the red marrow is distributed throughout a greater portion of the skeleton than in individuals without SCD; chronic hemolytic anemia puts greater stress on the bone marrow to produce red blood cells (RBCs).
        </p>
        <p>
         Pain in the ribs and sternum can also lead to splinting and hypoventilation, which can contribute to acute chest syndrome. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16353.html" rel="external">
          "Acute chest syndrome (ACS) in sickle cell disease (adults and children)"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Over time, repeated episodes of vaso-occlusion can lead to ischemia-reperfusion injury, inflammatory responses, bone infarcts, necrosis, degenerative changes in marrow-containing bone, and other complications such as avascular necrosis of the femoral heads or collapsed vertebral bodies, in turn leading to a chronic state of pain in addition to the more acute painful episodes. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126298.html" rel="external">
          "Disease-modifying therapies to prevent pain and other complications of sickle cell disease", section on 'Chronic pain'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to causing pain, expansion of the bone marrow due to chronic hemolysis and increased erythropoiesis can also lead to osteopenia and ischemia, which can affect growth and development.
        </p>
        <p>
         A role for vitamin D deficiency in bone pain has also been suggested. (See
         <a class="local">

          Dactylitis and other pain sites

         </span>
         Dactylitis (also called hand-foot syndrome) refers to SCD-related vaso-occlusive pain in the small bones of hands and feet; this is typically seen in infants and very young children [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. As many as 45 percent of all children with SCD will have an episode of dactylitis by the time they reach two years of age, especially those with more severe genotypes (homozygous hemoglobin SS or sickle beta
         <sup>
          0
         </sup>
         thalassemia) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Dactylitis is less likely to be seen in children older than four, presumably because, as the child grows older, the red marrow in these small bones is replaced by fat and fibrous tissue.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dactylitis presents with a painful, often symmetrical swelling of hands or feet accompanied by mild erythema and low-grade fever. Recurrent episodes of dactylitis lead to a mottled radiographic appearance of the small bones of the hands or feet. In most cases, the radiologic abnormalities disappear over time, although a permanent shortening of the involved digits may occur.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other sites of vaso-occlusive pain include the bones of the skull and vertebral column. Like changes in the long bones and digits, vaso-occlusion in these other sites can be severe enough to cause bone infarction. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Other sites of bone infarcts'
         </a>

         </span>
         Bacterial infections of bone and joints are common in children and adults with SCD. These complications may be more likely in children because the unique vasculature in immature bone is conducive to hematogenous spread, but adults can also be affected. The early loss of splenic function and chronic bone and bone marrow infarction in SCD may be predisposing factors to this increased prevalence of infection [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Presentations of acute and chronic osteomyelitis can vary significantly and can be difficult to distinguish from an acute vaso-occlusive pain episode [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Typical presentations include vague bone pain, inability to ambulate, soft tissue edema, skin erythema, and point tenderness to palpation. In more chronic settings, draining sinus tracts can develop. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in osteomyelitis are shown in the figure  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef119608" href="/z/d/graphic/119608.html" rel="external">
          image 1
         </a>
         ). The image on the left (panel A) is from an eight-year-old boy who presented with fever and lower back pain that subsequently localized to the right femur, leading to assessment for osteomyelitis. The image on the right (panel B) is from a three-year-old boy who presented with fever and diffuse pain in the extremities that subsequently localized to the left upper leg. Cultures of the abscess aspirate and bone biopsy on day 5 (after initiating antibiotics) were negative.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a meta-analysis of 227 articles focused on managing infected joints in children, no single laboratory value could identify which had septic arthritis [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. In a retrospective analysis of 358 episodes in children with SCD who were admitted to the hospital with acute bone pain, osteomyelitis occurred in five cases (1.4 percent; two acute and three chronic osteomyelitis cases) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. The only laboratory value that helped distinguish osteomyelitis from acute vaso-occlusive pain was elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). However, interpretation of CRP can be challenging in individuals with SCD due to the chronic inflammation associated with SCD.
        </p>
        <p>
         Chronic osteomyelitis in children with SCD is a major management challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. Optimal management is unclear, and care is hampered by limited resources (absence of clean water, limited antimicrobial therapy [oral, intravenous, or both], and scarce equipment and personnel for intraoperative debridement).
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite the relatively high prevalence of chronic osteomyelitis in a busy pediatric SCD practice in Nigeria, few risk factors could be elucidated to guide optimal medical and surgical treatment. Given that the most common pathogen in a low-income setting is
         <em>
          Staphylococcus aureus
         </em>
         and prolonged intravenous therapy is impractical, new strategies for combined intraoperative debridement, coupled with brief antibiotics, should be considered after proper surgical training and systematic assessment of clinical outcomes [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ].

         Osteonecrosis (also called avascular necrosis [AVN]) is a well-described complication of vaso-occlusion that affects as many as 10 percent of individuals with SCD [
         <a href="#rid1">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The common pathophysiology for all forms of AVN is bone ischemia due to occlusion of blood vessel lumens, with subsequent microfractures, collapse of cancellous bone, and ultimately, collapse of the articular surface. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/122049.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         A unique feature of AVN in SCD is the involvement of the entire epiphysis; in most other conditions associated with AVN, only weight-bearing areas are affected. Numerous mechanisms contribute to vascular occlusion in SCD, including recurrent acute vaso-occlusive pain episodes, hypercoagulability, vessel wall hyperplasia, marrow edema and hyperplasia, and fat emboli. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7135.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         The epiphyses of long bones, such as in the femoral and humeral heads, the femoral condyles, and the distal end of the tibia, are common sites of AVN. The femoral heads are the most commonly affected sites due to limited collateral circulation in these areas [

         In the prospective CSSCD, approximately 50 percent of the participants with avascular necrosis (AVN) were identified radiographically and were asymptomatic [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27

         ]. When symptomatic, the most common sites of involvement are the femoral head (hip) and the humeral head (shoulder); the area above the knee is also frequently affected.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are case reports of AVN affecting other joints and bony structures, including the mandibular condyle, the temporomandibular joint, and the elbow. However, the prevalence of involvement of these sites is still being determined [

         AVN generally progresses through a series of stages  (

          image 2

         ). Initial stages may be asymptomatic and may be identified incidentally in an imaging study. In other cases, AVN comes to medical attention when medullary infarcts occur in the diaphysis of a long bone and cause pain or when these infarcts lead to necrosis in the epiphysis, which can cause the subchondral bone to collapse [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         Various stages of AVN are used for the histological or radiographic definition of AVN.

        <p>
         Hip AVN can also cause back, buttock, groin, or knee pain and should be considered when patients with SCD present with chronic pain or recurrent pain in the same area that occurs over weeks to months.
        </p>
        <p>
         AVN often affects more than one joint in the same individual. In one study, hip involvement was bilateral in 54 percent [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>

        <p>
         Physical examination is helpful in the diagnosis of AVN. In general, decreased range of motion and pain associated with ambulation or passive range of motion is consistent with AVN, especially if periarticular. Some individuals with AVN of the hip may have decreased ability to abduct the hip relative to the contralateral hip (assuming only one hip is affected), pain with internal or external rotation of the hip, or an antalgic gait (gait that favors weight-bearing on the unaffected side). However, these findings are not specific to AVN and cannot be used to distinguish AVN from other causes of bone or joint pain.

         There are several proposed classification and scoring systems for femoral head AVN, among them the Ficat and Arlet, Steinberg, the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO), and the Japanese Investigation Committee (JIC) systems [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. All these systems rely on radiographic findings variably incorporating plain radiographs, bone scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Imaging'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Key elements of all these systems are the extent of the femoral head involvement, the extent of cystic and sclerotic changes, subchondral collapse, flattening of the femoral head, and extent of joint narrowing. The most commonly used systems are the Ficat and Arlet and Steinberg systems, but there is no consensus on a unified system with high inter-rater reliability and prognostic value [
         <a href="#rid34">

        </p>
        <p>
         The Children's Hospital Oakland Hip Evaluation Scale (CHOHES) is a derivative of the Harris Hip Score that has been modified to specifically evaluate hip disease in individuals with SCD, facilitating diagnosis of femoral head AVN [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36

         <a class="local">
          'Femoral head'
         </a>
         below). The CHOHES scale has three domains: a patient questionnaire, a functional assessment, and a physical examination. In a validation study, scores on the scale correlated significantly with Ficat scores from plain radiographs with strong intra- and inter-rater agreement. One limitation in the broader use of this scale is that the physical examination requires a detailed assessment of range of motion and would be best performed by clinicians or physical therapists trained in using the scale.
        </p>
        <p>
         Given that the development of AVN is challenging to predict and difficult to diagnose with a plain radiograph in its early stages, biomarkers for early identification of bone disease have been sought. However, no clinically available biomarker can identify the subgroup of children or adults likely to have AVN.

         The femoral head (hip) is the most common site of avascular necrosis (AVN) in individuals with SCD. AVN of the femoral head can develop at any age (as early as five years of age in children). It generally presents with hip pain upon weight-bearing. However, early disease may be asymptomatic and may be diagnosed during the evaluation of the contralateral hip.

         In a study from 1991 involving 52 individuals diagnosed with AVN of the hip in childhood and followed for an average of 19 years, nearly all of the patients had bilateral involvement, with 80 percent of affected hips showing permanent damage (eg, decreased mobility, abnormal gait, and limb-length discrepancies) and causing pain [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40

         ]. The first symptom of pain had been noted at an average age of 12 years (range 7 to 15 years), and 15 of the 95 affected hips required a surgical procedure at an average of 30 years after the onset of AVN (range 18 to 32 years).

Approximately one-half were diagnosed incidentally, and one-half due to the development of pain. Symptoms (pain or reduced mobility) always preceded collapse. There was an average interval of approximately three to five years until pain onset and an average of an additional five years between pain onset and collapse. By the final evaluation, 91 of 121 hips (75 percent) had intractable pain and required surgery.

         ). Orbital infarction is characterized by acute periorbital pain and swelling and can be accompanied by the formation of subperiosteal or intracranial hematomas. Inflammation associated with infarction of the bone within the limited bony space of the orbit can result in an orbital compression syndrome characterized by proptosis, limitation of extraocular movement, corneal hyperesthesia, and optic nerve dysfunction. Bone infarctions in other sites of the face and skull have also been described [

         The cause of bone or joint pain in individuals with SCD can be challenging to determine; this is because presenting findings are often similar, and in some cases, more than one cause is present. Vaso-occlusive pain, bone infarction, and osteomyelitis share many clinical features, including pain, redness, edema, and limited range of motion. As a result, patients are sometimes treated for all possible causes while further evaluations are performed. All things being equal, acute pain episodes are much more common than osteomyelitis. Regardless of the suspected cause and any delays caused by additional testing, all individuals should receive adequate pain control without delay. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pain control'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Routine laboratory testing in an individual with SCD who presents with pain includes a complete blood count (CBC) and reticulocyte count to assess for the stability of the hemoglobin level and compensatory reticulocytosis, as well as leukopenia or leukocytosis indicative of infection, as discussed in more detail separately. (See

        <p>
         The optimal diagnostic approach to distinguish between vaso-occlusive pain, infarction, and infection remains unclear, and it is essential to keep in mind that more than one may be present.
        </p>
        <p>
         The following features may help narrow the diagnosis. However, none of these characteristics can provide absolute diagnostic certainty and none of these should substitute for the clinical judgment of the treating specialist who has evaluated the patient in person.

         For some people, the characteristics, severity, and site of vaso-occlusive pain tend to be relatively consistent between episodes. Thus, a patient's (or parent/caregiver's) report that the pain is typical for their vaso-occlusive pain should be taken into account; a patient's (or parent's) report that the pain is atypical should prompt evaluation for concurrent causes other than (or in addition to) vaso-occlusion.

Treatment included staged surgeries that consisted of the removal of necrotic bone and injection of the synthetic bone graft without injuring the joint cartilage; in both cases, she received hydration and transfusion and postoperative prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This case illustrates the natural history and frequent bilateral involvement of AVN and the use of a multidisciplinary treatment plan that avoided total joint replacement and incorporated optimal preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care.

         C-reactive protein (CRP) is likely higher in osteomyelitis than in acute pain episodes, but there is no threshold to distinguish acute vaso-occlusive pain episodes from osteomyelitis. The clinical utility of obtaining CRP is limited as a diagnostic test. Still, it may have some benefit in monitoring after the diagnosis of osteomyelitis has been made and a response to treatment is considered.

         The diagnostic utility of these clinical features was evaluated in a case-control study that evaluated findings in 31 individuals with SCD who had osteomyelitis (based on discharge diagnosis as well as criteria including pain, positive blood cultures, bone aspirate culture, and typical radiographic findings) and compared them with 93 controls who had vaso-occlusive pain without osteomyelitis [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58

         ]. This found that compared with controls, individuals with osteomyelitis were more likely to have preceding fever (median, one versus no days), a longer duration of preceding pain (median, five versus two days), and swelling of the affected limb (71 versus 17 percent). Controls with vaso-occlusive pain were more likely to have more than one affected site and a lower WBC count (median, 15.6 versus 18.6/micro).

         If infection is suspected, it may be necessary to treat presumptively for the likely organisms while awaiting diagnostic testing results. A decision should be made at the bedside as to whether prompt antibiotic treatment is required before obtaining a tissue sample or joint aspiration for bacterial culture and sensitivities. (See

         Inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and CRP may be obtained in some instances of possible infection, but in the proinflammatory milieu seen in patients with SCD, the elevation of these markers can be challenging to interpret. However, the trend of these inflammatory markers, if serially collected, especially CRP, can be helpful in determining treatment response to antibiotic therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to routine testing with CBC and reticulocyte count, ESR, and CRP, additional laboratory testing appropriate for those with fever or localizing symptoms suggestive of infection may include blood cultures, urine culture, and cultures of other body fluids as appropriate. Chest radiography is appropriate if there are any findings suggestive of acute chest syndrome.
        </p>
        <p>
         The results of cultures are essential in guiding antibiotic therapy. However, negative blood cultures do not eliminate the possibility of osteomyelitis since some individuals will clear bacteremia. In the case-control study mentioned above, 6 of 31 cases of osteomyelitis (19 percent) had a positive blood culture (three for
         <em>
          Salmonella
         </em>
         and one each for

         For individuals with joint effusion, aspiration of joint fluid for cell count, Gram stain, and cultures are considered the gold standard for testing. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Treatment of osteomyelitis and septic arthritis'

        </p>
        <p>
         However, neutrophil infiltrates can be seen in synovial fluid with vaso-occlusive pain and infection, and thus, this finding is not very specific. Likewise, a negative culture does not definitively eliminate the possibility of septic arthritis, especially if the patient has received antibiotics. Unlike the evaluation in individuals without SCD, in SCD, it may be necessary to provide antibiotics before cultures can be obtained, especially in those with fever, because individuals with SCD are at risk for overwhelming sepsis due to their lack of splenic function. Delaying antibiotics for a short period (eg, one hour) is reasonable in some cases, such as those in which the aspirate will be completed within an hour, the patient monitored, and the antibiotics given immediately after the aspirate. If there is a long delay in obtaining the aspirate, antibiotics should be given as soon as blood cultures are obtained. (See

         If osteomyelitis is suspected, aspiration of bone may be appropriate.

         Plain radiographs often are not needed for individuals with highly typical vaso-occlusive pain that responds to analgesic therapy, and if performed, findings are often nonspecific. Likewise, MRI may show nonspecific changes with vaso-occlusive pain and osteomyelitis that cannot be used to make a definitive diagnosis. However, in other cases, MRI may reveal a joint effusion that may be aspirated or a nidus of bone infection, with significant enhancement on T1 fat-sensitive images or gadolinium.

          Radiographs

         – Plain films evaluate pain associated with trauma or limb pain. In general, it is reasonable to proceed with a radiograph (plain film) as the first imaging step to evaluate musculoskeletal pain from any etiology. However, plain films may not show any changes early in osteomyelitis and thus cannot be used to eliminate the diagnosis. (See

          MRI
         </strong>
         – MRI with gadolinium contrast is the preferred imaging modality for patients whose diagnosis is unclear and to evaluate chronic or intermittent pain, especially if plain films suggest osteonecrosis. MRI can also show fluid collections that may represent septic joint effusions or infected areas of bone in septic arthritis  (

The results of T1 (fat-sensitive)-weighted images or short-T1 inversion recovery (STIR) images may help distinguish bone infarct from osteomyelitis; T1 images do not show enhancement in bone infarct due to sequestration of red blood cells in the fatty marrow, but contrast enhancement in acute osteomyelitis can aid in its diagnosis [

         ]. Often other joints such as the knee, elbow, wrist, shoulder, or ankle can be aspirated without ultrasound if performed by an orthopedic surgeon familiar with the topographic anatomy. Computed tomography (CT) can be helpful to guide percutaneous biopsy of the bone by interventional radiology if osteomyelitis is suspected; this can be performed under conscious sedation rather than general anesthesia, which carries a risk of precipitating or exacerbating acute chest syndrome. As an alternative to MRI, CT scans of the limb can help identify bone sequestration or involution not identified on plain films to inform surgical debridement in the setting of osteomyelitis not responsive to intravenous antibiotic administration.

         Osteomyelitis and septic arthritis both require surgical input. The general principles for the treatment of sickle cell-related osteomyelitis and septic arthritis are not different from those in individuals without SCD. Still, the choice of antibiotics should take into account the different pathogenic organisms commonly found in asplenic individuals.

          Septic arthritis
         </strong>
         – Septic arthritis requires urgent formal consultation with an orthopedic surgeon and infectious diseases expert to perform needle aspiration of the joint and determine appropriate antibiotic therapy, respectively. The decision as to who will achieve the aspiration and when it will be performed is dependent on the availability of radiology and orthopedic personnel. Most importantly, a timely decision for obtaining joint fluid is appropriate when septic arthritis is part of the differential diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The synovial fluid should be sent for white blood cell (WBC) count with differential, crystal analysis, Gram stain, and culture. A WBC count &gt;50,000/mL and increased neutrophil count on the differential (eg, &gt;80 percent) confirms the diagnosis of septic arthritis. Ultimately, positive cultures of the joint fluid further confirm the diagnosis and identify the organism, but these can take days for results to be available, especially for specific pathogens.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         If there is suspicion of septic arthritis based on the results of the joint aspiration, operative debridement and irrigation of the joint should be performed. Surgical irrigation and debridement should not be delayed until culture results are available because devastating and permanent damage to articular cartilage can occur if septic arthritis goes untreated while awaiting culture results.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Appropriate systemic antibiotics are administered following debridement, ideally immediately after cultures are obtained; an exception is if the patient is septic-appearing or hemodynamically unstable, in which case antibiotics are given more urgently. Ideally, antibiotic administration is informed by the results from the aspirated synovial fluid or intraoperative tissue collection and is administered after surgical management.

         Initial antibiotics are directed toward broad coverage of possible organisms and based on the Gram stain of the joint fluid.

          Osteomyelitis
         </strong>
         – In osteomyelitis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is helpful to determine if a sequestered nidus of infection or subperiosteal abscess would benefit from a formal surgical debridement or can be managed with intravenous antibiotics only. The imaging should be reviewed by an orthopedic surgeon capable of handling a formal debridement if indicated. (See

         Ideally, sensitivities from a positive biopsy or aspiration results can inform definitive antibiotic choice.

         The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of hematogenous osteomyelitis is uncertain.

         The utility of screening for avascular necrosis (AVN) in asymptomatic individuals has not been established. However, clinicians should have a low threshold for evaluating individuals with SCD who present with hip pain, decreased range of motion relative to the contralateral side (particularly with hip abduction) in the setting of negative orthogonal plain films, or unexplained back, pelvic, or knee pain. Clinicians should also have a low threshold for performing pelvic MRI if the radiologic imaging is equivocal, as pre-collapse AVN can be identified and treated before collapse occurs [

        </p>
        <p>
         Given the range of presenting symptoms in AVN that can easily overlap with a chronic or recurrent acute vaso-occlusive pain event, a low threshold should be set to obtain a thorough history, physical examination, and imaging studies to exclude the diagnosis of early AVN.

         Staging can have a bearing on the best treatment modality for femoral AVN. As noted above, there are numerous staging systems in existence (see
         <a class="local">
          'Stages of AVN'

         <a class="local">
          'Scoring systems and biomarkers'
         </a>
         above). Fundamentally, AVN of the femoral head can be categorized as pre-collapse and post-collapse of the subchondral surface. This is important because individuals with pre-collapse disease can be treated conservatively using combinations of pain control, physical therapy, and core decompression procedures to potentially delay progression to.

         The management of AVN in individuals with SCD is challenging. Conservative management is usually used initially because it may be effective in some individuals and is the least invasive approach.

         We favor nonsurgical intervention with a physical therapist for a defined period (approximately six weeks) with a reevaluation of progress. Our practice is consistent with a 2014 practice guideline from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. The physical therapy sessions should include a formal consult, with an assessment and plan, rather than self-administered home exercises. We prefer to reserve core decompression procedures for those who are clearly not benefitting from conservative therapy (see
         <a class="local">
          'Core decompression'
         </a>
         below). Concomitant humeral head AVN may limit the ability of an individual with femoral head AVN to use crutches or a wheelchair.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the hip (and other sites of AVN), it may be very difficult to decide when to switch from conservative measures to surgery (eg, with core decompression or arthroplasty); limited evidence exists, and no consensus has been reached. In general, we prefer to try conservative measures first with close clinical monitoring, followed by core decompression in those who are not benefitting from conservative measures and arthroplasty in those not benefitting from core decompression. This is a joint decision between the hematologist and the orthopedic surgeon, along with the patient, as to whether physical therapy or orthopedic surgery should be tried initially. In some cases of late-stage AVN, physical therapy will not change the outcome, and surgery should be the initial management. However, in early-stage AVN (Steinberg Stage-I, II, or III osteonecrosis of the femoral head), physical therapy may initially be appropriate rather than core decompression [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65
         </a>
         ]. Large randomized trials would help to identify the optimal strategy and timing for surgical treatment of AVN in individuals with SCD.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once AVN has been identified, referral to an orthopedic surgeon is critical before subchondral collapse occurs, as subchondral collapse leads to permanent joint damage. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pretreatment evaluation'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Principles for management of AVN of the humeral head are similar to those of the hip, with conservative medical care and physical therapy used as first-line therapy. (See

         In a prospective case-control study involving 42 adults with SCD who had AVN of the hip, core decompression was significantly more effective than conservative therapy (provision of walking canes) in improving functional scores, especially in those treated at an early stage [

However, the authors have noted that revision to total hip arthroplasty (THA) may be more difficult following osteotomy because it may be more challenging to place the stem for the prosthesis.

         An investigational approach to the management of AVN in SCD is the injection of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells into osteonecrotic tissue. Initial experience suggests promise in reducing pain and improving function for both femoral and humeral AVN, but its long-term efficacy in arresting progression has not been established [

         We do not encourage the use of autologous stem cell-based therapy for the treatment of AVN unless administered in a clinical trial setting with formal stopping rules, a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), and registration in clinicaltrials.gov. Our reservations are due to the unproven nature of this strategy, coupled with the absence of randomization, systematic evaluation, or a valid comparison group in the prior studies.

There was no objective measurement of outcomes from arthroscopic intervention. Humeral head resurfacing yielded initial improvement in functional scores but frequently required revision with hemiarthroplasty or total shoulder arthroplasty due to complications. The authors of the individual studies concluded that both hemiarthroplasty and total shoulder arthroplasty resulted in improved pain, range of motion, function, and patient satisfaction. The authors of the systematic review stressed that these studies have small sample sizes, do not include randomization or control groups, and do not provide long-term survival data. Guidelines for the proper management of humeral avascular necrosis will require further systematic investigation.

         There is no evidence that regular blood transfusion therapy abates the progression of early-stage AVN in individuals with SCD. Although there is a biological basis for the possibility that regular blood transfusion therapy might potentially be of benefit, there is no randomized controlled trial demonstrating its benefit in abating the progression of AVN. In the absence of confirmed evidence that blood transfusion will attenuate progression of AVN, along with the known challenges of regular blood transfusion therapy, including eventual iron chelation and burdens to the family, we do not recommend this therapy for management of early AVN. In the Silent Cerebral Infarct Multicenter Trial (SIT), 6 of 97 patients in the observation arm developed symptomatic AVN of the hip, versus 1 of 99 in the chronic transfusion arm (IRR 0.22; p = 0.02) [

These data suggest that early initiation of chronic transfusion therapy could prevent symptomatic femoral head AVN, but they do not address the role of transfusions in arresting or reversing AVN that is already present. We do not typically endorse regular blood transfusion to abate progression of symptomatic AVN due to the absence of definitive evidence supporting this practice and no clear data on when transfusion could be stopped.

         Adults with SCD who are admitted to the hospital with an acute medical illness or who are undergoing orthopedic surgery typically require venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis due to the increased risk of VTE associated with the acute illness and/or immobilization as well as the baseline increased VTE risk conferred by SCD. Bone and joint complications that might increase the risk of VTE include acute pain episodes, infection, and chronic immobility. (See

         Osteopenic and osteoporotic bone is susceptible to fracture. The causes are multifactorial and may include marrow expansion due to chronic hemolysis and the associated compensatory increase in erythropoietic activity that leads to widening of the medullary space and thinning of trabecular bone, along with vaso-occlusion-associated ischemia and vitamin D deficiency. Reduced bone mineralization has been reported in children and adults with SCD, especially in the lumbar spine [

          Causes of bone or joint pain
         </strong>
         – Bone or joint pain in individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) can be caused by vaso-occlusion, avascular necrosis of bone (AVN; osteonecrosis), fractures, or infection (osteomyelitis, septic arthritis). Dactylitis refers to vaso-occlusive pain in the small bones of the hand and feet typically seen in infants. The mechanisms, presenting findings, and natural history of these complications are described above. Like other SCD manifestations, orthopedic complications are more frequent and tend to occur at an earlier age in individuals with more severe genotypes (homozygous hemoglobin SS or sickle beta

          Clinical
         </strong>
         – Findings of vaso-occlusion, infarction, and infection are often similar (pain, redness, edema, low-grade fever); in some cases, more than one cause is present. Vaso-occlusive pain is more common than the other causes, but the other causes are easy to miss. It is important to ascertain whether the pain is typical or atypical for the person's vaso-occlusive pain and whether signs of infection, such as high fever, high white blood cell (WBC) count, or overlying swelling or ulceration, are present.

          Laboratory

         – The complete blood count (CBC) and reticulocyte count as well as inflammatory markers (WBC count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP]) are used to assess changes from baseline, and cultures are used in individuals with suspected infection. Joint fluid or bone cultures are the gold standard for diagnosing septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. These may require image-guided techniques. Common pathogens include
         <em>
          Salmonella,
         </em>

         – AVN of the hip or shoulder is seen in approximately 10 percent of individuals with SCD and is often bilateral. Optimal management has not been established. Most individuals with AVN are treated with a course of conservative therapy (a period of protected weight-bearing and supervised physical therapy), and if this is ineffective, possibly with core decompression. Arthroplasty is generally reserved for those who do not benefit from or are not candidates for core decompression because of advance subchondral collapse of the femoral head. (See
