A new systematic review of 76 studies involving nearly 3000 cases,provides some guidance; most of the studies were retrospective and involved predominately male athletes [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The lowest overall rates for RTS were reported for injuries of the femoral neck (55 percent), talus (69 percent), anterior tibial shaft (76 percent), and tarsal navicular (83 percent). The longest average times for RTS were reported for stress fractures of the tarsal navicular (127 days), femoral neck (107 days), and medial malleolus (106 days). These figures are averages, and healing for individuals may vary substantially given the many factors involved, including location within the bone, radiologic grade, duration of symptoms, compliance with treatment, and underlying bone health. Nevertheless, these findings inform treatment decisions and anticipatory guidance for athletes.

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 110 studies with just under 4000 subjects assessed research primarily involving the rotator cuff, Achilles, lateral elbow, and patellar tendons [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. While noting that resistance dose was not well documented in many studies, researchers found consistent evidence that rehabilitation programs using resistance loads in excess of body weight and performed less frequently (ie, less than daily) demonstrated greater efficacy. These findings are consistent with our approach to treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/230.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of overuse (persistent) tendinopathy", section on 'Heavy-load resistance training'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143193"><span class="h2">Avulsion fractures of hip and pelvis in children (October 2023)</span></p><p>There are few large-scale studies of pelvic avulsion fractures in children. A retrospective review of over 700 children with pelvic or hip avulsion fractures from a single tertiary care hospital reported the average patient age was just over 14 years and nearly 80 percent were sustained by males [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The anterior-superior and inferior iliac spines and ischial tuberosity were the most common sites, accounting for over 80 percent of fractures. Most injuries were sustained while the patient was running or kicking during sport, most often football (soccer). The incidence of avulsion fracture rose substantially during the study period, 2005 to 2020.

Highlights from the conference include evidence summaries emphasizing the effectiveness of policies to reduce the risk for sports-related concussion (SRC), including mouthguard use in ice hockey and limiting contact drills in American football, and updated clinical assessment tools.

However, little is known about the effects of cannabidiol (CBD), a nonpsychoactive component of cannabis used for anorexia and childhood epilepsy, or of recreational synthetic cannabinoids. In a school-based survey from the United Kingdom that included over 6500 adolescents ages 13 to 14 years, reported use of cannabis, CBD, or synthetic cannabinoids were each associated with probable depression, anxiety disorder, or conduct disorder, as well as with auditory hallucinations [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. For each disorder, the risk appeared greatest with synthetic cannabinoids. This study highlights the need for further investigation into the association between mental health effects in youth and the different types of cannabinoids. We advise adolescents (and younger children) to avoid cannabis consumption, including CBD.

In June 2023, smoke from wildfires in Canada drifted hundreds of miles to New York City, resulting in increased ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub>. During smoke waves, emergency department visits for asthma in both pediatric and adult patients increased to 261 per day (reference during nonsmoke periods, 181.5 per day; incidence rate ratio 1.4) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Wildfires have health effects far from their source and are particularly hazardous to those with underlying lung disease.

In a phase 3, randomized trial of 220 children aged 2 to 17 years with JIA (66 percent with pJIA) who had inadequate response or intolerance to standard therapy, patients assigned to the investigational JAK inhibitor <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="130212" href="/d/drug information/130212.html" rel="external">baricitinib</a> had a longer time to disease flare compared with placebo [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. During the study period, fewer patients receiving baricitinib had a flare compared with placebo (17 versus 51 percent, respectively), but more infections occurred in the baricitinib group than the placebo group. However, rates of serious adverse events were similar in both groups. Baricitinib compares favorably with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="129936" href="/d/drug information/129936.html" rel="external">tofacitinib</a>, another JAK inhibitor used in refractory pJIA, but is not yet approved for this indication.

This allergy, first reported in 2009 and termed "alpha-gal syndrome," develops following the bites of certain ticks and causes reactions that are uncharacteristically delayed (ie, several hours after ingestion). A common presentation is anaphylaxis developing in the middle of the night after a meat-containing evening meal. Although the prevalence is increasing worldwide, a web-based survey of 1,500 health care professionals in the United States revealed that 42 percent had never heard of the disorder [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. This lack of awareness can delay diagnosis for decades. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2393.html" rel="external">"Allergy to meats", section on 'In whom to suspect the diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H142322"><span class="h2">Newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (August 2023)</span></p><p>Historically, best outcomes after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) occur in younger recipients without infection at the time of transplant. In a multicenter, longitudinal study, from 2010 to 2018, five-year overall survival after HCT was higher for children identified with SCID by newborn screening (93 percent) compared with those identified by family history or clinical presentation (80 and 85 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In multivariable analysis, younger age and absence of active infection at the time of HCT, both of which are improved by identification through newborn screening, were strongly associated with overall survival. Expanded use of newborn screening for SCID in public health programs worldwide could lead to additional improvement in survival after HCT wherever available. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/115988.html" rel="external">"Hematopoietic cell transplantation for severe combined immunodeficiencies", section on 'Newborn screening'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H240_143639"><span class="h1">DEVELOPMENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143639"><span class="h2">Infertility and autism spectrum disorder (December 2023)</span></p><p>Patients with infertility often ask about the impact of the disorder and its treatment on risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. In a large population-based cohort study comparing ASD risk among children whose parents had subfertility (an infertility consultation without treatment), infertility treatment, or neither (unassisted conception), children in the subfertility and infertility treatment groups had a small increased risk of ASD compared with unassisted conception but the absolute risk was low (2.5 to 2.7 per 1000 person-years versus 1.9 per 1000 person-years with unassisted conception) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The increased risk was similar in the subfertile and infertility treatment groups, suggesting that infertility treatment was not a major risk factor. Obstetrical and neonatal factors (eg, preterm birth) appeared to mediate a sizeable proportion of the increased risk for ASD.

In a meta-analysis of seven randomized trials (over 700 infants and children), overall LP success rate was higher with ultrasound guidance compared with the use of external landmarks and palpation alone, but the difference was not significant  [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Subgroup analysis of five studies (over 520 children) demonstrated significantly higher first attempt success in infants undergoing ultrasound guidance, but not in older children. The overall quality of the evidence was considered low. Based on these findings, when performed by a trained provider, ultrasound guidance prior to LP may be useful in infants. Ultrasound guidance in older children is also reasonable, but evidence of benefit in these patients is lacking. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6325.html" rel="external">"Lumbar puncture in children", section on 'Ultrasound guidance'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H142072"><span class="h2">Invasive bacterial illness in febrile young infants with COVID-19 (July 2023)</span></p><p>Evidence is limited for the risk of invasive bacterial illness (IBI) in febrile young infants &lt;60 days old with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In one cohort study of 163 well-appearing febrile infants ≤60 days old (36 neonates) who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by multiplex viral panel testing, none had IBI compared with 0.5 percent of 448 infants with other viral infection (none had meningitis) and 1.3 percent of 320 infants with no viral infection on testing (one with meningitis) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. For well-appearing febrile infants ≤60 days old with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2, the risk of IBI appears to be low. For well-appearing infants 29 to 60 days, we suggest, at minimum, urinalysis and urine culture. It is also reasonable to obtain additional studies according to the American Academy of Pediatric Clinical Practice Guideline (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef132301" href="/d/graphic/132301.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).

Prednisone treatment (but not vamorolone) led to growth deceleration and bone biomarker abnormalities. Based on these findings, the US Food and Drug Administration approved vamorolone for children age ≥2 years with DMD [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. We suggest glucocorticoid treatment for children with DMD and anticipate using vamorolone as an alternative to prednisone and deflazacort.

In a retrospective study from Japan of 55 patients presenting with FSE, the development of AESD in 11 patients was associated with longer time from seizure onset to hospital arrival, presence of hypoxia, and later treatment with antiseizure medications [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. These findings suggest that shortening the seizure duration by early effective treatment and preventing hypoxia during ambulance transportation might reduce the risk of AESD.

Recently, an international expert panel found a strong consensus that EEM is often underdiagnosed, that a correct diagnosis can only be made with EEG including photic stimulation, and that an earlier age at onset is associated with an increased risk of intellectual disability and drug-resistant epilepsy [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. Management generally involves reducing exposure to provoking factors (eg, visual stimuli, various sources of natural and artificial light) and use of antiseizure medication such as <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12910" href="/d/drug information/12910.html" rel="external">levetiracetam</a> or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12873" href="/d/drug information/12873.html" rel="external">valproate</a> [<a href="#rid46">46</a>].

This was illustrated by a report of a 27-year-old patient with advanced Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and impaired cardiopulmonary function who was treated with a high dose of rAAV containing a CRISPR-based transgene designed to upregulate dystrophin [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. After treatment, he developed worsening cardiac dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and fatal cardiac arrest. Laboratory and postmortem studies suggested his death was due to an innate immune reaction. Further research to develop safer approaches and identify high-risk patients may help to mitigate the acute toxic effects of rAAV gene therapy.

The guidelines recommend screening for spine deformity by physical examination at diagnosis and yearly thereafter. To limit radiation exposure in the pediatric population, diagnostic spine imaging is suggested only if clinical suspicion for a spinal abnormality arises from patient history or physical examination. Spinal tumor burden must be assessed preoperatively in any patient with NF1 undergoing surgery for scoliosis because instrumentation that impedes visualization of spinal tumors by magnetic resonance imaging is not recommended when spinal tumor burden is high.

FDA approval was based upon the surrogate outcome of increased dystrophin production, as shown in a placebo-controlled trial of 41 patients with DMD [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. There was no improvement in functional outcome with delandistrogene moxeparvovec treatment compared with placebo, but a subgroup analysis suggested possible improvement with active treatment for the four- to five-year age group.
