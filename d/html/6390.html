         RSI describes a coordinated, sequential process of preparation, sedation, and paralysis to facilitate safe, emergency tracheal intubation. Pharmacologic sedation and paralysis are induced in rapid succession to quickly and effectively perform laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Outside of the operating room, RSI is generally the preferred method for emergency intubation in patients who have varying levels of consciousness and are presumed to have a full stomach, which places them at risk for pulmonary aspiration [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         </span>
         RSI provides optimal conditions for emergency intubation. We recommend that clinicians who are trained in tracheal intubation use RSI for most children who require emergency intubation. Exceptions include patients who are in cardiac arrest or undergoing sedated intubation without paralysis because of an anticipated difficult airway. The goal of RSI is to intubate patients quickly and safely using sedation and paralysis. RSI is generally recommended because it is more successful and safer than intubation without sedation and paralysis for patients with varying levels of consciousness, active protective airway reflexes, and/or a full stomach.
        </p>
        <p>
         A simple, systematic approach to preparation and execution of the procedure is necessary (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51456" href="/z/d/graphic/51456.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         and
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111721" href="/z/d/graphic/111721.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). In the majority of situations, RSI, from the decision to intubate to successful intubation, is accomplished in less than 10 minutes (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77060" href="/z/d/graphic/77060.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Emergency intubations in children can be performed with or without sedation and paralysis. However, up to 80 percent are performed using RSI [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. The superiority of RSI, as compared with intubation without sedation and paralysis, has been demonstrated by clinical experience, several small retrospective series, and one large prospective observational series in which success rates for intubation were significantly higher and the incidence of adverse events was significantly lower using RSI in the emergency department [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-9
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in one large, multicenter prospective surveillance study of over 1000 pediatric intubations, RSI was associated with a significantly higher first-past success rate (83 percent) than sedation without paralysis (55 percent) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         RSI can be safely performed by emergency physicians trained in advanced airway management, including the use of medications for sedation and paralysis. This has been demonstrated in multiple large series of adult patients and several small pediatric series [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,8-11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Sedation and paralysis are unnecessary prior to intubation for some patients, such as those who are in cardiac arrest or already deeply comatose.

         There are no absolute contraindications to RSI. However, because sedation and paralysis eliminate protective airway reflexes and spontaneous respiration, RSI must be modified for the patient for whom bag-mask ventilation (BMV) and intubation may be more difficult. For these patients, an alternative plan is warranted, which may involve alternatives such as special airway devices, assistance from subspecialists (anesthesiologists, otorhinolaryngologists, or intensivists), if available, and/or intubation with sedation but without paralysis.

         In the preparation phase of RSI, a treatment plan for intubation based upon the patient's clinical condition must be quickly developed. This is done as the patient is being preoxygenated.
        </p>
        <p>
         We support the active use of intubation checklists that are customized to the setting and include items on patient assessment, required equipment, and medications as a means to reduce the frequency of errors during RSI (

         A rapid review of key aspects of the child's history, as well as a targeted physical examination, helps identify conditions that affect the optimal choices of medications for pretreatment, sedation, paralysis, and postintubation management, as well as a contingency plan in the event of a failed intubation. In addition, equipment for monitoring and airway management should be assembled and its function checked. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The benefit of apneic oxygenation in children is unclear. For example, in a retrospective, observational study of almost 150 children undergoing intubation in an emergency department, apneic oxygenation was associated with a significant reduction in hypoxemia (pulse oximetry &lt;90 percent) during endotracheal intubation versus no apneic oxygenation and a significantly higher median oxygen saturation during endotracheal intubation (100 versus 93 percent) [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. In a prospective, single-center, observational study of nearly 1400 endotracheal intubations in a pediatric intensive care unit, the implementation of routine apneic oxygenation during endotracheal intubation was associated with a decrease in both moderate (15 versus 12 percent) and severe (10 versus 7 percent) oxygen desaturation [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Apneic oxygenation has also been shown to extend the safe apnea time in adult trials. However, in a separate retrospective, observational study of 305 children undergoing RSI in the emergency department, apneic oxygenation was not associated with a lower rate or lesser degree of oxygen desaturation compared with standard preoxygenation [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Nevertheless, apneic oxygenation has little risk, although, in our experience, a nasal cannula may occasionally limit the ability to achieve a good mask seal in the event that the patient requires BMV. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/270.html" rel="external">
          "Rapid sequence intubation in adults for emergency medicine and critical care", section on 'Adjunct strategies to maximize preoxygenation'

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Preoxygenation establishes a reservoir of oxygen within the lungs as well as an oxygen surplus throughout the body. The patient can then tolerate longer periods of apnea without oxygen desaturation, permitting intubation to proceed without BMV [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Preoxygenation is particularly important for infants and children. Compared with adults, young patients have a higher oxygen consumption rate with lower functional residual capacity and alveolar volume [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19
         </a>
         ]. Consequently, oxygen desaturation occurs much more rapidly [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,18
         </a>
         ]. As an example, arterial oxygen desaturation to 80 percent may occur in a preoxygenated, apneic, healthy 10-kg infant in less than four minutes, as compared with over eight minutes in a healthy 70-kg adult.

         RSI becomes more complex and takes longer with the addition of each medication. Consequently, the decision of whether or not to use additional agents must include consideration of the potential benefit to the patient, as well as possible adverse consequences of a prolonged procedure or unanticipated drug responses.

         Protection during RSI refers to protecting the airway by preventing regurgitation of gastric contents and aspiration and maintenance of cervical spine precautions when neck trauma is suspected.
        </p>
        <p>
         Every effort must be made to avoid BMV during RSI because of the increased risk of vomiting and aspiration that can occur with gastric distention following BMV. However, in patients who cannot be adequately preoxygenated, BMV with 100 percent oxygen with small tidal volumes and cricoid pressure is preferable to intubating a hypoxic patient. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Preoxygenation'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Cricoid pressure (Sellick maneuver) involves posterior pressure applied to the cricoid cartilage with the thumb and forefinger for the purpose of occluding the esophagus (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71800" href="/z/d/graphic/71800.html" rel="external">
          figure 2

          figure 3
         </a>
         ). Cricoid pressure may help prevent gastric insufflation during BMV and is considered optional for this purpose. If cricoid pressure makes BMV more difficult due to occlusion of the airway, then it should be relaxed or removed.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the past, cricoid pressure was considered essential for the protection of the airway from regurgitated stomach contents during RSI and is still used routinely by many anesthesiologists for RSI with induction of anesthesia. However, observational evidence in children intubated in the intensive care unit setting does not support the routine use of cricoid pressure during RSI. For example, in a retrospective cohort study of over 7800 critically ill children that adjusted for known risk factors for regurgitation, cricoid pressure during RSI was
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         associated with lower rates of regurgitation when compared with no cricoid pressure (1.9 versus 1.2 percent, respectively; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.6; 95% CI 0.99-2.5). Risks with cricoid pressure include worsening the glottic view, occluding the airway, cervical spine movement in trauma patients, and esophageal injury in actively vomiting patients.

         Once the optimal glottic view is obtained, the laryngoscopist has an assistant place their fingers in exactly the same spot on the thyroid cartilage, using the same direction and degree of force necessary to maintain the view.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Bimanual laryngoscopy may help the intubator identify the glottic anatomy or optimize the laryngeal view when visualization is suboptimal or inadequate despite appropriate laryngoscope blade positioning.
        </p>
        <p>
         Alternatively, backward-upward-rightward pressure (BURP) is applied to the larynx by an assistant. However, this approach may not optimize the glottic view as effectively as bimanual laryngoscopy. (See

         Gentle cricoid pressure, applied over the anterior neck at the cricoid cartilage, may improve the glottic view in young infants due to the anterior position of the glottis. When used, it should be applied after the sedative is administered and the patient becomes unconscious. If cricoid pressure worsens the view, it should be removed immediately and ELM attempted. Because ELM may better improve visualization of the glottis, we generally prefer to use this technique rather than cricoid pressure during laryngoscopy. (See

         After adequate muscle relaxation is confirmed, laryngoscopy can be performed with careful attention to proper technique. Oropharyngeal injury can be minimized while effectively exposing the glottis. After the tracheal tube has been placed and stylet removed, tube placement must be confirmed.
