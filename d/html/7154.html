A number of general principles apply to both vitamin B12 and folate deficiency. These are outlined below and in a 2014 guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency from the British Committee for Standards in Haematology [

         or folate deficiency present asymptomatically with an incidental laboratory finding or with the slow development of symptoms. Repletion of the deficient vitamin can be instituted over a period of weeks in these instances. However, in certain cases it may be prudent to intervene more urgently:

        <p>
         In these cases, more urgent correction of the deficiency and more intensive monitoring are indicated, as illustrated in the algorithm  (

          algorithm 1

        <p>
         In extremely rare cases of severe deficiency with hemodynamic compromise due to severe anemia, blood transfusion may be given [

         replacement is often used for those who do not have the capacity to absorb oral replacement (eg, pernicious anemia [PA], intestinal blind loop). The parenteral route is usually well-tolerated, and medication adherence is assured. However, high-dose oral (or sublingual) vitamin B12 therapy can also be effective for those with impaired absorption, provided that the dose is sufficient, medication adherence is good, and a response is documented [

         The duration of therapy depends on whether the initial cause of the deficiency persists. Lifelong replacement is necessary for individuals with a condition that is not reversed (eg, gastric bypass surgery, autoantibodies to intrinsic factor [PA]). If the cause of the deficiency can be treated or eliminated (eg, excessively restrictive diet, drug-induced deficiency, reversible cause of malabsorption), supplementation can be discontinued after the deficiency is corrected.

A 2015 population-based case control study of older individuals (ages 66 to 69 years) in the United States found increased odds ratios (ORs) for gastric adenocarcinoma (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.9-2.5); gastric carcinoid (OR 11.4, 95% CI 8.9-14.7); small intestinal cancer (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-2.0); and some non-gastrointestinal malignancies [

         For a person with concerning neurologic or neuropsychiatric findings or symptoms related to cytopenias (eg, shortness of breath from anemia, bleeding with thrombocytopenia), we monitor more aggressively so that we may intervene if the response is not occurring.

          Treatment of folate deficiency

         – Folate deficiency is typically treated with oral
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8475" href="/z/d/drug information/8475.html" rel="external">
          folic acid
         </a>
         (1 to 5 mg daily). Therapy is generally given for one to four months or until there is laboratory evidence of hematologic recovery, or indefinitely for those with a chronic cause of folate deficiency. Intravenous folic acid may be appropriate for individuals who are unable to take an oral medication or those who require more urgent correction. Testing and/or treatment for

         deficiency may be appropriate for some patients. (See

          vitamin B12
         </a>
         and/or folate deficiency includes reticulocytosis within three to four days, initial increase in hemoglobin over one to two weeks, and resolution of anemia in four to eight weeks. Resolution of neuropsychiatric changes in vitamin B12 deficiency may take longer and may be incomplete, especially in individuals with more severe and/or longstanding deficits. Monitoring for a response to therapy should be tailored to the patient's symptoms and other factors (eg, more intensive monitoring during pregnancy). If the expected response does not occur, additional testing for other causes of the patient's findings may be indicated. (See
