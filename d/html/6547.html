The evaluation and causes of ankle pain in the active child or skeletally immature adolescent and the diagnosis and management of ankle sprains are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6525.html" rel="external">"Foot and ankle pain in the active child or skeletally immature adolescent: Evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6530.html" rel="external">"Ankle pain in the active child or skeletally immature adolescent: Overview of causes"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/189.html" rel="external">"Ankle sprain in adults: Evaluation and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">BACKGROUND</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ankle fractures are among the most common fractures of the lower extremity in older children. They also account for up to 40 percent of all fractures in the skeletally immature athlete [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Ankle fractures occur more often in boys than girls. Many fractures arise from activities such as basketball, soccer, inline skating, and riding motorized scooters [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>Distal fibular physeal fractures are the most common type of pediatric ankle fractures and are associated with a relatively low risk for long-term complications [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. By contrast, distal tibial physeal fractures are associated with a higher risk for long-term complications [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Anatomically, the ankle joint is best thought of as a hinge, with the talus held in place by the distal tibia (medial malleolus) and distal fibula (lateral malleolus). Immediately above the joint, but below the tibial physis, these bones are held together by strong syndesmotic ligaments. Additional stability is achieved through the medial and lateral ligamentous complexes  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51952" href="/z/d/graphic/51952.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72462" href="/z/d/graphic/72462.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/227.html" rel="external">"Ankle fractures in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Medially, the superficial and deep fibers of the deltoid ligament extend from the malleolus to the talus, navicular, and calcaneus  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51952" href="/z/d/graphic/51952.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). This thick triangular ligament resists eversion of the ankle joint  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60173" href="/z/d/graphic/60173.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The lateral ligamentous complex consists of three distinct bands that resist excessive inversion of the ankle  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60173" href="/z/d/graphic/60173.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). These include the anterior and posterior talofibular ligaments and the calcaneofibular ligament  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72462" href="/z/d/graphic/72462.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>).</p><p></p><p>The majority of the ankle's stability comes from these ligaments, which are typically stronger than the adjacent physes  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79444" href="/z/d/graphic/79444.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). It should be noted that the medial and lateral ligaments arise directly from the tibial and fibular epiphyses. This anatomy accounts for the high percentage of physeal injuries about the ankle, which are caused by inversion and eversion stress  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60173" href="/z/d/graphic/60173.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1,4</a>].</p><p>Important developmental anatomy of the ankle includes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Distal tibial physis</strong> – The distal tibial physis accounts for approximately 3 to 4 mm of limb growth per year and 15 to 20 percent of final leg length [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The physis develops between 6 and 24 months of age [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. A separation of the physis, beginning at approximately two years of age, divides it into medial and lateral portions [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The medial malleolus begins to form as an extension of the tibial physis at approximately seven to eight years of age and is fully ossified by the age of 10 years [<a href="#rid1">1,5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The distal physis begins to close around 12 years in girls and 14 years in boys [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Closure begins centrally, extends medially, and is completed laterally over the course of 18 months [<a href="#rid1">1,5</a>]. This pattern of closure has important implications for the types of tibial fractures seen in late adolescence. (See <a class="local">'Juvenile Tillaux fracture'</a> below and <a class="local">'Triplane fracture'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Distal fibular physis</strong> – The distal fibular physis appears between 9 and 24 months of age at the level of the ankle joint [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Closure generally occurs approximately one to two years after distal tibial physis closure.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ankle fractures may occur with the ankle inverted or everted and with the foot neutral, plantarflexed, or dorsiflexed  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60173" href="/z/d/graphic/60173.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>).</p><p>"Rolling" of the ankle, or an inversion injury, is the most common cause of ankle fracture in children [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Frequently, this mechanism occurs when the child trips on stairs, a street curb, uneven ground, or during sports play (eg, basketball, soccer, American football). Inversion injury typically causes a fracture of the fibula. If the force is extreme (eg, foot and ankle entrapment during a motor vehicle collision) or the foot is maximally plantar- or dorsiflexed at the time of impact, then the tibia may also be involved. In these instances, the ankle joint is often unstable.</p><p>Eversion injuries are less common but are associated with fractures of the tibia and fibula with accompanying instability of the ankle joint [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The evaluation of ankle fractures is summarized in the algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108267" href="/z/d/graphic/108267.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1499387054"><span class="h2">Identify and treat emergency conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who have sustained major trauma  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57293" href="/z/d/graphic/57293.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) are at risk for multiple traumatic injuries and should undergo a primary survey, stabilization of life-threatening injuries, and a complete physical examination before focused evaluation of any ankle injury. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6572.html" rel="external">"Approach to the initially stable child with blunt or penetrating injury", section on 'Blunt trauma'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6571.html" rel="external">"Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child", section on 'Initial approach'</a>.)</p><p>Emergency ankle conditions, such as an open fracture, neurovascular compromise, or fracture with dislocation, warrant emergency imaging and consultation with an orthopedist with pediatric expertise. (See <a class="local">'Initial management'</a> below and <a class="local">'Indications for orthopedic consultation or referral'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once life- and limb-threatening conditions have been managed or excluded, the clinician should proceed with a focused history. In addition to the mechanism of injury (see <a class="local">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above), the clinician's history should ascertain the following [<a href="#rid1">1,5</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Location(s) of the most significant pain</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other injured areas (eg, lumbar spine, hip, knee)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Length of time from injury to presentation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Neurovascular symptoms (eg, paresthesias, numbness, foot pallor)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ability to bear weight after injury</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of any previous injury or surgery</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Related orthopedic comorbidities (eg, myelomeningocele or cerebral palsy)</p><p></p><p>An ankle fracture, particularly one sustained in a fall from a height, may mask other injuries, especially spinal column fractures.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A complete evaluation of the entire lower extremity should be conducted before assuming that the injury is confined to the ankle, especially in a child who is younger than five years of age and/or is nonverbal [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>After an ankle injury, there is often swelling and pain. Analgesia prior to examination (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13371" href="/z/d/drug information/13371.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a> for mild to moderate pain or intranasal <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13298" href="/z/d/drug information/13298.html" rel="external">fentanyl</a> or intravenous <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="16024" href="/z/d/drug information/16024.html" rel="external">morphine</a> or fentanyl for severe pain) will often facilitate the child's cooperation. We suggest that the clinician avoid the oral route for patients likely to require sedation or general anesthesia for fracture reduction or repair.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Assessment of ankle stability</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once emergency conditions, including ankle injury with neurovascular compromise, have been excluded, the first priority in the examination of ankle injuries is to determine whether the joint is stable and can be managed nonoperatively or the joint is unstable and must be referred.</p><p>Typically, an ankle injury is stable if it meets the following criteria:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pain is isolated to the lateral or medial malleolus</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There is no deformity, malalignment, or major swelling of the lower leg and foot</p><p></p><p>An ankle injury is unstable if two or more sites of fracture or ligamentous disruption are suspected, such as a medial malleolar fracture with deltoid ligament disruption or a bimalleolar fracture. (See <a class="local">'Indications for orthopedic consultation or referral'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with gross deformity  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82323" href="/z/d/graphic/82323.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>), severe pain, or concern for an unstable joint should <strong>not</strong> walk or perform active range of motion of the ankle joint. These patients warrant prompt imaging. (See <a class="local">'Plain radiography'</a> below.)</p><p>If the ankle injury appears stable, the range of motion of the knee, hip, ankle, and subtalar joints (midfoot and toes) should be determined, and the ability to ambulate should be assessed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2191783414"><span class="h3">Ankle examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once emergency conditions and have been excluded, ankle examination may proceed as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inspection</strong> – Clinicians should inspect the injured ankle for swelling, deformity, or skin abnormalities (eg, lacerations with possible open fracture, tenting, or blistering caused by rapid stretching of the skin).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The amount of swelling is<strong> not</strong> a reliable guide to the presence of a fracture, especially a nondisplaced Salter-Harris I fracture or an avulsion fracture associated with an ankle sprain [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with obvious deformity or malalignment of the foot relative to the lower leg are at greater risk for neurovascular compromise due to the presence of a fracture or fractures that have caused an unstable ankle joint  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82323" href="/z/d/graphic/82323.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). They warrant rapid assessment of neurovascular status, emergency imaging, and consultation with an orthopedist with pediatric expertise. (See <a class="local">'Identify and treat emergency conditions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Palpation</strong> – Palpation should include all of the bones of the lower leg, ankle, and foot. Clinicians should palpate the ankle looking for the point of maximal tenderness and other tender areas.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The distal tibial and fibular physes deserve particular attention because the distal fibular physis in particular is the most common area of ankle injury in children. Testing for ligamentous laxity can be deferred until after radiographs are obtained; it is often not tolerated in the setting of an acute fracture. Evaluation of the ligaments of the ankle is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/189.html" rel="external">"Ankle sprain in adults: Evaluation and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical evaluation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Significant tenderness, both medially and laterally, implies that the ankle is potentially unstable due to bimalleolar fracture with injury to the deltoid ligament and lateral complex, even in patients without obvious deformity  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51952" href="/z/d/graphic/51952.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72462" href="/z/d/graphic/72462.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). These patients should not ambulate.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The examination of the distal tibia and fibula should include a careful examination in the area of the anterior joint line in addition to the medial and lateral malleoli, especially in older school-age children and young teenagers. Subtle juvenile Tillaux fractures may present with isolated tenderness in the anterior joint line and swelling extending over the distal fibula, while evaluation of the medial malleolus is normal. (See <a class="local">'Juvenile Tillaux fracture'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The clinician should also palpate the base of the proximal fifth metatarsal in patients with inversion injuries in order to assess for avulsion fractures and Jones fractures in this area. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6548.html" rel="external">"Metatarsal and toe fractures in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neurovascular assessment</strong> – Neurovascular examination requires comparison of findings in both feet.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The clinician should palpate the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulse and determine capillary refill. Although pain may interfere with interpretation, the ability to extend and flex the toes tests the deep peroneal (fibular) and tibial nerves, respectively.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Sensory evaluation involves testing of the following nerves in the indicated sites:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Deep peroneal (fibular) nerve (between the first and second toes on the dorsum)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Superficial peroneal (fibular) nerve (remainder of the dorsal foot)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Tibial nerve (sole of foot), which branches beneath the ankle to form the following nerves:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Medial planter nerve (medial plantar surface from great toe to middle of the fourth toe)</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Lateral plantar nerve (lateral plantar surface from middle fourth toe to fifth toe)</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Sural nerve (lateral foot)</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Saphenous nerve (medial foot)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h2">Imaging</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1353376256"><span class="h3">When to obtain</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2298868827"><span class="h4">Severe or unstable ankle injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All pediatric patients with emergency ankle conditions, such as an open fracture, neurovascular compromise, fracture with dislocation, or concern for ankle instability, warrant emergency plain radiographs and acute management by an orthopedist with pediatric expertise. Computed tomography (CT) of the ankle may be indicated subsequently if there is diagnostic uncertainty about the presence of serious injury on plain radiographs <strong>or</strong> if CT is needed to decide operative versus nonoperative management. (See <a class="local">'Plain radiography'</a> below and <a class="local">'Other imaging'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2646695324"><span class="h4">Stable ankle injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although stable ankle injuries are common in children, a systematic review of 12 studies found that, at most, 17 percent of all ankle injuries will result in a visible bony fracture on radiograph [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Despite the low positive yield of imaging, most children with ankle injuries undergo plain radiography. For example, two reports from Canada indicate that radiographs are ordered on 80 to 95 percent of pediatric patients with acute ankle injuries [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>], while rates of radiography may approach 100 percent in other settings [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>In an attempt to minimize the number of potentially unnecessary studies in children with stable ankle injuries, clinical decision rules have been developed to aid in decision-making about imaging [<a href="#rid10">10-12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2115637452"><span class="h5">Low-Risk Ankle Rule</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For children with stable ankle injuries who present to the emergency department, we recommend that the Low-Risk Ankle Rule (LRAR)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90427" href="/z/d/graphic/90427.html" rel="external">figure 5</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108267" href="/z/d/graphic/108267.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) be used to determine the need for plain radiographs. The LRAR has a reported sensitivity for the detection of clinically important ankle fractures in children of 98 to 100 percent and a negative predictive value for high-risk injury of 99.7 percent when the prevalence of clinically important fractures is about 7 percent [<a href="#rid8">8,12</a>].</p><p>Children are considered low risk by the LRAR and <strong>not</strong> in need of radiography at initial presentation if the following conditions are met [<a href="#rid8">8,12</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The injury is acute (&lt;3 days old)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The child is <strong>not</strong> at risk for pathological fractures (eg, osteogenesis imperfecta or known focal bone lesion such as an osteoid osteoma)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The child has no congenital anomaly of the feet or ankles</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The child can reliably express pain or tenderness</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Physical examination demonstrates tenderness or swelling confined to the distal fibula and/or adjacent lateral ligaments distal to the anterior tibial joint line  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90427" href="/z/d/graphic/90427.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>No gross deformity, neurovascular compromise, or other serious and potentially distracting injury are present</p><p></p><p>The LRAR regards distal fibular avulsion fractures and nondisplaced Salter-Harris I and II fractures as low-risk injuries because they can be managed with supportive splinting, crutches (as needed), and return to activities as tolerated by the patient. (See <a class="local">'Distal fibula fractures'</a> below.)</p><p>When communicating with caregivers about the decision to treat an ankle injury without imaging based upon the LRAR, the clinician should provide a clear statement about the decision. The following provides a sample script:</p><p class="bulletIndent1">"Your child has an ankle injury that typically heals very well with the immobilization that we are providing, limits on weight-bearing on the injured side until your child feels better, and treatment of the symptoms of pain and/or swelling, as needed. At this time, a radiograph would not help us in deciding the best way to treat your child's ankle injury. It is likely that they have a sprain or, in the worst case, a very tiny fracture to the fibula, a bone on the outside of the ankle. Even in the case of a tiny fracture, this heals very well with the treatment we are recommending and without the need for a cast, further radiographs, or follow-up from an orthopedic specialist. However, if you find that your child's injury is not feeling better within a week, please follow up with your doctor."</p><p></p><p>The ability of the LRAR to significantly reduce the ordering of plain radiographs for ankle injuries in children largely lies with the willingness of the clinician and caregivers to accept the possibility of not identifying nondisplaced fractures, including avulsion fractures or nondisplaced Salter-Harris I or II fractures that might have been visible on plain radiographs. Of note, these fractures occur in the minority of patients not requiring radiography according to the LRAR and, even if present, recover well without radiography when managed empirically with recommended treatment consisting of a removable ankle brace or similar device and return to activities as determined by symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> below and <a class="local">'Distal fibula fractures'</a> below.)</p><p>The LRAR has been associated with the greatest reduction in radiography during prospective validation studies in children [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Specifically, in a multicenter implementation study of the LRAR in six Canadian emergency departments (including community, general, and pediatric facilities) evaluating over 2150 children with ankle injuries, use of the LRAR reduced ankle radiography by 22 percent, with no significant difference in missed high-risk fractures, when compared with routine clinical practice. Reduction in ankle imaging was sustained for up to 72 weeks after implementation, and 94 percent of the participating physicians were willing to apply a symptomatic care strategy to this group of low-risk ankle injuries. These results indicate a high physician acceptance of the rule and the related management strategy. Subsequent cost analysis showed significant overall cost reductions when the LRAR was used [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The greatest savings were due to lower radiography costs and fewer orthopedic or emergency department follow-up visits. However, there are few external prospective validation or implementation studies, which may limit generalizability of the LRAR because it has not been evaluated in general ambulatory or urgent care settings.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H806278342"><span class="h5">Other clinical prediction rules</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other than the LRAR, the Ottawa Ankle Rule (OAR)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69818" href="/z/d/graphic/69818.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>) has been most widely studied in children [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In contrast to the experience in adults, the use of the OAR in children is less likely to reduce radiographic testing beyond that seen when no clinical rules are used. For example, in prospective validation studies of the OAR in children younger than 16 years of age with acute ankle injuries, the relative reduction in ankle radiography has only been approximately 10 percent [<a href="#rid12">12,14,15</a>]. This reduction is approximately half of the reduction in ankle radiography seen in prospective validation studies of the LRAR [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>When compared with the LRAR, the OAR has similar to slightly higher sensitivity but lower specificity for high-risk fractures [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>]. For example, a systematic review of 12 pediatric studies (3130 children over two years of age) reports a pooled sensitivity of 98.5 percent for the OAR and a range of specificity of 8 to 47 percent (pooled estimate was not performed because of significant heterogeneity) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The missed fracture rate given a negative OAR assessment was 1.2 percent (95% CI 0.6-2.3 percent). Another methodologically robust meta-analysis of the diagnostic performance of the OAR included 34 studies, eight of which were pediatric. This reported a pooled OAR sensitivity of 97.9 percent (95% CI 94.9, 99.1) and specificity of 21.0 percent (95% CI 13.1-31.9) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>Thus, the strength of the OAR is its consistently high sensitivity across numerous studies in adults and children. However, its limitation is its low specificity, whereby application of the rule results in obtaining radiographs in most children, resulting in limited clinical impact for the goal of reducing unnecessary radiographs. Furthermore, implementation studies of the OAR in children are lacking.</p><p>The LRAR also has reportedly high sensitivity for high-risk fractures in prospective multicenter studies, alongside a high specificity, with significant potential to safely reduce unnecessary imaging. There is also a rigorously done implementation study that reinforces the safe use of this rule.

This approach directs the clinician to the appropriate area of injury and facilitates radiographic interpretation. For example, in patients with nondisplaced Salter-Harris I fractures of the tibia and/or fibula, there is no visible fracture on initial radiographs. Diagnosis of this injury requires correlation of the clinical finding of growth plate tenderness with other radiographic evidence such as adjacent soft tissue swelling or widening of the growth plate [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p>Similarly, subtle juvenile Tillaux fractures may present with tenderness isolated to the anterior joint line and swelling extending over the distal fibula, while palpation of the medial malleolus is free of any tenderness and/or swelling.

Salter-Harris I and II ankle fractures are at lower risk for these complications than those that are Salter-Harris III or higher. Higher grades of Salter-Harris fracture often require operative repair.

In the past, these ankle injuries, when occurring in skeletally immature children, were presumed to be a Salter-Harris I fracture through the distal fibular physis (growth plate) rather than an ankle sprain [<a href="#rid1">1,4,24</a>]. However, prospective, observational studies with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the gold standard have demonstrated that the vast majority of these children actually have sprain injuries rather than physeal fractures [<a href="#rid22">22,23,25,26</a>]. As an example, in a multicenter, prospective, observational study of 135 children (5 to 12 years of age) with a clinical diagnosis of a distal fibular Salter-Harris I fracture and normal plain radiographs, MRI demonstrated a nondisplaced Salter-Harris I distal fibular fracture in four cases (3 percent), with two of these patients having only partial injuries to the growth plate and all four also having associated ligamentous injuries. Among the 131 children without physeal injuries, 104 (79 percent) had ligamentous injuries, 38 of which were associated with radiographically occult distal fibular avulsion fractures, indicating a high-grade sprain. The remaining 27 (21 percent) had isolated bone contusions, a very mild injury [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p>Thus, evidence suggests that the majority of children with inversion ankle injuries and no bony abnormality on plain radiographs have sprains and that nondisplaced Salter-Harris I fractures of the distal fibula are uncommon.

The mechanism of injury commonly involves inversion of the ankle with the foot pointed away from the midline (supination with external rotation)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60173" href="/z/d/graphic/60173.html" rel="external">figure 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76290" href="/z/d/graphic/76290.html" rel="external">image 2</a>). This mechanism leads to avulsion of the lateral tibial epiphysis that is attached to the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76624" href="/z/d/graphic/76624.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>). The uninvolved medial portion of the epiphysis is closed. Rarely, a Salter-Harris III fracture occurs in the medial malleolus before physeal closure; this most often follows an injury with eversion stress and is typically accompanied by a fracture of the distal fibula.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In addition to plain radiographs, computed tomography (CT) of these fractures is often indicated to evaluate the extent of displacement. Juvenile Tillaux fractures with &gt;2 mm of displacement warrant urgent orthopedic consultation for closed or open reduction. Some of these fractures may require percutaneous pinning to maintain reduction [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. After discussion with an orthopedist, children with nondisplaced Salter-Harris III fractures, as determined by CT, may be given crutches and placed in a posterior below-knee splint or cast pending evaluation and continued care by an orthopedist with pediatric expertise within one week.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with nondisplaced Salter-Harris III fractures typically undergo long leg casting for four to six weeks with conversion to a short leg cast or boot for an additional two to four weeks [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Weightbearing is initiated based on radiographic healing and clinical examination. Patients should anticipate eight weeks of non-weightbearing. Return to full activities frequently occurs by 10 to 12 weeks.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with displaced fractures requiring reduction and/or instrumentation warrant close, ongoing orthopedic care to ensure adequate reduction and to determine the optimal timing for hardware removal and return to normal activities [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Salter-Harris IV</strong> – Type IV fractures involve the ankle joint, and urgent orthopedic consultation is indicated. If located medially, these fractures are caused by inversion stress and are shearing-type injuries that need fixation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Triplane fracture describes a Salter-Harris IV fracture of the tibia that occurs in the sagittal, coronal, and transverse planes and creates between two and four fracture fragments  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67327" href="/z/d/graphic/67327.html" rel="external">image 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1,5</a>]. The mechanism of injury is debated, but many orthopedists feel it involves inversion of the ankle with extreme turning out of the foot (supination with external rotation).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">CT is required to discern the degree of displacement in patients with Salter-Harris IV fractures. Open reduction with internal fixation of these injuries is usually necessary to obtain adequate reduction. Failure to reestablish articular continuity may result in premature arthritis [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In addition, risk of growth arrest is significant. (See <a class="local">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">These injuries warrant close, ongoing orthopedic care to ensure adequate reduction and to determine the optimal timing for hardware removal and, ultimately, return to normal activities.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Salter-Harris V</strong> – These rare fractures result from axial loading of the extremity (eg, a fall on the heel from a height, leading to physeal compression)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54582" href="/z/d/graphic/54582.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>). Patients with multisystem trauma may be at particular risk for unrecognized Salter-Harris V injuries.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Initial plain films may show narrowing of the physis but are frequently unremarkable. Any suspected Salter-Harris V fracture warrants urgent orthopedic assessment. These patients need ongoing orthopedic care for several years because of the high risk of growth arrest and need for corrective surgery.

Growth arrest is most commonly seen in children with Salter-Harris III or IV fractures of the tibia, especially when initial reduction is incomplete. Thus, all tibial growth plate fractures should be monitored closely by an orthopedist for up to two years to observe for proper healing [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Osteochondral defect </strong>– Defects in the talar dome may occur after ankle fractures in children and should be suspected in patients with persistent pain [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Plain radiographs can identify osseous injury, while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is necessary to visualize cartilaginous injury. Operative treatment is typically necessary for resolution.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Osteoarthritis</strong> – Arthritis has been reported in up to 29 percent of patients with a Salter-Harris III or IV ankle fracture and seems to be most associated with the degree of fracture displacement and the presence of residual displacement after reduction [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ankle stiffness</strong> – Posttraumatic ankle stiffness has been observed in up to 6 percent of patients after ankle fracture and is associated with osteoarthritis [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complex regional pain syndrome</strong> – Complex regional pain syndrome (previously reflex sympathetic dystrophy) may follow an ankle fracture and is identified by marked pain with light touch to the skin (allodynia), swelling, and vasomotor changes. Splinting results in worsening symptoms. Multidisciplinary pain evaluation and treatment, including physical therapy, is sometimes helpful.

Rarely, these children will require partial closed reduction under sedation in the emergency department by the emergency clinician or orthopedist in an attempt to restore distal circulation. Patients who display a cold, cyanotic foot despite reduction attempts require emergency operative exploration and vascular repair. (See <a class="local">'Absent pulse'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Obvious deformity</strong> – In patients with an obvious deformity  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82323" href="/z/d/graphic/82323.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>), marked swelling with moderate to severe pain, signs of an unstable joint, or high suspicion for a displaced fracture, analgesia (eg, intranasal <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13298" href="/z/d/drug information/13298.html" rel="external">fentanyl</a> or intravenous fentanyl or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="16024" href="/z/d/drug information/16024.html" rel="external">morphine</a>) is advisable prior to physical examination and radiography.
