Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a biologically and clinically distinct variant of AML. APL was classified as AML-M3 in the older French-American-British (FAB) classification system and is currently classified as acute promyelocytic leukemia with t(15;17)(q24.1;q21.1); <em>PML-RARA</em> in the World Health Organization classification system [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4523.html" rel="external">"Molecular biology of acute promyelocytic leukemia"</a>.)</p><p>Without treatment, APL is the most malignant form of AML, with a median survival of less than one month [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Registry data suggest that many patients die before reaching an experienced hematologist. Thus, those patients who enroll in prospective clinical trials may already be a selected subset. However, with modern therapy, APL is associated with the highest proportion of patients with AML who are cured of their disease. The treatment of APL is distinct from that of other types of AML and is comprised of several stages which, in total, may span one to two years of treatment  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77537" href="/d/graphic/77537.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Remission induction</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Consolidation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Maintenance</p><p></p><p>The treatment of APL in adults will be reviewed here. While not specifically discussed, treatment programs described below appear to be equally effective in children, after minor modifications [<a href="#rid2">2,4-6</a>]. The clinical features, diagnosis, and prognosis of APL in adults are discussed separately, as is the treatment of patients with relapsed or resistant disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4527.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4505.html" rel="external">"Treatment of relapsed or refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">EMERGENCY PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>APL represents a medical emergency with a high rate of early mortality, often due to hemorrhage from a characteristic coagulopathy [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Among nearly 1000 patients who enrolled on prospective clinical trials that included early use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9262" href="/d/drug information/9262.html" rel="external">all-trans retinoic acid</a> (ATRA; tretinoin) for APL, the incidence of early hemorrhagic death was 3.7 percent [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Population-based surveys that included less highly selected APL patients indicate an early death rate of 17 to 29 percent [<a href="#rid7">7,9,10</a>]; the increased rate of death in the population-based surveys include additional causes of death (eg, infections, differentiation syndrome, thrombotic events), but also highlight the importance of early diagnosis and prompt treatment with ATRA.</p><p>It is critical to start treatment with ATRA without delay as soon as the diagnosis is <strong>suspected</strong> based on cytologic criteria, and before definitive confirmation of the diagnosis has been made by genetic, cytogenetic, or immunostaining methods [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. If the diagnosis is not confirmed, ATRA can be discontinued and treatment changed to that used for other types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4525.html" rel="external">"Acute myeloid leukemia: Induction therapy in medically fit adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4530.html" rel="external">"Acute myeloid leukemia: Management of medically unfit adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4527.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia in adults", section on 'Pathologic features'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with suspected APL should undergo studies to evaluate for disease extent and comorbidities as described for other patients with AML. While important, these studies should not interfere with the rapid initiation of ATRA-based therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4525.html" rel="external">"Acute myeloid leukemia: Induction therapy in medically fit adults", section on 'Pretreatment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">INDUCTION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H357174158"><span class="h2">Choice of regimen</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Induction therapy aims to reduce the total body leukemia cell population from approximately 10<sup>12</sup> to below the cytologically detectable level of about 10<sup>9</sup> cells. A key component of this therapy is the use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9262" href="/d/drug information/9262.html" rel="external">all-trans retinoic acid</a> (ATRA), which promotes the terminal differentiation of malignant promyelocytes to mature neutrophils  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66640" href="/d/graphic/66640.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). However, ATRA must be combined with other agents since remissions induced by ATRA therapy alone are short-lived with a median duration of only about 3.5 months [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>The largest experience has been with ATRA combined with anthracycline-based chemotherapy  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51345" href="/d/graphic/51345.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Randomized trials suggest that the combination of ATRA plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8977" href="/d/drug information/8977.html" rel="external">arsenic trioxide</a> (ATO) yields equivalent and perhaps superior outcomes compared with standard regimens combining ATRA with chemotherapy. The great majority of these results are derived from clinical studies in low-risk APL and intermediate-risk APL. There is still relatively limited information on the comparative value of combination treatment with ATRA plus ATO in patients with high-risk APL. In addition, there is limited availability of ATO worldwide.</p><p>Our preferred induction regimen is informed by risk stratification based on white blood cell (WBC) count at presentation:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Low- or intermediate-risk APL</strong> – Initial WBC count ≤10,000/microL (≤10 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>High-risk APL</strong> – Initial WBC count &gt;10,000/microL (&gt;10 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L)</p><p></p><p>Selection of induction therapy is also informed by the ability of the patient to tolerate anthracycline-based therapy, and the availability of ATO:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Low- or intermediate-risk APL </strong>– For most low- or intermediate-risk patients with newly diagnosed APL, we recommend ATRA plus ATO rather than ATRA plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy. This preference places a high value on the lesser toxicity (eg, myelosuppression, cardiac toxicity), fewer deaths during induction therapy, fewer relapses, and reduced risk of secondary leukemia with this combination, and less value on the longer clinical experience and robustness of the clinical trials with ATRA plus chemotherapy [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Where ATO is not available for initial use, a standard ATRA plus anthracycline regimen is the recommended alternative for remission induction. Patients who receive induction with ATRA plus chemotherapy benefit when ATO is used for post-remission therapy. (See <a class="local">'ATO plus ATRA'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>High-risk APL </strong>– There is less certainty regarding the preferred approach for patients with a high WBC count at presentation. International studies are underway comparing ATRA plus ATO versus ATRA plus chemotherapy in this setting. ATRA plus chemotherapy remains the recommended initial therapy for high-risk APL until more data are available regarding the early use of ATO in this small subset. When ATRA plus ATO is used for patients with high-risk APL, the WBC count often rises and raises concerns regarding hyperleukocytosis and differentiation syndrome. In clinical trials, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8968" href="/d/drug information/8968.html" rel="external">gemtuzumab ozogamicin</a> (GO) effectively reduced the rising WBC count in these situations, but GO is not currently readily available. Cytotoxic chemotherapy with either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8543" href="/d/drug information/8543.html" rel="external">hydroxyurea</a> or an anthracycline has been used for leukocytosis in this setting, but prospective studies have not yet been reported. These agents may add toxicities and it is not clear whether substitution of these agents for GO impacts efficacy. (See <a class="local">'ATRA plus chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Primary resistance to treatment with induction therapy that contains ATRA is unusual except for patients with the rare APL variant t(11;17). Such patients are generally treated as if they had a non-APL variant of AML. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4525.html" rel="external">"Acute myeloid leukemia: Induction therapy in medically fit adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4523.html" rel="external">"Molecular biology of acute promyelocytic leukemia", section on 'Variant translocations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">ATO plus ATRA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ATO, alone or in combination with ATRA, is capable of producing complete molecular remissions (as defined by the absence of the <em>PML-RARA</em> fusion transcript using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) in previously untreated APL [<a href="#rid14">14-22</a>]. Where ATO is available for front-line use, we recommend ATRA plus ATO for newly diagnosed APL with low or intermediate risk (ie, those with initial WBC count ≤10,000/microL). It is also our preferred therapy for patients, such as older adults, who are not able to tolerate anthracycline-based therapy. ATO plus ATRA is administered until marrow remission, but should not exceed 60 days.</p><p>Use of ATO plus ATRA in patients with high-risk APL (initial WBC count &gt;10,000/microL) without comorbidities is controversial, as the evidence supporting its use in this population is less robust. In high-risk disease, induction therapy with ATRA plus chemotherapy  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51345" href="/d/graphic/51345.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4,23</a>], followed by post-remission therapy with ATO is standard; this approach has not been directly compared with ATO plus ATRA for high-risk disease. (See <a class="local">'Is there a role for ATO in post-remission therapy?'</a> below.)</p><p>The Intergroup APL0406 trial randomly assigned 263 adults with newly diagnosed low- or intermediate-risk APL to ATRA plus ATO (ATRA-ATO) versus ATRA plus chemotherapy (ATRA-CHT) [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. In the experimental arm, ATRA (45 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) plus ATO (0.15 mg/kg) was administered daily until complete remission (CR), followed by consolidation with intermittent ATRA and ATO for seven and four courses, respectively. In the ATRA-CHT arm, patients received ATRA and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8549" href="/d/drug information/8549.html" rel="external">idarubicin</a> induction therapy, followed by three cycles of consolidation therapy with ATRA plus chemotherapy, and maintenance therapy with low dose chemotherapy and ATRA; the ATRA-CHT arm did not incorporate ATO into the post-remission therapy. At a median follow-up of more than 40 months, ATRA-ATO resulted in the following, when compared with ATRA-CHT:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Similar rates of hematologic CR (100 versus 97 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fewer deaths during induction therapy (0 versus 4 patients).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Superior estimated four-year event-free survival (EFS; 97 versus 80 percent), cumulative incidence of relapse (2 versus 14 percent), and overall survival (OS; 99 versus 93 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Two relapses and one death in CR in the ATRA-ATO arm, and 15 relapses and 5 deaths in the ATRA-CHT arm.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Similar rates of moderate/severe differentiation syndrome (17 versus 13 percent). (See <a class="local">'Differentiation syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Less severe (grade 3/4) thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and febrile neutropenia; less gastrointestinal toxicity and cardiac function abnormalities; but higher rates of severe (grade 3/4) elevation of liver function tests (which resolved with temporary discontinuation of ATO and/or ATRA), QTc prolongation (but no life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias), and reversible peripheral neuropathy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Analysis of the 35 older adults (age 60 to 70) included in the study reported that, among the 16 patients receiving ATRA-ATO, there were no deaths and one relapse at 27 months [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. In comparison, 3 of the 19 patients who received ATRA-CHT died (one each from differentiation syndrome, pulmonary embolism, and bronchopneumonia).</p><p></p><p>These results suggest that for patients with low/intermediate-risk APL, ATO plus ATRA is not inferior (and perhaps is superior) compared with ATRA-CHT. ATRA-ATO is associated with less toxicity, fewer deaths during induction therapy, and fewer short- and long-term relapses.</p><p>All risk groups of APL were represented in the United Kingdom's AML17 trial, in which 235 adults were randomly assigned to received ATRA plus ATO versus ATRA plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8549" href="/d/drug information/8549.html" rel="external">idarubicin</a> (AIDA) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. An initial dose of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8968" href="/d/drug information/8968.html" rel="external">gemtuzumab ozogamicin</a> (GO, 6 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) was offered to the 30 patients with high-risk disease (ie, total WBC count &gt;10,000/microL at presentation). The dose and schedule of ATO was less intensive than that used in the APL0406 trial described above. There was no difference in overall quality of life between the arms, the study's primary endpoint. At a median follow-up of 30 months, when compared with AIDA, ATRA plus ATO resulted in the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Similar rates of CR (94 versus 89 percent) and confirmed molecular negativity (91 versus 88 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Similar mortality at 30 days (4 versus 6 percent) and 60 days (5 versus 9 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Similar estimated rates of survival at four years (93 versus 89 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Superior estimated EFS at four years (91 versus 70 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lower cumulative rates of molecular relapse (0 versus 27 percent) and morphologic relapse (1 versus 18 percent) at four years.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An average of 7 fewer days in hospital, 5 fewer units of blood, 4 fewer units of platelets, and 10 fewer days of intravenous antibiotics.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>With median follow-up &gt;67 months, compared with AIDA, five-year OS (92 versus 86 percent) and relapse-free survival (RFS; 96 versus 86 percent) were superior with ATRA plus ATO [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. There were no relapses in patients treated with ATRA plus ATO who were negative for measurable residual disease (MRD) after consolidation therapy; in contrast, 20 percent relapsed within five years among those who received AIDA and were MRD negative after consolidation.</p><p></p><p>These beneficial results were seen across all patient populations. These positive results were also seen in those with high-risk disease although there were only small numbers of high-risk patients in the trial. GO is not available in most of the world. Cytotoxic chemotherapy with either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8543" href="/d/drug information/8543.html" rel="external">hydroxyurea</a> or an anthracycline is often used for leukocytosis in this setting. However, these agents may add toxicities and it is not clear whether the resulting mild to moderate leukocytosis needs to be treated with a cytoreductive agent and whether substitution of these agents for GO impacts efficacy in this setting. While some groups propose the use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a> as prophylaxis against differentiation syndrome, it is unclear whether this results in superior outcomes when compared with protocols that treat differentiation syndrome once symptoms develop. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4351.html" rel="external">"Differentiation syndrome associated with treatment of acute leukemia"</a>.)</p><p>Several smaller prospective trials have shown durable responses extending over longer periods of time:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Two prospective trials evaluated single agent intravenous ATO administered until CR or for a maximum of 60 days, with variable use of ATO consolidation [<a href="#rid15">15,18,19,28</a>]. Morphologic CR was attained in 86 percent. Estimated rates of disease-free survival (DFS) and OS at five years ranged from 67 to 80 and 64 to 74 percent, respectively. The best outcomes were seen in patients with a WBC count &lt;5,000/microL and platelet count &gt;20,000/microL. DFS improved with increasing number of consolidation cycles.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A prospective trial evaluated ATRA and ATO, with or without GO in 82 patients with newly diagnosed APL [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Ninety percent of patients achieved a CR. At a median follow-up of 25 months, the three-year estimated rate of OS was 86 percent, and was 100 percent for the subset of 22 patients who had both a WBC count &lt;5,000/microL and a platelet count &gt;20,000/microL at the time of diagnosis. Toxicity was mild and reversible, and, after remission induction, treatment could be given on an outpatient basis. Side effects of ATO include fluid retention, differentiation syndrome, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and electrocardiographic abnormalities. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4505.html" rel="external">"Treatment of relapsed or refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Another prospective trial of ATRA plus ATO in 85 patients with newly diagnosed APL followed for a median of 70 months reported a CR rate of 94 percent with five-year EFS and OS rates of 89 and 92 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group (ALLG) APML4 study was a non-randomized phase 2 trial that evaluated a combination of ATRA, ATO, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8549" href="/d/drug information/8549.html" rel="external">idarubicin</a> in 124 patients with newly diagnosed APL [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].

An earlier evaluation, such as that generally done for other variants of AML (eg, on day 14), is not recommended since it may result in over treatment (ie, there may be delayed clearance of malignant promyelocytes from the marrow even after they have lost their proliferative potential) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].
