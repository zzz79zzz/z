First, the response to rhGH is highly variable, probably because of the heterogeneous endocrinologic profile in children with ISS, and those children who respond to rhGH treatment may have only modest increases in linear growth. Second, there is little evidence that short stature represents a substantial psychosocial burden to most short children. The possible psychosocial benefit must be weighed against the substantial cost and possible adverse effects of treatment.</p><p>The efficacy and potential risks of rhGH and alternative treatments for children with ISS are discussed below. The clinical evaluation of children with short stature is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5834.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5832.html" rel="external">"Causes of short stature"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H998221225"><span class="h2">Definition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Idiopathic short stature (ISS) is a clinical description rather than a disease. A practical definition of ISS is a height below 2 standard deviations (SD) of the mean for age (ie, below the 2.3<sup>rd</sup> percentile), in the absence of any endocrine, metabolic, or other disease that explains the short stature [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. In defining ISS for the indication of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13354" href="/d/drug information/13354.html" rel="external">recombinant human growth hormone</a> (rhGH) treatment, the US Food and Drug Administration uses the more stringent criterion of 2.25 SD below the mean (ie, the 1.2<sup>nd</sup> percentile) and a predicted adult height that is below the normal range; this corresponds to an adult height &lt;63 inches (160 cm) for males and &lt;59 inches (150 cm) for females in the United States. The clinical approach to diagnosis of ISS is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5834.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature"</a>.)</p><p>ISS is generally considered a variant of normal growth (since pathologic causes are excluded by definition). However, some children formerly considered to have ISS, especially those with familial short stature with one parent significantly shorter than the other, may be heterozygous for some gene variants that affect growth plate development, eg, <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.omim.org%2Fentry%2F108961&amp;token=tEpDslnpc0F0kICl%2Fz7sFRc%2FQ%2FdLCs5TziGRc%2F5rLwiDZsukONtBrLRqqkA5A0iw&amp;TOPIC_ID=5824" target="_blank"><i>NPR2</i></a> [<a href="#rid3">3</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5832.html" rel="external">"Causes of short stature", section on 'Skeletal dysplasias/growth plate abnormalities'</a>). Other normal variants are familial short stature and constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP), sometimes called constitutional short stature for prepubertal children. There is ongoing controversy about the nomenclature of ISS. We use the term to refer to nonfamilial cases, but some other experts consider familial short stature and CDGP to be subcategories of ISS [<a href="#rid1">1,4</a>]. In either case, it is clear that there is considerable overlap among these variants, and many healthy children with short stature have growth characteristics consistent with more than one of these categories. The term ISS is generally reserved for children at the more severe end of the spectrum in each category, but the distinction between normal and abnormal growth patterns is not clear. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5832.html" rel="external">"Causes of short stature", section on 'Normal variants of growth'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Endocrine findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children with ISS often have normal height velocity (often near or at the lower limit of normal), no biochemical or other evidence for a specific growth-restricting condition, and normal results on GH stimulation tests. Thus, children with ISS do not have GH deficiency according to the classic criteria.</p><p>Nonetheless, some children with ISS have relatively low serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and normal or elevated serum GH levels, suggesting that they may be relatively insensitive to the effects of GH [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. These children may respond to supraphysiologic levels of GH given as treatment or induced by stimulation by IGF-1. However, a reduced level of IGF-1, in combination with a normal or minimally elevated GH level, is much more often the result of chronic illness or undernutrition, which is often concomitantly present in a short child. IGF-1 results should be interpreted in the context of the child's age because levels normally increase with age, especially during puberty. These caveats should be considered when interpreting the endocrine findings of a child with short stature. (See <a class="local">'Other treatments'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5842.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency in children", section on 'IGF-1 and IGFBP-3'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Exclusion of other diagnoses</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many systemic diseases and conditions may contribute to short stature, including renal, neoplastic, pulmonary, cardiac, gastrointestinal, immunologic, and metabolic disease. In addition, some therapies such as corticosteroid treatment can cause growth failure. Presence of significant disease in these categories precludes the diagnosis ISS.</p><p>The evaluation of a child for short stature always begins with analysis of height velocity using serial measurements of height, interpretation of the child's growth trajectory in the context of parental heights, and, in most cases, radiographic determination of bone age to permit an estimate of adult height and to evaluate for growth potential. Even without a bone age determination, a reasonably accurate near-adult height prediction may be made [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. However, even with bone age determination, adult height predictions have only moderate accuracy and a wide 95 percent confidence interval. Due to the possibility of skeletal dysplasia in children with presumed ISS, careful attention should be paid to body proportions (limbs disproportionately short for the trunk or vice versa) and the bony structures from the hand-wrist radiograph.</p><p>In otherwise healthy children, the yield of additional laboratory testing is extremely low [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. There is some controversy about the extent of testing that should be performed for children and adolescents with presumed ISS. Because of the low diagnostic yield and high cost, we suggest performing laboratory testing only selectively in otherwise asymptomatic children, as outlined in a separate topic review. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5834.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature", section on 'Features suggesting genetic or endocrine disease'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1145908467"><span class="h2">Psychosocial functioning</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients with ISS have normal psychosocial functioning. It is likely that there is substantial variation in the psychological effects of short stature and that shortness has adverse effects on some individuals but not others. This is supported by a systematic review, which concluded that children and adults with short stature may experience a small diminution in quality of life [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>In most children with extremes of short or tall stature, there is minimal impact on peer perceptions of social behavior, friendship, or peer acceptance [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. As an example, in a population-based sample, a few short children had problems with peer relationships, but short stature could not be established as the <strong>cause</strong> of the disturbance. Some negative stereotypes regarding the social adjustment of individuals were noted (eg, teasing and bullying, less social acceptance, and fewer friends) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The psychosocial effects of severe short stature (height &lt;-2.5 SD) have not been adequately studied [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Clinic-based populations may display greater psychosocial dysfunction, likely because children referred for medical treatment for their short stature are selected for a higher level of parental (or child) concern. Children referred for treatment may have significantly more externalizing behavior problems and poorer social skills [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. However, in this population, more problems were identified by the parents' report and children tended to score normally on measures of self-esteem and functioning when based on the child's self-report or report of teachers [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">GROWTH HORMONE THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Therapy with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13354" href="/d/drug information/13354.html" rel="external">recombinant human growth hormone</a> (rhGH) for children with ISS is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The indication is for children with current height below -2.25 standard deviations (SD) of the mean, in whom the epiphyses are not closed and whose expected adult height (based on bone age) is below the normal range; this corresponds to an adult height less than 63 inches (160 cm) for males and 59 inches (150 cm) for females in the United States [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. rhGH is not approved for treatment of ISS in many other countries, including the European Union. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5834.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature", section on 'Prediction of adult height'</a>.)</p><p>rhGH therapy should ideally be initiated in early childhood, for optimal efficacy [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H998223393"><span class="h2">Decision to treat</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Despite US Food and Drug Administration approval, the use of rhGH for children and adolescents with ISS remains controversial. Guidelines recommend <strong>against</strong> the routine use of rhGH for every child with ISS [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Instead, the decision about whether to administer rhGH should be made on a case-by-case basis after a detailed discussion with the child and family. This is because there are several limitations and uncertainties about the use of rhGH therapy for children with ISS. Understanding these limitations informs a pragmatic and personalized approach to selecting patients for rhGH therapy.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Limitations and uncertainties</strong>:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>There is little evidence that short stature has a consistent detrimental effect on an individual's psychosocial or physical functioning.

Moreover, it is difficult to predict responsiveness to rhGH treatment for the typical short child due to the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of the condition, inconsistent criteria used for the definition of ISS, and variable rhGH treatment doses used in clinical trials [<a href="#rid17">17-21</a>]. Clinical trials tend to enroll children with more severe short stature, so the reported growth response may not be generalizable to the less severe short stature seen in a clinical population. (See <a class="local">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Practical solutions</strong> – These uncertainties yield the following practical approaches to decisions about rhGH therapy:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The evaluation should attempt to identify children with growth patterns consistent with constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP) because they are likely to have catch-up growth without rhGH treatment. Clinical evidence supporting CDGP includes delayed bone age and/or history of delayed growth and puberty in a parent  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51582" href="/d/graphic/51582.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Moreover, adolescent boys with CDGP and moderate short stature (taller than -2.5 SD) are more appropriately treated with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12827" href="/d/drug information/12827.html" rel="external">testosterone</a> replacement rather than rhGH.

(See <a class="local">'Our approach'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>The decision to treat should be made collaboratively with the family and patient after a full discussion of each of these issues [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The psychosocial considerations should be emphasized because they depend on individual patient characteristics and are often misunderstood, as detailed in the following section.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H998223496"><span class="h3">Psychosocial considerations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The decision to treat children and adolescents with ISS using rhGH requires complex psychosocial considerations [<a href="#rid11">11,22</a>]. The treatment should be considered only if the short stature represents a disability to the child and is not amenable to counseling and reassurance and if growth augmentation is likely to provide psychosocial benefit to the child. If rhGH therapy achieves an increase in height, it might be expected to improve a child's self-image and social efficacy. On the other hand, some have speculated that rhGH therapy could have adverse psychosocial consequences because it draws the child's attention to their short stature [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>], in addition to the treatment burden from daily subcutaneous injections. A meaningful benefit/cost assessment must be applied [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p>Treatment with rhGH appears to have little or no effect on psychosocial outcomes, according to the few small studies that have addressed this issue. (See <a class="local">'Psychosocial outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1145907380"><span class="h3">Expectations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When considering rhGH therapy, it is essential to establish realistic expectations since unmet expectations can have adverse effects. Children presenting for rhGH therapy and their parents/caregivers often believe that the treatment will make them of average height or taller than average. However, even if the treatment is successful, most patients will still be short as adults. As an example, if a boy's predicted adult height is 155 cm (61 inches) and rhGH therapy is successful in adding 5 cm (2 inches), which is a typical expected increase [<a href="#rid25">25</a>], their adult height will still only be 160 cm (63 inches).</p><p>A study of parents seeking subspecialist care for their child's short stature showed that most parents have high expectations that their child's quality of life will improve with rhGH treatment; these expectations are unlikely to be met [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H998223883"><span class="h3">Costs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment costs of rhGH therapy are substantial and present an important consideration for allocation of medical resources. The costs and coverage of rhGH treatment by insurance companies vary significantly from country to country. The insurance industry has instituted progressive restrictions on coverage for rhGH in children/adolescents with ISS [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Efficacy</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1145908508"><span class="h3">Height outcomes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Assessment of the published clinical trials of rhGH treatment in children and adolescents with ISS is complicated by the use of variable inclusion criteria, rhGH doses, and outcomes; small sample sizes; high dropout rates (usually skewed to those with the least response); and lack of an adequate control group (in most studies). The studies generally support the conclusion that rhGH treatment results in modest increases in short-term growth rates and in adult height, although treated individuals remain relatively short compared with their peers. Studies of rhGH treatment using typical protocols for children with ISS report mean increases in adult height ranging from 4 to 10 cm (approximately 0.67 to 1.67 SD), compared with predicted adult height  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef128199" href="/d/graphic/128199.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid18">18-20,25,28,29</a>]. However, there is wide interindividual variation in height outcomes, including no increase in adult height for some children [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Height velocity and adult height outcomes are generally greater when rhGH is initiated during early childhood; a consensus conference concluded that the optimal age for initiating rhGH therapy is between age five years and early puberty [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Patient characteristics that predict a greater response to rhGH treatment for children with ISS include [<a href="#rid1">1,17,21,30-33</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Height at start of treatment (the taller the better)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age at start of treatment (the younger the better, if after age five)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Height response during the first year of rhGH treatment (the greater the initial response, the better the long-term outcome)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Midparental height (the taller the parents, the better)</p><p></p><p>In addition, higher doses of rhGH generally are associated with a greater response [<a href="#rid34">34-36</a>]; this observation has led to individualized approaches to dosing, as discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Dosing'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1145908596"><span class="h3">Psychosocial outcomes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Effects of rhGH treatment on psychosocial functioning were addressed in three small studies with untreated controls [<a href="#rid37">37-39</a>]. None showed differences between the treatment groups in behavior, self-esteem, or quality of life. However, these studies were limited by small sample size (approximately 30 children in each study).</p><p>Specific effects of rhGH treatment on child behavior and social functioning were addressed in a placebo-controlled trial of 68 children with ISS [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. In this study, there was a significant decrease in behavioral problems among the group treated with rhGH when compared with placebo, as measured by parent report, but both groups remained in the normal range for these measures. There were no differences in measures of social competency. The study was limited by small sample size and male predominance. Because it compared rhGH treatment to placebo, this study did not address the nonspecific effects of rhGH treatment (for example, whether the focus on a child's stature conferred by treatment might have adverse psychosocial consequences).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Safety</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Therapy with rhGH at standard doses appears to have minimal physiologic adverse effects. Safety studies have examined a variety of possible adverse effects, including idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), increased intraocular pressure, reduced insulin sensitivity, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, worsening of existing scoliosis, and possibly of pancreatitis. Placebo-controlled trials have generally shown no increase in these or other adverse effects as compared with placebo [<a href="#rid17">17,19</a>], but these studies are not adequately powered to detect rare adverse events, have limited length of follow-up, and use a variety of dosing schemes. Data from large postmarketing surveillance studies suggest that these risks are minimal with the rhGH doses that are typically used for therapy [<a href="#rid21">21,41</a>]. High-dose rhGH treatment (71 mcg/kg/day) was reported to accelerate the onset of puberty and epiphyseal closure in children with ISS [<a href="#rid42">42</a>], but lower doses (34 or 53 mcg/kg/day) did not [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. Overall, the physiologic adverse effects of rhGH for patients with ISS are similar to or less than those seen in children treated for GH deficiency or Turner syndrome [<a href="#rid44">44,45</a>]. The possibility of an increased risk for cancer has been raised and examined closely in long-term studies. Data suggest that each of these risks is very low with the rhGH doses that are typically used. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5843.html" rel="external">"Treatment of growth hormone deficiency in children", section on 'Adverse effects of growth hormone therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Excessive rhGH doses might be associated with more significant adverse effects, as suggested by the complications found in patients with substantial GH excess, such as those with acromegaly. These include edema, cardiomyopathy, insulin resistance, stroke, increased intraocular pressure, arthropathy, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and gynecomastia. Some, but not all, studies of adults with acromegaly have suggested an increased incidence of colonic and uterine neoplasia. The risks of giving excessive doses of rhGH may theoretically be reduced by using insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)-targeted dosing strategies.

Sustained-release formulations (for weekly dosing) are available but not approved for ISS. The optimal dosing range for children with ISS is not well established. In prepubertal children with ISS, rhGH routinely is used in the range of 0.3 to 0.47 mg/kg/week (43 to 67 mcg/kg/day). Some clinicians, including the authors of this topic review, readjust the dose based on growth response and/or IGF-1 levels. (See <a class="local">'Dose adjustment for IGF-1 levels'</a> below.)</p><p>Higher doses lead to modest increases in short-term height velocity and predicted adult height [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. In a multicenter study of children with ISS, rhGH doses of 0.37 mg/kg/week (53 mcg/kg/day) were significantly more effective than doses of 0.24 mg/kg/week (35 mcg/kg/day) [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].

We choose this target based on general considerations of cost-effectiveness and to avoid theoretical safety concerns that may be associated with excessive rhGH dosing. If IGF-1 levels are consistently elevated (&gt;2.5 SD), we reduce the rhGH dose [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. We check IGF-1 levels approximately four weeks after beginning therapy or changing the rhGH dose and approximately every 6 to 12 months thereafter, similar to the approach we use for patients with GH deficiency. Optimization and cost-effectiveness of this technique require further study [<a href="#rid46">46,47</a>].

The utility of this approach for children with ISS is inferential and based on preliminary data. The rationale is that children with ISS may have a variety of abnormalities in the GH-IGF-1 axis, conferring varied levels of GH sensitivity. Some studies in children with GH deficiency or ISS suggest GH responsiveness is closely associated with IGF-1 levels during treatment [<a href="#rid17">17,48</a>]. In addition, some side effects of rhGH, such as arthralgia and edema, are associated with supraphysiologic IGF-1 levels in other populations.

Some of these children may require higher rhGH doses to achieve a growth response, whereas others seem to respond particularly well to standard doses of rhGH [<a href="#rid46">46,49,50</a>]. Moreover, this is also the group for which direct replacement of IGF-1 may be most effective. Clinical trials will be necessary to determine the roles of rhGH versus recombinant IGF-1, or rhGH combined with recombinant IGF-1, in subsets of children with ISS.

Candidates for testosterone treatment typically have entered the early stages of puberty (some testicular enlargement) by age 13 or 14 years, and testosterone treatment will effectively accelerate puberty and growth.

Bone mineral density decreases during GnRHa treatment but typically normalizes after GnRHa is withdrawn.
