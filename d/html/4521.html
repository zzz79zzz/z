CNS involvement is investigated for patients with AML who have new or progressive neurologic signs or symptoms, but routine evaluation is not performed for asymptomatic patients (ie, those with no neurologic findings), except for infants &lt;1 year with AML or patients with remission after relapse of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). CNS involvement by AML is a dire prognostic finding. Management of CNS involvement by AML is guided by the nature of CNS disease, symptoms, systemic disease status, and patient fitness and values. </p><p>This topic discusses the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of CNS involvement in patients with AML. </p><p>Clinical features, diagnosis, classification, treatment, and overall prognosis of AML are discussed separately. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4497.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4525.html" rel="external">"Acute myeloid leukemia: Induction therapy in medically fit adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4530.html" rel="external">"Acute myeloid leukemia: Management of medically unfit adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13935.html" rel="external">"Acute myeloid leukemia in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Incidence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The incidence of CNS involvement with AML is not well-defined and reports vary widely. Estimates differ because detection methods vary among studies, diagnostic lumbar puncture (LP) is not routinely performed in patients with AML due to the low incidence, and contemporary AML management may have reduced the frequency of leukemic involvement of the CNS.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adults</strong> – In one study, CNS involvement was detected by cytology and/or flow cytometry in one-third of 103 consecutive adult patients with newly diagnosed AML who underwent routine diagnostic LP (regardless of neurologic findings) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In another study, CNS involvement was identified in 19 percent of 42 patients with AML who underwent routine LP, regardless of clinical findings [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. However, the same group detected CNS involvement in only 3 percent of 1370 consecutive patients with AML when an LP was performed only for findings suggestive of CNS disease [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Another study reported CNS involvement in &lt;1 percent of 3261 adults with newly diagnosed AML and CNS symptoms who were enrolled in a series of clinical trials; the rate was 3 percent in patients with relapsed AML [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Children</strong> – Among 1344 children with AML, 395 (29 percent) had evidence of CNS involvement at presentation; 217 had ≤5 white blood cells (WBC)/microL with blasts (ie, CNS2 involvement), and 178 had &gt;5 WBC/microL with blasts or CNS symptoms (CNS3 involvement) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p>The incidence of CNS leukemia appears to have decreased since the incorporation of high dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9314" href="/d/drug information/9314.html" rel="external">cytarabine</a> (HiDAC; which can penetrate into the CNS) into initial induction and/or post-remission therapy.

There are few, if any, other causes of palsies that affect CN III, V, or VI in patients with AML. However, it can be difficult to clinically distinguish leukemic involvement of CN VII from "Bell's palsy" (facial nerve palsy), which occurs frequently in the normal population; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) focused on the path of CN VII may be helpful in this circumstance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other neurologic findings</strong> – An intracranial collection of blasts and/or bleeding (eg, from thrombocytopenia or a coagulopathy) can cause altered mental status, headache, visual changes, weakness, and other neurological findings. The cause of such findings may resemble those of a spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage or tumor.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Spinal cord compression</strong> – Back pain, weakness or paresthesias of extremities, and/or bladder dysfunction may indicate spinal cord compression by an extramedullary collection of blasts (chloroma).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with suspected CNS involvement by AML should undergo imaging, as guided by neurologic findings, and a lumbar puncture (LP). </p><p>Rarely, retina exam by an ophthalmologist or other experienced clinician may demonstrate leukemic infiltrates, but this is more likely to detect ischemia or hemorrhage.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3880029898"><span class="h2">Imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Imaging can identify leptomeningeal involvement by AML and detect a mass lesion of the brain or spine.

In patients with cranial nerve palsies, careful examination with thin sections of the course of the nerve roots is often helpful, since the spinal fluid can be unrevealing ("negative") in patients with isolated nerve involvement by AML.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Mass lesions are uncommon in patients with CNS involvement by AML, although they have been reported in patients with inv(16) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Spine</strong> – MRI of the spine is indicated if there are concerns of spinal cord compression. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2819.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Computed tomography (CT)</strong> – Brain CT may be used to evaluate a potential stroke, tumor, hemorrhage, or infection. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure (eg, headache, lethargy, other mental changes) generally undergo head CT scan prior to LP. (See <a class="local">'Lumbar puncture (LP)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Lumbar puncture (LP)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>LP is performed to diagnose leptomeningeal involvement.

(See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p>A diagnostic LP is <strong>not</strong> routinely performed for adults or children with AML who do not have neurologic abnormalities; however, an LP should be performed routinely for infants (≤1 year) and patients who achieve remission after relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2130111988"><span class="h3">LP technique</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is critically important to avoid cerebral herniation (eg, caused by a mass effect in the brain) and to reduce the risk of bleeding or a traumatic LP. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4832.html" rel="external">"Lumbar puncture: Technique, contraindications, and complications in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Imaging prior to LP</strong> – Prior to performing an LP, patients with altered mentation, focal neurologic signs, papilledema, or a seizure within the previous week should undergo MRI or CT imaging to identify a possible mass lesion and other causes of increased intracranial pressure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Avoidance of bleeding/traumatic LP</strong> – Complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count and coagulation studies should be obtained, and deficits corrected before performing the LP. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">To reduce the risk of bleeding or a traumatic LP, the LP should be performed by the most experienced available clinician; some centers routinely refer patients to a radiologist to have the procedure performed with the aid of fluoroscopy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Bleeding</strong> – Thrombocytopenia and/or coagulopathy should be corrected prior to performing the LP. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">We generally do <strong>not</strong> perform an LP in patients who are actively bleeding, have severe thrombocytopenia (eg, ≤10,000 to 20,000/microL in many centers), or with an international normalized ratio (INR) &gt;1.4, without first correcting the abnormalities.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">There is controversy and relatively few data about the minimal platelet count at which an LP can be performed safely. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Children</strong> – A study in children demonstrated the safety of LPs at platelet counts &gt;10,000/microL [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. However, a larger study by the same group indicated that the risk for a traumatic or blood LP was higher in children with platelets &lt;100,000/microL, compared with ≥100,000/microL (odds ratio [OR] 1.5 [95% CI 1.2-1.8]) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Adults</strong> – It is difficult to extrapolate the findings from children to adults because of differences in size and because most children were sedated for the procedure. Compared with children, a longer length of tissue must be traversed to access the lumbar space in adults; this general concern is magnified in adults with obesity because of difficulties identifying the lumbar space. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">One review stated that 40,000/microL is a "safe" count for LP, but they acknowledged that lower platelet counts may also be safe [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Platelet count &gt;20,000/microL was considered desirable, according to a study of 195 LPs in 66 patients with acute leukemia [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">For patients with APL, an LP should be deferred until correction of the coagulopathy and, in the absence of symptoms, can usually be done after a second complete response is achieved. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4505.html" rel="external">"Treatment of relapsed or refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Traumatic LP</strong> – Every effort should be taken to avoid a traumatic LP in patients with leukemia, since this can seed leukemic blasts into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Because of concern about introducing circulating leukemic blasts into the CSF, many centers routinely administer a dose of intrathecal chemotherapy when LPs are performed at diagnosis or in relapse. (See <a class="local">'Intrathecal chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complications</strong> – The most serious complication of LP is cerebral herniation. Other complications include bleeding (which can cause impingement of the spinal cord), infection, seeding of CSF with blasts, and post-LP headache. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4832.html" rel="external">"Lumbar puncture: Technique, contraindications, and complications in adults", section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4094956041"><span class="h3">CSF analysis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A total of 8 to 15 mL of CSF is typically removed during an LP, but up to 40 mL of fluid can safely be removed, if needed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4832.html" rel="external">"Lumbar puncture: Technique, contraindications, and complications in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6325.html" rel="external">"Lumbar puncture in children"</a>.)</p><p>CSF should be evaluated for cell count and differential count, protein and glucose concentrations, gram stain and culture (if infection is suspected), cytology of stained cytospin slides (with flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry, if needed to identify blasts that cannot be characterized with certainty by morphology). These studies should be repeated each time the CSF is accessed for treatment to assess response to therapy. (See <a class="local">'Delivery'</a> below and <a class="local">'Response evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CNS involvement by AML should be suspected in patients with new or progressive neurologic signs or symptoms.</p><p>CNS leukemia is diagnosed by identifying leukemic blasts in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by microscopy of a cytocentrifuge specimen, with or without confirmation by flow cytometry and/or molecular studies [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. In some cases, CSF studies are inconclusive, but the diagnosis is based on evidence of leptomeningeal involvement (with or without parenchymal disease) by MRI or CT or biopsy/aspirate of a CNS mass. </p><p>In addition to cytologic evidence of CNS involvement by AML, most patients have moderately elevated CSF protein and a modest decrease in glucose. Interpretation of CSF studies is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1285.html" rel="external">"Cerebrospinal fluid: Physiology and utility of an examination in disease states", section on 'Composition of the CSF'</a>.)</p><p>Blast counts can range from 5 white blood cells (WBC)/microL to &gt;1000 WBC/microL; however, some patients with clinical signs of cranial nerve involvement or a mass with imaging can have a relatively bland CSF without detectable blasts.</p><p>Because patients with AML may have neutropenia or other causes for immunosuppression, bacterial and other causes of meningitis should be excluded, as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1287.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1799953395"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Management of CNS involvement by AML varies according to the nature of CNS involvement and associated neurologic findings, medical fitness, institutional/clinician practice, and patient goals. The extent of disease should be evaluated with imaging (eg, MRI or CT of brain or spine), if this was not previously performed. (See <a class="local">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p>Management decisions should be made promptly to prevent or limit further neurologic deficits and complications. Treatment should not be delayed if CNS involvement is suspected, but findings for the diagnostic lumbar puncture are ambiguous.</p><p>No prospective studies have directly compared intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy, radiation therapy (RT), and/or systemic chemotherapy for management of CNS involvement by AML. Because few studies are available, treatment suggestions are based on clinician experience and extrapolation from treatment of carcinomatous meningitis. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H58827819"><span class="h2">Asymptomatic leptomeningeal involvement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with leptomeningeal involvement, but no signs of neurologic deficit (eg, no cranial nerve impairment or other neurologic findings), we suggest treatment with IT chemotherapy alone, rather than systemic chemotherapy or cranial RT, based on the efficacy and rapid action of IT therapy and little toxicity, compared with the other management techniques. </p><p>Treatment with IT chemotherapy is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Intrathecal chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3754678163"><span class="h2">Leptomeningeal involvement with neurologic findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with cranial nerve abnormalities or other neurologic impairment associated with leptomeningeal involvement, we suggest treatment with IT chemotherapy plus RT and/or systemic chemotherapy that penetrates the CNS.
