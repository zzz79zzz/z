This wide range is due in part to patient selection and procedure-related risk factors, although differing definitions for postoperative complications account for much of the variability and make comparison of reported incidences across different studies difficult.</p><p>The preferred definition is a postoperative pulmonary abnormality that produces identifiable disease or dysfunction that is clinically significant and adversely affects the clinical course [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. This would include several major categories of clinically significant complications, including [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Atelectasis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Infection, including bronchitis and pneumonia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Respiratory failure (mechanical ventilation for &gt;48 hours after surgery or unplanned reintubation)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypoxemia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Exacerbation of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma</p><p></p><p>The rate of postoperative pulmonary complications across all types of surgery was 6.8 percent in a systematic review of studies that provided explicit outcome definitions [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3126326825"><span class="h1">IMPACT OF POSTOPERATIVE PULMONARY COMPLICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) found that postoperative pulmonary complications occurred in 6 percent of 165,196 patients who underwent major abdominal surgery [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In a separate report of 1202 patients undergoing non-cardiothoracic surgery with general anesthesia, patients with at least one pulmonary complication had higher rates of mortality, ICU admission, and length of stay [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. All patients were American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) physical status class 3 or greater.</p><p>In another study that used the NSQIP database, investigators examined the impact of particular postoperative complications on 30-day postoperative mortality among 2.82 million patients undergoing outpatient surgery [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Ten and one-quarter percent of patients who developed a postoperative pulmonary complication died within 30 days after surgery. Among eight types of postoperative complications studied, only cardiac complications conferred higher rates of 30-day mortality.</p><p>Given the frequency and morbidity of pulmonary complications following surgery, estimation of their risk should be a standard element of all preoperative medical evaluations.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">PERIOPERATIVE PULMONARY PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Postoperative pulmonary complications follow logically as an extension of normal perioperative pulmonary physiology. Reduced lung volume after surgery is a major factor contributing to the development of postoperative pulmonary complications.</p><p>Thoracic and upper-abdominal surgery are associated with a reduction in lung volumes in a restrictive pattern as follows [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vital capacity (VC) is reduced by 50 to 60 percent and may remain decreased for up to one week.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Functional residual capacity (FRC) is reduced by about 30 percent.</p><p></p><p>Diaphragmatic dysfunction appears to play the most important role in these changes; postoperative pain and splinting are also factors [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Reduction of the FRC below closing volumes contributes to the risk of atelectasis, pneumonia, and ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatching. Microatelectasis results in areas of the lung that are perfused but not ventilated, leading to impaired gas exchange with consequent postoperative hypoxemia [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>A decrease in tidal volume, loss of sighing breaths, and increase in respiratory rate occur after abdominal and thoracic surgery and contribute to the risk of complications. In addition, residual effects of anesthetic agents, neuromuscular blockers, and postoperative opioids depress the respiratory drive. Inhibition of cough and impairment of mucociliary clearance of respiratory secretions are factors that contribute to the risk of postoperative infection [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>Lower abdominal surgery is associated with similar changes but to a lesser degree. Reductions in lung volumes are generally not seen with surgery on the extremities [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">PATIENT-RELATED RISK FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Risk factors for pulmonary complications can be grouped into patient-related and procedure-related risks [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The potential patient-related factors that have been studied include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Asthma</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Smoking</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>General health status</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Obesity</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Obstructive sleep apnea</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pulmonary hypertension</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Heart failure</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Upper-respiratory infection</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Metabolic and nutritional factors</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Age</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Data regarding the influence of age as a predictor of postoperative pulmonary complications have consistently shown that age has an independent effect even after adjustment for comorbidities that increase with older age [<a href="#rid2">2,5,13,14</a>].</p><p>A systematic review prepared for the American College of Physicians estimated the impact of age on postoperative pulmonary complications among studies that used multivariable analysis to adjust for age-related comorbidities [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. This review made the novel observation that age &gt;50 years was an important independent predictor of risk. When compared with patients &lt;50 years old, patients aged 50 to 59 years, 60 to 69 years, 70 to 79 years, and ≥80 years had odds ratios (OR) of 1.5 (CI 1.31-1.71), 2.28 (CI 1.86-2.80), 3.90 (CI 2.70-5.65), and 5.63 (CI 4.63-6.85), respectively, of developing pulmonary complications. </p><p>This observation was confirmed in the ARISCAT study of 2644 patients that derived a multifactorial risk index to predict pulmonary complications [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. After adjusting for confounders more common with older age, advanced age was one of seven independent predictors of postoperative pulmonary complications. When compared with patients ≤50 years old, the odds ratio for development of pulmonary complications in patients &gt;80 years old was 5.1 (CI 1.9-13.3).</p><p>In addition, even among elderly patients undergoing surgery, the risk is highest among the oldest patients. For example, in a systematic review of the risk factors for postoperative pneumonia after hip fracture surgery in the elderly (defined as age ≥65 years), subjects who developed pneumonia were on average five years older than those who did not develop pneumonia [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>Therefore, even healthy older patients carry a substantial risk of pulmonary complications after surgery. This is in sharp contrast to perioperative cardiac risk, where age is not an independent risk factor after adjusting for confounders. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6616.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>COPD is an important patient-related risk factor for postoperative pulmonary complications. In an observational study using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database including over 450,000 patients, unadjusted rates of postoperative pneumonia, prolonged ventilation, and reintubation among patients with COPD were 6.5 percent, 8.8 percent, and 5.5 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p>A systematic review found that among studies that used multivariable analysis to adjust for patient-related confounders, the odds ratio for postoperative pulmonary complications attributable to COPD was 2.36 (CI 1.90-2.93) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In the NSQIP observational study described above, after adjusting for confounders, COPD was an independent predictor for postoperative pneumonia (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.59-1.83), reintubation (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.42-1.66), and failure to wean from the ventilator (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.35-1.56), in addition to non-pulmonary adverse outcomes [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p>Despite the increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients with obstructive lung disease, there appears to be no prohibitive level of pulmonary function below which surgery is absolutely contraindicated. For example, in a report of surgery in patients with severe COPD (FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;50 percent predicted), mortality was 5.6 percent (primarily related to a high mortality rate after cardiac surgery) and severe postoperative pulmonary complications occurred in 6.5 percent [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>The impact of COPD on various postoperative outcomes after total hip arthroplasty was examined in a study of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. After multivariable adjustment (n = 2426), complications, such as pneumonia, unplanned intubation, and prolonged ventilation, were all more common among patients with COPD. In addition, perioperative mortality (OR 2.21, CI 1.08-4.55) and 30-day readmission rates (OR 1.49, CI 1.24-1.79) were both more common.</p><p>While COPD is an important risk factor for postoperative complications, it confers less risk than other patient-related risk factors including age and heart failure [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>The benefit of surgery must be weighed against the known risks; even very high-risk patients may proceed to surgery if the indication is sufficiently compelling. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6970.html" rel="external">"Strategies to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications in adults", section on 'Chronic obstructive lung disease'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Asthma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Despite early reports indicating that patients with asthma had higher than expected rates of postoperative pulmonary complications, more recent studies have found no link for patients with well-controlled asthma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94358.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for adult patients with asthma", section on 'Preoperative evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Smoking</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Current cigarette smokers have an increased risk for postoperative pulmonary complications; smoking cessation prior to surgery reduces the risk of postoperative complications; smoking cessation for at least four to eight weeks may be even more effective. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6970.html" rel="external">"Strategies to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications in adults", section on 'Smoking cessation'</a>.)</p><p>In a 2014 meta-analysis of 107 cohort and case-control studies, preoperative smoking was associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications, including pulmonary complications (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.35-2.23) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Smokers with a greater than 20 pack-year smoking history have a higher incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications than those with a lesser pack-year history [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The risk attributable to cigarette smoking is procedure dependent and is higher for surgeries that carry intrinsically greater risk for pulmonary complications (eg, cardiovascular and oncologic procedures) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Obesity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Physiologic changes that accompany class 3 or higher obesity  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef134390" href="/z/d/graphic/134390.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) may include reduction in lung volumes, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, and relative hypoxemia [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. These findings might be expected to accentuate similar changes seen with anesthesia and increase the risk of pulmonary complications. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4320.html" rel="external">"Chest wall diseases and restrictive physiology", section on 'Obesity'</a>.)</p><p>However, obesity has consistently been shown not to be an independent risk factor for postoperative pulmonary complications. A review of 10 series of obese gastric bypass patients, as an example, showed a 3.9 percent incidence of pneumonia and atelectasis, a rate similar to that seen in the general population [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Similarly, in a report of 602 patients undergoing bariatric surgery (mean body mass index [BMI] 42 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), clinically significant postoperative pulmonary complications (atelectasis and pneumonia) occurred in 1.8 percent of patients [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p>In a study that used the NSQIP database (n = 141,802), pulmonary complications were no more common among obese adults (BMI &gt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) than among those with a healthy weight (BMI 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Unexpectedly, underweight patients actually sustained more postoperative pulmonary complications. This finding is persistent even after multivariable adjustment, for some, but not all, major surgical procedures.</p><p>In a separate NSQIP analysis, authors evaluated 30-day mortality, morbidity, and different potential postoperative complications among 5.57 million patients undergoing procedures from nine different surgical specialties [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. While obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) conferred higher rates of infection, venous thromboembolism, and renal complications, there was no difference in rates of mortality or pulmonary complications between patients who had normal weights and those in each of three different categories of obesity severity. Adjusted odds ratios for obesity categories I, II, and III (stratified by BMI) for pulmonary complications were 0.90 (CI 0.88-0.92), 0.94 (CI 0.91-0.96), and 0.97 (CI 0.95-0.99).</p><p>In a systematic review, among eight studies that adjusted for confounders more common among obese patients, only one reported obesity to be a predictor of postoperative pulmonary complication rates [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Obesity is not a significant risk factor for postoperative pulmonary complications and should not affect patient selection for otherwise high-risk procedures.</p><p>Patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (ie, body mass index &gt;30 kg/[mg]<sup>2</sup> and an arterial tension of carbon dioxide [PaCO<sub>2</sub>] &gt;45 mmHg [6 kPa]) may be more likely to need postoperative positive airway pressure, although their specific perioperative pulmonary risks have not been formally studied. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7698.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of obesity hypoventilation syndrome"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7713.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prognosis of the obesity hypoventilation syndrome"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Obstructive sleep apnea</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for pulmonary (and other) complications after surgery.

Baseline home oxygen use (relative risk [RR] 2.70, 95% CI 1.50-4.86) and increasing surgical time (per 60 minutes; RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.05) were identified as independent risk factors for postoperative acute respiratory worsening.

They represent an extension of the normal physiologic changes in the lung that occur with anesthesia. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient-related risk factors</strong> – Patient-related risk factors for these complications include the following: age &gt;50 years, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, poor general health status (American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] class &gt;2), functional dependence, obstructive sleep apnea, current cigarette use, pulmonary hypertension, recent COVID-19 infection, low oxygen saturation, and serum albumin &lt;3.5 g/dL. (See <a class="local">'Patient-related risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Procedural risk factors</strong> – Procedure-related risk factors for postoperative pulmonary complications include surgery lasting more than three hours, emergency surgery, nonreversed long-acting neuromuscular blockade, and type of surgery. Upper abdominal, thoracic, aortic, head and neck, neurosurgery, and abdominal aortic aneurysm surgeries have increased risk for pulmonary complications. (See <a class="local">'Patient-related risk factors'</a> above and <a class="local">'Procedure-related risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Probable additional risk factors</strong> – Additional potential risk factors include the following: general anesthesia (compared to spinal or epidural anesthesia), hypercapnia (arterial tension of carbon dioxide [PaCO<sub>2</sub>] &gt;45 mmHg), abnormal chest radiograph, cigarette use within the previous eight weeks, and current upper respiratory tract infection. (See <a class="local">'Patient-related risk factors'</a> above and <a class="local">'Procedure-related risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Perioperative risk assessment</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Clinical evaluation</strong> – A careful history and physical examination are the most important tools for preoperative risk assessment. Attention should be paid to known risk factors as well as symptoms that suggest underlying lung disease (eg, exercise intolerance, cough, and unexplained dyspnea). A high-risk patient may benefit from aggressive strategies to reduce pulmonary complications. (See <a class="local">'Preoperative risk assessment'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6970.html" rel="external">"Strategies to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Additional work-up, in selected patients</strong> – In selected patients, preoperative pulmonary function tests (PFTs), chest radiograph, and exercise testing may identify risk factors that require attention preoperatively. Current data do not support the use of preoperative arterial blood gas analyses to stratify risk for postoperative pulmonary complications. (See <a class="local">'Preoperative risk assessment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>PFTs</strong> – PFTs should generally only be obtained in patients with uncharacterized dyspnea or exercise intolerance and in those with uncertain control of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Chest imaging</strong> – We suggest not obtaining routine preoperative chest radiographs unless there is evidence for undiagnosed or unstable cardiopulmonary disease such as new or escalating exertional dyspnea, wheezing, angina, orthopnea, lower extremity edema, hypoxemia, rales/rhonchi, or heart murmur  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef139292" href="/z/d/graphic/139292.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Chest radiographs'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET)</strong> – CPET is used to assess patients with abnormal PFTs to determine the safety of planned lung resection surgery. CPET may also have a role in the evaluation of patients with unexplained dyspnea who are undergoing other types of major surgery. A six-minute walk test, which can be easily performed in an office setting, may be a reasonable, simpler alternative.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk calculators</strong> – Five different pulmonary risk indices are available to provide a quantitative estimate of the risk of respiratory failure, pneumonia, or general pulmonary complications. Each risk index has different strengths and weaknesses. We use the ARISCAT index (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/102399.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>). These tools are a useful starting point when estimating pulmonary risk before major noncardiac surgery, and they guide conversations with the patient and surgeon.
