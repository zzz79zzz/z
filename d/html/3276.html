         As the ureters pass in close proximity to gynecologic structures, urinary tract injury is a known complication of gynecologic surgery. Intraoperative identification of injury permits prompt repair and potentially lessens postoperative sequelae, including patient morbidity, mortality, and costs. Delayed diagnosis of urinary tract injuries can result in complications beyond the site of the injury, such as genitourinary fistula formation, renal injury, sepsis, and death.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will discuss the decision to perform cystoscopy at the time of gynecologic surgery as well as the evaluation and management of urinary tract injury resulting from gynecologic surgery. Prevention of urinary tract injury and issues related to urinary tract injuries during advanced gynecologic surgery and obstetric procedures are reviewed separately.

         <strong>
          Overview
         </strong>
         – If urinary tract injury is suspected at the time of surgery, the first step is visual inspection of the operative field to assess the integrity of the bladder and ureters as well as the nature and severity of any identified injury [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. If an injury is identified, evaluation of the entire urinary tract is performed as the contralateral ureter or bladder may also have been injured. While it is not possible to visually evaluate the bladder or ureters during vaginal surgery, all surgical vascular pedicles and the anterior vaginal wall are inspected for possible areas of impingement upon urinary tract structures.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Bladder injury is more likely than ureteral injury to be diagnosed using visual inspection [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-5
         </a>
         ]. In a prospective study over 800 women who underwent hysterectomy, visual inspection detected 38 percent bladder injuries versus 7 percent of ureteral injuries [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3

         <strong>
          Hematuria
         </strong>
         – Persistent gross hematuria, seen as blood-tinged urine in the bladder catheter, is more suggestive of injury than blood that clears rapidly from the urine. Transient bleeding can result from minor trauma during urinary tract manipulation (eg, insertion of the bladder catheter, pressure from retractor) and typically clears. If hematuria persists, further evaluation for a urinary tract injury should be performed.

          Location of surgical instruments

         If the ureter could reasonably be in the operative field; it should be clearly identified and protected from injury. The approach varies by type of surgery as this determines the anatomic length of ureter that requires evaluation.

          Limits of observing ureteral peristalsis
         </strong>
         – Observing ureteral peristalsis in the retroperitoneum can help identify the ureter and its anatomic course, as well as exclude a mistakenly identified vessel, but is not a valid test to assess ureteral integrity. In a retrospective study in which patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy were evaluated with intraoperative cystoscopy, peristalsis was present in five of six with ureteral injury [

         <strong>
          Ureteral dissection
         </strong>
         – Full evaluation of a ureter may require additional dissection of the ureter. Whether to perform ureteral dissection initially or defer dissection and evaluate the urinary tract integrity at a later time during surgery (eg, with cystoscopy) is based upon the surgeon's preference and skills. The techniques for dissection to avoid injury to the ureters and bladders are described separately. (See

          Role of ureteral catheterization
         </strong>
         – We prefer this approach if anatomy is distorted by pathology and/or prior surgery. Ureteral catheters can facilitate tissue dissection, aid detection of injury, and/or prevent a ureteric injury; use will depend on a surgeon's preference and skills. It will also depend on whether the patient is in low lithotomy position with boot-type stirrups. (See

         In our practice, we routinely perform cystoscopy (in addition to visual inspection) in all patients during major gynecologic surgery (eg, hysterectomy, continence procedures, prolapse repair) [

          2,6

         We encourage surgeons to have a low threshold for performing cystoscopy. Additional benefits of universal cystoscopy include increased trainee experience and comfort with cystoscopy skills and interpretation and, on rare occasions, detection of an unsuspected urinary tract injury. Intraoperative detection of an injury allows repair during the same surgery and avoids sequelae.

         Intraoperative cystoscopy evaluates for bladder injury (eg, perforation, bleeding, suture, and/or staple) and confirms urine efflux from both ureteral orifices. However, as cystoscopy does not visualize the ureters directly, injuries such as partial ureteral obstruction, partial transection, and thermal injury may be missed [

         Patients who are in dorsal supine position and need cystoscopy can either be repositioned to lithotomy position for transurethral cystoscopy or undergo transvesical cystoscopy (ie, through an incision in the bladder). For transvesical cystoscopy, a 70- or 30-degree cystoscope is inserted through an incision in the dome of the bladder that has been secured with a purse-string suture. Alternately, a simple incision can be made into the dome of the bladder and direct visual inspection performed.

          Findings suggestive of obstruction

         – Absent or abnormal (delayed or sluggish) flow from one or both ureters is concerning for ureteral transection or obstruction. Marked delay between drainage from one ureter or obvious differences in the amount of yellow urine seen coming from each ureter suggests partial obstruction. Blood coming from a ureteral orifice is also concerning for ureteral injury.

         – For ureteric catheterization, we assemble a 21-French cystoscope, deflector bridge, and 5-French flexi-tip ureteric catheter. We then introduce the 5-French flexi-tip ureteric catheter into the ureteric orifices that are not effluxing urine and advance the catheter into the ureter at least 15 to 17 cm. The catheter should glide easily; if so, we then remove the catheter and complete the surgical case. If the ureteric catheter cannot be advanced or if we have other concerns for ureteral injury, we explore the course of the ureter from an abdominal approach.

          Benefits of universal approach
         </strong>
         – Although the value of routine cystoscopy per case may be low, the value of routine cystoscopy per surgeon may be high. Over time, as a surgeon accumulates more experience in easy and difficult cases, the immediate feedback provided by cystoscopy about urinary tract integrity (secondary prevention) can help the surgeon develop a better awareness of risk that can alter the planning of future cases (primary prevention). Thus, while universal cystoscopy is presently not standard clinical practice, surgeons early in their career might wish to adopt an initial policy of universal cystoscopy to become skilled at the technique and interpretation of findings, and to recognize any inadvertent ureteral and/or bladder injuries in their early operative practice (secondary prevention). As these surgeons accumulate experience and thus better awareness, insight, and intuition about intraoperative challenges and pelvic anatomy that increase risks of injury (primary prevention), a policy of diagnostic or selective cystoscopy may be adopted.

          Concerns for universal approach
         </strong>
         – The most compelling argument against universal intraoperative cystoscopy is that a statistically significant decrease in postoperatively detected injuries has not been consistently demonstrated when intraoperative cystoscopy is routinely used [

          16

         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. General concerns about universal cystoscopy include increased cost, detection of clinically insignificant injuries (eg, absorbable suture in bladder) [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17

          Cost-effectiveness analysis
         </strong>
         – Studies that have assessed the cost-effectiveness of cystoscopy at the time of hysterectomy report conflicting conclusions. A 2019 study favored diagnostic or "selective" cystoscopy when the surgeon had a high suspicion of injury and a 2021 study favored screening or "universal" cystoscopy after all surgical cases [

          22,23

         The signs and symptoms of operative urinary tract injury vary by the anatomic location and nature of the injury, are often nonspecific, and can overlap with symptoms of other postoperative complications. Any postoperative patient with complaints suspicious for urinary tract injury should be promptly assessed. Patients who have been discharged will most likely need to return to a medical setting for evaluation. Early diagnosis facilitates management of the injury and improves outcomes [

         We perform serum studies on all patients with suspected urinary tract injury. We do not find urinalysis results helpful as patients who have had a bladder catheter and/or intraoperative bladder manipulation will typically have hematuria. If a patient with suspected uroperitoneum has an intra-abdominal drain, peritoneal fluid may be tested.

Limitations of peritoneal fluid assessment include that the specificity and sensitivity of this approach are unknown (ie, a normal test result does not definitively exclude injury), test results suggesting uroperitoneum require confirmation, injury that does not result in uroperitoneum cannot be identified, and liver cirrhosis interferes with result interpretation. Peritoneal fluid can be obtained from intraoperative drains, if present, or by paracentesis.

         Retrograde pyelogram provides information on the precise location of the injury. This test is usually done in a fluoroscopy suite.

         If intraoperative cystoscopy is not available, postoperative retrograde cystography can evaluate both the integrity of the urethra and bladder. Leakage of contrast indicates a laceration or perforation. A filling defect can represent a foreign body (or under distention). However, limitations of cystography include missing subtle findings such as a transmural suture, attenuation of the bladder mucosa, or a concurrent ureteral injury. (See

         When urinary tract injuries are diagnosed after surgery, initial priorities include relieving renal obstruction, treating infection, and stopping urine leakage (internal or external). In some cases of isolated ureteral injury, obstruction or leakage can be managed with ureteral stents placed retrograde via cystoscopy or anterograde by interventional radiology. Otherwise, surgical exploration is required for repair of the injury; repair techniques are described below.

         If surgical repair must be delayed, temporary measures such as nephrostomy may be necessary. Consultation with clinicians experienced in caring for these patients is advised. (See

         </strong>
         Repair of bladder dome injury is a straightforward procedure in most patients. However, patients with a complicated injury likely benefit from intraoperative consultation with an advanced gynecologic or urologic surgeon. Complicated injuries include large lacerations, lacerations that extend towards the trigone or ureters, and thermal injuries as well as injuries in patients who have undergone prior pelvic surgery or pelvic radiation  (

         – Most clinicians obtain a voiding cystogram, formally called voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), to confirm the injury has healed before removing the catheter, especially for larger or challenging cystotomies. In a study of 245 VCUG performed after surgical lower urinary tract injury, 125 (51 percent) were performed following cystotomy repair at a median of nine days from surgery. Of the three abnormal studies (2.4 percent) reported, the initial cystotomies ranged in size from 2 to 6 cm [

         – Prior to removing the bladder catheter, we measure a post-void residual for patients who had a concomitant incontinence surgery or if the patient has any risk factors for voiding dysfunction, such as prior incontinence surgery and/or hypotonic detrusor. To measure the post-void residual, we backfill approximately 300 mL of sterile water into the bladder, withdraw the bladder catheter, and ask the patient to void. While consensus is lacking regarding an elevated PVR, patients who void at least 200 mL are considered to be emptying adequately. (See

         As a result of the anatomic complexity of the trigone, repair of trigone defects or other injuries are generally performed by advanced gynecologic or urologic surgeons. The trigone is in the inferior and posterior aspect of the bladder and includes the ostia for the ureters and urethra  (

         ). Injuries to or just below the trigone may involve the ureters or urethra, are more difficult to access for repair compared with dome or supratrigonal injuries, and may require ureteral stent placement to prevent ureteral obstruction. Following trigone repair, the integrity of the ureters and urethra must be assessed.

         Antibiotics are used to treat clinical infection but are not helpful for preventing infection at the time of urinary tract injury or after placement of an indwelling bladder catheter. Most patients who experience urinary tract injury at the time of gynecologic surgery have already received prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the risk of surgical site infection  (

        </p>
        <p>
         Additional prophylactic antibiotics at the time of indwelling catheter placement (ie, as part of injury management) have not been shown to be helpful. As patients with indwelling bladder catheters or urinary stents are at increased risk of UTI, clinicians should remain vigilant to promptly recognize signs of infection in these patients and treat documented infection accordingly.

         </strong>
         In our practice, we routinely perform cystoscopy (in addition to visual inspection) in all patients during major gynecologic surgery (eg, hysterectomy, continence procedures, prolapse repair). However, decision to perform cystoscopy is surgeon dependent. Other experts may perform cystoscopy selectively rather than universally. (See

          Technique
         </strong>
         – After visual inspection of the bladder, we use cystoscopy to evaluate the bilateral ureteral orifices for evidence of normal urine efflux (ie, ureteral jets). To aid visualization of the jets, we give sodium
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8461" href="/z/d/drug information/8461.html" rel="external">
          fluorescein

         <strong>
          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – Initial evaluation for possible urinary tract injury includes physical examination and laboratory tests for evidence of acute kidney injury or urinary tract infection. Additional evaluation includes postoperative cystoscopy to exclude urethra and bladder injuries and/or imaging with CT with intravenous contrast and delayed images. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Evaluation'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Urinary tract injury is diagnosed by directly seeing the injury with cystoscopy or by visualizing the sequelae of injury (eg, hydroureter, urinoma) with imaging studies. Patients with a diagnosed injury are also evaluated for possible complications resulting from the injury (eg, renal insufficiency, urinary tract infection). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Management
         </strong>
         – Initial management priorities include relieving renal obstruction, treating infection, and stopping urine leakage (internal or external). (See
         <a class="local">
          'General considerations'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Ureteral injury
         </strong>
         – Repair of ureteral injuries often involves ureteral stenting or advanced surgical repair, including ureteral reanastomosis or ureteroneocystostomy. Nephrostomy tube placement for urine drainage can be a temporary step if surgical repair is delayed. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Ureteral injury'

         above.)

         <strong>
          Bladder injury
         </strong>
         – The approach to repair of a bladder injury depends upon the site (dome or trigone), type, and severity of injury. Injuries to the trigone are the most difficult to repair. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Bladder injury'

         above.)

         <strong>
          Urethral injury
         </strong>
         – Management of urethral injury generally involves bladder catheter placement followed by delayed repair as indicated. Consultation with a urologic specialist is advised. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/114923.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of traumatic lower genitourinary tract injury", section on 'Urethral injury'

         <strong>
          Role of antibiotics
         </strong>
         – After the initial perioperative dose of antibiotics for prevention of surgical site infection, further antibiotic therapy generally is not necessary for patients with urinary tract injuries unless the patient develops a UTI. Prophylaxis for surgical site infection and treatment of UTI are discussed separately. Antibiotics are used to treat clinical infection but are not helpful for preventing infection at the time of urinary tract injury or after placement of an indwelling bladder catheter, although clinicians should remain vigilant to promptly recognize signs of infection in these patients.
