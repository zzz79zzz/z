However, an assay that fully assesses these functions is not available for routine clinical use. Instead, antibody function is estimated by measuring an individual's response to specific vaccinations. This topic will review normal immunologic responses to vaccinations, methods for assessing these responses, and patterns of abnormal responses. A more general evaluation of the immune system, including measurement of antibody levels and functional assessments of different immune cells, is presented elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3903.html" rel="external">"Laboratory evaluation of the immune system"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3914.html" rel="external">"Primary humoral immunodeficiencies: An overview"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS FOR ASSESSING VACCINE RESPONSE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Vaccine response is part of the evaluation of possible immunodeficiency.

Most patients have already had serum levels of immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgA, and IgM measured, but if not, these can be obtained at the same time that vaccine response is assessed.

When evaluating suspected immunodeficiency, responsiveness to vaccines containing each distinct type of antigen should be assessed separately [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Depending on the immunologic defect present, a patient may respond poorly to one or both types.</p><p>A working group of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology published recommendations on the interpretation of vaccine responses in the evaluation of patients with possible immunodeficiency [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. The material in this review is consistent with those recommendations.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3927741622"><span class="h2">IgG reflects long-term protection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Only IgG titers are used in the assessment of vaccine responses. Infections and immunizations elicit IgM, IgA, and IgG antibody responses, but only IgG antibodies confer long-term protection.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1692808687"><span class="h2">Types of vaccines</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Vaccines may be categorized as polysaccharide vaccines, protein vaccines, or conjugate vaccines.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Polysaccharide vaccines</strong> – The polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines (ie, 23-valent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9784" href="/d/drug information/9784.html" rel="external">pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</a> [PPV-23], including Pneumovax 23, Pnu-imune 23, and others) are usually used to assess the response to polysaccharide antigens, which requires functional B cells only. Patients may be exposed to pneumococcal antigens either from vaccination or from natural infection. Of note, children are normally vaccinated with <strong>conjugate</strong> pneumococcal vaccines, which are <strong>not</strong> useful in assessing polysaccharide responsiveness. Uncommonly, other polysaccharide vaccines can be used to evaluate the polysaccharide response, although the "normal" response to these vaccines is not as well-characterized. (See <a class="local">'Other polysaccharide vaccines'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Protein vaccines</strong> – Tetanus and diphtheria vaccines are the two most common vaccines used to evaluate the antibody-mediated response to protein antigens because most patients have been exposed through primary and booster vaccination. Responses to protein antigens require intact B and T cell function. An impaired response indicates that both B and T cell function are abnormal, which is characteristic of more severe forms of immunodeficiency.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Response to the conjugate vaccine for <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type B (Hib) can also be used to assess responses to protein antigens. While the Hib vaccine includes <em>H. influenzae</em> surface polysaccharide, the vaccine induces antibodies to the protein component of the conjugate and thus represents a protein response. (See <a class="local">'Interpretation of Hib titers'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Conjugate vaccines</strong> – The other common type of vaccines are conjugate vaccines, which contain polysaccharide antigens complexed to immunogenic proteins. These have limited use in assessing either protein or polysaccharide responses, with the notable exception of the Hib vaccine discussed above. Conjugate vaccines were developed because many children under the age of two years generate weak responses to polysaccharide antigens alone but can respond to protein antigens. The antibody response to conjugate vaccines is predominately stimulated by the protein component and thus is not representative of either a pure polysaccharide response or a pure protein response. Therefore, in a patient who received a conjugate vaccine series, measurement of titers to the specific polysaccharides contained in the conjugate vaccine does not allow for an assessment of responsiveness to pure polysaccharide or protein antigens. Measurement of titers to the protein component of the conjugate vaccine, which is usually a diphtheria or tetanus toxoid, is similarly uninformative because these titers also reflect the patient's response to routine tetanus/diphtheria vaccinations. (See <a class="local">'Nonresponse to conjugate polysaccharides'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Mechanisms of the normal antibody responses to protein and polysaccharide antigens are reviewed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3975.html" rel="external">"The adaptive humoral immune response", section on 'Types of antigens'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3166878147"><span class="h2">Patterns of nonresponse</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Two patterns of nonresponse are well-described in immunodeficiency:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An inability to respond effectively to polysaccharide antigens <strong>only</strong> ("polysaccharide nonresponse")</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An inability to respond effectively to both polysaccharide and protein antigens</p><p></p><p>It is highly unusual for a patient to have an impaired response to protein antigens with a normal response to polysaccharide antigens.</p><p>The disorders in which each type of nonresponse is seen are reviewed below. (See <a class="local">'Disorders associated with abnormal vaccine responses'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H530391412"><span class="h2">Timing of pre- and postvaccination measurements</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When vaccines are administered for the purpose of assessing response, it is critical to wait at least four to eight weeks after administration before measuring postvaccination titers. Assessing responses earlier than this with any method may result in low titers. Longer periods (eg, 6 to 12 months) are also less informative because when antibody concentrations are low after longer periods, it is not possible to differentiate patients who did not respond at all from those who did but subsequently lost the antibodies over time (ie, patients with impaired immunologic memory). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3965.html" rel="external">"Specific antibody deficiency", section on 'Degrees of nonresponse'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1186102608"><span class="h2">Variability among laboratories</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is important that any evaluations of pre- and postvaccination titers be performed by the same laboratory using the same assay method because there are many other variables in technique. This is particularly critical for pneumococcal serotype-specific titers. Methods for the measurement of antigen-specific antibodies against individual pneumococcal serotypes include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), multiplex pneumococcal serology (eg, Luminex), nephelometry, turbidimetry, radial immunodiffusion, and radioimmunoassay. ELISA or a similar immunologic assay is the preferred method in most situations [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>], although the method employed depends upon the laboratory and the antibody class or subclass being measured. The assay should be standardized to World Health Organization standards. Laboratories may determine their own reference ranges or use data provided by reagent manufacturers. Consistency among the results obtained by different methods and even with the same method performed in different laboratories is poor [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1206602804"><span class="h2">Interfering factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The immunologic response to vaccination cannot be reliably evaluated in patients who have received <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> replacement within the past four to six months or in those who have received single doses of immunoglobulins for prevention of specific infections (eg, hepatitis A or measles) within the past three to five months because the results obtained could reflect antibodies from either donor or patient origin. Most immunologists wait at least four months after discontinuing immune globulin therapy to revaccinate patients for evaluation.</p><p>Other conditions and treatments that potentially interfere with immunoglobulin production and vaccine response include cancer, chemotherapy, and some immunosuppressive therapies (eg, long-term glucocorticoids, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a>, etc). These are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3986.html" rel="external">"Glucocorticoid effects on the immune system"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3939.html" rel="external">"Secondary immunodeficiency induced by biologic therapies", section on 'Impact on vaccination'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18"><span class="h1">ASSESSING PNEUMOCOCCAL POLYSACCHARIDE RESPONSES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1582639510"><span class="h2">Children under two years of age</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The response to polysaccharide vaccines cannot be reliably assessed in children under two years of age, because response to polysaccharide antigens is normally variable in young children, even in the absence of an immune disorder [<a href="#rid1">1,4-7</a>]. The ability to respond to polysaccharide vaccines normally increases with age. In addition, there is some evidence that use of polysaccharide vaccines in young children can interfere with the efficacy of conjugate vaccines given subsequently, so the polysaccharide vaccine is not used in young children for this reason also [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19"><span class="h3">Isohemagglutinin testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because young children do not respond vigorously to polysaccharide vaccines, isohemagglutinins may be measured instead as a means of assessing polysaccharide response, although there are significant limitations to their usefulness. The authors do not use isohemagglutinins in this manner, but they may be used in resource-limited settings. Testing is usually performed by blood banks.</p><p>Isohemagglutinins are antibodies that are normally generated in response to polysaccharides antigens from common gut bacteria. These antibodies are cross-reactive with A and B blood group antigens on the surface of erythrocytes [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. They generally appear in the blood by six months of age and can be measured in young children who have not completed a primary vaccination series. Patients with type A blood should have anti-B isohemagglutinins, and patients with blood type O should have both anti-A and anti-B. Patients with type AB blood do not have isohemagglutinins under normal circumstances. Since isohemagglutinins are both IgM and IgG antibodies that are measured together, they do not allow the assessment of IgG-mediated immunity.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20"><span class="h2">Adults and children over two years</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2202282269"><span class="h3">Which vaccines are used?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (eg, Pneumovax 23; Pnu-imune 23) is the primary means of assessing responsiveness to polysaccharide antigens in adults and in children older than two years. Rarely, other polysaccharide vaccines may be used. (See <a class="local">'Other polysaccharide vaccines'</a> below.)</p><p>IgG responses to pneumococcal serotypes in normal individuals of different ages across populations with and without infections have not been studied extensively, so a solid definition of normal and abnormal antibody responses to immunization in different age groups and different areas of the world is lacking. However, the approach to interpreting vaccine responses described in this section is consistent with the recommendations of an expert working group [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H388848016"><span class="h3">Vaccination and infection history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evaluation of pneumococcal vaccine response begins with a detailed history of past infectious illnesses and of vaccinations to pneumococcus. The following information is helpful in interpreting results:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Has the patient received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13, -10, or -7) or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9784" href="/d/drug information/9784.html" rel="external">pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</a> (PPV-23)? If yes, how long ago?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Has the patient had sinusitis, otitis media, or pneumonia? How many episodes of each type of infection? Is culture data available?</p><p></p><p>Patients who have either had an identified infection or recently received a vaccine for the infection-causing agent would be expected to have protective titers against it. If a patient was vaccinated more than a decade earlier, low titers may reflect normally waning immunity, rather than an immune disorder.</p><p>Childhood vaccination schedules for the United States are available on the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fschedules%2Findex.html&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr%2B3NCnsUgXejRPQelpwO%2B8EkAakdlxe4YNLYvIAW05w3wg7E%2BeCyDX3nfsOMDwUwxsJfFcGg%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=3929" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website</a>. Recommendations for vaccination of adults in the United States are summarized in the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82634" href="/d/graphic/82634.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Detailed discussions of the routine vaccination of children and adults are found separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2876.html" rel="external">"Standard immunizations for children and adolescents: Overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3884.html" rel="external">"Standard immunizations for nonpregnant adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7021.html" rel="external">"Pneumococcal vaccination in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6713413"><span class="h2">Interpretation of pneumococcal titers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The evaluation begins with a vaccination and infection history, followed by measurement of serum titers to the capsular polysaccharides in the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine before and after immunization. An algorithm of the steps in the evaluation is provided  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef117459" href="/d/graphic/117459.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Pneumococcal titers are available commercially as panels of IgG antibodies to specific serotypes. For the purposes of assessing vaccine response, the clinician should request a panel of at least 14 serotypes and preferably up to 23 serotypes, if available. The relevant serotypes are those included in the 23-valent vaccine but not in the conjugate vaccines. Pneumococcal titers are generally reported in micrograms/mL using a standard provided by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3010317145"><span class="h3">Normal responses are age-dependent</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A serotype-specific IgG concentration ≥1.3 mcg/mL is indicative of a normal ability to respond to polysaccharide antigens in all age groups [<a href="#rid1">1,10,11</a>]. Note that lower levels (ie, ≥0.35 mcg/mL) are considered adequate for protection against invasive pneumococcal disease [<a href="#rid10">10,12</a>]. However, higher titers may be necessary to protect against mucosal sinus disease, otitis media, and nasopharyngeal carriage [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Defining a more precise protective concentration for specific serotypes is difficult due to variations in antibody avidity and opsonizing properties that may differ with both age and serotype. In addition, the concentration of ≥1.3 mcg/mL may not apply if different methods and standards are used, especially in countries outside of the United States.

Children in the United States have been receiving conjugated pneumococcal vaccines routinely since 2001. In 2010, the 7-valent conjugate vaccine (containing serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) was replaced in the United States by a 13-valent vaccine. This vaccine additionally includes serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A. Outside of the United States, 10-valent conjugate vaccines are also in use, and these vaccines include serotypes that are present in the 13-valent vaccine. The table shows serotypes in the commonly used vaccines  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77758" href="/d/graphic/77758.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). When exclusion of serotypes in the conjugate vaccine results in a small number of serotypes remaining to analyze, the &gt;50 or &gt;70 percent criteria may not apply, and the patient's clinical history must guide interpretation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1631513586"><span class="h3">Relative increases in individual titers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ratio of post- to prevaccination titer is also included in the definition of a normal vaccine response.

Each serotype must be considered individually, and the table outlines the number of serotypes that are expected to increase by this amount in different age groups. The higher the prevaccination titer for a specific serotype, the less likely that titer will increase significantly after vaccination, even in patients with normal immune function [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>].</p><p>There is no response to a single serotype-specific polysaccharide that predicts the ability to or inability to respond to most or all of the other serotypes, and serotypes differ in immunogenicity. As an example, serotypes 6B and 23F are weak immunogens, whereas serotype 3 is highly immunogenic. Responses to all serotypes should be given equal weight (eg, an isolated but strong response to serotype 3 should not be interpreted as suggesting the patient's immune responsiveness is normal).</p><p>Some patients who initially develop an adequate antibody response demonstrate a rapid decline in antibody titers over the ensuing year. When this occurs, a patient who may have experienced clinical improvement may become susceptible to recurrent infections again. Retesting of antibody titers after 6 to 12 months is indicated in patients who responded appropriately to vaccination but then continue to get infections.

If the polysaccharide vaccine is also indicated, it should be given no sooner than eight weeks after the conjugate vaccine. This approach is recommended because giving the conjugate vaccine first may result in stronger responses to the 13 serotypes present in PCV-13 and better immunologic memory, compared with administering the PPV-23 first.

When compared with serotype-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) titers, a low (ie, &lt;110 mg/L) OVA response frequently but not always identifies low-specific serotype antibodies assessed by ELISA.
