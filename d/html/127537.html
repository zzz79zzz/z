This evaluation is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127759.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Evaluation of adults with acute illness in the outpatient setting"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2197873408"><span class="h2">Inpatient evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The evaluation of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 includes elements of a cardiovascular evaluation, including assessment of known cardiovascular disease and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, assessment of symptoms that may be caused by respiratory or cardiac disease, laboratory testing (including a complete blood count and complete metabolic panel), chest radiograph, electrocardiogram (ECG), and troponin testing (which is followed if elevated). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127429.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management in hospitalized adults", section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2874024231"><span class="h3">Troponin</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Troponin testing is commonly performed in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, as it may have prognostic value and may serve as a useful baseline for comparison in patients who develop manifestations of possible myocardial injury (such as HF or arrhythmia). Some experts also perform troponin testing in selected outpatients with uncertain level of risk. As mentioned above, among patients with COVID-19, troponin levels are most prevalent and most elevated with more severe disease [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129342.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Cardiac manifestations in adults", section on 'Troponin'</a>.)</p><p>An elevated troponin level is likely not indicative of an acute coronary syndrome in the absence of suggestive symptoms, signs, or ECG findings. Although peak troponin elevation is typically higher in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) than in patients with noncoronary myocardial injury, troponin levels in these clinical settings are overlapping [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The evaluation of COVID-19 patients for acute coronary syndrome is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127533.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues", section on 'Acute coronary syndrome patients'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2944484126"><span class="h3">ECG</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A baseline ECG is generally performed in patients presenting for acute care with suspected symptomatic COVID-19. This enables documentation of baseline QRS-T morphology should the patient develop symptoms or signs of a type of myocardial injury such as an acute coronary syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy. Additionally, the baseline ECG allows for documentation of the QT (and corrected QTc) interval. Importantly, QTc will need to be monitored if QT-prolonging therapies are initiated (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9041" href="/z/d/drug information/9041.html" rel="external">azithromycin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9247" href="/z/d/drug information/9247.html" rel="external">chloroquine</a>) to reduce the risk of acquired long QT syndrome. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127551.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Arrhythmias and conduction system disease", section on 'ECG'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127551.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Arrhythmias and conduction system disease", section on 'Patients receiving therapies that prolong the QT interval'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116011.html" rel="external">"Acquired long QT syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management"</a>.)</p><p>ECG abnormalities that have been reported in patients with COVID-19 and troponin elevation include T-wave depression and inversion, ST-segment elevation or depression, and Q waves [<a href="#rid3">3-6</a>]. When ST-segment elevation is present, diagnostic evaluation is required to distinguish MI from other causes of myocardial injury [<a href="#rid3">3,5,6</a>]. In a case series of 18 patients with COVID-19 with ST-segment elevation, MI was clinically diagnosed in eight (of which six underwent coronary angiography that confirmed obstructive coronary disease), with the remaining 10 diagnosed with noncoronary myocardial injury [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Four of the patients with MI and nine of the patients with noncoronary myocardial injury died in hospital. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129342.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Cardiac manifestations in adults", section on 'Electrocardiogram'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127533.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues", section on 'ST-elevation myocardial infarction'</a>.)</p><p>The most common arrhythmia in patients with COVID-19 is sinus tachycardia, but atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or ventricular tachycardia may occur.

The approach to cardiac evaluation in patients with known or suspected COVID-19 may differ from the standard approach to evaluation, as it is based upon weighing the following considerations [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The likelihood that evaluation will change management and guide prognosis. Thus, it is important to identify a treatable cause of myocardial injury that requires timely intervention, such as acute MI.

As described separately, natriuretic peptide levels are commonly elevated in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, particularly in patients with elevated cardiac troponin levels. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3510.html" rel="external">"Heart failure: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis in adults", section on 'Natriuretic peptide'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decisions regarding the need for further evaluation are based upon whether test results will alter clinical management and guide prognosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If the clinical presentation is suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS; including MI or unstable angina) based upon the presence of chest pain, other anginal symptoms, new HF, sudden cardiac arrest, and/or new ischemic ECG changes, timely evaluation is required to determine if urgent coronary angiography and intervention are indicated and to institute appropriate therapies. There is an elevated risk of ACS among patients with COVID-19 given the high prevalence of comorbidities in this patient population. Evaluation of coronary disease in patients with COVID-19 is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127533.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/52.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction", section on 'When to suspect acute MI'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with COVID-19 without suspected ACS, further cardiac testing is generally limited since specific diagnostic tests and treatments are not available for most of the noncoronary causes of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Most patients with mild troponin elevation without symptoms and signs of acute HF can be clinically monitored without cardiac imaging.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>For patients who develop new-onset HF, an echocardiogram may be performed to evaluate regional and global ventricular and valvular function if this is requested by a consulting cardiologist and is expected to have a significant impact on management or is likely to change the patient's prognosis.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3494.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of stress (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy", section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127533.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues", section on 'Acute coronary syndrome patients'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">A diagnosis of stress cardiomyopathy is based on presence of <strong>all</strong> of the following four features:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Transient left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction (typically not in a single coronary distribution; patterns include apical, midventricular, and basal).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Absence of angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary disease or acute plaque rupture (or if coronary artery disease is present, the wall motion abnormalities are not in the territory of the affected coronary artery).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>New ECG abnormalities (ST-segment elevation and/or T-wave inversion) <strong>or</strong> modest elevation in cardiac troponin.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Absence of pheochromocytoma or myocarditis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Although patients with stress cardiomyopathy are at risk for the development of acute HF and cardiogenic shock, those who survive the acute episode typically recover ventricular function within one to four weeks.

The approach to cardiac evaluation may differ from the standard approach to evaluation, as it is based upon weighing the likelihood that evaluation will change management and guide prognosis, nosocomial infection control considerations, and optimal management of limited available medical staff and resources.
