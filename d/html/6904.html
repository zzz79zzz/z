         A cataract is an opacity of the lens of the eye that may cause blurred or distorted vision, glare problems, or, in very advanced cases, blindness. Cataract is a significant cause of blindness worldwide [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Cataracts occur frequently with increasing age and may be a normal part of aging. However, poor nutrition, metabolic insults, excessive exposure to sunlight or other sources of radiation, trauma, and certain medications such as cortisone can speed their development. There are no proven medical therapies. Modern microsurgical technique combined with intraocular lens implantation can restore normal vision in the vast majority of patients [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Except in certain uncommon situations, delay in treatment does not result in an adverse outcome. The major advances in the surgical treatment of cataract have not been matched by advances in the understanding of cataract formation, approaches to prevention, or in nonsurgical therapy.

         This topic will discuss cataract in adults. Cataract in children is reviewed separately. (See

         </span>
         Cataracts continue to be an important cause of blindness. Worldwide, cases of blindness due to cataract have increased from 12.3 million in 1990 to 20 million in 2010, with the proportion of blindness due to cataract ranging from 12.7 percent in North America to 42 percent in Southeast Asia [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Cataract surgery has increased in most areas of the world, and the proportion of cases of blindness due to cataract has been decreasing, with the greatest decreases in East Asia, tropical Latin America, and western Europe and the smallest decreases in sub-Saharan Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
         The pattern and rate of blinding disorders differs between nations depending upon whether nutritional and infectious causes of blindness are eradicated and whether there are resources available for treatable disorders such as cataract. In addition, there are differences in how blindness is defined; for example, blindness by international health standards converts to 10/200 by Snellen notation, while the standard for legal blindness in the United States is 20/200.

         </span>
         The lens of the eye has a unique structure which renders it vulnerable to insults due to aging or other causes. It is composed of specialized cells arranged in a highly ordered and complex manner, which contain a high content of cytoplasmic protein. These proteins, the crystallins, along with the complex structure, impart transparency to the lens. Unlike other epithelia, the lens cannot shed its nonviable cells; these cells are compressed into the center of the lens over time and begin to lose their transparency [
         <a href="#rid3">

         ].

         Age-related cataracts – Older age accounts for the vast majority of cataracts. Pathogenesis is related to the degenerative effects of aging on cell structure. Some of the anatomic and ultrastructural correlates of lens opacity are known, although exact pathogenetic mechanisms are not. Epidemiologic and experimental evidence suggests that photo-oxidative insult, perhaps potentiated by toxic or sensitizing substances, plays a role.

         Non-age-related cataracts – These cataracts are most often due to trauma, uveitis, scleritis (particularly necrotizing scleritis), radiation of an intraocular tumor, metabolic impact of systemic disease such as myotonic dystrophy, use of topical corticosteroids or certain phenothiazines, and topical anticholinesterases (toxic cataract).

         Most of these risk factors are environmental stressors that lead to the formation of toxins or the impairment of antioxidants. A dose-response relationship has been demonstrated with ultraviolet B exposure in sunlight [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ] and smoking [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Some damage to the lens caused by smoking may be reversible upon quitting, although the reduction in cataract risk associated with smoking cessation is primarily due to limiting further dose-related damage to the lens [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Other environmental stressors may be involved as well. Low-level accumulated lead exposure, at levels commonly experienced by adults in the United States, appears to be associated with an increased risk of cataract [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14

         The size of the risk associated with duration of exposure to diabetes has not been quantified [

         Patients with HIV/AIDS who do not have ocular opportunistic infections undergo cataract surgery at a younger age than the general population; whether this is related to accelerated aging, drug effect, or occult inflammation remains unclear [

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The development of cataract is a painless, progressive process that is highly variable among individuals. Patients usually present with bilateral symptoms and complain of difficulty with night driving (especially due to glare of oncoming headlights) or reading road signs or fine print. Most cases occur in patients over age 60. Younger individuals with cataracts are likely to have risk factors such as diabetes mellitus or systemic steroid use. Patients of all ages are subject to cataract due to significant eye trauma. The clinical presentation of age-related and non-age-related cataracts is the same.
        </p>
        <p>
         In many patients, there is an increase in nearsightedness before there is opacity of the lens that degrades vision. This increase in nearsightedness, called a "myopic shift," is caused by an increase in the refractive power of a lens that is gradually becoming cataractous and can continue as opacity develops. Patients will report more difficulty with distance vision and some may note that their near vision is better. It is not unusual to require updates of spectacle prescription at more frequent intervals prior to development of frank opacity.

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         A lens opacity can be confirmed by a nondilated fundus examination with the direct ophthalmoscope; there may be darkening of the red reflex, opacities within the red reflex, or obscuration of ocular fundus detail. In the absence of other visual symptoms, a red eye, or other abnormality noted on fundus examination, these patients should be referred on a nonurgent basis for comprehensive ophthalmic examination.
        </p>
        <p>
         During the comprehensive examination, the type and extent of lens opacity is noted, and a dilated fundus examination is performed to rule out other pathology that could account for diminished vision or prevent full restoration of vision after cataract surgery.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The diagnosis of cataract is based on characteristic findings of opacity on comprehensive ophthalmic examination. A diagnosis of visually significant cataract is made if no other pathology is detected and the degree of lens opacity correlates with the patient's complaints and best-corrected visual acuity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cataracts typically have one of three components: nuclear sclerosis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51557" href="/z/d/graphic/51557.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ), cortical spoking  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56676" href="/z/d/graphic/56676.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>
         ), and posterior subcapsular haze  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72677" href="/z/d/graphic/72677.html" rel="external">
          picture 3
         </a>
         ). Each affects a different anatomical part of the lens  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70532" href="/z/d/graphic/70532.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ) and has different symptoms and progression. Most patients have a combination of components. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Classification'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Cataracts are also described by their maturity. An immature cataract still allows a view of the retina and transmits a red reflex  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53639" href="/z/d/graphic/53639.html" rel="external">
          picture 4
         </a>
         ). Once the red reflex is lost, it is called mature  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71657" href="/z/d/graphic/71657.html" rel="external">
          picture 5
         </a>
         ). A mature cataract degrades vision to the 20/400 level or worse. A hypermature cataract is one in which the cortex of the lens has liquefied and the lens nucleus is mobile within the capsule  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62426" href="/z/d/graphic/62426.html" rel="external">
          picture 6
         </a>
         ). A moderate to advanced cataract can interfere with the diagnosis and therapy of diseases involving the retina and optic nerve. (See

         A small fraction of mature and hypermature cataracts can give rise to secondary glaucoma which may be evident on initial presentation. These types of glaucoma sometimes cause a red, painful eye, in contrast to many other glaucomas, which are usually asymptomatic. (See

         Cataracts are classified as having nuclear, cortical, or posterior subcapsular components, evident on examination. However, these distinctions are mostly important for research classification rather than clinical management. Most patients have a combination of components.

          Nuclear cataract
         </strong>
         – Nuclear cataract dulls colors and white significantly; this is rarely a patient complaint until after the first cataract is removed, at which time the effect on color is noted by comparison with the brightness of colors in the operated eye.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Nuclear cataract progresses very slowly. Distance vision typically is affected much more than near vision. It is not unusual to find individuals in their 80s with nuclear cataract degrading acuity to the 20/70 to 20/100 level, with near vision preserved at the 20/25 level. Such an individual may not be particularly aware of or bothered by the decreased vision from cataract if they do not drive.

         – Although it is a prominent finding on examination with a biomicroscope (a low-power binocular microscope used with a slit lamp), cortical cataract does not degrade vision very much. Cortical cataracts may appear suddenly after trauma or other insult but tend to progress slowly.

         Surgery is indicated if symptoms from the cataract interfere with the patient's ability to meet his or her needs of daily living; there are no criteria based upon the level of visual acuity. The indication for surgical intervention is the same for age-related as well as other types of acquired cataract. Some forms of acquired cataract, such as that related to trauma or uveitis, require modification of standard surgical technique, but in most cases special surgical considerations are not necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
         Age alone is not a contraindication to cataract surgery. Cataract surgery and the resultant improvement in vision may have important benefits for older adults. Data from a Medicare database, comparing hip fracture rates in patients with cataract who did or did not undergo cataract surgery, found a 16 percent decrease in the adjusted odds ratio [OR] for hip fracture within one year in patients who had surgery and a 23 percent decrease for patients with severe cataract [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Additionally, a longitudinal study of over 550,000 adults observed a 9 percent relative reduction in serious traffic accidents in the year following a first cataract surgery [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The indication and timing of surgery depends to some degree on the presence or absence of coexisting eye disease:

         <strong>
          Patients without coexisting eye disease
         </strong>
         – The choice of whether and when to pursue surgery should be determined by the informed patient rather than the surgeon, except in cases in which cataract limits monitoring for retinal or optic nerve disease, or in the rare instance in which it is inducing glaucoma [
         <a href="#rid17">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For some patients, the myopic shift caused by the cataract may be correctable with a change in spectacle correction. Surgery should be deferred as long as diminished acuity can be corrected with spectacles to meet a patient's needs. In rare cases, the patient may not tolerate the full correction of refractive error because the result is imbalanced with respect to the fellow eye, and cataract surgery is chosen without first dispensing full correction.

          Patients with coexisting eye disease
         </strong>
         – The ophthalmologist must assess what proportion or aspect of diminished vision is accounted for by cataract in the presence of coexistent pathology such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, or diabetic retinopathy. Even if it seems that cataract accounts only partially for loss of vision, surgery may be indicated if the other disease process is under control and the patient understands that the prognosis for complete recovery of visual acuity is guarded. Many patients with impaired vision from cataract and AMD or diabetic retinopathy have significant improvement in visual function after cataract extraction, even when coexistent retinal disease precludes recovery of 20/20 vision [
         <a href="#rid18">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Adjunctive tests that can be done preoperatively, such as the potential acuity meter (PAM), may provide useful information in advising whether cataract surgery is likely to yield improvement in vision in patients with coexistent pathology. Retrospective data suggest that cataract surgery for patients with wet AMD can improve vision, but that close monitoring is warranted postoperatively because of a trend toward increased macular thickening or intraretinal cysts [

         Same-day surgery on the second eye (also referred to as immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery) is a good, or potentially superior option compared to delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery, although it remains relatively uncommon in the United States. Historically, immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery has not been routinely performed because of concerns related to the possibility of bilateral infection, inferior optimization of postoperative refractive error, and lack of potential for modification of regimens based on any complications in the first eye. However, there is potential for cost savings with same-day second eye surgery, and observational, as well as trial data show equivalent or improved outcomes [

        <p>
         It is important to make sure the surgeon is aware that the patient was or is taking one of these agents, as there are preoperative and intraoperative regimens (eg, cycloplegia, mydriatics, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], low-flow fluids, iris retractors, and pupillary ring expanders) that can reduce the risk of IFIS [

         Preoperative blood pressure control is important to avoid complications such as suprachoroidal hemorrhage. Patients should be given their antihypertensive medications with a sip of water on the morning of surgery. It is important to avoid intraoperative spikes in blood pressure that may be dangerous to the eye or to the patient’s overall health. A general rule of thumb is that elective surgery should not be performed if preoperative systolic pressures are over 180 or if diastolic pressures are over 110. (See

         Patients with diabetes should preferably undergo surgery in the early morning so insulin or oral hypoglycemic drugs can be held until after surgery; this reduces the risk of hypoglycemia before or during surgery. If patients with type 1 diabetes are scheduled later in the morning or afternoon, one-third to one-half of the morning insulin dose can be given. Marked derangement of glycemic control is uncommon in patients with diabetes who undergo cataract surgery since the procedure is brief.

          39

         ]. However, the decision to continue or discontinue these medications should be made after discussion with the ophthalmologist who is performing the surgery. Individual considerations (eg, reason for anticoagulation, whether the patient has monocular or binocular vision, history of prior hemorrhage in the fellow eye) should factor into this decision. Individuals with higher bleeding risks (eg, monocular patients, patients with previous bleeding complications, or in cases where a larger incision or retro-bulbar block is planned or topical anesthesia is not possible) may have oral anticoagulants stopped prior to surgery. If discontinuation of anticoagulants is not possible in a high-risk case, topical anesthesia should be considered to reduce the bleeding risks related to use of a needle block.

         Cataract surgery is typically performed on an outpatient basis under local anesthesia supplied topically, by block, or by sub-Tenon's infusion. Monitored intravenous sedation is also commonly used. [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48,49
         </a>
         ]. General anesthesia is necessary only for patients who cannot reliably cooperate under local anesthesia (eg, cognitive impairment or other communication barrier) or possibly those who had a complication of local anesthesia in the fellow eye. The intraocular components of cataract surgery can be performed in 10 to 20 minutes by experienced surgeons, but typically patients spend 30 to 60 minutes in the operating room for positioning, draping, preliminary, and final steps.

          Phacoemulsification
         </strong>
         – Also called small incision surgery, this has become the most common form of cataract removal technique in high-resource countries. The lens is removed using a handpiece with a 1 to 3 mm tip inserted through a small incision. This tip, also called a phaco probe, contains a needle that vibrates with ultrasonic energy to fragment the hard central part of the lens, and an irrigation and aspiration sleeve. The softer cortex is then aspirated and the lens capsule is left behind as in extracapsular cataract extraction. A foldable plastic or silicone lens may be passed through this smaller incision, or the incision can be extended if needed to accommodate a larger, rigid plastic lens. Phacoemulsification may not be feasible in advanced cataracts in which the lens nucleus may be very hard.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The small incision may be self-sealing, requiring one or even no sutures. Phacoemulsification has the advantage of more rapid visual recovery due to the small incision size and decreased likelihood of suture-induced astigmatism.

          Standard extracapsular cataract extraction
         </strong>
         – This typically involves removal of the lens nucleus in one piece through a large incision. The lens cortex is aspirated from the eye and the lens capsule is left behind to support an intraocular lens. A rigid plastic lens is inserted through the same incision and placed on or in the capsule, behind the iris. A modification of this technique which offers some of the advantages of a smaller incision (although not as small as the phacoemulsification incision) is described below.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Phacoemulsification is commonly performed, although it is technology-dependent and relatively costly and not available in all countries. A systematic review comparing phacoemulsification with extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) for age-related cataract found lower complication rates with phacoemulsification but concluded that the lower costs for ECCE support its use when high-volume surgery is important, since differences in visual outcomes for the two procedures are small [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A patient and surgeon may choose phacoemulsification under topical anesthesia for its apparent short-term advantages. However, traditional ECCE is a reasonable option in certain instances of advanced cataract or if ECCE is the preferred technique of the ophthalmologist whom the patient has chosen for surgery.

         Two other surgical techniques are sometimes used if standard approaches are not available:

         Intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE), an approach to cataract surgery in which the cataract and its surrounding capsule are both removed. Frequently, no lens implant is placed in the eye.

         Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS) or sutureless small-incision extracapsular cataract surgery (SICS) has many of the advantages of phacoemulsification without the costs. In MSICS, no phacoemulsification equipment is used; instead, the lens is manually, mechanically divided into smaller pieces before removal from the eye through a small incision through which a foldable lens can be implanted. Fewer sutures are used than for ECCE; sometimes none are required. A systematic review of three randomized trials in Nepal and India comparing short-term outcomes of MSICS and ECCE found better visual acuity with MSICS, though overall good functional visual acuity was achieved in less than half of subjects with either method and complications were greater with MSICS in one trial [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. A systematic review of eight trials comparing MSICS and phacoemulsification in India, Nepal, and South Africa found similar results for best corrected visual acuity for the two techniques at six to eight weeks, but there were quality concerns with the trials and longer-term outcomes are needed [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52

         Prophylactic use of topical antibiotics (eye drops) before and after cataract surgery is common, despite little evidence to support the practice.

         Most patients in resource-rich countries will have synthetic intraocular lenses (IOLs) implanted during these procedures, except in some forms of uveitis, in some cases of high myopia, and in the event of unusual intraoperative complications. IOLs can also be implanted secondarily in a subsequent operation. The alternatives to lens implantation are aphakic (cataract) spectacles  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71082" href="/z/d/graphic/71082.html" rel="external">
          picture 7

         ) or contact lenses. However, results with either of these alternatives are unsatisfactory for most patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are four types of IOLs: monofocal, multifocal, accommodative, and toric. In general, monofocal and multifocal lenses are equally effective at improving distance visual acuity. Multifocal IOLs result in better uncorrected near vision when compared with monofocal IOLs, but multifocal IOL users report more bothersome visual side effects such as glare or haloes [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ]. Toric IOLs can reduce or eliminate the need for astigmatism correction in spectacles or contact lenses. Multifocal, accommodative, and toric IOLs are more expensive than monofocal lenses and are typically offered as “premium” lenses; the additional expense is typically born by the patient because these lenses, which reduce dependence on glasses, are not covered by insurance.
        </p>
        <p>
         A 2014 systematic review of four trials in the United Kingdom, Italy, and Germany comparing accommodative IOL with monofocal IOL found moderate-quality evidence of small gains in near vision after six months with accommodative IOL [

         Overall, more data are needed to determine the relative benefits of monofocal, multifocal, accommodative, and toric lenses. Preoperative education and counseling are warranted to assure that patient expectations are realistic when “premium” lenses are offered at higher cost to patients. Studies are needed to correlate patient-reported outcomes with patient expectations [

         The eye may be patched, depending upon whether anesthesia was local or topical. All systemic medications can be resumed immediately, including anticoagulant/antithrombotic agents, assuming there were no concerns of bleeding during surgery. The eye is typically examined on the first postoperative day, although some surgeons are eliminating this step for uncomplicated cases and having staff contact patients by telephone instead. Many surgeons allow resumption of driving at the level immediately prior to surgery at this time, as long as continued patching is not required.

Regimens typically start at two to four times daily and usually taper down after the first week, depending on the drug. The available evidence suggests that NSAIDs may be more effective than steroids in suppressing cystoid macular edema. [

        <p>
         Recommendations on physical activity restriction vary widely among surgeons depending upon their confidence in the technique used. Patients with large incisions typically are advised not to undertake heavy lifting or strenuous activity including sexual activity for several weeks to several months. Surgeons who perform phacoemulsification tend to restrict heavy lifting or strenuous activity for a period of only days to weeks. Most patients are able to return to work by one week unless driving or heavy lifting is required. There is no contraindication to air travel. There are no evidence-based data for these recommendations.

         The final spectacle prescription is determined at any point between one and three months after surgery depending upon the need for suture removal. Patients usually require spectacles for night driving and/or reading after cataract surgery.

         Risk of macular degeneration – Concerns have been raised that patients undergoing cataract surgery may be at increased risk for AMD. Proposed mechanisms include an increased post-procedure susceptibility to light damage, inflammatory changes secondary to surgery, or induction of angiogenesis. However, this association may be due to overlapping risk factors for the two conditions, or the fact that AMD may be discovered after cataract surgery and thus may represent prior disease not recognized due to lens opacity [
         <a href="#rid78">
          78,79
         </a>
         ]. A 2017 systematic review concluded that it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions from the available data as to whether cataract surgery is beneficial or harmful in people with AMD after 12 months [
         <a href="#rid80">
          80

         Posterior capsule opacification (19.7 percent) can be successfully treated with yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG) laser capsulotomy and therefore is not considered a complication by many surgeons. The procedure, which is done as an outpatient in the doctor’s office, surgery center, or laser center, is painless and yields improvement in vision almost immediately. YAG capsulotomy does increase the risk of retinal detachment, however, and cannot be considered entirely benign. A meta-analysis found that biomaterials and edge design of the intraocular lens may influence posterior capsule opacification; incidence was lower for acrylic or silicone lenses and for those with sharp optic edges [

         An eye that has had cataract surgery with lens implantation is described as pseudophakic. Penlight and fundus examination findings are unchanged, except that sometimes the pupil takes on an irregular shape due to surgical manipulation. The pupil will appear black as opposed to grayish or opalescent after removal of the native lens. Some good observers notice a strange reflection of light in the pupil of younger pseudophakic patients who have larger pupils. This is an optical reflection off of the intraocular lens that is not present with the native lens. The fundus examination will be improved due to removal of media opacity.

         There is no proven therapy to either prevent cataract formation or slow progression of lens opacity once it develops. However, observational studies suggest that some interventions such as a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables and smoking cessation may be helpful [
         <a href="#rid83">
          83-86

         Although postmenopausal estrogen use (longer than 10 years) may reduce the risk of nuclear cataracts, this is not a recommended strategy to prevent cataracts. (See

         Several interventions have been suggested for prevention but have not been proven. Since sunlight exposure is a risk factor, sunglasses may offer protection, particularly for persons exposed to high reflected light (eg, water, snow, high desert ground), but there is no evidence that any particular type of sunglasses are more effective in cataract prevention or progression. Similarly, wearing a brimmed hat may offer protection against cataracts. Increased dietary glycemic load is not associated with risk for cataract [
         <a href="#rid90">
          90

         ], and no studies have been performed to evaluate whether blood glucose control in patients with diabetes correlates with cataract risk.

          Significance
         </strong>
         – A cataract is an opacity of the lens of the eye that may cause blurred or distorted vision, glare problems, or, in very advanced cases, blindness. Cataracts are a major cause of blindness globally worldwide. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Significance'

         <strong>
          Pathogenesis
         </strong>
         – Risk factors for cataract include older age, smoking, poor lifestyle habits, alcohol consumption, sunlight exposure, lower educational status, diabetes mellitus, and systemic and possibly high-dose inhaled corticosteroids. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Clinical presentation
         </strong>
         – Cataract formation is usually bilateral and presents with problems with night driving, reading road signs, or difficulty with fine print. There is often an increase in myopia. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Cataract should be suspected in any patient who complains of painless progressive decline in vision. Most cases of cataract occur in patients over age 60 or in younger individuals who have risk factors. Diagnosis is by comprehensive eye examination; a dilated fundus examination should be performed to rule out other pathology that could account for diminished vision. (See

         <strong>
          Management of comorbid conditions
         </strong>
         – Cataract surgery is a low-risk procedure. Extensive preoperative evaluation is not indicated, but blood pressure should be controlled in hypertensive patients; endocarditis prophylaxis is not necessary. As the risk of bleeding is low,

          aspirin
         </a>
         or anticoagulants may be continued for most patients. The decision to continue or discontinue these medications should be made after discussion with the ophthalmologist who is performing the surgery. (See

         Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE), including the variant manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS), may be performed at the surgeon's preference or based on resources available. Intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) is rarely undertaken, as it does not allow for capsule-supported intraocular lens (IOL) placement and requires aphakic spectacle or contact lens correction or an anterior chamber or sutured IOL, each of which involves compromise compared with the long-term safety and full-time correction of a capsule-supported IOL.
