Axial loading of the foot following a fall from a height is the most common mechanism for severe calcaneal fractures. There are two broad categories of calcaneal fractures: extraarticular and intraarticular. Extraarticular fractures are generally more straightforward to assess and manage. Patients with calcaneus fractures often have multiple concurrent injuries, and it is important to consider this possibility when evaluating patients. </p><p>The initial assessment of calcaneus fractures, differentiation of intraarticular from extraarticular fractures, and the nonoperative management of appropriate extraarticular fractures are reviewed here. A brief overview of the assessment and management of intraarticular fractures is also included. General fracture management and other foot fractures are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/237.html" rel="external">"General principles of acute fracture management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/236.html" rel="external">"General principles of definitive fracture management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/220.html" rel="external">"General principles of fracture management: Bone healing and fracture description"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13798.html" rel="external">"General principles of fracture management: Early and late complications"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/82957.html" rel="external">"Talus fractures"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5149569"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The calcaneus is the most commonly fractured tarsal bone, representing 60 percent of all tarsal fractures in adults [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The peak incidence occurs in younger males [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].<sup> </sup>Most calcaneal fractures are<sup> </sup>occupational, and are caused by axial loading from a fall [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The majority are displaced intraarticular fractures (60 to 75 percent) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. According to a retrospective review of 752 calcaneal fractures occurring over a 10-year period, the annual incidence of calcaneal fractures is 11.5 per 100,000, with a male to female ratio of 2.4:1 [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Seventy-two percent of these fractures resulted from falls.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5149576"><span class="h1">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The foot has three divisions: the hindfoot (calcaneus and talus), midfoot (navicular, cuboid, and cuneiforms), and forefoot (metatarsals and phalanges)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78924 graphicRef61079 graphicRef71857" href="/d/graphic/78924.html" rel="external">figure 1A-C</a>). The calcaneus is the largest tarsal bone and supports the axial load from the weight of the body  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65868" href="/d/graphic/65868.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86517" href="/d/graphic/86517.html" rel="external">figure 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93194" href="/d/graphic/93194.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). </p><p>Superiorly, the calcaneus has three facets (anterior, middle and posterior), which articulate with the talus to form the subtalar joint  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56189" href="/d/graphic/56189.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>). The posterior facet is the largest of the three facets and the major weightbearing surface of the calcaneus. The middle and posterior facets are separated from one another by a sulcus. The middle facet is reinforced by the sustentaculum tali, a projection of the calcaneus that articulates with the medial portion of the talus. The flexor hallucis longus tendon passes under the sustentaculum. </p><p>The anterior surface of the calcaneus articulates with the cuboid. The posterior portion of the calcaneus is known as the tuberosity. The Achilles tendon inserts on its superior aspect, a possible site for avulsion fractures. The inferior portion of the tuberosity has medial and lateral processes, which are common sites of extra-articular fractures. A central peroneal tubercle along the lateral surface of the calcaneus serves as an attachment site for the calcaneofibular and talocalcaneal ligaments. </p><p>The tendons of the peroneus brevis and peroneus longus pass behind the lateral malleolus and then along the lateral surface of the calcaneus. These tendons can sometimes dislocate from a retinacular injury sustained concomitantly with a calcaneus fracture. Also, displaced fragments or exostoses that form during fracture healing may impinge upon these tendons. The extensor digitorum brevis originates from the dorsolateral distal calcaneus, and may avulse a fragment from the calcaneus (see <a class="local">'Avulsion of extensor digitorum brevis origin'</a> below). The bifurcate ligament anchors the anterior process of the calcaneus to the navicular and cuboid bones. With certain twisting injuries, this ligament may avulse the anterior process of the calcaneus. (See <a class="local">'Anterior process fracture'</a> below.)</p><p>Neurovascular bundles run along the medial and lateral surfaces of the calcaneus, making them especially prone to injury from trauma and surgical procedures [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Injuries to the two nerves in this area, the lateral and medial plantar nerves, typically cause numbness along the respective side of the sole, but may also cause heel pain or toe flexion weakness [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The medical calcaneal artery passes behind and then below the sustentaculum tali. The lateral calcaneal artery passes along the lateral aspect of the calcaneus from posterior to anterior. </p><p>Several accessory ossicles, including the os trigonum and the os peroneum, may be present in the area of the calcaneus  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71857" href="/d/graphic/71857.html" rel="external">figure 1C</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78924" href="/d/graphic/78924.html" rel="external">figure 1A</a>). They are not seen in all patients but are common and can be mistaken for avulsion fractures  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89278" href="/d/graphic/89278.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H57343593"><span class="h1">MECHANISM AND CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinical presentation of a calcaneal fracture depends upon its location and the severity of the injury. Most calcaneus fractures result from significant trauma, typically an axial loading of the foot following a fall or jump from a height. Pain is usually quite severe and weightbearing is often impossible. Swelling and tenderness are typically evident, and may be severe. Deformity of the heel may be apparent. (See <a class="local">'Medial or lateral process fracture'</a> below and <a class="local">'Body fractures not involving the subtalar joint'</a> below and <a class="local">'Intraarticular fracture types'</a> below.)</p><p>Presentations of anterior process fractures and avulsion fractures of the extensor digitorum brevis may be subtle, with the only findings being moderate pain and tenderness just distal to the insertion of the anterior talofibular ligament. The mechanism of injury is often identical to that of lateral ankle sprains (ankle inversion), for which these fractures are often mistaken. (See <a class="local">'Anterior process fracture'</a> below and <a class="local">'Avulsion of extensor digitorum brevis origin'</a> below.)</p><p>Stress fractures of the calcaneus often present with heel pain during the first steps after rising from bed, mimicking plantar fasciitis. However, unlike plantar fasciitis, calcaneal stress fractures typically manifest tenderness along the sides of the calcaneus. Isolated fractures of the sustentaculum present with pain and tenderness over the upper middle part of the medial calcaneus. (See <a class="local">'Sustentaculum tali fracture'</a> below and <a class="local">'Stress fractures'</a> below.)</p><p>The typical presentation for each major type of calcaneus fracture is described in further detail below. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1025080"><span class="h1">EXAMINATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Calcaneus fractures are frequently caused by major trauma and associated with significant injury. Thus, the physical examination should include vital signs and a careful evaluation looking for signs of internal injury, particularly for patients involved in high energy trauma (eg, fall from height) or at high risk of injury (eg, elderly patient). Following major trauma, an obvious hindfoot or ankle injury, particularly if there is deformity, may distract the examiner from other more serious problems. If there is any doubt about the nature or extent of injury, it is best that the patient be evaluated in the emergency department. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13854.html" rel="external">"Initial management of trauma in adults"</a>.) </p><p>Examination of the patient with a foot or ankle injury follows the standard approach, including inspection, palpation, and range of motion testing, if this is tolerated. Neurovascular assessment is required. Look carefully at the skin for abrasions, lacerations, blistering from rapid stretching of the skin, and tenting. Any break in the skin increases the risk of infection and may complicate the application of a splint or cast. Open fractures and fracture-dislocations are considered orthopedic emergencies since delays in treatment lead to worse outcomes, including avascular necrosis. Blister formation may suggest more forceful trauma. Swelling may be severe, making landmarks difficult to identify.</p><p>Typically, patients with a calcaneus fracture from high energy trauma manifest tenderness around the heel and hindfoot. Areas to palpate include the tuberosity, body, and anterior portions of the calcaneus  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef129752" href="/d/graphic/129752.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef129751" href="/d/graphic/129751.html" rel="external">picture 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65868" href="/d/graphic/65868.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). Tenderness over the calcaneocuboid joint is associated with an anterior process fracture (tenderness directly over the lateral ankle ligaments suggests an ankle sprain).</p><p>Nerve integrity can be assessed by confirming sensation in each independently innervated area of the foot  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50419" href="/d/graphic/50419.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>), and by testing flexion and extension of the great toe, small toes, and ankle. The neurologic examination is described in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5095.html" rel="external">"The detailed neurologic examination in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Assessment of the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses and distal capillary refill is required. If the pulses are not palpable due to swelling, a handheld Doppler device can be used to determine if they are present. Immediate surgical consultation is required for any vascular deficit [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5149583"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Calcaneal fractures are diagnosed on the basis of imaging studies. Radiographic evaluation of a suspected calcaneus fracture begins with plain radiographs, including lateral and axial views  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89383" href="/d/graphic/89383.html" rel="external">image 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89295" href="/d/graphic/89295.html" rel="external">image 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54662" href="/d/graphic/54662.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>). Additional views and computed tomography (CT) are obtained when clinicians require greater detail about the extent of the fracture or when there is concern for an occult fracture despite nondefinitive initial radiographs. In addition, half of patients with a calcaneus fracture sustained during a fall or other high-energy trauma have concomitant injuries, including fracture of the contralateral calcaneus and compression fractures of the thoracolumbar spine  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89237" href="/d/graphic/89237.html" rel="external">image 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89238" href="/d/graphic/89238.html" rel="external">image 5A</a>), and areas of concern based upon the clinical evaluation should be imaged [<a href="#rid2">2,8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13854.html" rel="external">"Initial management of trauma in adults"</a>.) </p><p>Lateral and axial plain radiographs of the calcaneus are usually sufficient to detect the presence of a displaced fracture or dislocation, but high quality data describing their sensitivity and specificity are lacking. Overlying shadows on the axial view can make interpretation difficult, but an understanding of the anatomy simplifies this task. An anteroposterior (AP) plain radiograph of the foot is sometimes included in a calcaneus series. Although the AP view may demonstrate certain fractures, such as avulsions of the extensor digitorum brevis origin, it is seldom helpful and can usually be omitted from the initial series [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>If a fracture is present or strongly suspected on the basis of plain radiographs, the next step is to use the lateral radiograph to assess two important angles: Bohler’s angle and the angle of Gissane. To measure Bohler’s angle, draw a line from the highest (ie, most cephalic) point of the posterior calcaneus (tuberosity) to the highest midpoint of the calcaneus (ie, highest point of the posterior articular facet). Then, draw a second line from this highest midpoint to the highest point of the anterior process of the calcaneus. The angle between these lines is Bohler’s angle, which normally measures between 20 and 40 degrees  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89267 graphicRef89269" href="/d/graphic/89267.html" rel="external">image 6A-B</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2,9,10</a>]. An angle of less than 20 degrees indicates a depressed fracture. The angle of Gissane is formed by the two strong cortical struts of the calcaneus that lie beneath the lateral process of the talus; the lines used to measure the angle run approximately along the superior aspect of the posterior facet and the superior aspect of the anterior process  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89277" href="/d/graphic/89277.html" rel="external">image 7</a>). This angle should measure between 100 and 130 degrees<sup> </sup>[<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. If there is doubt about whether an angle is normal, a radiograph of the patient’s contralateral calcaneus can be obtained for comparison. Note that it is possible, although uncommon, for these angles to fall within the normal range despite the presence of a calcaneal fracture. </p><p>Imaging in addition to lateral and axial views is sometimes required to diagnose a calcaneal fracture. In most such cases, CT is preferred, but additional plain views may be beneficial in certain circumstances. An oblique view may help if an avulsion fracture is suspected  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89278" href="/d/graphic/89278.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). Broden’s views enable assessment of the posterior facet and may demonstrate a fracture, particularly an intraarticular fracture, that is poorly seen on other views  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89279" href="/d/graphic/89279.html" rel="external">image 8</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89280" href="/d/graphic/89280.html" rel="external">image 9</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. </p><p>CT may be required to fully characterize certain fractures, particularly intraarticular fractures  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89238 graphicRef89240 graphicRef89241 graphicRef89242" href="/d/graphic/89238.html" rel="external">image 5A-D</a>). CT is also used to determine whether a fracture extends into the subtalar joint. Hence, CT is recommended for most fractures through the body of the calcaneus, since these may have intraarticular extension that is not apparent on plain radiographs. When more detailed imaging is needed but CT is not available, other views (eg, obliques, Broden’s) and an ankle series can be obtained, but these are vastly inferior to CT for the evaluation of intraarticular fractures [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>MRI has a limited but potentially important role in select cases. If an occult nondisplaced calcaneus fracture is suspected (eg, persistent symptoms plus suggestive but non-definitive findings on CT), MRI may be used to confirm or rule out a fracture  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89311" href="/d/graphic/89311.html" rel="external">image 10</a>). MRI is also sensitive for detecting early stress fractures of the calcaneus. (See <a class="local">'Stress fractures'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/255.html" rel="external">"Overview of stress fractures", section on 'Imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H47613770"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The patient with a calcaneal fracture typically presents with pain, swelling, and possibly deformity around the heel, ankle, and hindfoot following trauma usually involving landing on the foot after a fall from a height. Less commonly, calcaneal fractures are caused by ankle inversion and manifest only mild to moderate pain and swelling. In either case, the diagnosis of calcaneal fracture is made with radiographic studies. CT may be needed to fully characterize the fracture or to make a definitive diagnosis in some cases, and should be obtained if clinical suspicion for a fracture remains high in the face of negative plain radiographs. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H47613778"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS FOR SURGICAL REFERRAL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Emergent (ie, immediate) surgical referral is required for open fractures, fractures associated with neurovascular injury, fractures associated with dislocation (which must be reduced immediately), and suspicion or diagnosis of acute compartment syndrome.</p><p>Virtually all intraarticular calcaneus fractures should be assessed and managed by a surgeon, and urgent referral is indicated. In addition, calcaneal fractures that are comminuted or involve noticeable displacement warrant urgent referral. As a general rule, it is best to contact the surgeon at the time of diagnosis and arrange timely evaluation. The surgeon consulted to manage the fracture may be an orthopedist or a podiatrist depending upon the local practice environment. The indications for surgical referral for specific types of calcaneal fractures are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Extraarticular fracture types'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5149590"><span class="h1">CLASSIFICATION AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When classifying calcaneus fractures, the most important step is to distinguish extraarticular from intraarticular injuries. Extraarticular calcaneus fractures have a good prognosis and rarely require surgery; intraarticular fractures have a poor prognosis and are difficult to evaluate and treat. </p><p>The following figure illustrates the major types of extraarticular calcaneus fractures  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93387" href="/d/graphic/93387.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>). Most are avulsion-type fractures, resulting from twisting/deforming forces [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. These include fractures of the anterior process, sustentaculum tali, dorsal aspect of the tuberosity (Achilles tendon insertion), and the origin of the extensor digitorum brevis tendon. Extraarticular fractures caused by sheering or impact forces include transverse fractures of the tuberosity and fractures of the medial and lateral processes of the tuberosity. CT imaging may be required to exclude intraarticular extension of transverse tuberosity fractures. Radiographic examples of each type of extraarticular fracture are included under the discussion of each fracture below. </p><p>Intraarticular calcaneus fractures usually result from high energy trauma such as falling from a height onto the heel. Intraarticular fractures generally have a poor prognosis because they extend into an important weight bearing joint (subtalar) and are often displaced. Surgery is often required to repair these injuries and early referral is indicated. The following images demonstrate an intraarticular fracture on plain radiograph and CT  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89238 graphicRef89240 graphicRef89241 graphicRef89242" href="/d/graphic/89238.html" rel="external">image 5A-D</a>). Intraarticular fractures can be subclassified, but a wide variety of patterns are possible and their description is beyond the scope of this topic. A discussion of these patterns can be found elsewhere [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5149604"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF COMPLICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Calcaneus fractures are prone to early and late complications. Thus, an important part of the initial patient evaluation is to identify and manage acute complications and associated injuries. Complications are less common with extraarticular fractures, but are particularly common with intraarticular fractures (especially if displaced). Skin tenting leading to skin necrosis is much more common with posterior displacement of fragments. Other dangerous complications such as compartment syndrome and neurovascular injury are much more common with displaced intraarticular fractures. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for complications with these fracture types, and consider admission for observation if swelling is extreme or pain difficult to manage. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5149611"><span class="h2">Early complications</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Swelling</strong> is often severe.

ACS is most likely to develop in displaced fractures involving the body of the calcaneus. Displaced, comminuted, intraarticular fractures appear to be at highest risk [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Stress fractures and non-displaced extraarticular fractures are unlikely to develop ACS. If not recognized early and treated, ACS can result in severe, permanent disability. Disproportionately severe pain is a hallmark of ACS, but most calcaneus fractures are extremely painful and thus ACS can be difficult to recognize in this setting [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Thus, it is important to maintain a high index of suspicion for this complication and measure compartment pressures if it is suspected. Because the foot has multiple soft tissue compartments, multiple measurements are necessary and should be performed by a clinician with experience managing ACS in the foot [<a href="#rid13">13,15</a>]. If compartment pressures are elevated, emergent fasciotomy is needed to prevent ischemic injury. ACS is discussed in detail separately.

Activities that pose a risk of reinjury should be avoided until healing is nearly complete and ankle function approaches preinjury levels (typically at least three to four weeks). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5149903"><span class="h2">Body fractures not involving the subtalar joint</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5149911"><span class="h3">Mechanism and clinical presentation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Approximately 20 percent of calcaneus fractures involve the body without extending into the subtalar joint [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. These are usually caused by falling onto the heel from a height. Patients typically present with severe pain and swelling that is more dramatic than with other extraarticular calcaneus fractures.

Even though fracture lines are often well seen on both axial and lateral plain radiographs, it can be difficult to exclude intraarticular extension using plain radiographs alone  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89298" href="/d/graphic/89298.html" rel="external">image 19</a>). Therefore, CT is generally required to characterize these fractures. The value of CT in evaluating extraarticular body fractures is demonstrated in the following examples  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89299" href="/d/graphic/89299.html" rel="external">image 20</a>).

Initial treatment consists of a bulky dressing, strict elevation of the foot above the level of the heart, and application of ice. This helps to reduce pain and minimizes swelling, which reduces the risk of fracture blisters. Elevation and icing should continue for three to four days [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Basic initial fracture care is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/237.html" rel="external">"General principles of acute fracture management"</a>.)</p><p>If fracture blisters develop, they should be monitored for subsequent ulceration or infection. An initial follow-up visit three to five days after the injury is recommended, at which time the skin can be reassessed. </p><p>Displaced fractures can lead to a number of problems, including shortening of the Achilles tendon, impingement of the peroneal tendons, and widening of the heel that makes normal shoes uncomfortable, and surgical correction is often performed. If widening of the heel is the only deformity, treatment with closed reduction may be adequate. </p><p>Casting is not recommended for non-displaced body fractures that spare the subtalar joint. Instead, early range of motion is preferred [<a href="#rid2">2,22</a>]. Some authors recommend that the patient not bear weight for 10 to 12 weeks until healing occurs [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Others recommend initial non-weightbearing, which progresses to toe-touch walking when tolerated, and then partial weightbearing for 6 to 12 weeks [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. By delaying weightbearing until healing is demonstrated on radiographs, the risk of fracture displacement is reduced. </p><p>Follow-up radiographs are recommended 10 to 12 weeks after injury to confirm healing. They are also recommended if symptoms persist longer than 16 to 20 weeks or if non-union or malunion are suspected (persistent pain, swelling, and/or development of deformity). </p><p>Patients with non-displaced calcaneal body fractures generally return to their preinjury activity level faster than those with other calcaneus fractures. This is due to the relative stability of these fractures, which allows for early range of motion exercises and progressive weight bearing over the course of treatment. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5149953"><span class="h1">INTRAARTICULAR FRACTURE TYPES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5149961"><span class="h2">Mechanism and clinical presentation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The large majority of intraarticular fractures are caused by falling from a height and landing on the heel. The clinical presentation is similar to that of calcaneal body fractures that do not extend into the joint, except that deformity of the heel is more likely to be apparent and swelling can be much more severe. Severe swelling carries with it a high risk of compartment syndrome (up to 10 percent) [<a href="#rid11">11-13</a>] as well as a high risk of skin problems from sloughing and fracture blisters. Bruising that appears on the arch of the foot one to two days after the injury suggests the presence of this fracture.

However, extension of the fracture into the subtalar joint may or may not be apparent on plain radiographs. CT imaging often reveals intraarticular extension or fracture fragments not apparent on plain radiographs and therefore is essential for appropriate classification and optimal management of intraarticular fractures  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89295" href="/d/graphic/89295.html" rel="external">image 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89296 graphicRef89301 graphicRef89302" href="/d/graphic/89296.html" rel="external">image 18A-C</a>).

Systematic reviews have failed to clarify which treatment approach is best [<a href="#rid23">23,24,27</a>]. Earlier meta-analyses found that while surgery results in better anatomical restoration and a higher probability of returning to prior employment, pain is no better and any benefits come at the cost of higher complication rates [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. A subsequent meta-analysis suggests that surgery may offer some short-term benefits (improved foot function over the first 6 to 24 months and fewer patients with chronic pain at 24 months) [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. The authors note the limited quality of available evidence, in part due to small sample sizes and the impracticality of blinding when comparing nonoperative to operative treatment.

Swelling may be present but often is not [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Patients with calcaneal stress fractures typically have tenderness along the medial and lateral walls of the posterior calcaneus, while patients with plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendinopathy usually do not.

Most result from significant trauma, typically an axial loading of the foot following a fall or jump from a height. Pain is usually severe and weightbearing is often impossible. Swelling and tenderness are typically evident; deformity of the heel may be apparent. However, presentations of anterior process fractures and avulsion fractures of the extensor digitorum brevis may be subtle, with the only findings being moderate pain and tenderness just distal to the insertion of the anterior talofibular ligament. The mechanism of injury for these two fracture types is often identical to that of lateral ankle sprains.
