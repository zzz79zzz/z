There are a variety of reasons that a case of pneumonia might resolve slowly or incompletely, including those relating to the etiology of the pneumonia (misdiagnosis of the pathogen or the presence of a resistant pathogen); those relating to the host, including mechanical processes; and the development of complications from the initial infection. In addition, noninfectious etiologies of pulmonary infiltrates can mimic infectious pneumonia, thus making it appear that resolution is not following the expected course. Approximately 20 percent of presumed nonresponding community-acquired pneumonia is due to noninfectious causes [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Despite the frequency of this problem, there has been a paucity of studies specifically addressing this issue.</p><p>In this review, we will use the term "nonresolving pneumonia" to include those cases of presumed pneumonia that progress, resolve slowly, or fail to achieve complete resolution despite what is thought to be appropriate therapy. We will first discuss those factors that normally affect the resolution of pneumonia, and we will then focus on specific causes of nonresolving pneumonia. </p><p>Aspiration pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and the approach to fever and pulmonary infiltrates in the immunocompromised patient are discussed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7024.html" rel="external">"Aspiration pneumonia in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6990.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and microbiology of community-acquired pneumonia in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7032.html" rel="external">"Clinical evaluation and diagnostic testing for community-acquired pneumonia in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7020.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, microbiology, and diagnosis of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1635.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation of ventilator-associated pneumonia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1401.html" rel="external">"Approach to the immunocompromised patient with fever and pulmonary infiltrates"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Persistent illness following COVID-19 is also discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129312.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Evaluation and management of adults with persistent symptoms following acute illness ("Long COVID")"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">EXPECTED RESOLUTION OF PNEUMONIA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The rate of resolution of pneumonia is not easily defined and may vary depending upon the underlying cause. Patients typically note subjective improvement within three to five days of treatment; more specific clinical criteria for resolution include improvement in tachycardia and hypotension, which are expected to improve in two days; fever, tachypnea, and arterial oxygenation (PaO<sub>2</sub>), which are expected to improve within three days; and cough and fatigue, which may take 14 days or longer to improve  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74599" href="/d/graphic/74599.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. The 2009 British Thoracic Society guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia suggest that chest radiograph and hospitalization be considered for outpatients with pneumonia who fail to improve after 48 hours of treatment [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>Most studies on the natural history of pneumonia have focused upon the resolution of chest radiographic abnormalities, with "slow resolution" often being defined as the persistence of radiographic abnormalities for greater than one month in a clinically improved host [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>].</p><p>Determining whether a patient has nonresolving or progressive pneumonia must also take into account several factors that affect the expected rate of resolution. These include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Comorbidities – Comorbid conditions often slow the resolution of pneumonia  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62007" href="/d/graphic/62007.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Whereas patients without associated medical illnesses usually demonstrate clearing of radiographic infiltrates by four weeks, only 20 to 30 percent of patients with a comorbid condition will clear by four weeks [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age – Approximately 90 percent of patients younger than 50 years of age show radiographic resolution by four weeks, compared with only 30 percent of patients older than 50, even in the absence of concurrent disease [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Severity – Radiographic resolution of severe pneumonia is estimated at 10 weeks, compared with three to four weeks for mild to moderate pneumonia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Infectious agent – The rate of radiographic and clinical improvement varies with the particular infectious agent causing the pneumonia. In general, resolution is more rapid with <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>, nonbacteremic <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Chlamydia</em> species, and <em>Moraxella catarrhalis </em>than with other organisms [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1186410740"><span class="h1">EVALUATION OF NONRESOLVING PNEUMONIA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evaluation of patients with an apparent nonresolving pneumonia generally centers around more detailed imaging studies and obtaining material for microbiologic and pathologic analysis  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef52895" href="/d/graphic/52895.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). While there are many potentially useful, noninvasive techniques to clarify the initial diagnosis, these may be limited by the difficulty of obtaining sputum in frail or immunocompromised patients. These groups are likely to constitute a larger proportion of those whose pneumonia fails to resolve. For example, heavy growth on expectorated sputum of a dominant organism would be extremely helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis but may be hampered by the difficulty of obtaining adequate sputum samples. Improved molecular and immunologic techniques for specific viral or bacterial pathogens have improved the diagnostic yield in patients with initial presentation of pneumonia [<a href="#rid12">12</a>] but have not been studied in slowly or nonresolving pneumonia.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1464768969"><span class="h2">Approach to diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnostic evaluation of treatment failure in pneumonia begins with a careful history, physical examination, and review of the medical record. </p><p>Whether or not the rate of resolution is within the range of expected norms, takes the patient's underlying host factors, comorbidities, severity of illness, and suspected pathogen into account. In stable or slowly improving pneumonia, especially in the presence of comorbidities or host factors that are known to delay the resolution of pneumonia, careful observation with or without therapy is warranted for four to eight weeks. If there is no resolution or progression of disease, a more aggressive diagnostic approach is appropriate [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. </p><p>If further evaluation is necessary, it should include appropriate basic laboratory studies as used in initial diagnosis and a chest computed tomography (CT) to look for sequestered areas of infection or for findings that suggest an alternative diagnosis. When pneumonia fails to resolve or when there is clinical progression, bronchoscopy should be considered. Patients with a negative bronchoscopic examination have a good chance of merely having a slowly resolving pneumonia, particularly if they are smokers or over age 55. Diseases not readily or typically diagnosed with bronchoscopy include pulmonary vasculitis syndromes, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, and diffuse alveolar damage of various etiologies. With a worsening chest radiograph and progressive symptoms accompanied by a negative bronchoscopy, further evaluation with thoracoscopic or open lung biopsy may be necessary  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef52895" href="/d/graphic/52895.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H872801849"><span class="h2">Imaging studies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial diagnosis of pneumonia will generally have been made on a chest radiograph. Three general patterns can be seen: (1) focal segmental or lobar, (2) multifocal, and (3) focal or diffuse interstitial changes, each with a different differential diagnosis [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. </p><p>CT can more accurately define areas of ground glass opacity, consolidation, and air bronchograms and is the primary radiographic tool for assessing treatment failure of a presumed pneumonia. Compared with conventional chest radiography, high-resolution chest CT allows superior detection of underlying parenchymal abnormalities, including emphysema, airspace disease, interstitial disease, and nodules. Such findings may narrow the differential diagnosis or suggest reasons for resolution failure. Chest CT also detects sequestered foci of infection, such as lung abscess and empyema, and helps direct biopsy procedures. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6988.html" rel="external">"High resolution computed tomography of the lungs"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3658083823"><span class="h2">Bronchoscopy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The relative ease and low risk of bronchoscopy make this the primary diagnostic procedure to obtain specimens from patients with a wide spectrum of possible infectious and noninfectious etiologies of nonresolving or progressive pneumonia. However, despite the frequency of its use for this indication, there are few studies that document the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy for nonresolving pneumonia.</p><p>Objective data suggest that bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy can successfully diagnose approximately 90 percent of patients who eventually have a specific diagnosis established [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. It is most likely to be useful in younger nonsmoking patients with multilobar involvement and prolonged disease, whereas older adult patients, smokers, and those with immunodeficiency are more likely to have a nondiagnostic bronchoscopy and to have a slowly resolving pneumonia [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. In a study in an Indian population, bronchoscopy found pyogenic infection to be the most common cause of nonresolving pneumonia (53 percent), followed by bronchogenic cancer (27 percent), and tuberculosis (17 percent) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. However, causes of nonresolving pneumonia vary considerably with geography. Bronchoscopy is particularly useful to exclude mycobacteria or fungi if not detected with expectorated sputum [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Bronchoalveolar lavage may be useful in identifying noninfectious cause of nonresolving pneumonia, such as acute or chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. Similarly, if there is concurrent mediastinal lymphadenopathy and sarcoidosis is in the differential diagnosis, endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial needle aspiration will be useful [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef52895" href="/d/graphic/52895.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H764726755"><span class="h2">Thoracoscopic or open lung biopsy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several factors need to be considered when deciding to proceed to a more invasive biopsy procedure, such as thoracoscopic or open lung biopsy. A previous nondiagnostic bronchoscopy, concern about the specific patient's risk or ability to tolerate bronchoscopy, or the need for obtaining larger specimens of tissue for certain diagnoses may all support the need for proceeding to thoracoscopic or open lung biopsy  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef52895" href="/d/graphic/52895.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">INFLUENCE OF SPECIFIC BACTERIAL PATHOGENS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The rate of clinical and radiologic resolution of bacterial pneumonia varies depending on the specific bacterial pathogen. It should be noted that the empiric approach to treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) suggested by most guidelines can result in failure to treat appropriately when pneumonia is the result of less common pathogens, like anaerobes and fungi.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because pneumococcal pneumonia represents the most common cause of CAP, it also is responsible for most cases of nonresolving pneumonia syndromes that are due to infection. In normal individuals without predisposing illness, clinical improvement is relatively rapid and precedes radiographic improvement. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7013.html" rel="external">"Pneumococcal pneumonia in patients requiring hospitalization"</a>.)</p><p>Risk factors for delayed resolution of auscultatory findings and fever include more severe presentation, multilobar disease, and infection with drug-resistant organisms. (See <a class="local">'Resistant bacterial pathogens'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7031.html" rel="external">"Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adults in the outpatient setting"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7027.html" rel="external">"Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adults who require hospitalization"</a>.)</p><p>Radiographic improvement is often much slower, with 20 to 30 percent of patients demonstrating no radiographic improvement after one week. Initial worsening of the chest radiograph is common. Risk factors for delayed radiographic resolution include bacteremia, persistent fever or leukocytosis beyond six days, advanced age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alcoholism, and HIV.</p><p>Radiographic clearing occurs by one to three months in nonbacteremic cases and three to five months in bacteremic cases. Residual radiographic abnormalities are rare in nonbacteremic cases but are present in up to 35 percent of bacteremic cases [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Legionella infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many of the risk factors for development of <em>Legionella</em> are also risk factors for delayed resolution. These include cigarette smoking, alcoholism, age greater than 65 years, immunosuppression (especially glucocorticoid use), chronic kidney disease, and hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplantation. As a result, the rate of resolution for <em>Legionella</em> infection is usually slower than for other organisms [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7035.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of <i>Legionella </i>infection"</a>.)</p><p>Radiographic, but not necessarily clinical, deterioration despite treatment is common, occurring in up to two-thirds of patients with <em>Legionella</em>, compared with 4 percent of patients with nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia. In addition, after this initial deterioration, resolution is slow, with clearing beginning only after two to three weeks and approximately one-half of patients demonstrating residual abnormalities at 10 weeks. Resolution may take as long as 6 to 12 months, and residual fibrosis may be evident in up to 25 percent of patients.</p><p>In addition to the slowly resolving or residual radiographic abnormalities, patients may experience generalized weakness and fatigue for months. Residual abnormalities on pulmonary function testing may be seen as long as two years later.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Mycoplasma pneumoniae</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><em>M. pneumoniae</em> is a common cause of respiratory tract infection but a rare cause of severe pneumonia. Resolution is typically rapid and faster than that with other types of pneumonia [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Significant clinical improvement usually occurs within the first two weeks, which may in part reflect the predominantly young and otherwise healthy population affected.</p><p>Radiographic deterioration after treatment is rare, occurring in less than 25 percent of cases. The average duration of radiographic abnormalities is two to four weeks, depending upon the use of antibiotics. Forty percent have complete radiographic resolution at four weeks and 90 percent at eight weeks. Residual radiographic abnormalities are distinctly unusual. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6989.html" rel="external">"<i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> infection in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Chlamydia pneumoniae</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><em>Chlamydia pneumoniae</em> infection is an uncommon cause of pneumonia, but it has been implicated in outbreaks of pneumonia in residents of long-term care facilities and military recruits. It is a relatively mild disease, and mortality is rare [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Prompt resolution is the rule in younger patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7036.html" rel="external">"Pneumonia caused by <i>Chlamydia pneumoniae</i> in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Radiographic deterioration is uncommon, with clearing typically occurring in less than three months. Fifty percent of chest radiographs clear within four weeks, while up to 20 percent take longer than nine weeks. Residual radiographic abnormalities persist in 10 to 20 percent of cases. Much information regarding <em>Chlamydia</em> resolution is derived from observations of patients with psittacosis [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Haemophilus influenzae</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> is commonly considered a cause of pneumonia, especially in older adults, in cigarette smokers, and in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. However, several large series following the widespread use of conjugate vaccines against <em>H. influenzae</em> type b in children have shown a decreasing incidence of infection and a shift to nontypeable strains compared with the more invasive type b infection [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8048.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i>"</a>.)</p><p>The natural history of <em>H. influenzae</em> infection has not been well studied, but there do not appear to be any unique features regarding its resolution. Based on the propensity for the organism to infect the immunocompromised and older adults, resolution is often slow, with many patients having prolonged hospitalization. Only 50 percent of patients return to their previous level of function by six weeks [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1879111970"><span class="h1">COVID-19</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Persistent illness following COVID-19 is also discussed separately.

Particularly important pathogens in this category include mycobacteria (either <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> or atypical mycobacteria), fungi, <em>Nocardia</em>, and <em>Actinomyces</em>.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Tuberculosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Tuberculosis is of significant concern, especially in older adult patients and in those who have immigrated within the past five years, those who have a history of intravenous drug use, and those who have other risk factors for AIDS.</p><p>The clinical presentation of tuberculosis as a cause of nonresolving pneumonia is often atypical, especially in diabetics and in older adult patients, who commonly have radiographic findings in the middle or lower lung zones. Diagnosis may be difficult as sputum is not always available and culture results take weeks after the specimen is obtained. Polymerase chain reaction testing has been approved for smear-positive specimens to allow confirmation of tuberculous disease, but its role in smear-negative cases is uncertain.
