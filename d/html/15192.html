In general, requirements for good access vessels include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Proximity of the artery to the skin</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diameter sufficient to accept the planned interventional sheath</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The ability to provide adequate pressure at the completion of the procedure to aid with hemostasis of the puncture site</p><p></p><p>Suitable vessels commonly used for access are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Specific access sites'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3006155222"><span class="h2">By location of arterial pathology</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lower extremity</strong> – For most lower extremity percutaneous procedures, the common femoral artery is selected, using either an antegrade or retrograde (up and over the aortic bifurcation) approach. Depending on patient anatomy (eg, occluded contralateral iliac system) and planned procedure, access via the upper extremity may also be considered using brachial or radial arterial access. (See <a class="local">'Common femoral artery'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15217.html" rel="external">"Endovascular techniques for lower extremity revascularization", section on 'Arterial access'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Iliac vessels</strong> – Similarly, for most iliac artery interventions (eg, iliac stenting, iliac aneurysm stent-grafting, iliac embolization), femoral access is most commonly used. This can be either retrograde on the ipsilateral side of the lesion or antegrade (up and over the aortic bifurcation) from the contralateral side. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15705.html" rel="external">"Surgical and endovascular repair of iliac artery aneurysm"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15217.html" rel="external">"Endovascular techniques for lower extremity revascularization", section on 'Arterial access'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Abdominal aorta</strong> – For the abdominal aorta, femoral access is selected; however, on occasion dual access using a combined femoral and brachial access approach may be used. This can be helpful in patients undergoing fenestrated endovascular repair or those receiving renal or visceral stents in the same setting as the abdominal aortic repair. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15203.html" rel="external">"Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm", section on 'Vascular access'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mesenteric/renal vessels</strong> – Brachial artery access is appealing for interventions on the mesenteric vessels because of the often-downward angle of these arteries from the aorta (particularly the superior mesenteric artery). Depending on the anatomy, these mesenteric/renal vessels may also be approached from femoral access, particularly if steerable sheaths are used. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15709.html" rel="external">"Surgical and endovascular techniques for mesenteric revascularization", section on 'Endovascular techniques'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thoracic aorta</strong> – Femoral artery access is usually selected. Historically, large diameter access sheaths were required for these procedures, which necessitated open cutdown. However, later-generation, lower-profile devices and percutaneous closure techniques have allowed this procedure to be performed percutaneously as well. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8191.html" rel="external">"Endovascular repair of the thoracic aorta", section on 'Vascular access'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Upper extremity</strong> – A femoral access site can be used; however, intervention on the more distal vasculature may be limited by the length of available catheters. Proximal lesions (such as the subclavian artery) may be treated in a retrograde fashion from the brachial artery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Carotid/cerebral</strong> – The femoral artery is often selected; however, the radial artery is increasingly being used. Percutaneous carotid access has been reported but is rarely used given the inability to easily compress the artery due to its location, as well as potentially devastating outcomes with complications. Endovascular procedures that use carotid access more commonly use an open cut-down to allow direct repair of the arterial puncture site. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1104.html" rel="external">"Overview of carotid artery stenting", section on 'Approach to carotid artery stenting'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/108265.html" rel="external">"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Periprocedural and postprocedural management", section on 'Alternative approaches'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Coronary circulation</strong> – A radial access site is often selected to reduce access site complications associated with femoral artery access, though a definitive advantage of one site over another has not been demonstrated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1562.html" rel="external">"Periprocedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention", section on 'Radial artery access'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3747440185"><span class="h2">Lower versus upper extremity access</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As devices have become smaller, some procedures can be performed equally well through either a lower extremity (femoral) or upper extremity access site (brachial, radial). When either lower or upper extremity access is deemed appropriate from a technical standpoint, early studies suggested lower complication rates for radial access compared with femoral access; however, later trials have reported that vascular complications were similar, possibly related to improvements in femoral artery access techniques including the use of ultrasound guidance and micropuncture techniques [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>Based on randomized trials, a radial rather than femoral access site may be preferred for patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [<a href="#rid2">2-7</a>]. This issue is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15358.html" rel="external">"Primary percutaneous coronary intervention in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Periprocedural management", section on 'Radial versus femoral approach'</a>.)</p><p>The risk of stroke comparing lower extremity versus upper extremity sites has also been studied. In one large database review of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, the risk of stroke was lower for radial compared with femoral access (odds ratio 0.33, 95% CI 0.16-0.71); the overall risk of stroke was 0.3 percent [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4066975876"><span class="h1">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Arterial interventions are typically performed in an angiography suite, hybrid operating room, or alternatively using an operating table suitable for radiographic imaging and a portable C-arm fluoroscopy unit.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H160280643"><span class="h2">Positioning and anesthesia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Positioning of the patient depends upon the proposed access site with the appropriate access area prepared and draped. Regardless of the approach, it is important to ensure proper positioning to avoid complications. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94593.html" rel="external">"Patient positioning for surgery and anesthesia in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For femoral artery access, the patient is generally placed supine.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For upper extremity access, the arm is usually abducted and externally rotated.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For popliteal artery access, the patient is placed prone.</p><p></p><p>Depending on the procedure planned, many patients will be given intravenous sedation. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/z/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">Lidocaine</a> injected with a 21-gauge needle is often used to anesthetize the access site. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/102831.html" rel="external">"Considerations for non-operating room anesthesia (NORA)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2260632811"><span class="h2">Dynamic ultrasound guidance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prior to needle access, the selected artery is identified using physical examination using appropriate anatomic landmarks and pulse, combined with imaging techniques such as ultrasound or fluoroscopy.</p><p>Based upon randomized trials, we recommend dynamic ultrasound guidance during needle placement in the artery (any site) rather than using landmark techniques or fluoroscopy techniques alone. Ultrasound reduces bleeding complications (eg, hematoma) and incidental venipunctures and improves first-pass success rates [<a href="#rid9">9-15</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a meta-analysis of five trials (1552 patients), the use of ultrasound reduced the rate of vascular access-related complications compared with using only landmarks (1.9 versus 4.3 percent, odds ratio [OR] 0.44, 95% CI 0.24-0.81) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In an earlier meta-analysis (four trials), ultrasound guidance was associated with 42 percent improvement in the likelihood of first-attempt success (relative risk 1.42, 95% CI 1.01-2.00).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a randomized trial that included 635 patients undergoing femoral access, cannulation success was increased with ultrasound guidance compared with fluoroscopy (93 versus 86 percent), as was first-attempt success (74 versus 42 percent) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Fewer inadvertent venipunctures occurred in the ultrasound group (2 versus 10 percent). However, complication rates for ultrasound guidance versus fluoroscopy were similar at 24 hours (1 and 1 percent) and nonsignificantly less at 30 to 90 days (4 and 2 percent, respectively).</p><p></p><p>Ultrasound also helps identify aberrant anatomy, small vessel size, and calcified or diseased segments of the artery to avoid and ensures that the access site is at a location that will allow for adequate compression following completion of the procedure. </p><p>Despite results showing benefits for ultrasound guidance, it is underused. In a review of over 43,000 procedures across the 18 Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) regions, the average rate of ultrasound usage was 71 percent [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. A higher use of ultrasound-guided access was associated with significantly fewer access site complications.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H110021573"><span class="h2">Access needle and initial sheath placement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Percutaneous arterial access is initially obtained with an arterial access needle, either an 18- or 21-gauge hollow beveled needle through which a wire is placed after the artery is accessed. An 18-gauge needle will accommodate a 0.035-inch guidewire, while a 21-gauge needle is typically used with a 0.018-inch guidewire. </p><p>Because of the lower profile of the wire, a 21-gauge needle is often referred to as a micropuncture needle  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116598" href="/z/d/graphic/116598.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). Use of these smaller needles and wires lowers vascular complication rates when compared with standard needles [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. </p><p>After access is obtained under direct ultrasound guidance (see <a class="local">'Dynamic ultrasound guidance'</a> above), the wire is advanced through the needle into the artery, and the needle is removed to allow placement of a sheath with its dilator over the wire. With micropuncture access, a micropuncture 4 or 5 Fr sheath and introducer are used, which then allows for exchange to a 0.035-inch wire and placement of a standard (working) sheath. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For extremity and peripheral artery work, these sheaths usually range in size from 5 to 7 Fr. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For thoracic or abdominal aortic procedures, sheath sizes ranging from 16 to 24 Fr may be used. </p><p></p><p>For sheath sizes larger than 8 Fr, a suture-mediated percutaneous closure device is commonly used. (See <a class="local">'Vascular closure devices'</a> below.)</p><p>The dilator is removed, and the sheath is flushed with heparinized <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a>.

The medial border is formed by the adductor longus muscle medially, and the lateral border is formed by the sartorius muscle. Because the inguinal ligament is not seen with angiography, the inferior epigastric artery is frequently used as a marker for the origin of the common femoral artery. The femoral head lies posterior to the femoral triangle and may be identified radiologically at the time of access and is useful as a point against which to compress the artery at the completion of the procedure.

In a large database study comparing antegrade and retrograde femoral access, no significant differences were reported for hematoma formation, reintervention, or access site occlusion [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Regardless of approach, the ideal location for arterial puncture is the middle of the vessel cephalad to the origin of the profunda femoris artery and caudal to the inguinal ligament. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Retrograde</strong> – A retrograde approach provides access to the ipsilateral iliac arteries and the aorta and also allows the operator to select the contralateral iliac artery to perform interventions on the contralateral lower extremity via an "up and over" technique  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef119075" href="/z/d/graphic/119075.html" rel="external">image 1</a>).

While visualization is limited to the common femoral artery and below, this approach provides a mechanical advantage with more "pushability" of devices by providing a more stable platform for intervention; shortens the access-to-target distance, which may extend the treatment zone of shorter-length device catheters in tall patients; and allows treatment of patients with anatomic considerations that preclude retrograde access [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. This may include a complete contralateral iliac occlusion, prior kissing iliac stents or endovascular aneurysm repair, or a scarred groin from previous access. (See <a class="local">'Antegrade approach'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>For either approach, the patient's bilateral groins are prepared and draped, and the operator stands on the side of the bed with which they are most comfortable. If right-handed, this is often to the patient's right (if retrograde access) or left (if antegrade access), as it allows use of the dominant hand in a forehand technique for arterial puncture. Conversely, standing ipsilateral to the artery being punctured provides the benefit of standing closer to the access site.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1150014234"><span class="h4">Retrograde approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The location of the inguinal ligament is identified by bony landmarks (pubic tubercle medially and anterior superior iliac spine laterally), and the pulse is palpated below this point. The point of maximal pulsation has been shown to be associated with the common femoral artery in over 90 percent of patients [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. If the femoral pulse cannot be easily palpated, the course of the vessel is typically halfway between the pubic symphysis and the anterior superior iliac spine and is identified using ultrasound.</p><p>The femoral head may be identified radiologically and marked on the skin, and using a vascular linear array probe, the artery is interrogated at this location. The use of ultrasound allows identification of the profunda femoris artery as well as any anterior arterial plaque that may hinder easy access. A location on the common femoral artery is identified with ultrasound that is cephalad to the profunda femoris artery and caudal to the inguinal ligament, ideally with a soft anterior arterial wall free of plaque. Access to the central portion of the common femoral artery is critical, as low, high-middle, and high femoral punctures have been associated with greater than 70 percent of vascular access complications [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p>The operator must estimate the distance from the planned access site and the puncture site of the skin. A steep needle angle may provide the additional force needed to puncture a scarred or calcified vessel, but the wire may not track easily through the needle. Conversely, a needle placed in a shallower trajectory may be deflected by the vessel, particularly if calcified, resulting in access failure. As such, a good rule of thumb is to plan access with the needle held at approximately 45 degrees. Under ultrasound guidance, the needle tip is identified anterior to the planned puncture site on the common femoral artery, which is entered under direct ultrasound vision.</p><p>Once the tip of the needle is identified within the lumen of the vessel and there is return of blood through the needle hub, a 0.018 guidewire with floppy tip is advanced through the needle into the common femoral artery. The wire should pass freely with minimal resistance and should not be forced if resistance is felt. Fluoroscopy should identify the wire in a path consistent with the external iliac artery. The skin is next incised with scalpel to a size consistent with the final planned sheath size, and a 4 or 5 French micropuncture catheter with dilator is advanced over the wire. The dilator is removed, and pulsatile bleeding should be noted from the microcatheter. A medium-stiff flexible wire with a floppy or J-tip is then advanced through the microcatheter, which is removed with gentle pressure over the arterial access site, and then the working sheath with its dilator is placed over this wire. The dilator is removed, and the sheath is flushed with heparinized <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a>. An access arteriogram may be performed at this time to identify the puncture site of the common femoral artery. This is performed by rotating the c-arm ipsilateral to the side of access and deflecting the sheath to the contralateral side, which allows identification of the profunda femoris artery as well as the entry point of the sheath in relation to the femoral head.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3032681873"><span class="h4">Antegrade approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Identification of bony landmarks and ultrasound identification of the common femoral artery is performed as with retrograde approach. The skin access site is typically cephalad to the inguinal ligament to allow puncture of the common femoral artery at its midportion based on access using a 45-degree needle angle. Use of a micropuncture catheter followed by working sheath is done in the same manner as above. Because of its posterior direction off the common femoral artery, the microwire often preferentially enters the profunda femoris artery rather than the superficial femoral artery. In this event, the wire should be manipulated under radiologic guidance into the superficial femoral artery before placement of the micropuncture catheter. Placing the image intensifier into ipsilateral oblique orientation, obtaining a roadmap image through the needle with contrast, or using a directional catheter may help achieve this goal.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1938940232"><span class="h2">Brachial artery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The brachial artery can be used to reach targets in the arm or the chest, abdomen, lower extremities via the aorta, and occasionally, the distal upper extremity. Brachial artery access is particularly appealing for interventions on the mesenteric vessels given the often-downward angle at which these arteries (particularly the superior mesenteric artery) originate from the aorta.</p><p>The location of brachial access affects the rate of complications. Distal brachial artery access is associated with lower rates of hematoma and subsequent nerve compression compared with more proximal access. While a distal brachial approach is acceptable for percutaneous access using small sheaths, as sheath size increases to &gt;5 Fr, the risk of complications increases, doubling for 6 and 7 Fr sheaths [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Often for more complex procedures and fenestrated devices, a large sheath is necessary (12 Fr), which will limit the distal brachial approach, as the artery generally is not large enough to accommodate the larger sheaths. In these situations, judicious use of brachial artery cutdown can be performed; however, even with open brachial artery access, there is still risk for brachial sheath hematoma [<a href="#rid21">21-23</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15202.html" rel="external">"Access-related complications of percutaneous access for diagnostic or interventional procedures", section on 'Axillary/brachial sheath hematoma'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Brachial artery anatomy</strong> – The brachial artery is the main artery supplying the upper extremity and is the continuation of the axillary artery  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55334" href="/z/d/graphic/55334.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) beyond the border of teres major muscle. The brachial artery is anatomically related to the median nerve. Proximally, the median nerve is lateral to the brachial artery; however, the median nerve crosses medially and lies anterior to the brachial artery at the elbow  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82540" href="/z/d/graphic/82540.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The nerve artery and vein are bounded by the relatively rigid brachial sheath. Bleeding within this space (ie, brachial sheath hematoma) can result in nerve compression with profound neurologic deficits. In the antecubital fossa, the brachial artery divides into the radial and ulnar arteries, which run through the forearm. In some individuals (8 to 15 percent), the artery bifurcates earlier in the course, resulting in radial and ulnar arteries that originate above the antecubital fossa of the arm [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Technique</strong> – The brachial artery is typically accessed a few centimeters cephalad to the antecubital fossa.

Care should be taken to avoid entry into a high radial artery takeoff in this location in patients with aberrant anatomy.

Access into small brachial or radial arteries can increase the risk of complications.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">At the completion of imaging/intervention, it is important to check the activated clotting time (ACT) and let it normalize or reverse heparin anticoagulation with protamine at the time of sheath removal, as it has been shown that protamine may be protective against access site complications at this location [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Hemostasis is often achieved with manual compression, although this may be complicated by thrombosis if a small brachial artery is completely occluded from excessive pressure or there is compression of the artery due to a brachial sheath hematoma or pseudoaneurysm formation from inadequate pressure. The adequateness of manual pressure can be checked by placing continuous pulse oximetry on the ipsilateral hand or by performing intermittent pulse checks of the radial artery. Given the risk of brachial sheath hematoma and difficulties with holding pressure on the arm, for a sheath size &gt;6 Fr, some providers will routinely cut down on the brachial artery and fix the puncture site surgically with interrupted suture closure.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3466063848"><span class="h2">Radial artery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The radial artery is frequently used for coronary diagnostic and interventional procedures and is often selected due to its ease of hemostasis and minimal risk of bleeding.

Based upon such observations, radial artery catheterization is usually not performed in patients with an abnormal modified Allen test. However, the results of the modified Allen test can be altered by several factors, including overextension of the wrist, skin tension over the ulnar artery, and operator error. As a result, an appreciable number of false positive and false negative results have been reported [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

(See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>General characteristics</strong> – Suitable access sites are those with good proximity of the artery to the skin, sufficient diameter to accept the planned interventional sheath, and tissue (usually bone) against which to provide adequate compression to aid with hemostasis at the completion of the procedure. (See <a class="local">'Site selection'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ultrasound</strong> <strong>guidance</strong> – When equipment and expertise are available, we recommend dynamic ultrasound guidance during needle placement in the artery, rather than using landmark techniques or fluoroscopy alone (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). When compared with the use of anatomic landmarks or fluoroscopy, ultrasound reduces complications, including bleeding, hematomas, and incidental venipunctures and improves first-pass success. (See <a class="local">'Dynamic ultrasound guidance'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Specific access sites</strong> – The access site is selected based upon the location of the pathology being treated and the planned procedure. (See <a class="local">'By location of arterial pathology'</a> above and <a class="local">'Specific access sites'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Common femoral artery</strong> – The common femoral artery is selected for most percutaneous cerebrovascular, aortic, visceral, lower extremity, and proximal upper extremity procedures. Access can be retrograde (directed toward the head) or antegrade (directed toward the feet). For vascular lesions below the knee, antegrade access provides a more stable platform, shortens the access-to-target distance, and extends treatment to patients in whom retrograde access is not possible (eg, iliac occlusion).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Brachial artery</strong> – Distal brachial artery access is often selected for mesenteric procedures given the often downward angle at which these arteries (particularly the superior mesenteric artery) originate from the aorta. The diameter of sheath the brachial artery can accommodate is limited to 5 Fr. The risk of complications increases for larger sheaths. Brachial sheath hematoma is a serious complication at this access site that can lead to nerve dysfunction. (See <a class="local">'Brachial artery'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Radial artery</strong> – The radial artery is commonly used for percutaneous cardiac procedures, particularly intervention, and is increasing in popularity for peripheral procedures. The radial artery is associated with lower rates of local complications; however, vasospasm is an issue occurring in up to 20 percent of cases and can lead to radial artery thrombosis. Administration of intra-arterial vasodilators and heparin and use of hydrophilic sheaths have been used to help prevent spasm and thrombosis. (See <a class="local">'Radial artery'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Popliteal artery</strong> – Popliteal access is useful for patients in whom retrograde or antegrade common femoral artery access has been unsuccessful (eg, flush superficial femoral artery lesion). The popliteal artery should ideally be larger than 5 mm in diameter and have no calcification. Advantages of this approach include increased support and a mechanical advantage, particularly for crossing complete occlusions, because of the proximity of the access to the lesion(s) of interest. (See <a class="local">'Popliteal artery'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Pedal arteries</strong> – Pedal access is useful when access at other sites has been unsuccessful. This occurs predominantly with attempts to cross long-segment, heavily calcified chronic total lower extremity occlusions. (See <a class="local">'Pedal artery access'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Postprocedure hemostasis</strong> – Hemostasis at the completion of the percutaneous procedure can be obtained using compression at the access site or by using a closure device. The use of a closure device has not been proven to reduce access site complications; however, the duration of compression and time to ambulation are both reduced. (See <a class="local">'Hemostasis at the access site'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Le May M, Wells G, So D, et al.
