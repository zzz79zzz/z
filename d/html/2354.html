In healthy individuals, the ingestion of water does not lead to hyponatremia because suppressed release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also called vasopressin, allows excess water to be excreted in a dilute urine  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65195" href="/z/d/graphic/65195.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Renal water excretion is impaired in most patients who develop hyponatremia, usually due to an inability to suppress ADH secretion. An uncommon exception occurs in psychotic patients with primary polydipsia who drink such large quantities of fluid that, despite appropriately suppressed ADH release, the excretory capacity of the kidney is overwhelmed.</p><p>The diagnostic approach to the patient with hyponatremia will be reviewed here. Many patients with hyponatremia have a single cause, but multiple factors sometimes contribute to the fall in plasma sodium. As an example, when a patient infected with HIV becomes hyponatremic, volume depletion, the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH), and adrenal insufficiency all may be present. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2375.html" rel="external">"Electrolyte disturbances with HIV infection"</a>.)</p><p>The causes and treatment of hyponatremia are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2374.html" rel="external">"Causes of hypotonic hyponatremia in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115534.html" rel="external">"Causes of hyponatremia without hypotonicity (including pseudohyponatremia)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2350.html" rel="external">"Overview of the treatment of hyponatremia in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2357.html" rel="external">"Treatment of hyponatremia: Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and reset osmostat"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3488890347"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF THE DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The evaluation of hyponatremia should follow a logical progression, answering several key questions. The first step is to determine if the patient has pseudohyponatremia, hypertonic hyponatremia, or isotonic hyponatremia, rather than hypotonic hyponatremia. (See <a class="local">'Patients with potentially normal or elevated plasma tonicity'</a> below.)</p><p>Once it has been determined that the patient has hypotonic hyponatremia (as is usually the case), the next step is to determine its cause. (See <a class="local">'Patients with hypotonic hyponatremia'</a> below.)</p><p>Because most patients with hypotonic hyponatremia are unable to excrete water normally, the cause of impaired water excretion should be evaluated:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) severely reduced?

Water can freely cross almost all cell membranes through aquaporin channels and moves from an area of lower tonicity (higher water content) to an area of higher tonicity (lower water content). Tonicity is not readily measured but is deduced from other laboratory measurements. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115534.html" rel="external">"Causes of hyponatremia without hypotonicity (including pseudohyponatremia)"</a>.)</p><p>The main difference between tonicity and osmolality is that tonicity reflects the concentration of solutes that do not easily cross cell membranes (mostly sodium salts with a small contribution from glucose) and therefore affect the movement of water between cells and the extracellular fluid. By contrast, osmolality also includes the osmotic contributions of urea and (if present) ethanol or other alcohols or glycols, which are considered "ineffective" osmoles since they can equilibrate across the cell membrane and therefore have little effect on water movement. (See <a class="local">'Ineffective osmoles'</a> below.)</p><p>Hyperglycemia is a common cause of hypertonic hyponatremia. In patients with normal serum glucose, or in those whose serum sodium remains low after correcting for hyperglycemia, the serum osmolality should be measured if other causes of isotonic or hypertonic hyponatremia are suspected. As noted, such patients include (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115534.html" rel="external">"Causes of hyponatremia without hypotonicity (including pseudohyponatremia)"</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients who have had recent transurethral prostate surgery or recent hysteroscopy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients who were recently prescribed <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9587" href="/z/d/drug information/9587.html" rel="external">mannitol</a>, glycerol, or intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with lipemic serum</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with obstructive jaundice</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with a known or suspected plasma cell dyscrasia</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1563385316"><span class="h3">Ineffective osmoles</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The measured serum osmolality can sometimes be misleading, suggesting a diagnosis of hypertonic hyponatremia or isotonic hyponatremia in a patient who instead has hypotonic hyponatremia. This most commonly occurs with:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Azotemia – Patients with advanced kidney disease may develop hyponatremia because their reduced kidney function impairs their ability to excrete excess water. Although the low serum sodium concentration will tend to lower the serum osmolality, this effect is counterbalanced to a variable degree by azotemia, which increases the osmolality. Thus, the measured osmolality may be normal or elevated. However, despite the fact that high urea concentrations raise the osmolality, they do not increase tonicity.

The urine sodium concentration is usually above 40 mEq/L in patients with the SIADH who are normovolemic and whose rate of sodium excretion is determined by sodium intake, as it is in normal individuals [<a href="#rid5">5,15,16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">SIADH is frequently associated with hypouricemia (serum uric acid concentration that is less than 4 mg/dL or 238 micromol/L) due to increased urinary uric acid clearance [<a href="#rid15">15,17-19</a>], and low blood urea nitrogen (BUN that is less than 5 mg/dL or 1.8 mmol/L) due to increased urea clearance [<a href="#rid18">18,20</a>]. Increased uric acid clearance can be identified in a spot urine sample by a high fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA &gt;10 to 12 percent); in two relatively small studies, an FEUA &lt;8 percent excluded SIADH with 100 percent specificity [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">It is presumed that increased clearance of uric acid and urea results from water retention and volume expansion in the SIADH. However, stimulation of the vasopressin V1a receptor (which primarily causes vasoconstriction) may also contribute via an uncertain mechanism.

However, not all patients with SIADH have hypouricemia and low BUN, and therefore, the absence of these findings does <strong>not</strong> exclude the diagnosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Calculation of the FEUA before and after correction of hyponatremia has been proposed as a way of distinguishing SIADH from cerebral salt wasting [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. According to this theory, before correction of hyponatremia, FEUA is &gt;11 percent in both SIADH and salt wasting. Conversely, after correction of hyponatremia, an FEUA that remains &gt;11 percent is said to indicate salt wasting, caused by impaired proximal tubule sodium reabsorption, whereas an FEUA &lt;11 percent identifies patients with SIADH. However, serial measurements of FEUA have not been validated with a consistent, rigorous, and convincing gold standard for identifying salt wasting [<a href="#rid23">23-25</a>]. For this reason, the diagnostic validity of these measurements is unproven. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The fractional excretion of urea (FEurea) might also be useful in evaluating patients with hyponatremia and suspected SIADH.

In healthy individuals, the ingestion of water does not lead to hyponatremia because suppressed release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also called vasopressin, allows excess water to be excreted in a dilute urine  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65195" href="/z/d/graphic/65195.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).
