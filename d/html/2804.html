         Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience that affects most aspects of life, including physical functioning, daily activity, psychologic and emotional status, and social life. Pain is a complex symptom and there is substantial heterogeneity in how it is experienced and in how it is manifested  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef129909" href="/z/d/graphic/129909.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         In many cases, the constellation of symptoms and signs can suggest a specific cancer pain syndrome [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The identification of such a syndrome may help to elucidate the etiology of the pain, direct the diagnostic evaluation, clarify the prognosis for the pain or the disease itself, and guide therapeutic intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cancer pain syndromes can be broadly characterized as acute or chronic. Acute pain syndromes usually accompany diagnostic or therapeutic interventions, whereas chronic pain syndromes usually are directly related to the neoplasm itself or to an antineoplastic therapy.
        </p>

         This topic review will provide an overview of acute and chronic cancer pain syndromes. Cancer pain assessment is discussed elsewhere. (See

         Most acute cancer pain syndromes are iatrogenic, ie, related to a diagnostic test or treatment  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79852" href="/z/d/graphic/79852.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. However, some are disease-related, such as pain due to acute hemorrhage into a tumor, bone pain from a pathologic fracture, and visceral pain from acute obstruction or perforation of a hollow structure  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71104" href="/z/d/graphic/71104.html" rel="external">

         Analgesic management of these acute pain syndromes is discussed in the following topics:

         "Breakthrough pain" is typically defined as a transient flare of moderate to severe pain occurring on a background of chronic pain that is adequately controlled by an opioid regimen [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]; this flare of pain is typically short lived and is usually related directly to the cancer, a cancer treatment, or a diagnostic test. The management of breakthrough pain is discussed elsewhere. (See

         used to describe singular events of acute, severe, and longer lasting pain that occur after surgery or after an injury, whether or not the pain is related to the cancer (eg, pathologic bone fracture). The management of this sort of severe acute pain is similar to that for patients who are receiving long-term opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. (See

          Hemorrhage into a tumor
         </strong>
         – The prototype for this type of pain is bleeding into a site of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This is typically accompanied by severe right upper quadrant pain, and is a potentially life-threatening complication, if the tumor ruptures. Urgent intervention for control of bleeding may be needed, in addition to transfusion and pain control. If measures such as transarterial embolization are unsuccessful, emergency surgery may be required. (See

          Pathologic fracture
         </strong>
         – A pathologic fracture is a bone fracture that occurs within a preexisting lesion such as a skeletal metastasis or a primary bone tumor. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Patients describe the sudden onset of back or limb pain, with or without antecedent trauma. Surgical stabilization of long bone fractures, if feasible and consistent with the overall goals of care, may relieve pain and should be considered. Vertebral collapse may be treated conservatively with analgesics or with an intervention, specifically vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty; surgery is typically considered only rarely and typically to address associated neurologic impairment. Radiation therapy (RT) is usually considered for all pathologic fractures and often augments pain control over a period of weeks or longer. (See

         The most common acute painful disorder associated with antineoplastic therapy is oral mucositis [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Many types of systemic chemotherapy can result in this complication, as can radiation to the head and neck region. Chemotherapy-associated mucositis can affect the mucosa throughout the entire gastrointestinal tract, but pain most often results from oral mucositis (stomatitis). Oral mucositis typically becomes clinically evident during the first week after chemotherapy administration and evolves over weeks after the start of fractionated RT. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1152.html" rel="external">

         High doses of chemotherapy that are part of a conditioning regimen for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation cause noninfectious mucositis in approximately 70 percent of patients by killing cells with high mitotic rates. Ulceration of the oropharyngeal mucosa begins several days following initiation of the conditioning regimen. Initial symptoms may consist of mild or moderate burning discomfort, but this often progresses to the point where mucositis interferes with talking, eating, and swallowing. Significant pain requiring opioid use persists in one-half of patients at three weeks after transplant. (See

         Mucositis develops in nearly all patients receiving RT to the head and neck region. RT-induced mucositis is similar qualitatively to that induced by chemotherapy. It usually develops two to three weeks after starting treatment. The Incidence and severity of RT-induced mucositis depend on the field, total dose and duration of RT, and the use of concomitant chemotherapy.

The syndrome is usually self-limited but may cause persistent pain or dysfunction. Newer methods of RT appear to have substantially reduced the incidence of this condition. (See

         Patients undergoing abdominal irradiation may experience cramping, nausea, and vomiting (radiation enteritis). The corresponding syndrome in those receiving pelvic irradiation (radiation proctitis) includes painful tenesmus with diarrhea, mucus discharge, and bleeding. Newer RT methods such as 3D-CRT have reduced the incidence and severity of these painful syndromes, but they have not eliminated the risk of bowel toxicity when the RT field includes the intestinal viscera.

         Symptoms can occur within hours after the onset of RT, but they more often develop several weeks into therapy.

At present, they are classified according to the putative mechanism (ie, tumor related, treatment related) and the underlying pathophysiology (ie, nociceptive [somatic, visceral] or neuropathic). Consensus-based core diagnostic criteria for several cancer-related pain syndromes, specifically bone pain, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatic cancer-related pain, have been published [

         Bone metastases are the most prevalent cause of chronic pain in cancer patients. Skeletal metastases are a common manifestation of distant disease spread from many types of solid cancers, especially those arising in the lung, breast, and prostate. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91912.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The pain associated with bone metastases may be due to direct invasion, secondary pathologic fracture, or damage to adjacent structures. Although the factors that convert a painless to a painful bone metastasis are not known, it is now well accepted that bone pain, once established, has both inflammatory and neuropathic components [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. The neuropathic component is presumably induced by direct nerve injury and consequent pathologic sprouting of both sensory and sympathetic nerve fibers [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. Presumably, some combination of these neural changes, the complex perineural release of growth factors and/or chemical mediators, and mechanical distortion related to microfracture culminates in bone pain. Diagnostic criteria for cancer-induced bone pain have been developed  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef114495" href="/z/d/graphic/114495.html" rel="external">
          table 9

        </p>
        <p>
         Local field external beam radiation therapy (RT) is a well-recognized and effective palliative modality for painful bone metastases; pain relief is seen in 80 to 90 percent of cases. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2805.html" rel="external">
          "Radiation therapy for the management of painful bone metastases"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the majority of patients with multifocal bone pain have widespread bony metastases, hematologic malignancies can rarely produce painful bone marrow expansion [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. This is presumably caused by nests of rapidly growing cells in the marrow.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, a rare paraneoplastic form of renal phosphate wasting called oncogenic osteomalacia can cause osteomalacia, multifocal bone pain, and fractures [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. This rare syndrome is most often associated with mesenchymal neoplasms, and complete tumor removal can lead to rapid correction of the biochemical derangements, remineralization of bone, and symptom improvement. (See

         Neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression (ESCC) is a common complication of solid tumors [

         ]. Most often, ESCC is caused by posterior extension of a vertebral body metastasis into the epidural space  (

          figure 1

         ). ESCC almost always presents initially as back or neck pain. Untreated, tumor growth may eventually cause irreversible loss of neurologic function. Because pain usually precedes neurologic impairment by weeks or months, it is crucial to diagnose epidural disease extension in patients when pain is the sole complaint so that effective treatment may be started to prevent or retard the progression of neurologic impairment.

         In patients with metastatic disease, worsening spine pain, pain described as worse when recumbent, pain that develops in a radicular distribution (eg, around the chest wall or into the arm or leg), or pain associated with a neurologic symptom or sign typically indicates the need for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Total spine MRI is the preferred approach to evaluate for ESCC in the context of metastatic disease. (See

         For most patients, RT represents first-line definitive treatment for ESCC. Although multiple fraction RT has been considered the standard of care, there is no evidence that outcomes are better among those with advanced illness than those obtained with single-fraction therapy [

          18

         ]; a single palliative dose of RT is an option for patients with limited prognosis. Glucocorticoid treatment also is useful to temporarily improve pain and neurologic functioning, often providing a window of time during which RT can be provided. Surgical decompression is considered if the tumor type is typically radioresistant and the lesion is high grade, if the neurologic status is deteriorating during RT, if ESCC occurs in a previously irradiated field, if the lesion is posterior and can be easily extirpated, or if a tissue diagnosis is needed.

          Trigeminal neuralgia
         </strong>
         – A syndrome that mimics idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia may be caused by tumors of the middle or posterior cranial fossa. This pain may be labeled a painful trigeminal neuropathy. However, because it most often presents with "electric shock-like" or stabbing paroxysms that are similar to the symptoms seen in the idiopathic syndrome, it may be called a malignant, or tumor-related, trigeminal neuralgia. If a lesion that involves the trigeminal nerve produces different qualities of pain, such as a constant aching or burning in the face, it is more appropriate to describe the syndrome as a painful trigeminal neuropathy rather than a malignant trigeminal neuralgia. (See

         Many patients with tumor-related trigeminal neuralgia are treated, at least initially, for an idiopathic process. Over time, however, tumor growth leads to symptoms and signs that raise suspicion as to the nature of the disorder (eg, change in the quality of the pain or the development of neurologic deficits on examination) [

         Any malignant process that compresses, distorts, or inflames nerve roots may cause a painful radiculopathy. If multiple nerve roots are affected, it is called a polyradiculopathy. A painful radiculopathy may result from leptomeningeal metastases, intradural tumor (particularly meningioma, neurofibroma, and ependymoma) or tumor in the epidural space. The latter situation is most common and may arise via posterior extension of a tumor from a vertebral body metastasis, or growth into the intervertebral foramen from a paraspinal site of disease  (

        <p>
         Radicular pain may be continuous or intermittent, aching or sharp, or dysesthetic (eg, burning or electrical-like) in quality; it may or may not be associated with neurologic signs. When located in the thoracic level and bilateral in distribution, the pain may be experienced as a tight band across the chest or abdomen, a presentation that signals a relatively high likelihood of associated epidural disease. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         A high index of suspicion for a malignant cause of radiculopathy or polyradiculopathy should lead to a spinal MRI. If the patient has known vertebral metastasis or paraspinal disease, this test can be done without contrast enhancement; if infiltration of nerve roots is suspected, then a study with and without the injection of contrast is more informative.

         Among patients who have been previously treated for a malignancy, the differential diagnosis of a new brachial plexopathy includes recurrent tumor and radiation injury. In the setting of a known neoplasm and RT, distinguishing between cancer recurrence and radiation-induced plexopathy can be challenging. (See

         The diagnosis of neoplastic versus radiation-induced brachial plexopathy is suggested by the symptoms and signs, and electrodiagnostic findings, and is confirmed by imaging, or in some cases, by biopsy. In general, radiation-induced plexopathy is less painful than neoplastic brachial plexopathy; the upper plexus is more commonly involved, there often is relatively intense paresthesias, and radiation changes in the skin and other soft tissues are evident (eg, poikiloderma, telangiectasias, atrophy, hyperpigmentation, and lymphedema). Radiation is less likely to be associated with Horner syndrome than plexopathy related to tumor recurrence.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The diagnosis of a radiation-induced rather than neoplastic plexopathy is supported by the presence of so-called myokymic discharges on electromyography. These are relatively specific for radiation-induced injury, but are not a universal feature, and their absence does not exclude the diagnosis.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         MRI or CT scan of the plexus can usually establish the diagnosis. Occasionally, biopsy is needed. Because tumors adjacent to the spine may be responsible for a brachial plexopathy, MRI of the epidural space may be needed. Imaging of the chest by CT or MRI is most useful to detect a pulmonary tumor.

The symptoms may initially affect one extremity but, in a few weeks or months, they usually progress to involve other extremities, the face, abdomen, or trunk. A severe sensory ataxia may prevent walking or even self-care. In a subset of patients, hyperalgesia and spontaneous pain remain the prominent symptom, and sensory ataxia is mild or even absent. (See

         Well-defined pain syndromes may occur after the surgical excision of cancer. The best characterized include postmastectomy pain syndrome, post-radical neck dissection pain syndrome, post-thoracotomy pain syndrome, postoperative frozen shoulder, postsurgery pelvic floor pain, stump and phantom limb pain following amputation, and phantom breast pain  (

         Chronic pain following limb amputation may involve stump pain, phantom pain, or both. Stump pain may be due to neuroma formation several months after amputation, but a poorly fitting prosthesis, recurrent tumor, infection, or ischemia also may contribute [
         <a href="#rid46">

        </p>
        <p>
         Phantom sensation, the sensory experience that the amputated limb is still present, occurs in most amputees. Phantom pain, which is often paroxysmal and atypical, and described by some as an intense twisting or crushing sensation, is also common [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Numerous neurophysiologic explanations for phantom pain have been advanced, from changes at the stump to functional cortical changes. Sensory deafferentation in primates and arm amputation in humans causes cortical somatosensory reorganization; this phenomenon may explain the elicitation of phantom pain by sensory stimulation at other sites [

         Radiation-induced cervical, brachial or lumbosacral plexopathies may occur months to many years after RT [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41,53
         </a>
         ]. The usual presenting signs are weakness and sensory changes. Although they cause pain, it is rarely severe. Chronic perineal pain following pelvic RT is often clinically associated with a sacral plexopathy. The pain is burning in nature and may extend anteriorly to the vagina or scrotum [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The incidence of these syndromes has declined over the years due to lower-dose regimens and better RT techniques. (See

         Chronic radiation myelopathy is another late complication which may develop many years following the completion of RT. Sensory symptoms, including pain, typically precede the development of progressive motor and autonomic dysfunction. The pain is usually characterized as a burning dysesthesia and is localized to the area of spinal cord damage or below this region. The neurologic findings may be consistent with a transverse myelopathy, sometimes in a Brown-Sequard pattern. (See

Small bowel obstruction, strictures, gastroparesis and intestinal pseudo-obstruction (eg, impaired gastrointestinal motility without any anatomical obstruction), fistula formation, gastrointestinal perforation, and bleeding are all late manifestations of radiation toxicity to the gastrointestinal tract, and persistent abdominal pain often complicates these lesions.

         Lymphedema may result from RT to the breast or shoulder, or to the pelvis. The most common symptoms are heaviness, changes in skin, and discomfort or pain. The disorder carries a high burden and recent advances present opportunities to improve prevention and management [

         A cancer pain syndrome is defined as a clinically meaningful constellation of symptoms and signs in a patient with cancer. The identification of a specific pain syndrome in cancer patients may help to elucidate the etiology, help direct the diagnostic evaluation, clarify the prognosis for the pain or the disease itself, and guide subsequent therapeutic interventions.

         Cancer pain syndromes may be broadly divided into those that are acute and those that are chronic. Acute pain syndromes usually accompany diagnostic or therapeutic interventions, although some are directly related to the malignancy itself (eg, hemorrhage into a hepatocellular cancer, pathologic fracture, obstruction or perforation of a bile duct, ureter, or bowel lumen).
