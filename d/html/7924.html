         The surface of every red blood cell (RBC) is coated with antigens (sugars and proteins) that are integrally linked to membrane proteins or lipids. The clinical relevance of these antigens for blood component transfusion and tissue/organ transplantation lies in the ability of these surface molecules to incite an immune response, potentially causing a transfusion reaction or organ/tissue rejection. In addition, some RBC surface antigens have cellular functions with clinical relevance, and others are targets of immune attack in certain infections, as discussed below.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will review clinically relevant RBC antigens and respective antibodies, and settings in which the RBC antigens may be important. Additional discussions of certain clinical issues are presented separately:

          Blood group system

         – A blood group system is a collection of one or more antigens that are under the control of a single gene or a cluster of closely linked, homologous genes [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Forty-three blood group systems are recognized by the International Society for Blood Transfusion [

         ]. The major blood group systems with clinical significance are listed in the table  (

          Blood group antigen
         </strong>
         – A blood group antigen is a sugar or protein present on the surface of the RBC that is defined serologically by reagent antisera that react with the antigen and cause red cell agglutination (eg, blood group A cells are agglutinated by anti-A antibodies)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106903" href="/z/d/graphic/106903.html" rel="external">

         ) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. In cases in which a single nucleotide difference results in two different antigens, the convention is for these to be designated with a superscript (eg, Fy
         <sup>
          a
         </sup>
         , Fy
         <sup>

         Blood type is used clinically in pretransfusion testing, organ/tissue transplantation, evaluation of transfusion reaction, and determining the risk of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). Transfusion-associated hemolytic anemias are associated with certain blood group antigens.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some blood group antigens (or their absence) appear to have been selected during evolution, such as antigen phenotypes that microorganisms cannot use to enter the RBC (see
         <a class="local">
          'Resistance to RBC parasites'
         </a>
         below). Additional information about historical contexts and specific blood groups is presented in several review articles [

         Safe transfusion of RBCs is possible because donor RBC units can be selected for their compatibility with the recipient's blood type. Transfused RBC units do not need to be phenotypically identical to the recipient's RBCs, but they do need to lack antigens that could provoke clinically significant hemolysis in the recipient (eg, a blood group A donor unit cannot be transfused to a blood group O recipient). If an individual develops an alloantibody to an RBC antigen, it is important to avoid transfusing RBCs with that specific antigen, indefinitely.
        </p>
        <p>
         Antibodies to RBC antigens are considered to be clinically significant if they have been shown to lead to clinical events (acute hemolytic transfusion reactions, delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn). Generally, these antibodies are reactive at 37°C and are IgG, with the exception of IgM for ABO antibodies. Antibodies that have not been shown to lead to clinical events are considered clinically insignificant.
        </p>
        <p>
         Incompatibility between a blood transfusion recipient and donor is a cause of potentially serious transfusion reactions. Routine pretransfusion testing for RBC, platelet, and plasma transfusion typically involves determination of ABO and RhD type  (

         <strong>
          RBCs
         </strong>
         – For RBC transfusion, the patient’s RBCs are typed and the patient’s plasma is tested for the presence of antibodies that could cause hemolysis of the transfused blood, such as those directed against antigens in the ABO, Rh, Duffy, Kidd, Kell, MNS, and Lutheran blood groups. Antibodies to additional RBC antigens may be detected during compatibility testing (crossmatching) with a specific unit of blood. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7953.html" rel="external">
          "Pretransfusion testing for red blood cell transfusion", section on 'Serologic testing (type and screen)'

         <strong>
          Platelets
         </strong>
         – Platelets express ABO (but not Rh) antigens on their surface; these ABO antigens are absorbed from the plasma onto the platelet surface. Rarely, an individual may have platelets that express high levels of ABO antigens [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. Most transfusion services monitor platelet transfusions to limit the amount of ABO incompatible plasma administered with the platelet product, and some avoid giving platelets with high titers of anti-A and anti-B to A and B individuals. When RhD-negative women of childbearing age are given platelet transfusions, platelets from RhD-negative donors are used to avoid potential co-transfusion of a small amount of RhD-positive RBCs in the platelet product. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7918.html" rel="external">
          "Platelet transfusion: Indications, ordering, and associated risks", section on 'ABO, Rh, and HLA matching'

         </span>
         <strong>
          Plasma
         </strong>
         – Plasma contains antibodies to ABO antigens. Plasma for transfusion can either be from a donor who shares the same ABO type as the recipient (ABO identical or ABO matched) or it can be ABO compatible (eg, patient with type A blood can receive plasma from a donor who is type A or type AB, neither of which will contain antibodies to A). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7920.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical use of plasma components", section on 'ABO matching'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Any individual with a history of a clinically significant antibody should receive blood that lacks the relevant antigen, even if the antibody is not detectable on subsequent testing. The rationale is that some antibodies may decrease to undetectable levels but may be boosted upon re-exposure to the antigen. Antibodies to Kidd blood group antigens (anti-Jk
         <sup>
          a
         </sup>
         and anti-Jk
         <sup>
          b

         ) are one setting in which this phenomenon is seen. (See

         Hematopoietic stem cells can be transplanted from a donor of any blood type to a recipient of any blood type, regardless of compatibility, because the donor hematopoietic stem cells will give rise to the new donor blood type and a new immune system that are compatible with each other.
        </p>
        <p>
         Measures to reduce hemolysis of recipient and donor RBCs and improve platelet survival during the immediate post-transplant period (when donor and recipient blood cells and circulating antibodies in the plasma are both present) are outlined in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef99896" href="/z/d/graphic/99896.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In solid organ/tissue transplantation, antibodies to blood group antigens that are expressed on the transplanted organ can mediate organ rejection and graft loss. Routine transplantation practice involves the use of organs that are ABO identical with the recipient. Compatibility for other (non-ABO) blood group antigens is not performed. Non-ABO identical transplants can be performed (eg, group O donor organ transplanted to group A, B, or AB recipient).
        </p>
        <p>
         In selected cases, transplantation of an ABO incompatible organ can be performed (eg, from a living kidney donor; for fulminant hepatic failure), often using desensitization and immunosuppression protocols [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. This subject and other exceptions are discussed separately. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In some cases, transient hemolysis of recipient RBCs may be observed due to the presence of passenger lymphocytes from the donated organ. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7953.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         ABO compatibility is not required for transplantation of tissues such as cornea, bone, or tendon. These tissues do not contain appreciable RBCs, and ABO compatibility has not been correlated with transplant outcomes [

         HDFN is a potentially fatal alloimmune reaction in which maternal antibodies directed against fetal RBC antigens can cross the placenta and cause hemolytic anemia in the fetus or during the neonatal period (maternal antibodies persist in fetal plasma for several weeks). Maternal antibodies that could potentially react with fetal antigens inherited from the father may have developed in response to prior exposures to the antigens. Examples include exposure of an RhD-negative mother to an RhD-positive fetus during a previous pregnancy or exposure of a Kell-negative mother to Kell antigen through a previous blood transfusion.

         Autoantibodies to self-RBC antigens play a role in hemolytic anemias. Common examples include autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) due to antibodies to the I antigen that develop following certain infectious illnesses (eg, mycoplasma), and paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria resulting from autoantibodies to the P antigen of the Glob blood group.

In these individuals, RBCs lack A, B, and H antigens, and antibodies to A, B, and H are produced. As a result, these individuals are at risk for a severe hemolytic transfusion reaction (HTR) if transfused with RBCs of any ABO type other than Bombay.

         Higher-than-normal titers of anti-A or anti-B may be seen following pregnancy, recent vaccination, or ingestion of high doses of live bacteria (eg, probiotic therapy). Infusion of plasma-containing blood products such as platelets or Frozen Plasma (FP) from donors with extremely high anti-A or anti-B titers may result in severe hemolytic transfusion reactions in recipients, even if the amounts of plasma are small [

         Following the 1999 Institute of Medicine report focusing on preventable harm, quality and regulatory organizations responsible for patient care practice, including transfusion, mandated improved processes for patient identification and blood specimen collection to mitigate errors in transfusion and risk for AHTR [

          HDFN
         </strong>
         – In contrast with the life-threatening effects of a severe AHTR, most cases of HDFN associated with maternal anti-ABO antibodies tend to be relatively mild in nature, since the A and B antigens are not well developed at birth. An exception is a group B African-American or Black, non-Hispanic newborn of a group O mother. The B antigen appears to be more developed at birth in this ethnic group, and HDFN can be of a more severe nature, sometimes requiring exchange transfusion. (See

          AIHA
         </strong>
         – Autoantibodies with Rh system specificity have been demonstrated in a high percentage of cases of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), with anti-e being most commonly seen. Anti-e reacts with 98 percent of random donor RBC units, presenting a problem in identifying compatible units. In the absence of hemolysis, Rh(e)-negative blood need not be given; Rh(e)-negative blood should be reserved for patients who have formed allo anti-Rh(e). Anti-Rh(C) can be difficult to detect but has been reported to cause hemolysis and hemoglobinuria. (See

         The Duffy blood group antigens reside on an integral RBC membrane glycoprotein known as the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC); other names for this protein include atypical chemokine receptor 1 (ACKR1), Fy glycoprotein, and CD234. DARC is encoded by the

         ; those who are Fy(a-b-) are also referred to as being homozygous for the Fy allele. This allele results from a polymorphism in the
         <em>

         promoter that disrupts transcription factor binding and blocks expression in erythroid cells.

        <p>
         DARC is a multi-pass membrane glycoprotein that acts as a chemokine receptor for certain proinflammatory cytokines (IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, RANTES) [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49,50
         </a>
         ]. Duffy antigens are also used by malaria parasites (

          Plasmodium vivax
         </em>
         and
         <em>
          P. knowlesi
         </em>
         ) to enter the RBC. As a result, approximately 70 percent of Black people from West Africa are Fy(a-b-), which is protective against invasion of these malaria species. The merozoites can attach to Fy(a-b-) RBCs but cannot enter the cell and eventually detach, leaving the RBC markedly deformed [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51

        </p>
        <p>
         Fy(a-b-) individuals also may have a reduced baseline neutrophil count. When the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is below the lower limit of normal (&lt;1500 cells/microL), the patient is said to have Duffy-null associated neutrophil count (DANC, formerly referred to as constitutional neutropenia, benign ethnic neutropenia [BEN], or benign familial neutropenia). The mechanism is not completely understood, but it might be related to reduced clearance of cytokines by RBCs. Approximately 10 to 15 percent of Fy(a-b-) individuals have an ANC &lt;1500/microL.

          HDFN

         – Anti-K is capable of causing severe HDFN and is responsible for a relatively large portion of clinically significant non-Rh HDFN. The K antigen is produced early in fetal development and is expressed on bone marrow erythroid progenitor cells; thus, antibodies to K can cause suppression of normal erythropoiesis in addition to hemolysis of mature RBCs. This bone marrow suppression is thought to account for the severity of anemia in Kell-associated HDFN. Anti-k, anti-Js

This causes an increase in the titer and thermal range of the patient's naturally occurring autoantibody to I. When the infection is successfully treated, the patient's I antigen reverts to normal and the previously increased levels of anti-I destroy a portion of the patient's own RBCs until the antibody level has diminished.

The blood group antigens are located on the C4d fragment, which is liberated upon cleavage of C4 during complement activation and becomes adsorbed from the surrounding plasma onto the RBC surface.

         Antibodies to Chido and Rodgers antigens demonstrate fragile agglutination (and easy dissipation) at the indirect antiglobulin stage of the pretransfusion antibody screen. These antibodies are neutralized by the addition of pooled plasma, and they both react strongly with C4d-coated RBCs prepared in vitro.

The rare Vel-negative individual can be immunized against the Vel antigen following exposure to RBCs through transfusion or pregnancy. Anti-Vel is often a mix of IgG and IgM antibodies that can bind complement; hence, transfusion of Vel-positive blood to a patient with anti-Vel can cause a severe HTR. This is potentially important because donors with weak Vel expression can be mistyped as Vel-negative.
        </p>
        <p>
         Anti-Vel can cause HDFN (rarely), but it is thought to be mild since fetal cells do not express high levels of the Vel antigen.

          Definition
         </strong>
         – A blood group system is a collection of one or more antigens that are under the control of a single gene or a cluster of closely linked, homologous genes. Forty-three blood group systems are recognized by the International Society for Blood Transfusion. The major blood group systems with clinical significance are listed in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106849" href="/z/d/graphic/106849.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). A blood group antigen is a sugar or protein present on the surface of the red blood cell (RBC) that is defined serologically by an antibody  (

          Relevance for transfusion
         </strong>
         – Any individual with a history of a clinically significant RBC alloantibody should receive blood that lacks the relevant antigen, whether the antibody is detectable on subsequent testing, to avoid hemolytic transfusion reactions. Hematopoietic stem cell donors and recipients can have different blood types. In solid organ/tissue transplantation, routine practice uses organs that are ABO identical with the recipient. (See

          Relevance for obstetrics
         </strong>
         – Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) is an alloimmune reaction in which maternal antibodies directed against fetal RBC antigens cross the placenta and cause hemolysis in the fetus or during the neonatal period (maternal antibodies persist in fetal plasma for several weeks); it is potentially fatal and requires close monitoring in case interventions are needed.

          Disease predisposition
         </strong>
         – Certain RBC antigens and antibodies may be associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, resistance to RBC parasites, and certain disease predispositions, possibly including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), although other patient characteristics and risk factors are likely to impact disease risk to a much greater degree than that of blood group antigens.
