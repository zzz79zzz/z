         Elevated ICP is a potentially devastating complication of neurologic injury. In children, increased ICP is most often a complication of traumatic brain injury; it may also occur in children who have hydrocephalus, brain tumors, intracranial infections, hepatic encephalopathy, or impaired central nervous system venous outflow  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69683" href="/z/d/graphic/69683.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Successful management of children with elevated ICP requires prompt recognition and therapy directed at both reducing ICP and reversing its underlying cause. Early recognition of elevated ICP can prevent neurologic sequelae and death.

         ICP is the pressure of CSF inside the cerebral ventricles, which is determined by cerebral blood flow (CBF) and CSF circulation. The Davson equation describes this relationship [

         Measured ICP is often greater than the calculated value because of a vascular component, which is probably a result of pulsation in the arterial bed and the interaction between pulsatile arterial inflow and venous outflow curves, cardiac function, and cerebral vasomotor tone [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, all of these interrelationships may be altered in critically ill comatose patients with any of the conditions that increase ICP  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69683" href="/z/d/graphic/69683.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The anatomy and development of the cranial vault, the brain, and its vascular and CSF compartments also have an effect on ICP. The interrelationship between volume and compliance of each component of the intracranial compartment was recognized over 150 years ago and is known as the Monro-Kellie doctrine [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. Because the overall volume of the cranial vault cannot change in the patient with closed cranial sutures, an increase in the volume of one component or the presence of pathologic components necessitates the displacement of other structures, an increase in ICP, or both [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Taken together with the Davson equation, it is clear that ICP is affected by various pathologies including:

         The net result of this pathophysiology is elevated ICP along with significant risk of brain tissue herniation, ischemic syndromes, and death.

        <p>
         This process is demonstrated in the figure  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65853" href="/z/d/graphic/65853.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Normally, the intracranial components are in equilibrium. In a “closed system” (ie, closed sutures), initial compensation to increase in volume of a space-occupying lesion is by displacement of blood and CSF along the spinal axis, and ICP remains normal. When the limits of this compensation are reached; any additional increase in the volume of the mass lesion is accompanied by a corresponding increase in ICP (decompensated phase). The slope of the curve in the decompensated phase is steep, such that small changes in volume cause significant changes in ICP  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54602" href="/z/d/graphic/54602.html" rel="external">
          figure 2

         ) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. In infants with open cranial sutures and a non-ossified fontanel, the system should be considered as “open” and initial compensation occurs with bulging at the anterior fontanel. In slowly progressive change in volume, head growth will be affected by splaying of the cranial sutures, as seen in hydrocephalus.

         Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is a clinical surrogate for the adequacy of cerebral perfusion. CPP is defined as mean arterial pressure (MAP) minus mean ICP.
        </p>
        <p>
         CPP = MAP - ICP
        </p>
        <p>
         Normal CPP in adults ranges from 50 to 70 mmHg; normal CPP in children younger than five years of age is probably lower than that in older children or adults, because children have lower systolic blood pressures, but normal limits have not been well established. However, based upon a normal ICP &lt;20 mmHg and MAP &gt;60 to 80 mmHg, depending upon age (where MAP = 1.5 x Age + 55 mmHg [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]), normal CPP in children can be calculated to be at least 40 to 60 mmHg [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. When CPP falls below a critical level, either from hypotension or from a markedly elevated ICP, the brain receives inadequate CBF, and ischemic injury can occur [

         When managing elevated ICP, the major goal is to maintain CBF. CBF is a function of the pressure drop across the cerebral circulation divided by the cerebrovascular resistance (CVR), as predicted by Ohm's law:

          Autoregulation
         </strong>
         – In the intact and normal cerebral circulation, CBF is maintained at a relatively constant rate by intrinsic cerebral mechanisms referred to as autoregulation. In addition to this global phenomenon, a region of brain tissue can also bring about an acute regional change in CBF. This coupling of local blood flow to local changes in metabolic activity is determined by a number of "neuro-energetic" signals [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. A clinical illustration of this phenomenon is by the blood oxygen level-dependent ("BOLD") time series used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that can show "activated" regions with mental tasks. (See

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         At a global level, cerebral autoregulation adjusts CBF through changes in CVR. In adults, changes in CVR can maintain constant CBF at mean arterial pressures of 60 to 150 mmHg [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. However, this "plateau" is under many influences including level of sympathetic activity and baseline PaCO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         . In infants and children, the range of the plateau (with upper and lower limits) is going to differ to that identified in adults because of developmental differences in mean arterial pressure and level of sympathetic activity. Consequently, we do not know the precise lower limit in mean blood pressure at which CBF falls with declining blood pressure. Newer techniques, however, using near-infrared spectroscopy in babies with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy suggest that optimum mean arterial pressure can be identified [
         <a href="#rid16">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Outside this range, the compensatory mechanisms break down and inadequate or excessive perfusion can occur [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,15
         </a>
         ]. The upper and lower limits of autoregulation are shifted to the right in patients with chronic hypertension, such as patients with malignant hypertension and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, in whom acute reductions in blood pressure can produce ischemic symptoms  (

         ). It results from downward displacement of supratentorial brain tissue into the infratentorial compartment and can be caused by supratentorial mass lesions, diffuse brain swelling, focal edema, or acute hydrocephalus. Transtentorial herniation can cause compression of the third cranial nerve, the upper brainstem, and the cerebral peduncles as well as distortion or traction of the superior portion of the basilar artery and the posterior cerebral arteries, leading to occipital lobe infarction.

         Although discussed separately, the assessment and management of elevated ICP are performed jointly in practice. The diagnosis of elevated ICP is typically established by neuroimaging or other noninvasive means in pediatric patients with suggestive clinical findings (eg, headache, vomiting, vision changes, altered mental status, or findings of herniation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70683" href="/z/d/graphic/70683.html" rel="external">

          2
         </sub>
         O) using an external ventricular drain or intraparenchymal ICP monitor is the definitive way to confirm the presence of intracranial hypertension. However, invasive measurement of ICP is reserved for the most severely affected children in whom the benefits of direct measurement outweigh the risks of bleeding and infection (eg, Glasgow coma score [GCS] ≤8  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59662" href="/z/d/graphic/59662.html" rel="external">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In awake patients with findings that indicate subacute or chronic elevation of ICP (eg, headache, peripheral vision loss, and papilledema) but a nonfocal neurologic examination and normal neuroimaging, elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture (&gt;27 cmH
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         O) can establish the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5257.html" rel="external">
          "Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri): Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Lumbar puncture'

        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of intracranial hypertension can be challenging, especially when the elevation is subacute or chronic. In infants with unfused sutures, progressive enlargement of the cranial vault due to increased ICP can be initially accommodated without major clinical decompensation. In older children, early symptoms such as headache or vomiting are nonspecific, and unless there is a high index of suspicion, as the course progresses, an altered level of consciousness may hinder the diagnosis. Nonetheless, early diagnosis is of utmost importance because appropriate therapy can minimize or prevent permanent neurologic injury.

         For detection of acute elevation of ICP, computed tomography (CT) of the brain without contrast is the initial study of choice because it is noninvasive, can be obtained quickly in most hospitals without sedating the patient, and is more readily available than magnetic resonance imaging [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Head CT should be obtained as soon as the child is stabilized so that emergency therapy, if indicated, can be initiated. The goal of the emergency CT is to assess for a surgical cause of raised ICP that necessitates immediate neurosurgery (eg, epidural hematoma or acute, obstructive hydrocephalus). Head CT is also the best imaging study for the initial evaluation of intracranial injuries caused by head trauma. (See

         In adults, increased optic nerve sheath diameter (&gt;6 mm); specific criteria for children have not been established, but &gt;6 mm is used at the author’s institution.

         Head CT may also demonstrate the underlying etiology of elevated ICP such as cerebral edema, mass lesion, or hemorrhage  (

        </p>
        <p>
         However, based upon small observational studies in children with head trauma or nontraumatic coma and experience in adults with severe head trauma, patients
         <strong>
          without
         </strong>
         these findings on initial CT may have elevated ICP in up to 15 percent of cases [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,28
         </a>
         ]. Abnormalities on head CT may develop within the first few days after a closed head injury in up to one-third of patients. (See

         Thus, head CT findings must be interpreted cautiously, especially in children with head injury. Children with no findings of increased ICP on head CT but in whom elevated ICP is suspected based upon clinical findings such as headache, vomiting, vision changes, altered mental status, or findings of herniation should still receive expectant management and undergo alternative means to identify elevated ICP as follows:

         MRI of the brain is more accurate for detecting elevation of ICP than CT but is less accurate than invasive measurement of ICP. It is also less available, takes longer to perform, and requires sedation in infants and young children or otherwise uncooperative patients [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24

         MRI does have greater sensitivity for detecting conditions that can cause cerebral edema  (

          table 2

         ) than computed tomography of the head. In clinical practice, these different forms of edema can be differentiated by comparing images from T2-weighting (T2-W), diffusion-weighting (DW), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequences [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. For example, three clinical illustrations of interstitial edema, cytotoxic/cellular edema, and vasogenic edema are, respectively, acute hydrocephalus, cerebral infarction, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). All three conditions show hyperintensity of signal in the affected region on T2-W imaging. Signal hyperintensity on DW imaging is seen in regions affected by cerebral infarction and periventricular regions in acute hydrocephalus. ADC is large and anisotropic in PRES, large in periventricular regions in acute hydrocephalus, and low with reduced anisotropy in infarcted tissue [

         Papilledema on funduscopy has low sensitivity for intracranial hypertension as demonstrated in small studies of children with shunt failure or idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) [

          33,34

        </p>
        <p>
         Fundus photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) provide alternative methods to detect elevated ICP using images of the optic disk [

         Invasive measurement of ICP definitively establishes the presence of intracranial hypertension.

         Intracranial monitoring with an external ventricular drain or intraparenchymal ICP monitor should be strongly considered in pediatric patients with a GCS ≤8  (

         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. However, evidence is lacking to guide this decision in children. Furthermore, in a retrospective, database, propensity-weighted analysis of the impact of ICP monitors in over 3000 children suffering with severe TBI, functional outcomes, specifically survival, were not associated with the use of invasive monitoring [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. Further studies are needed to help with clinical decision-making (ie, examination of treatment used along with the monitoring). Until that time, use of ICP monitoring remains a recommendation for severe TBI (GCS ≤8) in pediatric patients.

         always identify elevated ICP, patients with focal neurologic findings should
         <strong>

         routinely undergo LP, regardless of radiographic findings. (See

         These precautions are essential to avoid precipitating herniation across the tentorial notch or into the foramen magnum. LP decreases pressure in the region below the tentorium. If elevated pressure above the tentorium exists, then the pressure gradient between compartments, if large enough, can cause herniation.

          Hypoglycemia
         </strong>

          Metabolic encephalopathies, other than hypoglycemia
         </strong>
         – Metabolic coma in children usually occurs as a progression from delirium to stupor to coma, but more fulminant cases may present in coma. A fluctuating examination is common; deficits can include abnormal brainstem reflexes, hypotonia, and even posturing in severe cases. However, focal neurologic findings and anisocoria are uncommon in metabolic coma. Multifocal myoclonus is very suggestive of a metabolic etiology. Potential etiologies of metabolic coma are provided in the table  (

          Acute drug intoxication
         </strong>
         – Encephalopathy resulting from the toxic effect of medication is an important diagnostic consideration in a patient in whom intracranial hypertension is suspected because of the typically abrupt onset of encephalopathy. This condition can result from therapeutic overdose, unintentional ingestion, or deliberate abuse. Drugs that result in coma when present in high concentration include sedatives, anticholinergic agents, and salicylates  (

          algorithm 1

         ). The diagnosis of elevated ICP is typically established by neuroimaging or other noninvasive means in pediatric patients with suggestive clinical findings (eg, headache, vomiting, vision changes, altered mental status, or findings of herniation  (

         Invasive measurement of ICP definitively establishes the presence of intracranial hypertension. Intracranial monitoring with an external ventricular drain or intraparenchymal ICP monitor placed by a neurosurgeon is usually indicated in pediatric patients with a Glasgow coma score (GCS) ≤8  (

          Ancillary studies
         </strong>
         – In addition to neuroimaging, ancillary studies serve to identify specific etiologies of elevated ICP (eg, meningitis or encephalitis), comorbid conditions in children with severe head trauma, and to differentiate elevated ICP from other causes of altered mental status (eg, hypoglycemia, metabolic encephalopathy, intoxication, or nonconvulsive status epilepticus).
