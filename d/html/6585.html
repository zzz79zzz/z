The etiology of UPJ obstruction includes both congenital and acquired conditions. UPJ obstruction is the most common pathologic cause of antenatally detected hydronephrosis.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, and management of congenital UPJ obstruction will be reviewed here.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The reported incidence of UPJ obstruction is 1 in 500 live births screened by routine antenatal ultrasound; however, not all cases require surgical intervention [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. UPJ obstruction is the most common anatomical cause of antenatal hydronephrosis.</p><p>Boys are affected with UPJ obstruction more commonly than are girls [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Lesions are found more frequently on the left than on the right side. The reported rate of bilateral involvement is approximately 10 percent [<a href="#rid1">1,4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Congenital UPJ obstruction is caused by anatomic lesions or functional disturbances that restrict urinary flow across the UPJ, resulting in hydronephrosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55146" href="/z/d/graphic/55146.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77143" href="/z/d/graphic/77143.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Most cases are thought to be due to partial obstruction because complete obstruction results in rapid destruction of the kidney. In some cases, partial obstruction may also lead to progressive deterioration of kidney function. However, in many infants, an equilibrium state may develop in which kidney function remains stable.</p><p>Development of the equilibrium state resulting in stable kidney function depends on:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Urinary rate and output</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anatomy and degree of UPJ obstruction</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Compliance of the renal pelvis</p><p></p><p>In the fetus and infant, the renal pelvis, because of its increased compliance, can stretch and thereby accommodate large volumes of urine, which results in pelvic dilatation (hydronephrosis). The large capacity volume of a stretched pelvis decreases the risk of high intrapelvic pressure. As a result, kidneys with a large intrarenal pelvis are less vulnerable to damage from obstruction than those with a small intrarenal pelvis, especially during diuresis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Congenital UPJ obstruction is usually caused by intrinsic stenosis or less commonly crossing vessel causing external compression of the ureter at the UPJ. In older children, a rare cause of UPJ obstruction is a benign intraluminal ureteral polyp. If surgical correction is deemed appropriate, preoperative determination of the underlying cause is not necessary since the technique of reconstruction remains the same regardless of UPJ etiology and the exact etiology can be made intraoperatively.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intrinsic narrowing</strong> – In most cases of UPJ obstruction, the upper segment of the ureter is narrowed at the UPJ or kinked as the ureter enters the pelvis, resulting in obstruction of urinary flow  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef118453" href="/z/d/graphic/118453.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). Although the underlying mechanism is not proven, it is thought that there is an embryologic disruption of the proximal ureter that alters circular musculature development and/or collagen fibers, and composition between and around the muscular cells [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Rare causes of intrinsic UPJ obstruction include valvular mucosal folds, persistent fetal ureteral convolutions, and ureteral polyps  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91875" href="/z/d/graphic/91875.html" rel="external">image 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef129922" href="/z/d/graphic/129922.html" rel="external">movie 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Crossing vessel</strong> – In approximately 10 percent of pediatric UPJ obstruction, an aberrant or accessory renal artery may cross the lower pole of the kidney, resulting in intermittent compression of the UPJ and blockage of urinary flow  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef118454" href="/z/d/graphic/118454.html" rel="external">picture 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80130" href="/z/d/graphic/80130.html" rel="external">image 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef129921" href="/z/d/graphic/129921.html" rel="external">movie 2</a>). It is possible to identify crossing vessels that cause extrinsic obstruction on computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which are typically obtained for abdominal pain evaluation or other unrelated pathologies.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ureteral polyp</strong> – Less than 1 percent of pediatric UPJ obstruction  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef118454" href="/z/d/graphic/118454.html" rel="external">picture 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80130" href="/z/d/graphic/80130.html" rel="external">image 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef129921" href="/z/d/graphic/129921.html" rel="external">movie 2</a>) is caused by an intraluminal ureteral polyp(s) that typically presents with intermittent flank pain. Prospective diagnosis is often difficult, with the polyp typically found at the time of operative repair, although on occasion the polyp(s) may be suspected on preoperative sonogram, CT scan, or MRI. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Infants</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prenatal hydronephrosis</strong> – In geographic areas where prenatal ultrasound screening is commonly performed, most cases of UPJ obstruction are diagnosed during the postnatal evaluation of antenatal hydronephrosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68377" href="/z/d/graphic/68377.html" rel="external">image 3</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6099.html" rel="external">"Fetal hydronephrosis: Etiology and prenatal management"</a>) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Postnatal presentation</strong> – In the absence of prenatal screening, infants may present with a palpable abdominal mass caused by an enlarged obstructed kidney. Other presentations include urinary tract infection, hematuria, or poor weight gain. Kidney failure is an unusual presentation and occurs in infants with a single obstructed kidney or with bilateral involvement.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Older children</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinical manifestations in older children include intermittent flank pain or abdominal pain (referred to as Dietl's crisis). The pain may worsen during brisk diuresis (for example, after consumption of caffeine). These symptoms may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting, leading to an evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Children may also present with hematuria, kidney stone, acute pyelonephritis [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], hypertension or kidney injury after experiencing minor trauma, [<a href="#rid7">7-10</a>]. UPJ obstruction may also present as an incidental finding on ultrasound for other conditions  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68377" href="/z/d/graphic/68377.html" rel="external">image 3</a>); or as a finding on computed tomography (CT) performed for abdominal pain of unknown etiology  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50727" href="/z/d/graphic/50727.html" rel="external">image 4</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6434.html" rel="external">"Emergency evaluation of the child with acute abdominal pain", section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Other anomalies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>UPJ obstruction may be associated with other genitourinary anomalies, such as a horseshoe kidney [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], or be a component of or associated with a syndrome such as CHARGE (coloboma, heart anomaly, choanal atresia, retardation, genital and ear anomalies) syndrome [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of UPJ obstruction is generally suspected when ultrasonography demonstrates significant hydronephrosis with evidence of calyceal and renal pelvic dilatation without ureteral involvement (ie UPJ-type hydronephrosis)  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68377" href="/z/d/graphic/68377.html" rel="external">image 3</a>). Confirmation of UPJ obstruction is based on further imaging studies. In our center, the confirmatory diagnostic imaging differs between infants and older children.</p><p>Many infants with UPJ obstruction come to medical attention because significant hydronephrosis was detected on antenatal ultrasound. Details regarding the initial evaluation of newborns with antenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis, including the timing of postnatal ultrasound, are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6105.html" rel="external">"Postnatal evaluation and management of hydronephrosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H987906936"><span class="h2">Infants</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>UPJ obstruction is the most common cause of antenatal hydronephrosis. It should be suspected in infants with persistent hydronephrosis with renal pelvic diameter (RPD) &gt;15 mm on postnatal ultrasound. The diagnosis of UPJ obstruction is typically confirmed with diuretic renal scan, although magnetic resonance imaging can also be used to make the diagnosis. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In our center, <strong>diuretic renal scan</strong> (renal scan and the administration of a diuretic [typically <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13329" href="/z/d/drug information/13329.html" rel="external">furosemide</a>]) is used to diagnose UPJ obstruction and other causes of obstructive uropathy. The preferred radioisotope is technetium-99m-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (Tc-99m MAG3), which is taken up by the renal cortex, filtered across the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) to the renal tubules, and excreted into the renal pelvis and urinary tract. The diuretic renal scan measures the drainage time from the renal pelvis (referred to as washout) and assesses the percent relative function of each kidney. The washout measurement correlates with the degree of obstruction. In general, we use a half-life greater than 20 minutes indicating delayed transient time of the TC-99m isotope from the kidney as an indication of significant UPJ obstruction. Another indicator of obstruction is a difference greater than 10 percent in split renal. Thus, patients with a half-life greater than 20 minutes or &gt;10% difference in split function (for example, &gt;60 percent on the right and &lt;40 percent on the left) will need close monitoring and/or consideration of surgical correction. A more complete description of the diuretic renography is found separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6105.html" rel="external">"Postnatal evaluation and management of hydronephrosis", section on 'Diuretic renography'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When a diuretic renal scan is being considered, referral to a center with expertise in pediatric urologic care is warranted because the renal scan is an invasive procedure, requiring placement of an intravenous line and bladder catheter in infants and children prior to toilet training. In general, diuretic renography can be performed after six weeks of life because immediate surgical intervention is rarely required, and the diuretic renography is more difficult to interpret in the newborn period because of immature kidney function.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging</strong> (MRI) renography can be used to diagnose UPJ obstruction  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91874" href="/z/d/graphic/91874.html" rel="external">image 5</a>). The advantage of MRI is the ability to discern accurate anatomy defining the point of obstruction. MRI can also determine the split function of the kidney and simulate the diuretic renogram by providing washout data. The disadvantage of MRI is the cost and the need for general anesthesia and/or sedation in infants and small children [<a href="#rid13">13-15</a>]. In an observational study, a feed and wrap technique allowed MRI (without contrast) imaging without anesthesia in infants three months or younger [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The swaddle MRI technique only allows for anatomical assessment since an IV contrast is not administered; therefore, split function and washout date are not obtained.</p><p></p><p>If the infant has persistent postnatal hydronephrosis that is not severe (RPD &lt;15 mm), a follow-up ultrasound is performed at three months of age to monitor the degree of hydronephrosis. If dilatation progresses to the threshold of RPD ≥15 mm, a diuretic renography should be obtained at that time to determine the relative function of the affected kidney and the presence of UPJ obstruction or other causes of obstructive uropathy. (See <a class="local">'Asymptomatic patients'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H452602717"><span class="h2">Older children</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Older children most often present when they are evaluated for abdominal pain. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>CT scan may reveal a previously unsuspected intermittent UPJ in children that present emergently with acute and severe abdominal pain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sonographic evaluation performed for children with abdominal pain including recurrent pain may demonstrate significant hydronephrosis. </p><p></p><p>The diagnosis of intermittent UPJ obstruction is confirmed if hydronephrosis is present on CT scan or sonogram when the child is symptomatic and resolves or greatly improves on follow-up sonogram when the child is well. </p><p>We do not routinely perform diuretic renal scan or MRI in patients with classic intermittent obstruction based on CT or sonogram finding unless we are concerned about decreased split renal function based on thinning of the renal parenchyma on the affected side. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h1">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The differential diagnosis of UPJ obstruction includes other causes of hydronephrosis.

There are no randomized trials that provide evidence for the optimal management of congenital UPJ obstruction. The following discussion is based upon observational studies, and the experience and opinions of experts in the field including the author.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4115221996"><span class="h2">Management approach</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21"><span class="h3">Prenatal</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prenatal intervention or early delivery is usually not necessary for fetal hydronephrosis including cases due to UPJ obstruction. There is no evidence that prenatal intervention in infants with either a single obstructed kidney or bilateral involvement improves kidney outcome. Possible exception is the rare situation when prenatal decompression of an enormously dilated renal pelvis is necessary to prevent dystocia or pulmonary compression. However, antenatal surgery should only be considered in the rarest of cases and only in select centers with expertise after a complete evaluation is performed. The criteria and setting for antenatal surgery are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6099.html" rel="external">"Fetal hydronephrosis: Etiology and prenatal management", section on 'Fetal surgery'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22"><span class="h3">Symptomatic patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children who are symptomatic usually require operative intervention. If radiographic evaluation (CT scan or sonogram) reveals hydronephrosis during pain that resolves when symptoms subside, surgical intervention is warranted. As noted, we do not routinely perform diuretic renal scan or MRI in patients with classic intermittent obstruction based on CT or sonogram finding unless we are concerned about decreased split renal function based on thinning of the renal parenchyma on the affected side. </p><p>Additional management decisions involve treating concomitant conditions that can occur in symptomatic patients:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pyelonephritis</strong> – Rarely patients with UPJ obstruction will present with acute pyelonephritis and require intravenous antibiotics. Surgical repair is performed when the infection has resolved. If pyelonephritis does not respond to antibiotics and persistent infection is suggested on sonography, a temporary percutaneous pyelostomy tube should be placed to relieve the obstruction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Kidney stones</strong> – Kidney stones sometimes develop in the obstructed renal pelvis. Treatment involves removal of the stone at the time of surgical repair. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25"><span class="h3">Asymptomatic patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most asymptomatic patients are infants who initially present prenatally (see <a class="local">'Infants'</a> above). Managing these infants is challenging because the natural course of UPJ obstruction is variable. It appears that many patients will have stable kidney function and improvement in the degree of hydronephrosis during long periods of observation, while others will have deterioration of their kidney function, and appear to benefit from surgical correction [<a href="#rid17">17-19</a>]. As a result, there is no reliable method to predict whether the function of a kidney with UPJ obstruction will remain unaffected or deteriorate with time and limited guidance on deciding between the management options of immediate surgical correction (ie, pyeloplasty) and observation with a later option of pyeloplasty dependent on the course of the obstruction.</p><p>In our center, the following approach based on postnatal ultrasound measurement of renal pelvic diameter (RPD) and the results of a diuretic renal scan is used to manage asymptomatic patients with UPJ-type hydronephrosis detected by antenatal ultrasound. Based on available literature and expert opinion, we believe that this approach best meets the goal of preserving kidney function while avoiding unnecessary surgery.

(See <a class="local">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Epidemiology</strong> ‒ UPJ obstruction is the most common pathologic cause of antenatally detected hydronephrosis with a reported incidence of up to 1 in 500 fetuses screened by antenatal ultrasound.

Congenital UPJ obstruction is usually caused by intrinsic stenosis of the ureter at the ureteropelvic junction  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef118453" href="/z/d/graphic/118453.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>), less commonly by an accessory renal artery crossing vessel causing extrinsic compression of the UPJ  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef118454" href="/z/d/graphic/118454.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>), and rarely from an intraluminal ureteral polyp. (See <a class="local">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Presentation</strong> ‒ Most cases of UPJ obstruction are diagnosed during the postnatal evaluation of prenatal hydronephrosis. In the absence of prenatal screening, infants may present with an abdominal mass (enlarged obstructed kidney), urinary tract infection (UTI), hematuria, or failure to thrive. In older children, the most common clinical manifestations of UPJ obstruction are intermittent flank and abdominal pain. Other presentations include kidney injury after experiencing minor trauma, hematuria, kidney stone, or rarely hypertension. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis </strong>‒ The diagnosis of UPJ obstruction is generally suspected when imaging studies (sonography or CT scan demonstrate hydronephrosis.
