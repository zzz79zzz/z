They are often lethal diseases, with a case-fatality ratio of 84 (esophageal) and 75 percent (gastric), respectively [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The esophagogastric junction (EGJ; also called the gastroesophageal junction or GEJ) and gastric cardia  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79793" href="/d/graphic/79793.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) represent anatomical sites with a remarkably high and rapidly rising incidence of adenocarcinoma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2616.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology of gastric cancer", section on 'Changes in histologic pattern'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2274.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and pathobiology of esophageal cancer", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Although surgery is the primary curative modality for EGJ cancers, long-term outcomes are not satisfactory with resection alone, even if microscopically complete (R0). This poor long-term outcome has prompted an evaluation of neoadjuvant (preoperative) and adjuvant (postoperative) combined modality therapy. There is no consensus on the best combination of multimodality therapy.</p><p>This topic will cover the definition and classification of EGJ tumors. It will provide an overview of the clinical trials that support the multimodality management of locally advanced, potentially resectable EGJ adenocarcinomas. It will also focus on considerations that influence the choice of the multimodality approach. Principles of surgical management for gastric and thoracic esophageal tumors, treatment of locally advanced, unresectable esophageal cancers, adjuvant and neoadjuvant approaches to gastric cancers, and neoadjuvant and adjuvant approaches to tumors of the thoracic esophagus are covered elsewhere, as is management of dysplasia and early superficial cancer (including adenocarcinoma) arising in Barrett's esophagus.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2481.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of invasive gastric cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2530.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of resectable esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancers"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2472.html" rel="external">"Management of locally advanced, unresectable and inoperable esophageal cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2523.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment of gastric cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2478.html" rel="external">"Radiation therapy, chemoradiotherapy, neoadjuvant approaches, and postoperative adjuvant therapy for localized cancers of the esophagus"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2236.html" rel="external">"Barrett's esophagus: Surveillance and management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2494.html" rel="external">"Management of superficial esophageal cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7933267"><span class="h1">DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The definition of the EGJ is not standardized. It is defined differently by anatomists, physiologists, endoscopists, surgeons, and pathologists:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anatomists and surgeons localize the EGJ at the level of the angle of His, the point at which the tubular esophagus joins the cardia of the saccular stomach [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Physiologists define the EGJ as the distal border of the lower esophageal sphincter, as determined by manometry.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Endoscopically, the EGJ corresponds to the most proximal extent of the longitudinal gastric folds  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76055" href="/d/graphic/76055.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. It is not the same as the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ), which forms a visible Z-line that marks the juxtaposition between the reddish columnar epithelium lining the gastric cardia and the pale glossy squamous epithelium lining the esophagus  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69873" href="/d/graphic/69873.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). The SCJ is located approximately 3 to 10 mm proximal to the anatomically defined EGJ [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2269.html" rel="external">"Barrett's esophagus: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Identify possible Barrett's'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pathologically, the EGJ is defined in an opened esophagogastrectomy specimen as the most proximal aspect of the gastric folds. The EGJ is located in the opened specimen by following the mucosa of the tubular esophagus to the top of the gastric folds. The EGJ location as defined by the pathologist is likely more precise than the location that is defined endoscopically, which can be limited both by respiratory and diaphragmatic motion during an endoscopic examination, as well as by the presence of a hiatal hernia.</p><p></p><p>The use of anatomic or endoscopic definitions such as "end of the tubular esophagus" or "proximal limit of the gastric folds" to define the EGJ should be avoided as these definitions place the EGJ at a point that can be over 2 cm proximal to the true physiologic EGJ, or over 2 cm distal to it, within the cardia of the stomach.</p><p>The gastric cardia is also imprecisely defined  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79793" href="/d/graphic/79793.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Anatomists describe the cardia as that zone of the stomach that is adjacent to the orifice of the tubular esophagus, but there is no anatomical landmark for the distal margin of the cardia. A definition of the cardia commonly used in Japan is the area within 2 cm above and below the EGJ [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>The lack of a clear definition of the EGJ and gastric cardia has contributed to difficulties in classification of these tumors and has hampered definition of the optimal multimodality strategy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H497521"><span class="h2">AJCC classification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) for esophageal and gastric cancer is used universally  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221" href="/d/graphic/111221.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In the most recent (2017, eighth edition) revision of the AJCC staging classification [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], tumors involving the EGJ with the tumor epicenter no more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as esophageal cancers. By contrast, EGJ tumors with their epicenter located more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as stomach cancers, as are all cardia cancers not involving the EGJ, even if they are within 2 cm of the EGJ  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111351" href="/d/graphic/111351.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Other changes from the 2010 classification include the provision of unique prognostic stage groupings based on clinically determined TNM categories, and unique pathologic (p) and post-treatment pathologic (yp) TNM prognostic stage groupings, which are specific for adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. Stage-stratified prognostic estimates for esophageal adenocarcinomas, which are based on data from the Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration, are outlined in the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111241" href="/d/graphic/111241.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) [<a href="#rid7">7-12</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2502.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of esophageal cancer", section on 'TNM staging criteria'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2513.html" rel="external">"Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of gastric cancer", section on 'TNM staging criteria'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12477151"><span class="h2">Siewert classification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Siewert and Holsher published a topographic-anatomic subclassification scheme for EGJ adenocarcinomas in 1987 [<a href="#rid13">13</a>] that has been adopted by many clinicians; it was approved by the Seventh International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus in 1995 and by the Second International Gastric Cancer Congress in 1997 [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Within this classification, EGJ adenocarcinomas encompass all tumors with an epicenter within 5 cm proximal or distal to the EGJ [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>Siewert described three distinct categories of EGJ adenocarcinoma based on anatomic location, for which the surgical approach differs  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64783" href="/d/graphic/64783.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Type I tumor</strong> (located between 5 and 1 cm proximal to the EGJ [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]) – Adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus that usually arises from an area with specialized intestinal metaplasia of the esophagus (ie, Barrett's esophagus) and that may infiltrate the EGJ from above.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Type II tumor</strong> (located between 1 cm proximal and 2 cm distal to the EGJ) – True carcinoma of the cardia arising from the cardiac epithelium or short segments with intestinal metaplasia at the EGJ; this entity is also often referred to as "junctional carcinoma."</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Type III tumor</strong> (located between 2 and 5 cm distal to the EGJ) – Subcardial gastric carcinoma that infiltrates the EGJ and distal esophagus from below.</p><p></p><p>In most cases, classification is relatively straightforward based on the results of contrast radiography, endoscopy with retroflexed view of the EGJ, computed tomography (CT), and sometimes, intraoperative appearance. However, in some cases, it may be difficult to distinguish the type for very locally advanced tumors that obliterate the EGJ and cross boundaries. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2502.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of esophageal cancer", section on 'Pretreatment staging evaluation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2663.html" rel="external">"Endoscopic ultrasound for evaluating patients with esophageal cancer", section on 'Preoperative staging'</a>.)</p><p>There are some data suggesting that type II/III tumors might be better staged (and treated) as gastric cancers [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. However, as noted above, in the newest eighth edition TNM classification system, cancers involving the EGJ that have their epicenter within the proximal 2 cm of the cardia and involve the EGJ are still staged as esophageal cancers  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221" href="/d/graphic/111221.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Cancers whose epicenter is more than 2 cm distal from the EGJ, even if the EGJ is involved, and all proximal cardia tumors that do not involve the EGJ (even if they are within 2 cm of the EGJ) are staged as stomach cancers  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111190" href="/d/graphic/111190.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2513.html" rel="external">"Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of gastric cancer", section on 'TNM staging criteria'</a>.)</p><p>Siewert I, II, and III type tumors share a number of common morphologic features and a similar prognosis, but there are differences with regard to epidemiology, etiology, distribution, and pattern of nodal metastases [<a href="#rid18">18-21</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Siewert type I tumors have epidemiologic and histologic characteristics that are similar to distal thoracic esophageal adenocarcinomas, including a strong male predominance, association with a history of reflux symptoms, and a predominance of intestinal-type histology, having arisen from Barrett's intestinal metaplasia secondary to gastroesophageal reflux [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2276.html" rel="external">"Barrett's esophagus: Pathogenesis and malignant transformation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2274.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and pathobiology of esophageal cancer", section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2274.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and pathobiology of esophageal cancer", section on 'Etiologic factors'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2269.html" rel="external">"Barrett's esophagus: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Intestinal metaplasia at GEJ'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">By contrast, type III tumors resemble distal (non-cardia) gastric cancers, with a similar proportion of diffuse and intestinal histologic types and no association with reflux. They arise from the gastric mucosa, and their origin might be associated with <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> and atrophic gastritis [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Type III (and II) tumors have a less strong male predominance than do type I cancers. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2616.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology of gastric cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2617.html" rel="external">"Risk factors for gastric cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">There is increasing evidence to suggest that Siewert type II tumors have two distinct etiologies, some being esophageal adenocarcinomas probably arising from short or ultrashort Barrett's esophagus, and others gastric adenocarcinomas caused by <em>H.</em> <em>pylori</em> infection and atrophic gastritis (as with type III tumors) [<a href="#rid24">24-26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For the purpose of multimodality treatment, EGJ tumors are all treated similarly, although the operative approach differs, partly because of the differing pattern of nodal spread  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64783" href="/d/graphic/64783.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>) [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In general, type I cancers more frequently involve lymph nodes in the upper mediastinum (tracheal bifurcation and above) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Patients with type I tumors are not appropriate candidates for a purely transabdominal approach to resection. The standard surgical approach is a transthoracic en bloc esophagectomy combined with resection of the upper part of the stomach and two-field lymphadenectomy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>On the other hand, for type II and III carcinomas, nodal metastases are more frequently found in the lower mediastinum and around the celiac trunk  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111242" href="/d/graphic/111242.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. The optimal treatment for type II cancer is controversial. Some surgeons recommend an esophagectomy with a proximal gastrectomy, which allows the dissection of both the abdominal and mediastinal nodes. Others advocate for a total gastrectomy and extended lymph node dissection with a transhiatal approach into the posterior mediastinum [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For type III carcinomas, the standard surgical approach is a transhiatally extended total gastrectomy with distal esophageal resection and systemic lymphadenectomy of nodes that drain the stomach. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2530.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of resectable esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancers", section on 'Esophagogastric junction cancer resection'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H944333"><span class="h1">PRETREATMENT STAGING EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the EGJ and gastric cardia is usually established by an endoscopic biopsy. In addition to achieving a biopsy, to assist with treatment planning the endoscopist should document tumor location relative to both the teeth and the EGJ, tumor length, extent of circumferential involvement, degree of obstruction, and any evidence of Barrett's esophagus. The Siewert type (I, II, or III) can often be defined endoscopically, although endoscopic localization of the EGJ can be hindered by the presence of a hiatal hernia and by respiratory and diaphragmatic motion. (See <a class="local">'Siewert classification'</a> above and <a class="local">'Definition and classification'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2530.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of resectable esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancers"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2502.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of esophageal cancer", section on 'Endoscopic biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>Once a diagnosis is established, staging is undertaken to ascertain disease extent and location. At the completion of staging, information on tumor location, extent, and potential resectability enables the choice of the most appropriate multimodality treatment.</p><p>Staging involves an assessment of both locoregional and potentially distant (metastatic) disease. Integrated positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging is the preferred approach to evaluate for metastatic disease. (See <a class="local">'Role of PET and integrated PET/CT'</a> below.).</p><p>However, contrast-enhanced CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis is often obtained as the initial imaging study.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H635075564"><span class="h2">Role of PET and integrated PET/CT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>PET and integrated PET/computed tomography (CT) scans are more accurate than CT alone for detecting metastatic disease and may be performed initially in lieu of CT. However, we still recommend integrated PET/CT even if contrast-enhanced CT was performed initially, in the absence of demonstrable metastatic disease. Suspicious PET findings should be confirmed with biopsy before excluding a patient from treatment with curative intent. PET has a high rate of false positive findings [<a href="#rid31">31,32</a>].</p><p>Integrated PET/CT imaging is favored over PET alone due to better spatial resolution. PET and CT are performed sequentially during a single visit on a hybrid PET/CT scanner. The CT component of integrated PET/CT imaging is performed in most institutions without intravenous (IV) contrast, which limits the detection of small metastases both within and outside of the liver. Without IV contrast, an integrated PET/CT cannot substitute for a dedicated IV contrast-enhanced CT. At some institutions, PET/CT is carried out with IV contrast, but this practice is not widespread.</p><p>Integrated PET/CT may also be of clinical utility in restaging after induction therapy.

This uses high frequency ultrasound to create detailed images of esophageal masses, the depth of involvement into the five-layered esophageal wall and the extent of locoregional lymph node metastasis. EUS is the most accurate technique for locoregional staging of invasive esophageal cancer (including tumors arising at the EGJ), with an overall accuracy for tumor (T) and node (N) staging of 80 to 90 percent. EUS allows assessment of both perigastric and mediastinal lymph nodes, which may be sampled with a fine needle aspiration biopsy.

For example, only one trial, the German POET trial of neoadjuvant CRT versus induction chemotherapy alone, treated EGJ tumors as a separate entity.</p><p>Most of the data that inform the multimodality treatment of EGJ adenocarcinoma are derived from trials that involved predominantly gastric or esophageal cancers. Within the trials designed primarily for gastric cancer (which will be considered "lower tract trials" for the purpose of this review), patients with EGJ tumors account for only approximately 20 percent of all enrollees [<a href="#rid41">41,42</a>]. There are epidemiologic and pathologic differences between EGJ and non-cardia gastric adenocarcinomas that raise concern as to whether results from predominantly gastric cancer trials can be extrapolated to EGJ tumors. Gastric tumors are associated with <em>H.</em> <em>pylori</em> infection, chronic gastritis, and low acid production, while EGJ tumors tend to be associated with obesity, high acid production, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and are inversely associated with <em>H.</em> <em>pylori</em> [<a href="#rid43">43</a>].

Trials of multimodality therapy for esophageal cancer (which will be designated "upper tract trials" for this review) included a larger percentage of patients with distal esophageal and EGJ adenocarcinomas, although in some cases, the majority were still SCCs. While most clinical studies did not stratify outcomes by histology, increasing evidence supports a difference between SCCs and adenocarcinomas in terms of pathogenesis, epidemiology, tumor biology, and prognosis. Esophageal SCCs are strongly associated with alcohol and tobacco use while adenocarcinomas are associated with gastroesophageal reflux and high body mass index.

Although multimodality treatment was suggested for all locally advanced esophageal carcinomas, the guidelines recommended preoperative CRT or perioperative chemotherapy for those with adenocarcinoma, and preoperative CRT or definitive CRT was recommended for locally advanced SCC.

Although early detection of recurrence can facilitate treatment before the development of symptomatic bulky disease that may be difficult to manage (eg, bowel entrapment from peritoneal metastases), there are no data that support the view that early detection of an asymptomatic recurrence by tumor marker elevation or radiologic imaging improves quality of life or prolongs survival [<a href="#rid124">124,125</a>].

They advise that follow-up visits concentrate on symptoms, nutrition, and psychosocial support. In the case of a complete response to CRT in a patient who did not undergo resection, a three-month follow-up based on endoscopy, biopsy, and CT scan may be recommended to detect early recurrence, leading to a discussion about salvage surgery.</p><p>We disagree with this approach.

For patients with clinicopathologic high-risk features (eg, poorly differentiated or higher grade cancer, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, or age &lt;50) we discuss the relative benefits and risks of adjuvant chemotherapy, with or without RT.
