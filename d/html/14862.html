It is defined pathologically by abnormal and permanent enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles and is associated with destruction of the alveolar walls. Progressive emphysema leads to early airway closure in exhalation, lung hyperinflation, air-trapping, and loss of gas-exchanging surface area, all of which contribute to refractory dyspnea.</p><p>In carefully selected patients with severe COPD, lung volume reduction may be an option to improve their lung function, quality of life, and exercise capacity by decreasing lung hyperinflation.</p><p>Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS; also called reduction pneumoplasty or bilateral pneumectomy) is a surgical treatment for patients with advanced emphysema whose dyspnea is poorly controlled with other standard therapies (eg, short- and long-acting bronchodilators, inhaled glucocorticoids, supplemental oxygen, and pulmonary rehabilitation) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. LVRS entails reducing the lung volume by wedge excisions of emphysematous tissue. However, surgical morbidity is significant and nonpulmonary comorbidities preclude surgical approaches in many patients.</p><p>Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (bLVR) refers to techniques developed to treat hyperinflation due to emphysema using endoscopic approaches. Several options for bLVR exist, but treatment using one-way endobronchial valves is the most studied and has regulatory approval worldwide. Additional bronchoscopic techniques include coils, sealants, and vapor ablation.</p><p>The devices and techniques for bLVR will be reviewed here. The general management of COPD, an overview of flexible bronchoscopy, and the roles of LVRS, bullectomy, and lung transplantation in the management of advanced COPD are discussed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/112250.html" rel="external">"Management of refractory chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4398.html" rel="external">"Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Overview"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1430.html" rel="external">"Lung volume reduction surgery in COPD"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4658.html" rel="external">"Lung transplantation: General guidelines for recipient selection"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12785482"><span class="h1">RATIONALE AND PATIENT SELECTION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1511176815"><span class="h2">Rationale</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Emphysematous destruction of alveolar walls causes loss of elastic recoil, early airway closure during exhalation, and air trapping in the distal air spaces. Air trapping and subsequent hyperinflation press the diaphragm into a flat configuration, rather than its normal domed shape, and place all the muscles of respiration at a mechanical overstretch disadvantage. Furthermore, loss of alveolar walls and formation of emphysematous blebs and bullae results in loss of gas-exchanging surface. Lung volume reduction counteracts some, but not all, of these adverse physiologic effects.</p><p>Although the dominant mechanisms through which lung volume reduction provides benefit are not known with certainty, the following salutary effects have been investigated:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduction in size-mismatch between the (previously hyperinflated) lungs and the chest cavity, thereby restoring the outward circumferential pull on the bronchioles (ie, increasing elastic recoil) and improving expiratory airflow [<a href="#rid2">2-8</a>]. With improved expiratory airflow, the amount of dynamic hyperinflation associated with exercise decreases and consequently reduces exercise-related dyspnea. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1459.html" rel="external">"Dynamic hyperinflation in patients with COPD", section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Improvement in the mechanical function of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles by decreasing the functional residual capacity (FRC; the amount of air left in the lungs after exhalation of a tidal volume breath) and returning the diaphragm to a more normal domed configuration [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduction in the inhomogeneity of regional ventilation and perfusion, resulting in improved ventilation-perfusion matching, alveolar gas exchange, and ventilatory effectiveness [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1430.html" rel="external">"Lung volume reduction surgery in COPD", section on 'Rationale of LVRS'</a>.)</p><p>Among selected patients with advanced upper lobe predominant emphysema, LVRS improved exercise capacity and, in some patients, reduced mortality at two years. However, the morbidity of LVRS is substantial. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1430.html" rel="external">"Lung volume reduction surgery in COPD", section on 'Primary endpoints'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1430.html" rel="external">"Lung volume reduction surgery in COPD", section on 'Complications'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1430.html" rel="external">"Lung volume reduction surgery in COPD", section on 'Long-term outcomes'</a>.)</p><p>Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (bLVR) uses endoscopic methods (eg, valves, sealants, thermal ablation) to collapse areas of overinflated emphysematous lung, which ideally should have a beneficial physiologic effect similar to resecting these areas during LVRS but without the morbidity of surgery. Thus, patients who are not good surgical candidates might be able to undergo bLVR instead. Several bLVR techniques are reversible, which may contribute to increased safety of the procedure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2307733487"><span class="h2">Patient selection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>bLVR is indicated in patients with refractory dyspnea due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) despite optimization of inhaled therapies, evaluation for other causes of dyspnea, and a trial of pulmonary rehabilitation. The management of these patients is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/112250.html" rel="external">"Management of refractory chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"</a>.)</p><p>Typical evaluation and inclusion/exclusion criteria have been established for endobronchial valves  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118859" href="/z/d/graphic/118859.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Most experimental device trials use similar criteria except for the absence of collateral circulation, which is not necessary for several other techniques. (See <a class="local">'Choice of technique'</a> below.)</p><p>A key step in evaluation of potential patients is high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) to measure lobar volumes, determine the amount of emphysematous destruction of each lobe, and to assess for lack of collateral circulation (high-to-complete fissure integrity) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The computed tomography (CT) is also important to rule out other important diseases like bronchiectasis and assess nodules or other findings that may require additional evaluation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2092503518"><span class="h3">Indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The indications for bLVR are still being defined for some investigational techniques but are generally similar to the consensus criteria for endobronchial valves  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118859" href="/z/d/graphic/118859.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), which include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Severe dyspnea (modified Medical Research Council [mMRC] dyspnea scale ≥2;  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86426" href="/z/d/graphic/86426.html" rel="external">table 2</a>)) despite optimal medical therapy and maximal pulmonary rehabilitation</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Longer than four months of smoking cessation</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Marked airflow obstruction on spirometry (forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] less than 45 percent predicted), consistent with the diagnosis of advanced COPD</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lung volume measurements showing air trapping (eg, residual volume [RV] greater than 175 percent predicted, total lung capacity [TLC] greater than 100 percent predicted, and an increased RV/TLC ratio).

Prior major thoracic surgeries, active pulmonary infections, continued tobacco use, severe resting pulmonary physiologic derangements, and active myocardial ischemia or systolic heart failure are contraindications to bLVR therapies. Contraindications for endobronchial valve therapies have been better established  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118859" href="/z/d/graphic/118859.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), and include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cigarette smoking within the prior four months</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Comorbid cardiac illness that would increase surgical mortality (eg, significant coronary heart disease, heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40 percent)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Severe obesity (≥35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inability to complete a 6- to 10-week program of pulmonary rehabilitation</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prior cardiothoracic surgery in the pleural space, including lung transplant, LVRS, or lobectomy</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>End-stage pulmonary disease as defined by severe resting hypoxemia (arterial partial pressure of oxygen [P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]<sub> </sub>&lt;45 mmHg), hypercapnia (arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub> </sub>&gt;60 mmHg), FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;15 percent predicted, six-minute walk distance &lt;100 m</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Active pulmonary infection</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1614319076"><span class="h3">Radiologic evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CT scan plays an important role in bLVR techniques. An HRCT with acquisition of images in inspiration and expiration is typically required. Determination of fissure integrity, severity, and distribution of emphysema are all critical to determine if the patient is appropriate for therapy and to select appropriate target lobes for treatment. The exact protocol for each technology may differ somewhat and it is best to consult the individual companies prior to establishing a local protocol. CT analysis includes the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fissure integrity</strong> – Determination of potential collateral ventilation is essential to establish candidacy for placement of endobronchial valves. Intact lobar fissures prevent collateral ventilation and can be assessed by analyzing HRCT images. In general, if the fissure completeness score is low (&lt;80 percent on the left and &lt;90 percent on right) then success is unlikely for valve placement. Other modalities including surgery may then be considered. (See <a class="local">'Disadvantages (collateral ventilation)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Emphysema severity</strong> – Degree of emphysematous damage can also be calculated from scan images. The destruction score is a term used to give an estimate for how much emphysema is present. Multiple thresholds have been studied, but most agree that a destruction score of at least 30 percent at -950 HU is a minimum requirement for bLVR.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Emphysema distribution</strong> – Analysis of the CT scan can demonstrate which lobes contain the most emphysematous lung as well as which lobes occupy the most volume [<a href="#rid21">21-23</a>]. The combination of these measures, along with fissural integrity, guides lobar selection, with the guiding principle being maximal volume reduction of ineffective lung.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other findings</strong> – Other potential important findings include the presence of pulmonary nodules, interstitial lung disease (ILD), blebs, and others that may have an impact on the decision process. This population almost always has a significantly increased risk of malignancy, so the presence of nodules can be critical to future management. A therapy for volume reduction should not be done in a manner to obscure a suspicious nodule.</p><p></p><p>If multiple lobes are eligible for treatment based on CT findings but no single lobe can be identified as the most appropriate target, many practitioners evaluate perfusion using perfusion scintigraphy or single photon emission CT (SPECT). The area with the lowest perfusion is selected as the target lobe [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12785496"><span class="h1">TECHNIQUES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Over the past 20 years, multiple bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (bLVR) techniques have been introduced with the goal of reducing hyperinflation and subsequently improving exercise capacity and quality of life. Of these techniques, endobronchial valves (EBVs) are the most thoroughly studied. They are the only devices with widespread regulatory approval or inclusion in the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease recommendations [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>] due to demonstrated physiologic improvements and likely survival benefit in selected patients [<a href="#rid28">28-32</a>]. Other investigational bronchoscopic options include airway bypass stents, endobronchial coils, thermal vapor ablation, and polymeric sealants.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H290320755"><span class="h2">Choice of technique</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Each of the bronchoscopic options have an inherently different mechanism of action, so the phenotype of each patient must be kept in mind while making the decision on which technique is most appropriate [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Ideally, the procedural approach should be made in the setting of a multidisciplinary team including pulmonologists, thoracic surgeons, and radiologists. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/112250.html" rel="external">"Management of refractory chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", section on 'Choice of procedure'</a>.)</p><p>In general, most candidates for lung volume reduction who meet criteria for EBV placement  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118859" href="/z/d/graphic/118859.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) should receive either a Zephyr or Spiration EBV, as these techniques are the most rigorously tested and widely available. Patients who do not meet these criteria due to collateral ventilation (lack of intact lobar fissures) are often good candidates for clinical trials of other device types. Other criteria for investigational techniques vary by individual trial. (See <a class="local">'Investigational procedures'</a> below and <a class="local">'Clinical trial sites'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12785503"><span class="h2">Endobronchial valves</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>One-way EBVs have been designed for bronchoscopic placement based on the hypothesis that they will allow air and mucus to exit the treated area, but not allow air to re-enter. The goal of this treatment is to facilitate atelectasis of the emphysematous, hyperinflated lung distal to the valve. This atelectasis leads to effective volume reduction akin to surgical lung volume reduction. EBVs have demonstrated physiologic improvement and likely survival benefit in selected patients with advanced COPD.</p><p>Two different valve designs are available for bLVR. The Zephyr valve is a duckbill-shaped valve housed within a silicone coated nitinol frame. Once deployed it is held in place in the bronchus by the radial forces of the frame. (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76276 graphicRef64484" href="/z/d/graphic/76276.html" rel="external">picture 1A-B</a>). The Spiration valve is an umbrella-shaped valve with a nitinol frame and thin membrane. It uses small anchors that affix into the airway wall to prevent migration  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55269" href="/z/d/graphic/55269.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). Both valves come in a variety of sizes to allow for a best individual fit.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1527752829"><span class="h3">Advantages</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>EBVs may have some technical advantages over other bLVR techniques and are also the only bLVR therapy to demonstrate an improvement in patient survival.</p><p>EBVs can be removed if the patient has no response or develops a complication. Removal is generally straightforward using standard biopsy forceps and a flexible bronchoscope. It can be done under general anesthesia or conscious sedation. The longer a valve is in place, the more likely it is to be challenging to remove due to formation of granulation tissue around the insertion site. Valve removal was successfully performed (less than six months after insertion) in several of the initial randomized controlled trials with minimal difficulty or complications [<a href="#rid28">28-31</a>]. Valve removal can still be done more than six months from implantation but is associated with a more difficult removal and higher rate of failure or complications, though still with an acceptable safety profile [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Valve placement can also be combined with other endobronchial techniques for bLVR.</p><p>Initial trial data demonstrated that EBV therapy can improve lung function, quality of life, and exercise tolerance similar to lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). (See <a class="local">'Zephyr duckbill valve'</a> below and <a class="local">'Spiration umbrella valve'</a> below.)</p><p>Subsequent long-term follow-up of recipients has suggested a modest survival benefit as well. For example, observational follow-up of 353 EBV recipients and 988 evaluated but not treated patients showed the median survival for patients treated with EBV was significantly longer (3133 versus 2503 days, hazard ratio [HR] 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.7) [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].

The EDC can be inserted through the working channel of a bronchoscope under direct vision. The EDC also acts as a sizing mechanism, enabling the bronchoscopist to select the size valve that will best fit that bronchus. There are two sets of sizing "wings" on the EDC. These allow for the appropriately sized valve to be chosen for each individual airway. Four sizes of valve are commonly available (4.0 low-profile, 4.0, 5.5 low-profile, and 5.5, corresponding to the minimum width of the subsegment to be treated).

The flexible frame struts allow for the valve to maintain contact with the airway wall and prevent air from passing inwards while allowing for mucus and air to escape. The five anchors secure the valve in place. This creates a one-way valve effect with the intent of redirecting airflow to more normal areas and/or inducing atelectasis of the emphysematous area blocked by the valve.

The sizing balloon is calibrated and then used to measure the size of the airways the valves will be inserted into. Four sizes of valves can be used. Once the appropriate sizes have been determined, the valves are loaded into a deployment catheter. Then, under direct vision, the valve deployment device is passed through the working channel of the bronchoscope and the valve is deployed. If the valve needs to be repositioned or removed, standard biopsy forceps are used to grab the central rod; when the rod is pulled, the umbrella collapses and can be removed.

Long-term complications include granulation tissue formation, valve malfunction or migration, lobe torsion, and bacterial infection or colonization. Acutely, pneumothorax can be seen commonly and may require urgent or emergent management. Postprocedural COPD exacerbations are also common.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pneumothorax</strong> – The reported prevalence of pneumothorax is between 4 and 34 percent in those treated with valves, but it was seen in between 20 and 30 percent of patients in several of the larger clinical trials [<a href="#rid64">64</a>]. Most (86 percent) EBV-related pneumothoraces occur in the first three days after valve placement and are involved in most of the early procedural mortality [<a href="#rid64">64,65</a>]. Mortality is observed in approximately 0.75 percent of all EBV cases, but in 4.6 percent of patients who develop pneumothorax [<a href="#rid65">65</a>]. Management can be complicated and may require removal of one or more valves.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Most experts feel that pneumothorax after valve placement is due to the volume reduction in the treated lobe causing expansion in the nontreated ipsilateral lobe(s). Pleural adhesions, extension of emphysema, and location of the emphysema (paraseptal) may increase the likelihood of this [<a href="#rid66">66</a>]. The rapidity of atelectasis after valve placement may also increase the risk of shearing damage from ipsilateral lobe expansion. In one small multicenter cohort, use of minimal fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO<sub>2</sub>, mean FIO<sub>2</sub> 0.29) during EBV placement was associated with a large decrease in the incidence of postprocedural pneumothorax (14 of 45 patients using FIO<sub>2</sub> 0.9-1.0 compared with 2 out of 29 patients after initiating a low FIO<sub>2</sub> protocol) [<a href="#rid67">67</a>]. There was also a large change in the timing of pneumothorax, with 9 of 14 pneumothoraces occurring in the first hour of postprocedural monitoring in the high FIO<sub>2</sub> group compared with postoperative day two and six in the low FIO<sub>2</sub> group. Although limited by small numbers and the before-after study design, these observations support the possibility that rapid atelectasis drives pneumothorax in patients receiving high levels of intraoperative oxygen (which is reabsorbed rapidly) and suggest a possible intraoperative strategy to reduce this complication. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Many factors may play a role in the management of a pneumothorax, from the stability of the patient to degree of air leak, length of leak, and more. Large (pneumothorax rim &gt;2 cm from the chest wall) or symptomatic pneumothoraces require immediate drainage with a chest tube, but small pneumothoraces without accompanying pain and dyspnea can be observed with repeat imaging at 4 and 24 hours to confirm lack of enlargement and a trend towards resolution.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">After chest tube placement, appropriate lung reexpansion and cessation of air leak facilitate chest tube removal, which occurs uneventfully in most patients. Failure of lung reexpansion for more than 72 to 96 hours despite adequate wall suction should prompt removal of one valve (generally the most proximal) to facilitate reexpansion; continued poor reexpansion over the ensuing 48 hours can necessitate removal of all the valves. Similarly, persistent air leak for more than seven to ten days prompts removal of a proximal valve and, if necessary, all valves to facilitate reexpansion and healing. Persistent air leak despite valve removal may require pleurodesis or surgical intervention at the site of injury.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If a single proximal valve needs removal for reexpansion or air leak, we will often replace the valve in 6 to 12 weeks if the patient is willing. We do not typically re-attempt valve placement in the affected lobe if all valves require removal.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypoxemia</strong> – Although infection, bleeding, and new COPD exacerbation should also be investigated in this setting, early postprocedural hypoxemia often occurs due to temporary shunting of blood into the progressively atelectatic lobe that is no longer participating in ventilation. This hypoxemia is generally temporary due to adequate hypoxemic vasoconstriction and progressive atelectasis of the affected lung tissue. If the hypoxemia persists for more than 48 hours and no other cause is found, we first discontinue nonessential medications that may interfere with hypoxemic vasoconstriction (eg, calcium channel blockers) and make sure the patient is receiving minimum necessary supplemental oxygen (target O<sub>2</sub> saturation 88 to 92 percent). Persistently worsened hypoxemia without other clinical benefit after treatment is an indication for valve removal.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Central airway distortion</strong> – Successful lobar atelectasis may lead to positional shifts in the remaining lobes and central airways. This can occasionally result in distortion, narrowing, or even torsion of the remaining central airways. The most common clinical manifestation of the distorted airways is mucous retention with persistent cough, but in severe cases, ventilation to the affected lobe may be impaired. CT scans are often suggestive, and bronchoscopy can confirm the diagnosis. In many cases, enhanced expectoration techniques (chest physical therapy, flutter valves) can mitigate this problem in patients for whom the valves were otherwise effective, but in severe cases, the valves can be removed to restore the normal airway position.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hemoptysis</strong> – Minor hemoptysis for a few days after the procedure is common and generally self-limiting. Prolonged hemoptysis in follow up is less common (2 percent in one large series) and warrants bronchoscopic evaluation [<a href="#rid68">68</a>]. Minor granulation tissue-associated hemoptysis can sometimes be monitored or treated with local coagulation therapy; more significant hemoptysis or severe granulation tissue build-up can require removal of the affected valve. We do not replace the valve at the same site after removal, but if removal causes clinical worsening, a new valve can occasionally be placed distal to the prior site after appropriate healing (6 to 12 weeks). Additional treatment options for hemoptysis itself are described elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4333.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of nonlife-threatening hemoptysis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4394.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of life-threatening hemoptysis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pneumonia and COPD exacerbation</strong> – Pneumonia and COPD exacerbation are common in the patient population undergoing EBV placement. The clinical trials generally show increased short-term (within 45 days of the procedure) risk for COPD exacerbation and pneumonia, but there is evidence for possible improvement in these outcomes longer term after valve placement [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. Most trials show an approximately 5 percent one-year incidence of pneumonia, with half of the infections occurring in the treated lobe [<a href="#rid46">46,47,58</a>]. Some centers empirically treat with antibiotics or systemic glucocorticoids at the time of valve placement, although there is no evidence to suggest improvement in outcomes with this strategy. Pneumonia and COPD exacerbations are generally treated medically; however, pneumonia in the treated lobe that is not responsive to both an oral and subsequent intravenous (IV) broad spectrum antibiotic can necessitate temporary removal of valves.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Granulation tissue</strong> – Granulation tissue formation is a medium- to long-term complication of valve placement and occurs idiosyncratically due to inflammatory response to a foreign body and to minor repetitive injury from the valve abutting the airway walls. Severe granulation tissue can result in valve malfunction or misplacement, postobstructive pneumonia, or hemoptysis that may require valve removal. For removal of valves associated with severe granulation tissue, we typically prescribe moderate doses of systemic glucocorticoids (eg, 20 to 40 mg of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a>) for several days before and after removal to facilitate removal and airway healing. Additional airway treatment beyond removal of the valve is rarely necessary. For patients who had highly clinically effective initial valve placement, a valve can be replaced distal to the initial site after several weeks of healing  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef141515" href="/z/d/graphic/141515.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2444258589"><span class="h3">Long-term management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Despite appropriate patient selection, effective valve placement at the time of the procedure, and lack of perioperative complications, some patients will still not benefit from valve therapy. A standard protocolized follow-up may help in capturing those without benefit, identifying reversible tweaks, and appropriately removing valves in those who have not benefited from them [<a href="#rid64">64</a>].</p><p>Recommended follow-up practice includes a one-week check-in; this can be a telephone encounter, virtual visit, or a face-to-face visit. Additional testing, including chest CT, spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusing capacity, should be performed along with a face-to-face visit after six to eight weeks. Patients who clearly have had a positive response can be followed in six months and then yearly for at least five years.</p><p>Earlier follow-up and investigation are appropriate in patients who do not show benefit or if the benefit is transitory. Lack of or loss of benefit can arise for a variety of reasons, including valve migration or valve malfunction. For example, formation of granulation tissue is well described and can result in impaired valve performance. Initial evaluation includes an HRCT using a similar protocol to the one done preprocedurally; this may anatomically identify the culprit valve. The HRCT also may directly reveal valve migration, loss of atelectasis, or an obvious infection. Even in the absence of CT findings, a repeat bronchoscopy with inspection of the valves is reasonable, as direct visualization can often reveal otherwise occult causes of valve malfunction. Valve removal and repositioning may be all that is required to address the loss of benefit. Steroids and/or antibiotics may be added if there is significant mucus or culture positive specimen. Occasionally, the severity of infection or granulation tissue at a valve site requires removal of the valve, with later replacement after resolution of airway inflammation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2626039055"><span class="h2">Investigational procedures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Nitinol coils, airway sealants, and thermal airway ablation are alternative bronchoscopic treatments that facilitate atelectasis of lung tissue regardless of the presence of collateral circulation.

Several sizes are available to the operator (100, 125, and 150 mm) [<a href="#rid69">69</a>]. The coils are deployed through the working channel of a flexible bronchoscope in a straightened configuration into subsegmental airways and out into the lung parenchyma. As they are released, they resume their coiled shape and thereby increase tension in the parenchyma in that area, leading to improved airway tethering  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93172" href="/z/d/graphic/93172.html" rel="external">image 1</a>).

After the partial success of this method, a revised technique (called BioLVR) was developed that added chondroitin sulfate and poly-L-lysine to the fibrin mixture. A hydrogel is created when the fibrin and thrombin solutions mix, theoretically providing a scaffold for fibroblast attachment and collagen synthesis that promotes scarring and prevents future recanalization of the treated area. An alternative method uses a synthetic polymeric foam sealant called emphysematous lung sealant (ELS).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Potential uses</strong> – One potential advantage of sealants may be direct blocking of interalveolar and bronchiolar-alveolar pores and channels, eradicating collateral ventilation [<a href="#rid75">75</a>].

It is hypothesized that instilling a limited amount of AeriSeal in an area with collateral ventilation could lead to closure of an incomplete fissure. This could allow for valve treatment in a population that was previously excluded due to lack of response.

The bronchoscope is introduced into an airway leading to emphysematous alveoli and moved into wedged position, completely occluding the segment or subsegment to be treated. Suction is applied through the bronchoscope to collapse the distal airways in that segment [<a href="#rid75">75,76</a>]. An enzymatic primer solution (eg, porcine trypsin) is instilled to promote detachment of epithelial cells from the target region. After two minutes, the primer is removed by suction and 10 mL of cell culture media is used to wash out residual primer. Next, a dual lumen catheter with the thrombin mixture in one lumen and the fibrin mixture in the other is placed through the wedged bronchoscope. The contents of the two lumens are instilled, followed by 60 mL of air to push the solutions distally. The solutions mix as they are simultaneously delivered to the distal airway and alveoli. The liquid component is thought to fill the alveoli prior to complete polymerization, thus blocking collateral ventilation. Each subsegmental application takes approximately 10 minutes and four to eight subsegments are treated during a single procedure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Efficacy</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>BioLVR – In a preliminary human study of hydrogel-based lung volume reduction, 22 patients with upper lobe predominant emphysema were treated with 20 mL of hydrogel/subsegment and 28 patients with 10 mL/subsegment [<a href="#rid77">77</a>]. The six-month follow-up revealed a greater improvement in forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV<sub>1</sub>, and RV in the higher dose group compared with the low-dose group. No significant change in the six-minute walk test was seen in either group compared with baseline. Chest CT at six months revealed scarring and atelectasis in the previously hyperinflated area in the high-dose, but not the low-dose group  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57927" href="/z/d/graphic/57927.html" rel="external">image 2</a>). Similar findings were reported in a study of 25 patients with bilateral homogeneous emphysema in whom high- or low-dose hydrogel was administered to eight subsegments [<a href="#rid78">78</a>]. In a separate observational trial, targeting a single lobe led to a greater improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> at 12 weeks after the procedure than treating scattered subsegments in both upper lobes [<a href="#rid79">79</a>]. It is hypothesized that full treatment of one lobe prevented collateral ventilation, leading to sustained lobar collapse and a better functional result [<a href="#rid76">76</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>ELS – In a randomized trial of polymer-based lung volume reduction, 57 patients were randomly assigned to ELS (two subsegments in each upper lobe) plus medical therapy or medical therapy alone and followed for six months. Significant improvements from baseline were noted in lung function, dyspnea, and quality of life at three months when compared with control, and the benefits persisted for six months [<a href="#rid80">80</a>]. However, clinically important adverse events requiring hospitalization occurred in 44 percent of the treatment group, in addition to two deaths. The study was terminated early due to financial problems. In the STAGE trial, patients underwent a staged, lower dose ELS administration protocol in an attempt to minimize the number of adverse events [<a href="#rid81">81</a>]. The modified protocol did not impact the overall safety profile. Lobar reduction was achieved, but there were not any clinically relevant changes; a larger dose may be needed to demonstrate efficacy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complications</strong> – Over 90 percent of patients treated with sealants experience flu-like symptoms such as fever, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, nausea, headache, malaise, and leukocytosis within 24 hours of the procedure [<a href="#rid76">76,82</a>]. These symptoms resolve in 24 to 48 hours. Later inflammatory events including pneumonia, pleural effusions, and COPD exacerbations appear to occur more commonly in patients receiving sealants, particularly when higher doses are used [<a href="#rid80">80</a>]. As distinguishing between infection and inflammation can be difficult, typically both antibiotics and glucocorticoids are used.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H472953628"><span class="h3">Thermal airway ablation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The technique of thermal airway ablation involves using a specialized catheter via a flexible bronchoscope to administer steam vapor directly to segmental airways [<a href="#rid83">83</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient selection</strong> – Inclusion criteria are similar to those used for other bLVR modalities, with additional consideration of exacerbation history and immune status because these may increase the risk of complications. Selection of segments to be treated is based on a quantitative CT scan, much like that used for EBV placement. This CT is also used to calculate the volume of vapor needed [<a href="#rid84">84</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Procedure</strong> – The procedure utilizes a reusable vapor generator with a disposable bronchoscopic catheter that delivers heated water vapor to the targeted airways. During the procedure, a vapor occlusion balloon is inflated to protect other airways from the heated vapor. The goal is to induce an inflammatory response that will result in occlusion and atelectasis of that segment. Ideally, the complication rate will be lower than with bronchial valve techniques as no foreign body is left in place. The procedure is typically performed under general anesthesia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Efficacy</strong> – Preliminary data of targeted thermal ablation show promise in improving respiratory physiology and quality of life in selected patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a multicenter trial from 13 European and 3 Australian sites, 69 patients were randomly assigned to targeted thermal ablation (n = 45) or standard medical management (n = 24) [<a href="#rid85">85</a>]. At six months post-treatment, patients receiving targeted thermal vapor ablation of more diseased segments with preservation of less diseased segments demonstrated improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> (+130 mL compared with standard management, 95% CI 65-200 mL) and quality of life (Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD patients [SGRQ-C] -9·7 points [95% CI -15·7 to -3·7]). The most frequent complication was COPD exacerbation (24 versus 4 percent). One patient died 84 days after treatment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a multicenter observational study, 44 patients with upper lobe predominant emphysema underwent unilateral bronchoscopic thermal airway ablation or sham bronchoscopy [<a href="#rid86">86</a>]. At six months, FEV<sub>1</sub> was improved by 140±30 mL over baseline. Exercise tolerance (6MWD, +47 m), and quality of life (mMRC dyspnea scale, +0.9; SGRQ, +14) also improved, with 73 percent of patients demonstrating clinically meaningful improvements. Adverse events included exacerbations of COPD, pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infection, and hemoptysis. One patient died during an exacerbation of COPD two months after the procedure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complications</strong> – Like other bLVR techniques, pneumonia, pneumonitis, and COPD exacerbations are common; infrequently hemoptysis and pneumothorax can also occur. As with polymer sealants, identifying the difference between pneumonitis and pneumonia can be a challenge; after thermal ablation, these are treated similarly with both antibiotics and glucocorticoids [<a href="#rid84">84,87</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12785538"><span class="h1">CLINICAL TRIAL SITES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A listing of active clinical trials in this area may be found at <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov%2F&amp;token=Rti1NBSWdX%2F%2FH%2FlCKGrzlGu03gYcMJXuTK3xOgZRWSzRV8srxVomMWotD038y2Xv&amp;TOPIC_ID=14862" target="_blank">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a> using the search terms "bronchoscopy" and "emphysema."</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1678618576"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (bLVR) was developed to collapse areas of emphysematous lung in hopes of having the same effect on respiratory function as LVRS but without the morbidity and mortality of surgery. (See <a class="local">'Rationale and patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient population</strong> – Based on the inclusion criteria for the pivotal clinical trials, candidates for endobronchial valve (EBV) placement should have emphysema, a modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea score ≥2  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86426" href="/z/d/graphic/86426.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) despite optimized medical therapy, postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) between 15 and 45 percent predicted, total lung capacity (TLC) ≥100 percent predicted, residual volume (RV) ≥175 percent predicted, and a six-minute walk distance (6MWD) between 100 and 500 m following supervised pulmonary rehabilitation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118859" href="/z/d/graphic/118859.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Criteria for investigational techniques may vary slightly but have been largely similar in most trials. (See <a class="local">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Contraindications</strong> – Common relative contraindications include prior major cardiothoracic surgeries in the pleural space, active pulmonary infections, continued tobacco use, severe resting pulmonary physiologic derangements (arterial partial pressure of oxygen [P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub>] &lt;45 mmHg, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide [P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>] &gt;60 mmHg, FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;15 percent predicted), and active myocardial ischemia or systolic heart failure. (See <a class="local">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Techniques</strong> – Proposed techniques for bLVR include endobronchial placement of one-way EBVs, plugs, and coils; biologic sealants; and thermal ablation. EBV placement is the most available and well-studied treatment for patients with refractory dyspnea and emphysema who have a high degree of fissure integrity based on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) or other testing. The use of plugs, blockers, and stents has been abandoned due to adverse effects. The other options remain investigational. (See <a class="local">'Techniques'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Endobronchial valves</strong> – Two types of EBV are available for bLVR. The Zephyr EBV uses a duckbill mechanism  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76276" href="/z/d/graphic/76276.html" rel="external">picture 1A</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64484" href="/z/d/graphic/64484.html" rel="external">picture 1B</a>), while the Spiration EBV is umbrella-shaped and expands on inhalation and contracts on exhalation  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55269" href="/z/d/graphic/55269.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). Both EBVs prevent air from entering the bronchus during inhalation but allow air and secretions to pass around or through the device during exhalation, thus leading to atelectasis of the lobe.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">EBV placement leads to modest improvements in lung function, quality of life, and possibly mortality but carries a significant short-term risk of pneumothorax. Placement of EBVs requires specialized training and equipment. (See <a class="local">'Endobronchial valves'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/112250.html" rel="external">"Management of refractory chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", section on 'Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Follow-up assessment by CT imaging verifies expected target-lobe volume loss – failure of initial atelectasis or reexpansion after initial atelectasis should prompt CT and bronchoscopic reevaluation.
