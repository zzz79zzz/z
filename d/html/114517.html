Successful transitions typically require a scope of services, generally best provided by organizations with the capacity to provide a full spectrum of psychological, medical, and surgical care. Medical treatment often includes hormones to expose sex steroid-responsive target tissues to more estrogen and block androgen action. Commonly performed surgeries include facial feminization (craniomaxillofacial procedures), chest ("top") surgery (eg, breast augmentation), and genital ("bottom") surgery (eg, orchiectomy and vaginoplasty). Knowledge of these commonly performed procedures and the surgical techniques used will aid medical care providers in caring for transgender and gender-diverse patients before, during, and after the transition process, and may help in the assessment and management of complications related to these surgeries.</p><p>This topic will review surgeries that are commonly performed as part of feminizing transition. Other topics related to the care of transgender persons include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/109911.html" rel="external">"Transgender men: Evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7456.html" rel="external">"Transgender women: Evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/82964.html" rel="external">"Primary care of transgender individuals"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the terms "woman/en" or "patient(s)" as they are used in the studies presented.

Transitioning involves learning to express and live socially in the individual's desired gender role and may include feminizing or masculinizing hormone therapy and/or surgical procedures (known as gender affirmation surgery), depending on the individual's personal goals [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Mental health care and social support play a critical role throughout the transition process, and a multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of transgender individuals is recommended. Treatment, including hormonal therapy and/or surgery, is medically necessary to alleviate gender dysphoria in many individuals, and with treatment, many distressing symptoms may be alleviated [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>]. A study of 2015 survey data reported that undergoing one of more types of gender-affirming surgery was associated with reduced rates of past-month psychological distress, past-year smoking, and past-year suicidal ideation [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. </p><p>Surgical options include feminizing procedures, breast ("top") surgery, and genital ("bottom") surgery. These procedures can be performed independently or in combination. The incidence of gender-affirming genital surgery appears to be increasing. An observational study of the United States National Inpatient Sample reported that, for inpatients with a diagnostic code for transsexualism or gender-identity disorder undergoing gender-affirming surgery, the incidence of genital surgery increased from 72 to 84 percent between the time periods 2000 to 2005 and 2006 to 2011 [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Approximately 44 percent of patients had insurance coverage for these procedures (private insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid), which, in part, reflects data indicating that transgender care is both affordable and cost-effective [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. This increase in gender-affirming genital surgery highlights the need to prospectively assess quality metrics such as treatment efficacy and patient-centered outcomes (including patient satisfaction, complications, and reversal surgery), as well as ensure proper clinical training of surgeons and other health care providers. </p><p>A broad overview of the care of transgender individuals, including presentation, assessment, diagnosis, and medical management, is covered separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7456.html" rel="external">"Transgender women: Evaluation and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/109911.html" rel="external">"Transgender men: Evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H307139771"><span class="h2">WPATH Standards of Care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH; formerly known as the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association) is an international professional society dedicated to promoting the highest evidence-based principles for the care of transsexual, transgender, and gender-diverse people [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wpath.org%2Fsoc8&amp;token=OqHbRR0lt%2FUEOwSsKCcy78fWPwAZftZUkJq2mRkHvWRFJFmfwFx51LpopOcDs6uu&amp;TOPIC_ID=114517" target="_blank">The Standards of Care</a> (SOC) are a series of flexible guidelines for clinical practice set forth by the society based on evidence and expert consensus and may be modified to meet the needs of an individual [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

The decision to stop or continue <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9422" href="/z/d/drug information/9422.html" rel="external">estradiol</a> perioperatively must balance the individual's risk factors, mode of estrogen administration, and potential side effects of cessation [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The concern is that continuation of exogenous estrogen at doses used for transfeminine individuals may significantly increase their risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) during and after surgery. Management strategies include estrogen cessation for two to four weeks preoperatively, estrogen continuation but at a reduced dose, and estrogen continuation at usual levels. The decision is individualized based on patient risk factors, benefits of continued treatment, type of surgery, anticipated recovery (eg, mobility expectations), and mode of estrogen administration (oral versus transdermal) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7456.html" rel="external">"Transgender women: Evaluation and management", section on 'Estrogen therapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Drug cessation</strong> – Some experts discontinue estrogen therapy two to four weeks prior to surgery to reduce VTE risk [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. However, absolute benefits of VTE reduction with this approach compared with risks of abrupt hypoestrogenism (eg, hot flashes, mood changes) are not yet known and may be small. A retrospective review of 407 transfeminine individuals undergoing labiaplasty with (n = 212) and without (n = 190) estrogen use reported only one episode of VTE, which occurred in a patient whose hormones had been stopped preoperatively [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Continuation with dose reduction</strong> – The rationale for this approach is to limit the risk of estrogen-induced VTE without increasing side effects of abrupt hypoestrogenism. The authors reduce the estrogen dose to 1 mg of oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9422" href="/z/d/drug information/9422.html" rel="external">estradiol</a> starting three weeks prior to the surgery. The same regimen is used for patients using transdermal formulations of estradiol. Alternatively, transdermal dosing can be maintained at 0.1 mg per day leading up to surgery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Continuation at usual dose</strong> – This approach avoids potential side effects of reduced estrogen levels, including hot flashes, night sweats, and mood disturbance. The absolute increased risk of postoperative VTE with this approach is not known and likely varies by type of surgery, postoperative mobility, and patient risk factors. In our experience, most surgeons performing feminizing gender-affirming surgery do not use this approach for the management of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9422" href="/z/d/drug information/9422.html" rel="external">estradiol</a> in the perioperative period. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intraoperative</strong> – Estrogen therapy is not dosed during the surgical procedure. The patient should receive prophylaxis against VTE, as appropriate for the individual's risk factors and the type of procedure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1339.html" rel="external">"Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in adult nonorthopedic surgical patients"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Postoperative</strong> – There are no data to support current practice as it relates to estrogen dosing after surgery. In our practice, we allow patients to restart their low-dose 1 mg oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9422" href="/z/d/drug information/9422.html" rel="external">estradiol</a> one week postoperatively for the subsequent two weeks following their surgery. Once this time period has passed, they are allowed to resume their prescribed preoperative regimens. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7456.html" rel="external">"Transgender women: Evaluation and management", section on 'Estrogen therapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H130991688"><span class="h2">Lack of standardized and validated reporting outcomes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Available outcomes data for gender-affirming surgeries are mainly retrospective and nonvalidated. There is a pressing need to identify and describe patient-centered outcomes for these procedures to facilitate patient care and reporting of research [<a href="#rid10">10-12</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2179067173"><span class="h2">Brief history of vaginoplasty surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While cases have been reported throughout history of males feminized by means of castration, "sex-reassignment surgery" (now referred to as gender affirmation<em> </em>surgery) was not described before the 20<sup>th</sup> century. The first feminizing genital surgeries were performed in the 1930s in Germany. At that time, the term "transsexual" had been coined by the sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld, who cared for and studied transgender individuals.</p><p>Lili Elbe, a Danish transgender woman, is historically regarded as one of the first to undergo gender affirmation surgery in Dresden, Germany, in the 1930s. She underwent several surgeries and died from complications related to her final surgery. Wide publicity and attention was brought to the United States in the 1950s when Christine Jorgensen, a former United States Army soldier, was the first American to undergo gender affirmation surgery in Europe.</p><p>In the late 1950s, the French plastic surgeon Dr. Georges Burou was one of the first to publish the modern penile inversion vaginoplasty technique. Modifications of this technique are still commonly used today. Nearly a decade after Dr. Burou's work, gender affirmation surgery became available at a few academic centers in the United States, including Johns Hopkins Medical Center and Stanford University. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a shift in paradigm occurred, with most surgeries performed by private practicing surgeons. These operations have returned to academic centers in the United States and formal training programs for this type of surgery now exist.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2241212865"><span class="h2">Fertility preservation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Gender-affirming surgeries such as orchiectomy and vaginoplasty irreversibly inhibit the ability for people to have genetically related children in the future. Many transgender women have an expressed interest in fertility [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Fertility preservation techniques such as semen cryopreservation or the surgical retrieval or cryopreservation of sperm, followed by use of assisted reproductive technologies, can provide transgender women with the ability to have biologic children after competition of gender-affirming surgeries. WPATH guidelines advise that fertility preservation be reviewed with patients prior to gender affirmation treatments that involve reproductive structures [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. People undergoing orchiectomy and/or vaginoplasty are advised to use gender-affirming hormones for at least a year prior to surgery. Therefore, most transgender women seeking surgery have already had a discussion with a hormone providing provider about future fertility. However, it prudent to review this again prior to fertility-impacting gender-affirming surgeries. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7440.html" rel="external">"Fertility and reproductive hormone preservation: Overview of care prior to gonadotoxic therapy or surgery"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/121395.html" rel="external">"Fertility preservation: Cryopreservation options"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1986892965"><span class="h1">NONGENITAL/NONBREAST SURGERIES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Nongenital/nonbreast surgeries include a range of feminizing surgeries. While facial feminization and thyroid cartilage reduction are discussed here, other feminizing procedures include body contouring (eg, liposuction) and body implants (eg, buttock implants). WPATH has published recommended criteria that need to be met by patients considering and clinicians performing these types of surgeries [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Patients should be fully counseled and informed of the risks and benefits prior to proceeding with surgery [<a href="#rid1">1,14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3589560689"><span class="h2">Facial feminization surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many different components of the face, including individual features (such as the eyes, jaw, or brow), facial configuration, and dimensional structure contribute to an individual's desired gender  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115589" href="/z/d/graphic/115589.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. While facial surgery may be regarded by some as cosmetic, feminizing alterations to the face may lead to reduction in gender dysphoria, high patient satisfaction, and greater social acceptance of transgender women [<a href="#rid3">3,14,17</a>]. Since 2013, the number of patients seeking facial feminization surgery in the United States has risen exponentially [<a href="#rid18">18</a>], likely as a result of increased insurance coverage for certain procedures. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Components</strong> – Facial feminization surgery aims to feminize masculine features of the face through a wide variety of craniomaxillofacial procedures, frequently performed by specialized plastic surgeons [<a href="#rid14">14,19,20</a>].

However, not all studies specifically reviewed surgical complications, and this finding should be interpreted with caution. While patient satisfaction appeared high, many of the included studies were limited by use of nonvalidated techniques or instruments for measuring satisfaction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Patient-reported outcomes</strong> – In a retrospective analysis of 33 patients who underwent a total of 180 facial feminization operations with a minimum follow-up of 24 months, all patients reported improvement in quality of life, measured as positive responses to a survey assessing physical, emotional, and social domains [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. When assessed objectively by independent surgeons, aesthetic improvement was noted to be "very much improved" in nearly 88 percent and "significantly improved" in 12 percent [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. No major postoperative complications were observed in this study.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2303492972"><span class="h2">Thyroid cartilage reduction (chondrolaryngoplasty)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The laryngeal prominence, or Adam's apple, is perceived as a distinctly male characteristic. Chondrolaryngoplasty, also known as thyroid cartilage reduction or Adam's apple reduction, involves excision of the superior thyroid notch and rim, reducing the appearance of the laryngeal prominence and altering the contour of the anterior neck to achieve a more feminine appearance  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115593" href="/z/d/graphic/115593.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>) [<a href="#rid14">14,22,23</a>]. In natal men, the thyroid lamina fuse in the midline at an approximate 90-degree angle, forming a more pronounced laryngeal prominence and contributing to greater vocal cord length and a deeper voice compared with the natal woman, in whom fusion of the thyroid lamina occurs at approximately 120 degrees [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].

Hair removal should be performed on the areas of the scrotum and perineum that will be used to line the neovagina (posterior to the penile shaft, approximately 2 cm medial to the groin creases and 4 to 5 cm anterior to the anus). The procedures may be performed on other genital hair-bearing areas, or they may be left intact to achieve the individual's desired hair distribution and aesthetic outcome following surgery.

Modified bowel preparation regimens may involve a combination of clear liquid diet the day prior to surgery and mechanical bowel preparation or enemas. Rectal wash out is performed at the time of surgery with povidone-iodine solution.

Patients should be counseled that each body is different and results will vary depending on body habitus, tissue availability, and other individual medical factors such as a history of prostatic disease. The most commonly performed technique, especially in the United States, is the penile inversion vaginoplasty. Many modifications of this technique exist, and one of these modifications is described below. Intestinal vaginoplasty procedures are also performed and described. Graft materials are mainly used in revision surgeries.</p><p><strong>Orchiectomy</strong> –<strong> </strong>Some patients undergo removal of the testes only.<strong> </strong>For some patients this is the final stage of their gender affirmation surgical process while for others it is a first step in their pursuit of genital gender affirmation. Patients who choose to undergo orchiectomy often only have intolerance to anti-androgen therapy or have a challenging time suppressing their endogenous androgens despite anti-androgen therapy. Other patients experience significant genital dysphoria as a result of their testes and benefit from their removal. </p><p>The procedure can be done in the outpatient setting. A 3 cm incision is made in the midline of the scrotum below the penis and the testes are brought to the incision. The spermatic cord is skeletonized and then suture ligated, after which the testes are removed. Patients seeking further genital reconstruction following orchiectomy remain good candidates for the surgery as no genital skin is disturbed or removed during this procedure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H407037247"><span class="h3">Vulvoplasty procedures ("no depth" or "zero depth" vaginoplasty)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some patients choose not to undergo the creation of the vaginal canal as part of their surgical transition and request a feminizing genital surgery that involves construction of the female external genitalia only. This procedure is becoming more common among surgeons who perform feminizing genital surgery. Vulvoplasty alone is also commonly performed in patients who have a history of prostate cancer who have undergone prostatectomy and/or radiation treatment in order to reduce the surgical risks associated with the creation of a vaginal canal. In the majority of cases, however, the choice to undergo vulvoplasty alone is based on patient preference rather than contraindications to performing the vaginal reconstructive portion of the procedure [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3353206778"><span class="h3">Penile inversion vaginoplasty</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common technique performed for primary male-to-female transgender vaginoplasty is penile inversion vaginoplasty [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. The technique has been widely researched and described, and modifications have been made over time to improve aesthetic outcome and functional results [<a href="#rid42">42-44</a>]. Penile inversion vaginoplasty is irreversible and generally includes orchiectomy (if not previously performed), penile deconstruction, formation of a sensate neoclitoris from a portion of the glans penis on its dorsal neurovascular pedicle, creation of a neourethral meatus, creation of a vaginal cavity and lining of the neovagina with local penoscrotal skin flaps, and labiaplasty to create an aesthetic and feminine external appearance of the genitalia. Surgery may be performed by a variety of surgical specialists in plastic surgery, urology, gynecology, and female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery. </p><p>We use the following technique in performing modified penile inversion vaginoplasty, which is also presented in the video  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef115676" href="/z/d/graphic/115676.html" rel="external">movie 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The scrotal flap, which will later be used to line the neovagina, is marked  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115678" href="/z/d/graphic/115678.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>). The borders of the graft are the base of the penile shaft anteriorly, 2 to 4 cm medial to the groin creases laterally, and 4 to 5 cm above the anus posteriorly. The flap is incised sharply, then excised from the underlying subcutaneous tissue using electrosurgery. To prepare the graft, all excess subcutaneous tissue is removed sharply, creating a split thickness skin graft. If hair removal is suboptimal, remaining hair follicles can be electrosurgically coagulated. The graft is kept moist with saline-soaked sponges.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Next, electrosurgery is used to remove excess subcutaneous tissue by skeletonizing the underlying penile structures down to Buck fascia.

If excess distal penile skin is present, the distal penile skin and prepuce may be left intact with the glans for later creation of a clitoral hood and labia minora. The penile structures are then sharply de-epithelized leaving a penile tube. The suspensory ligament of the penis is released. A urinary catheter is placed to drain the bladder.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Attention is then turned to creation of the neovagina. A transverse incision is made in the perineum below the bulbous urethra, transecting the perineal tendon and creating a cavity by separating the levator ani muscles laterally  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115684" href="/z/d/graphic/115684.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>). Dissection is performed, first sharply and then bluntly.

Care is taken to delineate the borders of the rectum and to palpate the urinary catheter during the dissection to avoid injury to the rectum or lower urinary tract. Dissection is carried past the level of the prostatic urethra anterior to the rectoprostatic fascia for a total length of approximately 15 cm  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115686" href="/z/d/graphic/115686.html" rel="external">figure 10</a>). Once adequate caliber and depth are achieved, meticulous hemostasis is obtained to avoid hematoma formation. A bubble test may be performed to assess for rectal injury by filling the neovagina with irrigation solution, then insufflating the rectum using a large syringe. If bubbles are seen in the neovaginal cavity, further investigation for rectal injury should be performed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Attention is returned to the penile structures. A dorsal flap containing the dorsal penile neurovascular blood supply to the neoclitoris (created from a portion of the dorsal glans penis) and a ventral urethral flap are created.

The procedure uses similar techniques to the penile inversion vaginoplasty with regard to penile deconstruction and reconstruction of the vulvar structures. However, peritoneum is mobilized abdominally using conventional or robotic-assisted laparoscopically to elongate the distally grafted neovagina. This procedure is sometimes performed for patients with hypoplasia of the male genitalia (eg, cases of puberty suppression in younger patients) and cases of revision surgery when vaginal stenosis has occurred [<a href="#rid52">52</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H630443432"><span class="h2">Postoperative care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Postoperatively, pain is controlled with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia and, once diet is advanced, oral narcotic pain medication.

Options for revision include intestinal vaginoplasty, use of full-thickness skin grafts from various donor sites, or a peritoneal pull-through procedure. Each technique carries different and specific advantages and disadvantages. Intestinal vaginoplasty provides depth, natural lubrication, and lower risk of stenosis but confers the risk of bowel-related complications. The use of full-thickness skin grafts is less invasive and avoids abdominal surgery, but carries complications related to skin grafting including donor site scarring, graft contracture, and poor graft taking.</p><p>A retrospective comparison of laparoscopic intestinal vaginoplasty versus perineal full-thickness skin graft vaginoplasty performed in 50 transgender women and 3 cisgender women reported two rectal perforations (10 percent) and one bladder neck injury in the intestinal group and six rectal perforations (19 percent; p = 0.46) in the full-thickness perineal skin graft group [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. Operative time was significantly shorter for the perineal skin graft group (130±35 minutes) than for the laparoscopic intestinal vaginoplasty group (191±45 minutes; p &lt;0.01). Intraoperative intestinal neovaginal length was significantly greater after intestinal vaginoplasty, but adequate intraoperative depth was able to be achieved in 31 of 32 skin graft vaginoplasties. Both groups were hospitalized for a mean of eight days. Complications in the laparoscopic intestinal vaginoplasty group leading to prolonged hospitalization included fecal peritonitis in a patient with intraoperative rectal perforation, stenosis of the anastomosis, and intestinal torsion. In the perineal skin graft group, prolonged hospitalization occurred secondary to rectal perforation in three patients and superficial wound infection in one patient. In long-term follow-up (median 3.8 years, range 1.1 to 19.7 years), nearly all sigmoid neovaginas (90 percent) and perineal skin graft neovaginas (80 percent; p = 0.45) were of adequate depth for intercourse. Two sigmoid neovaginas required removal, one due to compromised vasculature and necrosis, the other due to excessive fibrosis. Five cases of complete stenosis were observed in the perineal skin graft group. Other complications in the intestinal group included one case of neovaginal prolapse and two cases of introital stenosis. In the skin graft group, three patients underwent revision of the labia majora, and two were treated for granulation tissue at the neovaginal apex.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H771829200"><span class="h3">Patients on puberty blockers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Adolescents who meet eligibility and readiness criteria may initiate hormone therapy beginning with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) puberty hormone suppression, later incorporating cross-sex steroids for development of secondary sexual characteristics congruent with the individual's gender identity [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].

Corpus spongiosum bleeding is typically treated by applying pressure or hemostatic agents as suturing this delicate tissue often worsens the bleeding. Excessive bleeding may also occur during the neovaginal dissection and result from disruption of branches of the inferior gluteal, inferior vesical, and pudendal vascular supply to the levator ani [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. Surgical management with direct visualization and ligation of bleeding vessels is preferred. Interventional radiology embolization of bleeding vessels is generally not recommended, as this may compromise the flaps and result in flap necrosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Rectal injury</strong> – In cases of intraoperative rectal injury, primary layered closure may be undertaken, and a protective colostomy may be considered to allow for wound healing and prevention of rectovaginal fistula formation. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Urinary tract injury</strong> – Urethral or bladder injuries are typically managed with primary layered closure and prolonged urinary catheter drainage. Ureteral injury is a rare complication as the ureters are not in close proximity to the operative field. If a ureteral injury is suspected, or if a cystotomy is encountered near the bladder trigone that raises concern for ureteral compromise, intraoperative specialist consultation can be obtained to discuss possible imaging (eg, retrograde pyelogram) and ureteral stenting. No specific surgical considerations are needed to address the fact that these patients have a prostate. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Immediate postoperative</strong> – In the immediate postoperative period, bleeding, hematoma or seroma, wound infection or abscess, wound dehiscence, flap necrosis, or VTE may be observed. Postoperative rectovaginal or pararectal abscess or feculent vaginal discharge should alert the surgeon to the possibility of an undetected rectal injury, and further investigation including imaging and/or examination under anesthesia is recommended. Neovaginal prolapse may require local excision in the setting of a sigmoid neovagina if the prolapse is limited to mucosa only, or neovaginopexy may be performed for complete prolapse.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Late postoperative</strong> – Late postoperative complications include neovaginal or introital stenosis, genitourinary or rectovaginal fistula formation, abdominal urinary stream (ie, upward or abnormal urinary stream), urethral meatal stenosis, and sexual dysfunction. Patients with significant complications should be referred to the original surgeon or to a surgeon with expertise in vaginoplasty techniques for assessment and management. In cases of vaginal stenosis, revision surgery may be indicated for severe stenosis (complete neovaginal revision) or an obvious skin bridge or scar obstructing the introits (introitus plasty). Other cases of neovaginal or introital stenosis may be managed conservatively with neovaginal dilation. Urethral meatal stenosis often presents as abnormal urinary stream spraying and may be addressed by release of the stenosis or revision of an obstructing skin bridge. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Minor postoperative complications that can be managed in the office may include vaginal spotting, vaginitis, and hair growth in the neovagina. Vaginal spotting often occurs secondary to granulation tissue formation in the neovagina and can be managed locally with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9888" href="/z/d/drug information/9888.html" rel="external">silver nitrate</a> or excision. A trial of vaginal estrogen may be acceptable, although there is no evidence for this intervention. Yeast vaginitis may occur as a result of the warm, moist neovaginal environment, and postoperative skin sloughing may also contribute to symptoms of excessive discharge and malodor [<a href="#rid56">56</a>]. Douching with a vinegar or povidone-iodine solution, or with a mixture of baby soap and warm water may be recommended for routine hygiene [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. If preoperative hair removal procedures are not performed or are inadequate, excessive hair growth within the neovagina may lead to tangling and knotting, which requires trimming and removal in the office setting.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2073149423"><span class="h3">Incidence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The overall risk of major complication from gender-affirming vaginoplasty is relatively low.
