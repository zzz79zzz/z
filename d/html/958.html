         In contrast to the standard electrocardiogram (ECG), which provides a brief sample of cardiac electrical activity over 10 seconds, ambulatory ECG monitoring provides a view of ECG data over an extended period of time, thereby permitting evaluation of dynamic and transient cardiac electrical phenomena. The most common ambulatory ECG application is in the diagnosis and assessment of cardiac arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities (symptomatic or asymptomatic) or the presence of potential arrhythmias (such as in patients with syncope or presyncope); however, ambulatory ECG also has a role in stratification of certain cardiomyopathies, in assessing the effectiveness of arrhythmia therapy, and in the evaluation of silent ischemia.

         Ambulatory ECG monitoring, which can be performed using a variety of techniques for as short as 24 to 48 hours and for as long as months to years  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ), offers the opportunity to review cardiac ECG data during routine activity, as well as during periods of physical and psychological stress. Ambulatory ECG monitoring for longer periods (when compared with standard ECG for a 10-second time period) is more sensitive for detecting spontaneous, often highly variable cardiac arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities [

         Ambulatory monitoring, in conjunction with clinical and ECG findings, can be a useful component in the evaluation of the patient with unexplained syncope, presyncope, or palpitations. A detailed discussion of the evaluation of syncope and palpitations, including the role of ambulatory monitors, is presented separately. (See

         Ambulatory ECG monitoring is the most widely employed technology for the evaluation of a patient with symptoms suggestive of cardiac arrhythmia or conduction abnormality. Professional society guidelines on ambulatory ECG recommend ambulatory ECG monitoring for the symptomatic patient with [

         The choice of initial ambulatory ECG monitoring for the symptomatic patient depends somewhat on the frequency and severity of symptoms. Continuous ECG (Holter) monitoring for 24 to 48 hours is most practical as the initial monitor for patients with daily or near daily symptoms, while those with less frequent symptoms are more likely to benefit from extended monitoring with an event monitor or an insertable cardiac monitor (sometimes referred to as an implantable cardiac monitor or an implantable loop recorder).

         In addition to being used for the evaluation of patients with unexplained symptoms suggestive of cardiac arrhythmia, ambulatory ECG monitors may also be used in risk stratification, in assessing the effectiveness of arrhythmia therapy, and in the evaluation of silent ischemia. As examples:

         An event monitor is the preferred ambulatory ECG monitoring test for patients with less frequent (ie, weekly to monthly) symptoms and for patients in whom a comprehensive assessment of all cardiac activity over a 24 to 48 hour interval is not required. Several types of event monitors are available with a gradation of features:

         <strong>
          Post Event Monitoring
         </strong>
         devices are generally small, lightweight devices that can be placed on the patient's chest upon the onset of symptoms. The patient's rhythm is stored for a specified amount of time after recording begins (eg, 30 to 150 seconds).

          Event/Loop Recorders
         </strong>
         are devices that constantly record for a pre-specified period, but do not save the data until they are triggered to do so by the patient pushing an event button. The device will record and save the patient's rhythm for a pre-specified amount of time before and after activation of the device (eg, 30 seconds prior to and 60 seconds after the event).

         are more advanced devices. In addition to recording and saving symptomatic patient-triggered events, these devices have auto-detect features that will capture asymptomatic arrhythmias based on detection algorithms (eg, atrial fibrillation events or bradycardia events).

         Intracardiac monitoring (ICM) can be a particularly useful diagnostic tool for patients with infrequent (ie, less than monthly) symptoms that are potentially injurious (eg, syncope). ICM can also be useful for patients with bothersome symptoms requiring a diagnosis, but whose prior assessments with Holter or event monitoring have been unrevealing of a diagnosis. ICM may also be helpful when searching for asymptomatic occult episodes of AF, such as following a cryptogenic stroke. (See

         </span>
         The conventional continuous ambulatory ECG system, generally referred to as a Holter monitor, is most commonly performed for patients with frequent (ie, daily or near daily) symptoms of palpitations  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120899" href="/z/d/graphic/120899.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). Continuous ambulatory ECG (Holter) monitoring includes a continuous recording of all ECG data for a period of 24 or 48 hours. This technology uses a small, lightweight, battery operated recorder  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105244" href="/z/d/graphic/105244.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ) that typically records two or three channels of ECG data (although 12-lead monitors are also available) from electrodes placed on the patient's chest [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Holter monitoring devices have patient-activated event markers, and encoded time or time markers. The recorded data are analyzed with a playback instrument system that requires operator interaction with an arrhythmia analyzer, ST segment detector, RR interval analysis, signal-averaging computer, and a variety of audiovisual detection and review displays, as well as a printer for generating printouts of ECGs, trends, or a statistical summary. Holter monitors must be returned for analysis and, as such, do not provide real-time information on patient symptoms or arrhythmias.

         Event monitors, historically referred to as loop monitors because the recording device continuously looped its recording tape, are most commonly used for patients with less frequent (ie, weekly to monthly) symptoms of palpitations, presyncope, or syncope  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120899" href="/z/d/graphic/120899.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). Event monitors can be utilized for two to four weeks (although possibly up to three months). Similarly to Holter monitors, event monitors use a small, lightweight, battery operated recorder  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105244" href="/z/d/graphic/105244.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ) that typically records two channels of ECG data from electrodes placed on the patient's chest. Typically, event monitors are worn continuously and are activated by patient trigger when symptoms arise. Alternatively, patients with longer lasting symptomatic episodes can be instructed to apply the event monitor during symptomatic events. Because these instruments store the ECG in continuous memory before activation, they are excellent for documenting transient symptomatic or incapacitating events, and often can display the antecedent onset and subsequent offset of a paroxysmal cardiac arrhythmia [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7

         ]. Several types of event monitors are available with a gradation of features:

         <strong>
          Post Event Monitoring
         </strong>
         devices are generally small, lightweight devices that can be placed on the patient’s chest upon the onset of symptoms. The patient's rhythm is stored for a specified amount of time after recording begins (eg, 30 to 150 seconds).
        </p>

         <strong>
          Event/Loop Recorders
         </strong>
         are devices that constantly record for a pre-specified period, but do not save the data until they are triggered to do so by the patient pushing an event button. The device will record and save the patient's rhythm for a pre-specified amount of time before and after activation of the device (eg, 30 seconds prior to and 60 seconds after the event).

         <strong>
          Auto-triggered Event Recorders
         </strong>
         are more advanced devices. In addition to recording and saving symptomatic patient-triggered events, these devices have auto-detect features that will capture asymptomatic arrhythmias based on detection algorithms (eg, atrial fibrillation events or bradycardia events).

         Real-time event monitors have been developed that transmit arrhythmic event data from an ambulatory patient to a continuously attended monitoring station [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. Based on device specific algorithms and pre-specified alert criteria, these devices automatically record and transmit data for review in real-time. Data can also be recorded through patient-triggered activation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry (MCOT)'

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The ECG data from event monitors are received at a base station equipped with a demodulator and an ECG strip chart recorder. Trained staff analyze live incoming patient data and can contact the patient's clinician if instructed to do so according to a prespecified set of alert criteria provided by the clinician.

The monitor transmits the ECG information to a monitoring center via built-in cell phone technology. The device can also be triggered to record symptomatic events by the patient or can be triggered automatically in response to programmed settings. Algorithms for automatic arrhythmia detection analyze every heart beat and are based on rate, rhythm irregularity, P wave analysis, and QRS morphology. A single lead MCOT patch monitor is also available.
        </p>

         As events occur, patient ECG data is automatically transmitted to the monitoring center for analysis. Certified technicians review the data and a daily report and service-summary report is made available for online review (or by fax) [

         Among a registry cohort of 19,173 patients who underwent ICM implantation between 2007 and 2016 and were followed for an average of 2.1 years, syncope (54 percent) was the most common indication for ICM implantation; 25 percent of syncope patients ultimately had a diagnosis leading to implantation of a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) [

         Notably, permanent pacemakers and ICDs can also be used as a continuous monitoring devices, as these systems have built-in algorithms for the recognition of various arrhythmias (such as AF or VT)  (

         ). The devices can be interrogated to obtain data about arrhythmia frequency, duration, and atrial and ventricular rates. In addition, intracardiac ECGs meeting detection criteria can be recorded and stored for review. The data provided by such devices can be limited by the number and type of leads associated with the specific device (eg, a device with a single ventricular lead might not provide information on atrial arrhythmias) (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1015.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         There are circumstances in which a patient with a PPM or ICD might be prescribed an external monitor to gain more clear and detailed information regarding a potential arrhythmia. For example, evaluation of a patient's single chamber defibrillator might reveal nonsustained ventricular tachycardia episodes that appear irregular. An external monitor can help differentiate if these episodes are atrial fibrillation or true nonsustained ventricular tachycardia events.

         ]. These devices can be useful in the diagnosis of arrhythmia in certain patients. Many of these technologies come in the form of electronic wristbands and smartwatches. Optical sensors integrated into these devices use photoplethysmography to measure pulse rate [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Rapid rise in heart rate associated with symptoms can help detect arrhythmias such as supraventricular tachycardia or AF. In addition, some of these devices have automated algorithms to detect pulse irregularity and can notify the user regarding possible arrhythmia, such as AF. Photoplethysmographic algorithms for irregular heart rhythms in a number of smart watches and fitness trackers have been shown to have high positive predictive value for concurrent AF and to identify those who were likely to have AF demonstrated on subsequent traditional ECG monitoring [

         </a>
         ]. The ECGs are displayed and stored directly onto such devices or in another form, and are sent wirelessly to applications on the user's smartphone. Algorithms incorporated into these applications can also provide analysis for possible arrhythmia, including AF. Smartwatches are also now able to record single lead ECG by using electrodes built into the back of the watch and a finger from the opposite hand placed on the digital crown or onto an electrode built into the watch band to complete the circuit. Such devices can be useful in long term monitoring for arrhythmia recurrences, particularly in symptomatic patients with atrial fibrillation who have undergone rhythm control therapy (such as ablation). In addition to identifying cardiac rate and rhythm, smartwatches have the potential to allow for QT interval measurement. In one study of 100 patients in which a single-lead ECG was recorded using a smartwatch in three different locations (left wrist, left ankle, left lateral chest wall), 94 percent of patients were able to obtain an accurate QT interval which correlated to the QT interval measured on 12-lead ECG [

         The ECG rhythm recorded using any ambulatory ECG monitoring modality must be correlated with the simultaneous occurrence of suggestive symptoms. Without this correlation in many cases, the detected rhythm abnormality is less likely to be clinically important. Bradycardia and sinus pauses are particularly common at night while the patient is asleep, as a result of enhanced vagal tone. Thus, the occurrence of such arrhythmias does not necessarily establish a causal mechanism for a transient disturbance in consciousness or for other symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Among patients evaluated with 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, approximately 25 to 50 percent of patients will experience a symptom, between 2 and 15 percent will have an associated causal arrhythmia, and 35 percent will report symptoms without associated arrhythmias [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29

         Hospitalized patients with symptoms are more likely to have a causal arrhythmia. In one study, which included 306 hospitalized patients and 278 outpatients, symptoms occurred far more frequently in the outpatients (55 versus 6 percent); however, symptomatic inpatients were significantly more likely to have symptoms that correlated with causal arrhythmias (95 versus 44 percent) [

Data acquired by the ICM during the syncopal event directly contributed to a diagnosis in 78 percent of patients. A cardiac etiology was found in 75 percent; however, a breakdown of specific cardiac arrhythmias noted on the ICM was not reported. (See

         For a patient with history of cryptogenic stroke who had an unremarkable four-week event monitor for whom a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation would prompt the need for stroke prevention therapy (ie, initiation of oral anticoagulation), prolonged ambulatory ECG monitoring should be instituted (such as with an ICM).

         A patient who has suffered syncope (particularly abrupt syncope without warning symptoms that resulted in injury) but who did not have recurrent symptoms or ECG abnormalities during the initial monitoring should usually proceed with prolonged ambulatory ECG monitoring (such as with an ICM).

         <strong>
          Background
         </strong>
         – In contrast to the standard electrocardiogram (ECG), which provides a brief sample of cardiac electrical activity over 10 seconds, ambulatory ECG monitoring provides a view of ECG data over an extended period of time, thereby permitting evaluation of dynamic and transient cardiac electrical phenomena. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Indications
         </strong>
         – Ambulatory ECG monitoring is the most widely employed technology to evaluate a patient with symptoms suggestive of a cardiac arrhythmia or a conduction abnormality (ie, unexplained syncope/near syncope or unexplained palpitations), but it is also used for a variety of other diagnostic and prognostic indications. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Indications'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Types of monitors
         </strong>
         – Ambulatory ECG monitoring is available in many forms  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120899" href="/z/d/graphic/120899.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ), including continuous (Holter) monitoring for 24 to 48 hours  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105244" href="/z/d/graphic/105244.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ), event (loop) monitoring for several weeks, or insertable cardiac monitoring  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104724" href="/z/d/graphic/104724.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>
         ) for months to years. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Types of ambulatory ECG monitoring'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The approach to choosing an ambulatory ECG monitoring strategy depends on the indication for the test along with the frequency and duration of symptoms  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120898" href="/z/d/graphic/120898.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). If an ambulatory ECG monitor is being used for diagnostic purposes (ie, unexplained syncope or unexplained palpitations), extended duration monitoring might be required to increase the diagnostic yield. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnostic efficacy'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">
          'Our approach to choosing an ambulatory ECG monitoring strategy'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Importance of symptom correlation
         </strong>
         – The ECG rhythm recorded using any ambulatory ECG monitoring modality should be correlated with the simultaneous occurrence of suggestive symptoms. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnostic efficacy'
         </a>
