Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is the most common cause of chronic primary MR in resource-abundant countries [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Rheumatic heart disease is a prominent cause of primary MR in resource-limited countries (particularly during the first two decades of life), but it is an uncommon cause of MR in resource-abundant countries.

The decision on whether to attempt mitral valve repair (rather proceeding directly with valve replacement) is based upon the mitral valve anatomy and the surgeon's experience. For isolated severe primary MR limited to less than one-half of the posterior leaflet, mitral valve repair is the procedure of choice. (See <a class="local">'Surgical valve repair versus replacement'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">A surgical mitral valve repair procedure involves repair of the valve, assessment of the success of the repair with intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE; under the same loading conditions as in the awake state), and, if the repair is deemed inadequate, the repair is generally revised. If the valve cannot be adequately repaired, the procedure is converted to mitral valve replacement.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Intraoperative TEE is recommended since it can enhance the success of valve repair and can reliably predict early and late mitral valve dysfunction [<a href="#rid2">2,3,5</a>].

The following illustrative findings were reported from a Medicare database study of 47,279 patients aged 65 years or older who underwent primary isolated mitral valve surgery between 2000 and 2009 with a median follow-up of five years [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Operative mortality was 3.9 percent for patients who had mitral valve repair compared with 8.9 percent in those who had mitral valve replacement.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One-, five-, and 10-year Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were greater among those who underwent mitral valve repair (91, 77, and 54 percent versus 83, 65, and 37 percent, respectively, for mitral valve replacement).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The one-, five-, and 10-year survival benefits with mitral valve repair were also seen in those aged 75 years or greater (88, 71, and 40 percent survival with repair versus 80, 60, and 28 percent survival with replacement). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8147.html" rel="external">"Valvular heart disease in older adults", section on 'Mitral valve repair'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>A meta-analysis of eight observational studies with a total of 4599 patients (mean age 62 to 69 years; 3064 mitral valve repairs and 1535 mitral valve replacements performed during 1973 to 2014) followed for a mean of three to nine years found that mitral valve replacement was associated with an increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio 1.68, 95% CI 1.35-2.09) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The benefit of mitral repair was greater during later surgical eras.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2739970364"><span class="h3">Risk of reoperation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with primary MR, surgical mitral valve repair and surgical mitral valve replacement are generally associated with similar rates of subsequent mitral valve reoperation [<a href="#rid15">15</a>], as illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the Emory experience of patients undergoing surgery between 1984 and 1997, the rate of reoperation for mitral valve replacement at five years was 6 percent for patients who had undergone mitral valve repair and 4 percent for those who had undergone mitral valve replacement [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. However, at the end of 10 years, the rate of reoperation was lower in the mitral repair patients (22 percent) compared with mitral replacement patients (34 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lower rates of reoperation were noted in a cohort of patients undergoing mitral valve surgery during a slightly later time period. In the Mayo experience for initial repairs in the 1990s, the linearized risk of reoperation after repair of the posterior leaflet (0.5 percent per year) compared favorably with the risk of reoperation after mechanical valve replacement (0.7 percent per year) and all mitral valve replacements (0.7 percent per year) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The risk of reoperation following bilateral and anterior leaflet repair were nominally higher (0.92 and 1.64 percent per year), although not statistically different. The durability of repair for anterior leaflet prolapse improved during the second decade of the study.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Lower rates of reoperation following mitral valve repair in later series likely reflect technical advances (eg, use of more effective anterior leaflet prolapse repair techniques such as polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] chordal replacement), greater experience, and earlier patient referral [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Mitral valve repair'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Catheter-based procedures (transcatheter edge-to-edge repair and valve-in-valve transcatheter mitral valve implantation) now enable treatment of many patients with late postintervention valve dysfunction, so not all patients with significant recurrent MR require surgical reintervention.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2613082801"><span class="h2">Mitral valve repair</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Techniques for mitral valve repair include annuloplasty ring implantation, leaflet resection/remodeling, neochordae implantation, and edge-to-edge (Alfieri) repair.</p><p>The likelihood of successful and durable mitral valve repair depends upon mitral valve anatomy, the cause of MR, and surgical technique and expertise.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anterior versus posterior leaflet repair</strong> – With routine use of multiple techniques, the repairability of anterior leaflet and bileaflet pathologies is similar to that for isolated (P2) posterior leaflet prolapse [<a href="#rid16">16,18</a>]. This was illustrated by a study of propensity matched pairs consisting of 309 patients who underwent anterior leaflet repair (85 isolated, 224 bileaflet) and 309 patients who underwent posterior leaflet repair [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. The study identified similar rates of residual MR in the two groups (8 percent with no residual MR) and similar survival rates at 10 years (72 and 74 percent) and 15 years (63 and 60 percent). The incidence of reoperation at 15 years was 7.5 percent after anterior repair and 4.9 percent after posterior repair.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Similarly, a meta-analysis of 10 studies found similar rates of long-term survival, freedom from moderate to severe MR, and freedom from reoperation in patients who underwent anterior/bileaflet repair compared with those who underwent posterior leaflet repair [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rheumatic mitral disease </strong>– Successful mitral valve repair has generally been considered less likely in patients with rheumatic mitral disease than in patients with degenerative disease [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], although some have reported comparable results using specialized techniques with stringent quality control [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3997662166"><span class="h2">Mitral valve replacement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When mitral valve replacement is required, a choice is made between a mechanical or bioprosthetic valve.
