Recognition of either of these problems should lead to a frank discussion of treatment options and/or re-evaluation of goals of care.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of pulmonary tumor embolism and pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis are reviewed here. The epidemiology, etiology, and pathogenesis of these syndromes, as well as the diagnosis and management of venous thromboembolism, and embolism of air, amniotic fluid, fat, or foreign material, are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/106144.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary tumor embolism and lymphangitic carcinomatosis in adults: Epidemiology, etiology, and pathogenesis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8253.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and pathogenesis of acute pulmonary embolism in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8263.html" rel="external">"Air embolism"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1591.html" rel="external">"Amniotic fluid embolism"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1602.html" rel="external">"Fat embolism syndrome"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4370.html" rel="external">"Foreign body granulomatosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4215590599"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The terminology for both disorders is often used interchangeably by clinicians. However, pulmonary tumor embolism refers to the identification of tumor within pulmonary arteries and/or capillaries on pathologic lung samples, whereas pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis refers to the identification of tumor in pulmonary lymphatic vessels. Since both entities are similarly evaluated and treated, distinguishing one from the other has little clinical significance. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/106144.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary tumor embolism and lymphangitic carcinomatosis in adults: Epidemiology, etiology, and pathogenesis", section on 'Terminology'</a>.)</p><p>While any malignancy can cause both disorders, the risk appears to be the greatest in patients with renal cell and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as adenocarcinoma of the breast, stomach, colon, and lung  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67921" href="/d/graphic/67921.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The etiology and pathogenesis of these disorders are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/106144.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary tumor embolism and lymphangitic carcinomatosis in adults: Epidemiology, etiology, and pathogenesis", section on 'Etiology'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/106144.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary tumor embolism and lymphangitic carcinomatosis in adults: Epidemiology, etiology, and pathogenesis", section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical manifestations of pulmonary tumor emboli and lymphangitic carcinomatosis are nonspecific, with the majority of patients presenting with subacute, progressive, unexplained dyspnea [<a href="#rid1">1-7</a>]. Consequently, the diagnosis often remains unsuspected and not made until autopsy. Traditionally, it is thought that pulmonary tumor embolism is more likely to present with features suggestive of pulmonary hypertension (PH) or venous thromboembolism (dyspnea, hypoxemia, right heart strain, and clear lungs) while pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis is more likely to present with the features of interstitial lung disease (eg, fever, bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging). However, clinical and pathological overlap between the entities is common. (See <a class="local">'Definitive pathologic diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4187684528"><span class="h2">Symptoms and signs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Progressive, unexplained dyspnea is the most common symptom that occurs in up to 60 percent of cases [<a href="#rid1">1,2,8-14</a>]. Dyspnea is often subacute (over weeks) but can be rapid (over days). Rarely, patients present suddenly with overwhelming shock and acute respiratory failure from acute massive tumor embolism resulting in acute PH [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>Pleuritic chest pain can occur, particularly in patients with lymphangitic carcinomatosis when obstructed pleural lymphatics or blood vessels are involved with tumor.</p><p>Cough, hemoptysis, fatigue, and weight loss occur less commonly. While some of these symptoms may be explained by tumor embolism or lymphangitis, they may also be due to the underlying cancer.</p><p>A diagnosis of cancer is usually, but not always, present and patients may have advanced, metastatic, or occult disease [<a href="#rid8">8-12</a>].</p><p>Patients are rarely asymptomatic. Case reports of patients with imaging features suggestive of either embolization or lymphangitis found incidentally during surveillance for known cancer have been reported [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>].</p><p>The physical examination usually reveals tachypnea, tachycardia, and low-grade fever. Signs of PH and cor pulmonale, such as an increase in the pulmonic component of the second heart sound, a right ventricular lift, cyanosis, and jugular venous distention, may be more likely in patients with tumor emboli than lymphangitis. Crackles or adventitious sounds are unusual but may be more likely to be heard in patients with lymphangitic carcinomatosis than in tumor emboli syndrome [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1777596201"><span class="h2">Imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most imaging studies are insensitive for the diagnosis of pulmonary tumor embolism and lymphangitic carcinomatosis. However, many of these imaging modalities are performed because venous thromboembolism or other etiologies are suspected. Importantly, these tests are usually not diagnostic, and up to 50 percent of patients have normal imaging, particularly in the early phase. In an autopsy series, imaging detected only 20 to 30 percent of cases of pulmonary tumor embolism, although higher rates of detection of lymphangitic carcinomatosis by both positron emission tomography (PET) and high resolution chest computed tomography (CT) were reported (approximately 73 percent) [<a href="#rid14">14,19</a>]. However, imaging studies may provide subtle clues to help raise the clinical suspicion for underlying tumor embolism or lymphangitis in the event that other more common etiologies are ruled out. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Imaging may show features of one or both entities and include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chest radiography</strong> – Chest radiography is often initially normal, but as the disease progresses, it may show diffuse reticular and nodular infiltrates, coarse bronchovascular markings, or Kerley B lines suggestive of lymphangitic edema [<a href="#rid1">1,2,20</a>]. Occasionally, lymphadenopathy and pleural effusions are also seen.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The signs of PH may indicate elevated pulmonary pressures from pulmonary tumor embolism (eg, enlarged pulmonary arteries, enlarged right heart) but can also be less commonly seen in lymphangitic carcinomatosis [<a href="#rid1">1,13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) lung scintigraphy</strong> – V/Q lung scans may be normal or demonstrate multiple, small, peripheral, subsegmental perfusion defects ("mottled" or "beaded" appearance) with normal ventilation [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. This pattern is similar to that seen in fat embolism or idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, but different from the pattern typically seen with venous thromboembolism.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Computed tomography</strong> – CT findings of smooth or irregularly thickened interlobular septum ("nodular" appearance)  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69355 graphicRef79160" href="/d/graphic/69355.html" rel="external">image 1A-B</a>) are more characteristic of lymphangitic carcinomatosis than tumor embolism. While some experts believe that nodular septae may help distinguish lymphangitic carcinomatosis from other interstitial disorders, in general, overlap with other diseases including sarcoidosis and asbestosis is not uncommon [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Some cases may have ground glass densities that may represent interstitial edema. Hilar adenopathy and effusions may occasionally be present. In contrast, a dilated, beaded or tree-in-bud appearance of pulmonary arteries on CT pulmonary angiography may be more characteristic of tumor embolism than lymphangitic carcinomatosis [<a href="#rid16">16,23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Conventional pulmonary</strong> <strong>angiography</strong> – Older reports from an era where conventional pulmonary angiography was more commonly performed in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) report subtle abnormalities such as subsegmental filling defects, pruning and tortuosity of the third to fifth order vessels, or delayed filling of segmental arteries [<a href="#rid8">8,24,25</a>]. However, these findings are neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of tumor embolism or lymphangitic carcinomatosis. In addition, conventional pulmonary angiography is no longer commonplace in the diagnostic evaluation patients with suspected PE.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other</strong> – PET and endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) are not routinely performed for the diagnosis of tumor embolism or lymphangitic carcinomatosis but case reports suggest abnormalities in rare cases.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>PET</strong> – Rare case reports have described 18F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) uptake in the lungs (eg, during serial PET surveillance) when presumably tumor deposits are large enough to be FDG avid [<a href="#rid17">17,19,26-28</a>]. However, it is unlikely that smaller tumor deposits can be detected with this modality.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>EBUS</strong> – Rare case reports also describe the identification of filling defects in the major or central pulmonary arteries using EBUS [<a href="#rid29">29-31</a>]. However, it is unlikely that EBUS can locate filling defects in more distal vessels (eg, beyond the second order) and cannot readily distinguish between tumor and clot.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2421279366"><span class="h2">Laboratory</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most routine laboratory tests including complete blood count and chemistries are unhelpful and are not diagnostic. A mild leukocytosis is not unusual and may represent a stress response to disseminated tumor. One case report described elevated circulating eosinophils in a patient with lymphangitic carcinomatosis, but in our experience this finding is unusual and likely to be due to a paraneoplastic phenomenon [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p>D-dimer levels may be elevated in patients who have evidence of acute PH and acute right heart failure. However, an elevated D-dimer is nonspecific as it may be elevated in many other conditions  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60881" href="/d/graphic/60881.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8261.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism", section on 'Laboratory tests'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2371108971"><span class="h2">Arterial blood gas</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As the disease progresses, arterial blood gas analysis generally shows hypoxemia, a respiratory alkalosis, and an elevated alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/13447.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>). If shock ensues, then patients may develop lactic acidosis. However, these are nonspecific findings and can be found in many of the competing diagnoses. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1648.html" rel="external">"Arterial blood gases"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2352.html" rel="external">"Simple and mixed acid-base disorders"</a> and <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H237218400"><span class="h2">Pulmonary function tests</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pulmonary function tests may be normal but may reveal a restrictive pattern with reduced lung volumes and reduced diffusing capacity as the disease progresses.

Other rhythm disturbances including atrial fibrillation and bradycardia and evidence of right heart strain due to PH may also be present. Similarly, echocardiography may be normal or show signs consistent with right ventricular hypertrophy or strain from PH, the details of which are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8261.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism", section on 'Electrocardiography'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8261.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism", section on 'Echocardiography'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8249.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension of unclear etiology in adults", section on 'Echocardiography'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8249.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension of unclear etiology in adults", section on 'Electrocardiography'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2552720424"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The optimal diagnostic approach is unknown. In our experience, multiple imaging tests are often performed, during which time patients typically progress, increasing the risk of invasive procedures. Consequently, the diagnosis is often delayed and not made until autopsy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3076536881"><span class="h2">When to suspect tumor emboli or lymphangitic carcinomatosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Progressive unexplained dyspnea and hypoxemia in a patient with malignancy should raise the clinical suspicion for pulmonary tumor embolism or lymphangitic carcinomatosis; however, patients with microscopic tumor emboli may be asymptomatic. These syndromes should be considered in those suspected to have pulmonary embolism (PE; acute or subacute dyspnea, hypoxemia, chest pain, low grade fever) and/or pulmonary hypertension (PH; dyspnea, loud second heart sound, elevated jugular venous pressure, lower extremity edema, right ventricular dilation) in whom testing or an etiology is unrevealing.</p><p>Dyspnea is often subtle and initially occurs in the setting of a normal chest radiograph or a radiograph with nonspecific infiltrates. In our experience, patients are often treated empirically with antibiotics for presumed bronchitis or pneumonia but fail to respond and continue to progress.</p><p>Details regarding the clinical signs and symptoms of pulmonary tumor embolism and lymphangitic carcinomatosis are provided above. (See <a class="local">'Symptoms and signs'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1751614082"><span class="h2">Initial diagnostic tests</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other than lung biopsy, most diagnostic tests are nonspecific but help to raise the clinical suspicion for tumor embolism or lymphangitic carcinomatosis, and prompt invasive testing (see <a class="local">'Pursuing a histologic diagnosis'</a> below and <a class="local">'Choosing among the tests'</a> below). Nonetheless, we suggest the following tests be performed in the routine evaluation of patients suspected of having either pulmonary tumor embolism or lymphangitic carcinomatosis:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chest radiograph (see <a class="local">'Imaging'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chest CT, CT pulmonary arteriogram, and/or ventilation-perfusion lung scanning (see <a class="local">'Imaging'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Laboratory studies including complete blood count and differential, serum chemistries, and liver function tests (see <a class="local">'Laboratory'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Arterial blood gas analysis (see <a class="local">'Arterial blood gas'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Electrocardiography (see <a class="local">'Electrocardiography and echocardiography'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Echocardiography (see <a class="local">'Electrocardiography and echocardiography'</a> above)</p><p></p><p>Positron emission tomography (PET), pulmonary angiography, or endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) are not routinely performed for the diagnostic evaluation of this population. However, PET and EBUS may be appropriate on a rare case-by-case basis if it is considered that additional imaging would help guide further diagnostic testing (eg, a patient with an intensely positive tumor by PET scan or a patient in whom central emboli are suspected and biopsy options are limited). (See <a class="local">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H428631298"><span class="h2">Pursuing a histologic diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Additional testing is aimed at a cytologic or histologic diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107749" href="/d/graphic/107749.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). In general, many experts prefer to obtain a transbronchial lung biopsy (TBBX); if TBBX is negative and the clinical suspicion remains, or if TBBX is contraindicated, then proceeding with surgical lung biopsy may be appropriate in select cases. Alternatively, aspiration of pulmonary artery blood using a right heart catheter (RHC) may be appropriate as the initial test, particularly in those with suspected PH or for those who are too ill to undergo lung biopsy; if negative, then proceeding to lung biopsy is appropriate for patients well enough to undergo biopsy. (See <a class="local">'Choosing among the tests'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1602679439"><span class="h3">Right heart catheterization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is typically placed for the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected PH and/or for the acquisition of a wedged sample of pulmonary artery blood.

The presence of PH increases the risk of lung biopsy (eg, hemorrhage and cardiovascular collapse).

(See <a class="local">'Pulmonary artery catheter aspiration'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1536698719"><span class="h4">Pulmonary artery catheter aspiration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pulmonary artery blood is not routinely aspirated during RHC for the evaluation of PH.

As such, the prognosis with or without therapy is generally poor [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Although rare case reports suggest prolonged remission in some cases, cure is typically not possible, with most patients dying within 3 to 12 months after presentation [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. It is likely that prognosis also relates to the responsivity of the underlying tumor to antitumor therapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H24781406"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Terminology</strong> – Pulmonary tumor emboli and lymphangitic carcinomatosis are rare, end-stage manifestations of malignancy that have a poor prognosis. Prompt recognition is critical so that therapy can be initiated in a timely fashion. Although the syndromes overlap, pulmonary tumor embolism refers to the identification of tumor within pulmonary blood arterial vessels on pathologic lung samples, whereas pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis refers to the identification of tumor in pulmonary lymphatic vessels. The causes are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67921" href="/d/graphic/67921.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical features</strong> – The clinical manifestations are nonspecific with the majority of patients presenting with subacute, progressive, unexplained dyspnea. Traditionally, it is thought that pulmonary tumor embolism is more likely to present with features suggestive of pulmonary hypertension (PH) or venous thromboembolism (eg, dyspnea, hypoxemia, right heart strain, and clear lungs), while pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis is more likely to present with the features of interstitial lung disease (ILD; eg, fever, bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69355" href="/d/graphic/69355.html" rel="external">image 1A</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79160" href="/d/graphic/79160.html" rel="external">image 1B</a>)). However, clinical and pathological overlap between the entities is common. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation'</a> above and <a class="local">'When to suspect tumor emboli or lymphangitic carcinomatosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic evaluation</strong> – The optimal diagnostic approach is unknown. Other than lung biopsy, most diagnostic tests are nonspecific but help to raise the clinical suspicion and prompt invasive testing. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a class="local">'Initial diagnostic tests'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>We suggest the following tests be performed in the routine evaluation of patients suspected of having either pulmonary tumor embolism or lymphangitic carcinomatosis: chest radiography, chest CT (including CT pulmonary angiography), ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) imaging, routine chemistries, arterial blood gas analysis, electrocardiography, and echocardiography.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Additional testing is aimed at a cytologic or histologic diagnosis. In general, many experts prefer to obtain a transbronchial lung biopsy (TBBX); if TBBX is negative and the clinical suspicion remains, or if TBBX is contraindicated, then proceeding with surgical lung biopsy is appropriate. Alternatively, aspiration of pulmonary artery blood using a right heart catheter may be appropriate as the initial test, particularly in those with suspected PH or for those who are too ill to undergo lung biopsy; if negative, then proceeding to lung biopsy is appropriate for patients well enough to undergo biopsy. (See <a class="local">'Pursuing a histologic diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The decision about how aggressively to pursue the histologic diagnosis of pulmonary tumor embolism generally is individualized and depends upon the nature of the underlying tumor and likely success of treatment, the severity of illness, the presence or absence of PH, goals and preferences of the patient, and the benefits and risks of each procedure in the context of its diagnostic yield. (See <a class="local">'Choosing among the tests'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The major competing diagnoses are pulmonary embolism (PE), PH, and ILD. Pneumonia, heart failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and other embolization syndromes (amniotic, fluid, fat, foreign body) may also be considered on the differential. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Definitive diagnosis of pulmonary tumor emboli or lymphangitic carcinomatosis is made histopathologically, most often on autopsy  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107749" href="/d/graphic/107749.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). While definitive diagnosis is ideal, we acknowledge that there is a role for a presumptive diagnosis in patients who are too ill to undergo tissue sampling to justify antitumor therapy. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment</strong> – Definitive therapy is directed at treating the primary tumor. This may involve surgical resection, systemic chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or any combination thereof. In some patients, therapy is sufficient to wean patients from supportive forms of treatment including oxygen and, occasionally, mechanical ventilation. Importantly, therapy is not curative, and in many cases, the malignancy will likely recur or progress despite therapy. (See <a class="local">'Therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prognosis</strong> – Pulmonary tumor emboli and lymphangitic carcinomatosis are typically end-stage manifestations of malignancy. As such, the prognosis with or without therapy is generally poor. Most patients die within 3 to 12 months after presentation. (See <a class="local">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Roberts KE, Hamele-Bena D, Saqi A, et al.
