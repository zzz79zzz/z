HF may be caused by disease of the myocardium, pericardium, endocardium, heart valves, vessels, or by metabolic disorders [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. HF due to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is categorized according to LV ejection fraction (LVEF) into HF with reduced ejection fraction (with LVEF ≤40 percent, known as HFrEF; also referred to as systolic HF), HF with preserved ejection fraction (with LVEF ≥50 percent; known as HFpEF; also referred to as diastolic HF), and HF with mid-range ejection fraction (with LVEF 41 to 49 percent; known as HFmrEF).</p><p>An overview of the management of chronic HFrEF in nonpregnant patients is presented here [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>The management of acute HF, management of HF during pregnancy, and management of HFpEF and HFmrEF are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3454.html" rel="external">"Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: General considerations"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3450.html" rel="external">"Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: Specific therapies"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3507.html" rel="external">"Management of heart failure during pregnancy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3461.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/117708.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction"</a>.) <span class="utd-adt-cnt utd-adt-pathwys utd-content-120408">(Related Pathway(s):  <a class="utd-content-120408" href="/pathway/120408?topicRef=121085&amp;source=see_link">Heart failure: Primary pharmacologic therapy for compensated heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)</a>.)</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2232039007"><span class="h1">GOALS AND OVERALL APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goals of therapy of HFrEF are to reduce morbidity (ie, reduce symptoms, improve health-related quality of life and functional status, and decrease the rate of hospitalization), and to reduce mortality.</p><p>Management of HFrEF includes management of the cause of HF and associated conditions, monitoring, preventative care, care coordination, education and support for HF self-management (including lifestyle modification and daily monitoring), pharmacologic therapy, cardiac rehabilitation, palliative care, device therapy (including cardiac resynchronization therapy, implantable cardioverter defibrillator, and mechanical circulatory support [eg, LV assist device]) and cardiac transplantation.</p><p>Several major societies and organizations have published guidelines for the treatment of HF. These include the 2022 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart Failure Society of America guideline [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], the 2017 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway for Optimization of Heart Failure Treatment [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], and the 2016 European Society of Cardiology guidelines [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. With few exceptions, these societies make similar recommendations regarding the treatment of HFrEF. Our approach is in broad agreement with these guidelines.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H780762352"><span class="h1">GENERAL MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1661887824"><span class="h2">Management of causes and associated conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment should address underlying causes (eg, intervention for coronary artery disease, intervention for symptomatic valve disease, therapy for treatable causes of cardiomyopathy) and associated conditions (eg, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid dysfunction)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73383" href="/z/d/graphic/73383.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3485.html" rel="external">"Determining the etiology and severity of heart failure or cardiomyopathy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1626046020"><span class="h3">Ischemic heart disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Coronary atherosclerosis is a dominant cause of HF in developed countries. Patients with ischemic heart disease may have HFrEF from either or both of two mechanisms: a prior myocardial infarction followed by LV dysfunction and remodeling; or hibernating myocardium due to chronic but potentially reversible ischemic dysfunction [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. In addition, coronary artery disease may be present in patients with HF from other causes, and may sometimes be overlooked as a contributing factor [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Thus, patients with HFrEF should be evaluated for the presence of coronary artery disease and appropriate therapy instituted, including pharmacologic therapy for relief of angina and risk factor reduction (including lipid therapy) and coronary artery intervention as indicated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1483.html" rel="external">"Chronic coronary syndrome: Overview of care"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1505.html" rel="external">"Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease (secondary prevention) or at very high risk"</a>.)</p><p>Surgical revascularization (in addition to medical therapy) is indicated for patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF ≤35 percent and coronary artery disease amenable to surgical revascularization. The available evidence does not support routine concomitant surgical ventricular reconstruction. Patients with a history of repeated episodes of acute LV dysfunction and flash pulmonary edema should also undergo evaluation to evaluate the potential benefit of revascularization (percutaneous or surgical). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1507.html" rel="external">"Treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1474.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of hibernating myocardium"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3967759636"><span class="h3">Valvular disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Valvular heart disease is a cause of HF and is also a secondary phenomenon in many individuals with HF. For example, some degree of secondary mitral and tricuspid regurgitation is frequently present in patients with severe dilated cardiomyopathy, regardless of etiology [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Valvular disease imposes a hemodynamic load on the ventricles, leading to further impairment in cardiac function, regardless of whether the valvular disease is primary or secondary. Clinically indicated valve intervention (eg, surgical replacement or transcatheter aortic valve implantation for severe aortic stenosis) can lead to improvement in symptoms and may also improve cardiac function.</p><p>Indications for valve intervention are discussed in specific valve disease topic reviews. Management of secondary mitral regurgitation, including indications for transcatheter or surgical mitral valve intervention, is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/102361.html" rel="external">"Chronic secondary mitral regurgitation: General management and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H179254297"><span class="h3">Cardiomyopathy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients in whom significant coronary artery disease has been excluded, the specific cause of nonischemic cardiomyopathy should be sought since disease-specific therapy is available for certain conditions (eg, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy, cardiac sarcoidosis, cardiac amyloidosis, and abnormal thyroid function) and the diagnosis may alter the estimated risk of potential complications (eg, thromboembolism) and expected prognosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3485.html" rel="external">"Determining the etiology and severity of heart failure or cardiomyopathy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3467.html" rel="external">"Alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1062.html" rel="external">"Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113686.html" rel="external">"Management and prognosis of cardiac sarcoidosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/85952.html" rel="external">"Cardiac amyloidosis: Treatment and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p>Genetic causes of HFrEF should be considered, particularly if there is a suggestive family history, and may lead to genetic counseling for other family members.

The goals of therapy are to control blood pressure and to reduce LV afterload, thereby improving cardiac function and decreasing the progression of pathologic remodeling. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3838.html" rel="external">"Treatment of hypertension in patients with heart failure"</a>.)</p><p>For patients with HFrEF and hypertension, the preferred antihypertensive therapy is standard combination therapy with primary pharmacologic agents for HFrEF including a diuretic (as needed for volume overload) and other agents, which are described separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef140887" href="/z/d/graphic/140887.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/121086.html" rel="external">"Primary pharmacologic therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction", section on 'Regimen for patients with mild to moderate symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with residual hypertension despite optimal use of the primary therapies for HFrEF, secondary agents may be indicated  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef140889" href="/z/d/graphic/140889.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/121087.html" rel="external">"Secondary pharmacologic therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction", section on 'Add isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine in select patients'</a>.)</p><p>The presence of renovascular disease should be considered in patients with HF and hypertension, particularly in those with HF due to ischemic heart disease. Recurrent unexplained HF decompensation and/or flash (sudden-onset) pulmonary edema occur in some patients with renovascular hypertension, often with preserved (normal or near normal) LV systolic function. Treatment options include antihypertensive drug therapy and revascularization, as discussed separately.
