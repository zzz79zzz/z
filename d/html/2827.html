Rehabilitation focuses on the evaluation and treatment of functional loss and pain disorders with the goal to restore maximal function, which, depending on the patient's specific needs, may involve a multidisciplinary team, including a physiatrist (ie, physical medicine and rehabilitation clinician), physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, and a lymphedema therapist. The importance of cancer survivorship care inclusive of attention to the medical, functional, and psychosocial consequences of cancer and its treatment were cited as important areas to address in an Institute of Medicine (IOM) consensus study report issued in 2006 [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. It is important to identify and refer to those health care professionals that are qualified and have the expertise in treating patients' rehabilitation needs [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Cancer rehabilitation is typically a coordinated endeavor that requires an open channel of communication to the primary oncology team (eg, medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and/or surgical oncologist) and the primary care providers. In addition, supportive services play a critical role in the rehabilitation of cancer survivors, including those by nurses, recreational therapists, nutritionists, social workers, mental health professionals, orthotic and prosthetic specialists, chaplains, vocational counselors, hospice liaisons, home care agencies, support groups, and educational outreach programs [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss cancer rehabilitation, including a specific discussion of the techniques and approaches utilized in the setting of rehabilitation, their indications, and evidence of their benefit. We will discuss in the following sections specific physical impairments that we most commonly see, with evidence of how rehabilitation can be effective  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef96287" href="/d/graphic/96287.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Other topics in cancer survivorship are covered separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16613.html" rel="external">"Overview of cancer survivorship care for primary care and oncology providers"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1241100"><span class="h1">MODELS OF REHABILITATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The majority of rehabilitation programs address specific physical impairments caused by the cancer and its treatments. It is important to note that general physical exercise has been shown in many studies to have tremendous benefits in cancer survivors, including improving fatigue, quality of life, mood, decreased cancer recurrence, and improved survival [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. This is beyond the scope of this chapter and is discussed extensively elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14222.html" rel="external">"The roles of diet, physical activity, and body weight in cancer survivors"</a>.)</p><p>Cancer rehabilitation plays a role throughout the continuum of cancer survivorship. General cancer rehabilitation is often grouped into categories known as the Dietz Classification [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. These include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preventative rehabilitation </strong>– The emphasis in preventative rehabilitation (sometimes referred to as prehabilitation or prospective surveillance [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]) is on the use of early intervention and exercise to prevent or delay complications related to cancer or its therapies. It includes physical and psychologic assessments done early in the cancer continuum of care to identify physical impairments and to refer as deemed necessary to qualified rehabilitation professionals. The rationale is that earlier detection of impairments makes them easier to treat, which may reduce the incidence and/or severity of future impairments [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Restorative rehabilitation</strong> – For patients in whom a fully functional recovery is expected, restorative rehabilitation envisions full reintegration of the patient back into society, community, school, or work.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Supportive rehabilitation</strong> – For patients in whom cancer treatment has resulted in permanent deficits (including those in whom deficits are very unlikely to resolve), the goal of supportive rehabilitation is to re-establish functional independence as much as possible.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Palliative rehabilitation</strong> – If intensive rehabilitation is not possible or deemed clinically inappropriate, palliative rehabilitation may play a role in supporting the patient, especially if they are facing a terminal diagnosis. The goals are to maximize patient comfort and caregiver support.</p><p></p><p>These services are not necessarily delivered independently of each other. Instead, they may be offered within a single program, allowing patients to transition to different services as dictated by their needs. This can be done by utilizing both inpatient and various outpatient rehabilitation services:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Preventative services are generally offered while patients are admitted for acute care. When patients are referred, inpatient physical and occupational therapists assess the patient's current functional status in order to determine if and what types of rehabilitation services might be necessary. This includes assessments of patient safety, their independence in performing tasks (eg, bed mobility, transfers), and ambulation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Physical medicine and rehabilitation clinicians provide early education regarding potential impairments that can arise from cancer or its treatments. For example, for patients admitted with newly diagnosed breast cancer, therapists are involved with the early education about postoperative complications of breast surgery, including shoulder range of motion limitation and lymphedema.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>At discharge, rehabilitation clinicians provide recommendations about safe disposition of patients and when needed, assist in the transfer of appropriately selected patients to an acute or sub-acute inpatient rehabilitation center or a skilled nursing facility based on the individual's needs and ability to participate in inpatient rehabilitation. Alternatively, individuals who are functioning at a high level independently may be discharged home with referral for outpatient rehabilitation to work on specific functional skills. For other patients who are too sick or immunocompromised to receive rehabilitation on an outpatient basis (but are not candidates or otherwise refuse inpatient rehabilitation services), home therapy can be coordinated and implemented.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Restorative services are provided on an outpatient basis. Patients are usually referred from their primary care providers, oncologists, surgeons, and radiation oncologists for a wide variety of symptoms and impairments. The work within our program is performed in conjunction with the pain and palliative care service, the anesthesia pain department, and integrative medicine.</p><p></p><p>Each patient is monitored closely amongst the clinicians and therapists, and any questions regarding his or her safety or care are communicated with his or her respective oncologists, surgeons, and primary care providers. Patients with diffuse metastases are not excluded from rehabilitation, as rehabilitation can help achieve set functional goals. Spinal precautions and weight bearing precautions are carefully executed to prevent injury and harm. Once rehabilitation goals are met and patients have reached maximum benefit, they are usually discharged with home exercises and reassessed by the physiatrists at a later date to see if they would benefit from further rehabilitation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1241106"><span class="h2">Role of the physiatrist</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The physiatrist is a clinician trained in physical medicine and rehabilitation and typically leads an interdisciplinary team. The role of the physiatrist is to conduct a full initial evaluation, including the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A comprehensive medical assessment – A thorough review of a patient's medical comorbidities that may impact safe and effective rehabilitation. Evaluation of medications is necessary to assess for drug-related side effects that could be contributing to any presenting impairment(s). Additionally, in the event that additional medications are indicated to treat various pain conditions, it is important to identify any potential drug-drug interactions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A comprehensive functional assessment – Important aspects of a patient's history include his or her cancer history (eg, initial diagnoses and prior and ongoing treatments, including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy) and precautions that would be important in the rehabilitation process, such as his or her weight-bearing status and spinal stability.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ordering and interpreting specific testing as indicated, including imaging, nerve conduction studies (NCS), electromyogram (EMG), or lab work.</p><p></p><p>Based on their rehabilitation needs, patients are then referred to specialized services (eg, prosthetics, orthotics, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech and swallow therapy, and/or lymphedema therapy) with a detailed prescription outlining their rehabilitation course. Interventions may be recommended depending on the precise functional deficit(s) encountered. Some examples include therapeutic exercise, manual therapy (eg, myofascial massage, joint mobilization), electrical modalities (eg, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation [TENS]), thermal modalities, lasers, and therapeutic taping. Additionally, many physiatrists also perform various procedures to control pain and subsequently improve the patient's ability to participate in various rehabilitation or exercise protocols. Examples of such procedures include peripheral nerve blocks, joint injections, and spinal injections.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1241112"><span class="h1">SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multiple clinical scenarios may be encountered after treatment for cancer, which depend on the type of malignancy and the therapies administered. The time course for both onset and exacerbation of symptoms is largely dependent on whether there was a preexisting impairment that was mild or had not yet manifested clinically. For example, a patient with a prior history of mild or moderate joint arthritis may be more symptomatic during or after cancer treatment due to a variety of factors, including (but not limited to) overall deconditioning, weakness, and/or the adverse effects of anticancer medications (eg, anastrozole-induced myalgia and arthralgia) and their potential impact on overall tissue healing and homeostasis.</p><p>Common impairments are discussed below. Most of these are typically described following treatment for breast cancer, reflecting both that patients treated for breast cancer are a large proportion of cancer survivors [<a href="#rid7">7</a>] and that much of the literature on cancer rehabilitation has been gained from studies involving these patients. Where data exist, we describe impairments among survivors of other types of cancer.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1241118"><span class="h2">Upper extremity pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cancer survivors, in particular those treated for breast cancer, face a myriad of upper extremity impairments resulting from their treatments, which include surgery, radiation therapy (RT), chemotherapy, and hormonal and biologic therapies. Estimates are that between 10 and 64 percent of patients treated for breast cancer develop upper body symptoms between 6 and 36 months after diagnosis [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Persistent arm and shoulder impairments, defined as restricted shoulder mobility, lymphedema, and arm/shoulder pain, occur in 30 to 50 percent of breast cancer survivors [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>Although the etiology is usually multifactorial, it is important for the treating clinician to properly examine the patient to find the source that can guide the course of rehabilitation and optimize the treatment strategy. Two common conditions include issues related to shoulder dysfunction and the axillary web syndrome.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1241124"><span class="h3">Shoulder dysfunction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgery and RT fields that involve the upper extremity (typically indicated for treatment of breast cancer, lymphoma, and sarcomas) may induce painful scar tissue formation and nerve damage. This in turn can lead to abnormal protective posturing by the patient, which can result in the shortening of soft tissues in the anterior chest wall, including the pectoralis major and minor muscles, causing a protracted or forward depression of the shoulder girdle [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The misalignment can lead to subsequent impingement of the rotator cuff, leading to pain and immobility, and eventually, to adhesive capsulitis. Shortening of the pectoral muscles can also lead to overuse and strained scapular retractors, leading to subsequent myofascial dysfunction in the back and neck muscles [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/239.html" rel="external">"Rotator cuff tendinopathy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/225.html" rel="external">"Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis)"</a>.)</p><p>For patients experiencing shoulder symptoms, data are available to suggest there are benefits to an exercise prescription [<a href="#rid12">12-14</a>]. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In one randomized controlled trial involving 160 patients who underwent breast cancer surgery, the patients were randomly assigned to either an eight-week exercise program or to periodic assessments without an exercise prescription (controls) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The exercise program consisted of weekly sessions and a home program of passive stretching and progressive resistance training for shoulder muscles that started four to six weeks postoperatively. Compared with controls, patients in the exercise group gained slightly greater range of motion in both forward flexion and abduction and strength in abduction plane. Of note, resistance training in the postoperative period was not associated with an increased risk of lymphedema.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In another trial, 30 patients who had undergone breast cancer surgery and axillary lymph node dissection were randomly assigned to receive standardized physiotherapy treatment for the arm and shoulder (beginning two weeks post-surgery and then for three months afterwards) or to a control group that received a leaflet containing advice and exercise suggestions [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. After three and six months, the treatment group showed a significant improvement in shoulder mobility and had significantly less pain than the control group. Quality of life improved significantly, and arm volume did not change significantly.</p><p></p><p>Beyond exercise for shoulder symptoms, it is also important to evaluate patients for co-existing edema involving the arm and/or chest wall, which are also etiologies of impaired range of motion [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The approach to lymphedema is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/755.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of peripheral lymphedema"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/738.html" rel="external">"Clinical staging and conservative management of peripheral lymphedema"</a>.)</p><p>Exercise prescriptions must be accompanied by adequate pain control, which can be achieved with antiinflammatory agents (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs). Patients may be offered subacromial and glenohumeral corticosteroid injections with minimal complications. However, the role of corticosteroid injections for shoulder dysfunction in this population needs to be further evaluated.</p><p>In addition to treating existing shoulder dysfunction, early exercise interventions can also prevent shoulder dysfunction arising from breast cancer treatments, based on data from prospective clinical trials [<a href="#rid15">15-18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1241131"><span class="h3">Axillary web syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Axillary web syndrome or "cording" is characterized by palpable cord-like subcutaneous tissue extending from the axilla into the medial arm and sometimes to the palm, usually manifest when the shoulder is abducted. It may be due to damage and sclerosis of the lymphatic and/or venous system [<a href="#rid19">19</a>], although the exact etiology is not clear. Although not always painful, the cords can limit the range of motion of the shoulder.</p><p>Therapy is usually directed at maintaining shoulder range of motion and reducing edema through manual lymphatic drainage. Depending on the degree of range of motion deficit, therapy can begin with gentle, gravity-assisted pendulum exercises (eg, Codman technique) and can gradually progress to wall walking and active assisted range of motion. Manual mobilization techniques can sometimes release or "break" the cords.</p><p>While treatment can be successful, patients may experience recurrence of axillary webs. Further research is needed in the etiology and best management strategy for patients who present with this syndrome.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1241138"><span class="h2">Postmastectomy pain syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Postmastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) is characterized as any pain persisting beyond the period of healing post-mastectomy, although it is also seen post-lumpectomy. Among females with breast cancer treated with a mastectomy, the risk factors for this syndrome include the following [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of severe and acute pain postoperatively</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Younger age at diagnosis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>RT to the axilla</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Extensive axillary surgery</p><p></p><p>The pain is typically characterized as burning, stabbing, neuropathic (eg, numbness, hyperesthesia, or paraesthesia), or as an "electric shock" at the operative site or ipsilateral arm. It is thought to be caused by direct nerve injury during breast cancer operations or from the development of a traumatic neuroma or scar tissue involving the neural tissue in the axilla and/or chest wall (eg, brachial plexus, intercostobrachial, lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal, long thoracic and medial and lateral pectoral nerves). The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of PMPS are discussed more extensively elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14973.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of postmastectomy pain syndrome"</a>.)</p><p>Although there are no prospective data on the impact of rehabilitation services on PMPS, physical therapy (PT) is often prescribed to help relieve the symptoms of PMPS. This includes modalities such as desensitization techniques, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and the application of cold packs topically. The approach also involves pain management, including neural stabilizers (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9473" href="/d/drug information/9473.html" rel="external">pregabalin</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8483" href="/d/drug information/8483.html" rel="external">gabapentin</a>), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ([SNRIs]; eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8484" href="/d/drug information/8484.html" rel="external">duloxetine</a>), or topical agents (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs).</p><p>Interventional techniques such as intercostal or paravertebral nerve blocks and/or ablation can be used in the usual manner to treat regional pain syndromes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5630.html" rel="external">"Complex regional pain syndrome in adults: Treatment, prognosis, and prevention", section on 'Interventional options for refractory pain'</a>.)</p><p>Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNTA) injections into hyperirritable muscles such as the pectoralis major and serratus have been safely used in our practice with good efficacy to treat refractory PMPS. Its use is extrapolated from other data showing that BoNTA may prevent postoperative pain after mastectomy and subsequent breast reconstruction [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. However, no clinical trials exist on its use in PMPS. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/86609.html" rel="external">"Postmastectomy pain syndrome: Risk reduction and management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1241145"><span class="h2">Aromatase inhibitor-associated musculoskeletal syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are important agents utilized in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in the adjuvant and metastatic disease settings. However, AIs can cause a constellation of symptoms known as the Aromatase Inhibitor-associated Musculo-Skeletal Syndrome (AIMSS). Associated symptoms include arthralgia, joint stiffness, and bone pain, which can be severe in up to 30 percent of patients. The pain and stiffness typically involves the hands, arms, knees, feet, pelvic and hip bones, or back. It is usually symmetrical and may be associated with mild soft-tissue thickening [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Trigger finger and carpal tunnel syndrome are often the most frequently reported signs [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p>Initial management of AIMSS includes nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and exercise, as these interventions may allow patients to minimize or avoid the use of narcotic medications. As an example, one trial (Hormones and Physical Exercise [HOPE]) demonstrated that patients with AIMSS derive benefit from exercise, including reduction in pain, weight loss, and improved exercise capacity. Further details on this trial, as well as the optimal medication-based management of AIMSS, are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/749.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant endocrine and targeted therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer", section on 'Musculoskeletal pains and stiffness'</a>.)</p><p>The approach to these patients is also similar to those with signs and symptoms of fibromyalgia. Physical and occupational therapy is aimed at increasing range of motion, while strengthening exercises aim to increase flexibility and relieve tension. Any exercise prescription should also include weight-bearing exercises to prevent osteoporosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5627.html" rel="external">"Treatment of fibromyalgia in adults", section on 'Increasing physical activity and exercise'</a>.)</p><p>Beyond medical therapy and exercise, complementary modalities such as acupuncture may be helpful [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. If carpal tunnel syndrome or trigger finger is present, an injection with corticosteroids and/or splinting may relieve symptoms. In our experience, injections to alleviate the symptoms associated with carpal tunnel syndrome do not worsen lymphedema in patients with mild to moderate lymphedema; therefore, the presence of lymphedema should not be taken as an absolute contraindication to this therapy. Of note, isolated knee pain can also be treated with intra-articular corticosteroid injections.</p><p>Musculoskeletal complications associated with other cancer-related therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy, are discussed separately.

Cancer and/or its treatment are the most common causes of lymphedema in the developed world and can be a significant cause of both physical and functional distress. The most common cancer associated with lymphedema is breast cancer, although it is not uncommon among patients treated for other cancers, including soft-tissue sarcoma, lower extremity melanoma, gynecologic or genitourinary cancers, and cancers of the head and neck. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/104714.html" rel="external">"Breast cancer-associated lymphedema"</a>.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of lymphedema are discussed separately.

In addition, for patients referred to rehabilitation, the application of Kinesio tape may be an additional modality for treatment [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>]. Kinesio taping is a specific type of modality that involves the use of an elastic adhesive tape applied to a patient's skin to facilitate proper fascial plane alignment. It is theorized that re-aligning such fascial planes will enhance tissue healing and serve to alleviate pain. Kinesio taping has rapidly become popular in the fields of sports medicine and rehabilitation, but clinical trials demonstrating its efficacy are limited.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1241157"><span class="h2">Neuropathy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (CINP) may result from direct toxic effects on the nervous system or indirectly from drug-induced metabolic derangements or cerebrovascular disorders.

In addition, rehabilitation, which includes physical and/or occupational therapy, may be useful to work on deficits such as decreased balance, gait abnormalities, muscle weakness, and difficulties with performing activities of daily living. Pain or discomfort should be properly managed for full participation in therapy.

They may strengthen the working diagnosis based on the history and physical examination. NCS/EMG may be useful for deciphering the location of a nerve lesion such as root, plexus, or peripheral nerve itself. This, in turn, may prompt additional work-up, including blood work, as in the case of peripheral neuropathy, to determine potential reversible causes. Additionally, NCS/EMG results indicating nerve root origin for pathology may warrant follow-up imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to further examine for causes of extrinsic insult to a nerve root from a herniated disc or mass. NCS/EMG can be helpful in the management of carpal tunnel syndrome, as individuals who have electrodiagnostic evidence for axonal loss may need more aggressive treatment such as surgery, while those with pure conduction block may respond better to corticosteroid injection.

For patients treated for head and neck cancer, symptoms typically consist of trapezius atrophy, shoulder girdle depression, limited active shoulder abduction to less than 90 degrees, shoulder pain, and shoulder weakness. RT and surgery can also lead to hyperirritable muscles and nerves, resulting in spasm, pain, and muscle tightness. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5282.html" rel="external">"Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes", section on 'Spinal accessory neuropathy'</a>.)</p><p>Rehabilitation includes preserving range of motion of the shoulder, strengthening of alternate scapular elevators and retractors, neuromuscular retraining of shoulder girdle muscles, postural modification, and using electrical stimulation [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Patients with complete spinal accessory nerve palsy can be fitted with an orthosis to reduce pain [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. For patients experiencing spasm or tightness of a specific muscle group, we have found a combination of PT as well as botulinum toxin injections into the sternocleidomastoid muscle to decrease painful spasms [<a href="#rid32">32,33</a>]. Integrative techniques, such as acupuncture, may also be helpful [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1241171"><span class="h2">Dropped head syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with a history of radiation to the head and neck can develop neck extensor weakness secondary to myopathy and atrophy, leading to dropped head syndrome or an inability to keep the head up for a prolonged period of time. RT leads to progressive fibrosis that can involve tissues encompassed by the radiation field, such as the spinal cord, cervical nerve roots, cervical and brachial plexus, and peripheral nerves and muscles. This neuromuscular damage, known as "myelo-radiculo-plexo-neuro-myopathy," results in functional compromise of the cervical and thoracic paraspinals and subsequent difficulty keeping the head upright [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Dropped head syndrome is seen most commonly in survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma who have received mantle field RT. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14232.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult survivor of classic Hodgkin lymphoma", section on 'Neuromuscular complications'</a>.)</p><p>PT can improve patients' quality of life by improving core muscles as well as neck strength, posture, body mechanics, proprioception, and endurance with emphasis on a lifelong home exercise program, as over time patients can develop neck flexor contractures [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Manual myofascial release techniques are beneficial over fibrotic tissue. A cervical collar such as the Headmaster  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97015" href="/d/graphic/97015.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) or a similar device can be used for functional assistance in elevating the neck, energy conservation, and improving quality of life.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1241178"><span class="h2">Trismus</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Trismus is a common complication of head and neck cancer and is usually due to a combination of factors, including direct tumor invasion, surgery, and/or RT. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3365.html" rel="external">"Management of late complications of head and neck cancer and its treatment", section on 'Trismus'</a>.)</p><p>Treatment should be aggressive and started early, as mature scar tissue becomes more resistant to exercise therapy [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Multiple modalities have been implemented and can be used alone or in combination. Aside from an evaluation from a speech and swallow specialist, dentist, and nutritionist, PT should be initiated for myofascial release techniques as well as initiation of oromotor tongue and jaw exercises to preserve range of motion [<a href="#rid37">37,38</a>]. The most commonly prescribed devices used to treat trismus in this population are the TheraBite System [<a href="#rid39">39</a>] and The Dynasplint Trismus System [<a href="#rid40">40,41</a>]. In the past, stacked tongue depressors and/or corkscrew-like devices were used but have now fallen out of favor due to the oral and dental trauma associated with their use. Other modalities, such as low-level laser therapy and low-intensity ultrasound, have also shown some improvement [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].</p><p>Botulinum toxin injections to the masseter or pterygoid by themselves do not improve mouth opening, but they can help with muscle pain and decrease dynamic muscle spasm [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. Pain medications, including muscle relaxants, analgesics, and nerve stabilizers can be used to diminish the pain and spasm, which can make jaw opening devices and therapy more effective.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1241185"><span class="h2">Speech and swallowing dysfunction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>This should be evaluated in every head and neck cancer patient and should be treated appropriately.

Although "chemo brain" is commonly used, cognitive dysfunction is usually multifactorial in nature, and the treating clinician should rule out other concomitant factors such as anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. Cognitive dysfunction can include memory impairment, mental fogginess, difficulty concentrating, slower processing speed, and difficulty with executive functioning. These symptoms can persist even after treatment cessation. Neuropsychologic evaluation and testing are important to determine the nature and extent of the patient's impairment, which then would guide appropriate treatment interventions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16347.html" rel="external">"Cognitive function after cancer and cancer treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/109994.html" rel="external">"Patients with cancer: Clinical features and diagnosis of cognitive impairment and delirium", section on 'Cognitive impairment'</a>.)</p><p>Cognitive rehabilitation for cancer patients is not yet based on solid evidence-based research and oftentimes uses the guidelines approached for traumatic brain injury and stroke patients [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. Goals usually involve maximizing functioning, coping, and quality of life through the use of compensatory strategies and reliance on residual abilities [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. Compensatory strategies include making changes in the patient's home or hospital environment to increase structure, decrease demands for planning and decision making, and enhance orientation. External memory aides such as checklists, planners or memory books, wall calendars, and alarms can be used. It is important to treat other etiologies such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, stress, and depression as well.</p><p>Pharmacologic interventions (eg, cytokine antagonists, antiinflammatory agents, stimulants, and anticholinergics) have also been used in conjunction with formal rehabilitation. Exercise has not yet been studied for cognitive dysfunction in cancer patients, but it has shown improvement in cognitive recovery among patients with acquired brain injury [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. Exercise is generally advocated for its overall benefits, including decreasing fatigue, depression, anxiety, improving quality of life, and decreasing bone loss and fracture [<a href="#rid47">47</a>].
