CAIM therapies may be used to promote overall health and wellness, mitigate cancer-related symptoms, as supportive care during cancer treatment to mitigate side effects, during survivorship care to address late effects of cancer treatment, and to improve overall quality of life during the continuum of cancer care, including end-of-life care. Given the high frequency of use, and the various reasons for CAIM use in cancer patients, it is important for clinicians to ascertain what CAIM therapies are being used and for what purpose.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of CAIM therapies and practices in patients with cancer, including definitions, how to discuss CAIM use with patients, the potential risks and harms of CAIM use by patients with cancer, a description of those complementary and integrative medicine practices that require specific training (including licensing and credentialing) and those that do not, and a general overview of the role of these practices in oncology care. </p><p>Further details on rehabilitative and integrative strategies for pain in patients with cancer are discussed elsewhere:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14249.html" rel="external">"Rehabilitative and integrative therapies for pain in patients with cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2598129901"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is important to understand the different definitions of complementary medicine, alternative medicine, and integrative medicine:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>As defined by the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nccih.nih.gov%2Fhealth%2Fcomplementary-alternative-or-integrative-health-whats-in-a-name&amp;token=ukDvWgywpi0IEMTIYqoQ%2FcSGZFgbCj4Njm8GyoRN1woR4057x5qnNjl8E1o4EC8ll9q35rJ5SMqwX2VunElJxZYe%2BhLeyDI%2FmPKr9HKZqLZOetrwgs91iJ0svmns3XT%2F&amp;TOPIC_ID=2831" target="_blank">National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health</a>, and the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcam.cancer.gov%2Fhealth_information%2Fcam_definitions.htm&amp;token=utqHb9RChX8Suh6PjVzWX8sAfl0KSgMXstI4koSiYjvJi5X3IepiIlH9lKhnw7kDuXYP49LyVt5YX4qrab3GKQ%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=2831" target="_blank">National Cancer Institute</a>, "complementary medicine" is used along with standard care; in the setting of oncology, this is often considered supportive care.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">By contrast, "alternative medicine" is the use of nonstandard treatments in lieu of standard medical care; in the oncology setting, these are often nonevidence-based cancer treatments.

Integrative oncology aims to optimize health, quality of life, and clinical outcomes across the cancer care continuum and to empower people to prevent cancer and become active participants before, during, and beyond cancer treatment.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1064828090"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The use of CAIM in cancer patients is common. Multiple studies have found that over the course of one year, up to 90 percent of patients with cancer used a CAIM approach for at least a part of their therapy [<a href="#rid2">2,4-11</a>]. Some patients limit use to common dietary supplements, such as calcium and vitamin D, whereas others use a broad range of supplements, mind-body medicine practices, and body-based practices [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. In 2012, the estimated national cost in the United States of CAIM use by patients with active cancer and survivors was $6.7 billion [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. CAIM usage patterns differ by patient population, demographics, and geography:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among cancer populations, individuals with breast cancer represent the highest users of CAIM [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Globally, the reasons for CAIM use may differ based on cultural preferences, as well as access to conventional medical care.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the United States, vitamins and minerals are the most commonly used form of CAIM, and use is higher among cancer survivors compared with cancer-free adults (75 versus 68 percent), followed by herbal supplements (24 versus 19 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patterns of CAIM use also differ by geographic region in the United States, with use of non-vitamin, non-mineral dietary supplements being significantly higher than the national average of 18 percent in the Pacific (23 percent), Mountain (29 percent), and West North Central (23 percent) regions compared with the rest of the country [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. In addition, the use of mind and body practices, such as yoga and meditation also differ across geographic regions in the United States, with use being significantly higher than the national average of 8.4 percent in the Pacific (12 percent), Mountain (11.5 percent), and New England (11 percent) regions.</p><p></p><p>Users of CAIM are generally <strong>not</strong> dissatisfied with conventional medicine but find CAIM therapies to be more congruent with their own values, beliefs, and philosophical orientations toward health and life [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Factors reported to be associated with CAIM use in cancer patients include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased psychosocial stress (eg, anxiety, depression) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Being given a less hopeful prognosis [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Having the feeling of "nothing to lose" [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Attending support groups [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age (younger versus older) and sex (female more than male) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3972451194"><span class="h1">DISCUSSING CAIM WITH PATIENTS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H300049780"><span class="h2">Importance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is important to ask all patients with cancer about CAIM use throughout the course of their treatment/survivorship, and to ascertain what they are using, who is directing the therapy (eg, self or practitioner/provider), and their reasons for use of specific forms of CAIM. Clinicians will then be able to assess the patient's goals of therapy, whether the approach/modality is known to be effective or risky, whether the specific approach is helpful, whether there are adverse effects, and if there are other known therapies that might be equally or more effective. The risk-to-benefit ratio of each CAIM approach should be addressed.</p><p>The following data pertain to cancer patients:</p><p>Despite the high prevalence of CAIM use among oncology populations, patient-provider communication about CAIM use is generally lacking [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. In a survey of 752 newly diagnosed adult cancer patients in the United States receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy, 91 percent were using one or more forms of CAIM, yet only 51 percent discussed at least one form of CAIM with their oncologist, and 24 percent discussed between two and four modalities; 49 percent did not discuss any CAIM therapy [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Among the reasons for patient nondisclosure to providers of CAIM therapies are: not being asked by the provider; perceived time constraints; and patients feeling providers are uninterested, unreceptive, or unknowledgeable about supplements [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cancer patients may not reveal the use of CAIM unless specifically asked. In one study, disclosure increased from 7 to 43 percent when directed questions were added to standard history taking [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Unfortunately, communication between oncologists and patients about CAIM is poor, infrequent, and mostly initiated by patients or their kin [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Despite the current popularity of CAIM, most mainstream oncologists have little understanding of these therapies [<a href="#rid27">27</a>], and in one study, fewer than one-half initiated discussions about their use with patients [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1623567284"><span class="h2">Communication strategies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Oncology healthcare providers can use published clinical practice guidelines to inform their approach to discussing and documenting CAIM therapies with their patients [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Communicate respectfully and nonjudgmentally with patients and caregivers about CAIM.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assess all patients for CAIM use, including details of therapies, dose, frequency, and goals for use.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Determine patient's information needs around CAIM and assist with knowledge acquisition.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Provide patients with coaching and support for making evidence-informed CAIM decisions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Document patient's CAIM use, discussions about use, potential interactions, and monitoring plans in the electronic medical record.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Monitor and follow up with patients about their CAIM use.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Report suspected serious adverse events to appropriate regulatory bodies; adverse events related to dietary and herbal supplements should be reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (800-FDA-1088).</p><p></p><p>Engaging in a meaningful discussion with a patient about a topic for which there is limited formal education and is potentially controversial is a daunting task. Although training programs have been established [<a href="#rid30">30</a>], the best way to educate patients and clinicians about the appropriate and effective use of CAIM in the oncology setting is not established, and there is no consensus on the most successful method(s) [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1018509314"><span class="h1">POTENTIAL RISKS AND HARMS OF CAIM USE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While many forms of CAIM being used by cancer patients are associated with minimal or no risk, this is not true for all such therapies; there are three distinct issues related to potential risks and harms of CAIM use:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Direct toxicity or injury resulting from the CAIM therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Potential interactions with conventional treatment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Possible delay in receipt of effective conventional therapy or treatment due to use/pursuit of CAIM therapy, or due to conflicting belief system.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H450980679"><span class="h2">Direct toxicity of CAIM medications and procedures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A variety of natural products may produce serious side effects.

There are complications that are seen with any type of needle use, including transmission of infectious diseases, retained needle fragments, nerve damage, and very rarely, pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum, organ puncture, cardiac tamponade, and osteomyelitis. Local complications may include bleeding, contact dermatitis, infection, pain, and paresthesias. Major adverse events are exceedingly rare and are usually associated with poorly trained, unlicensed acupuncturists.

More serious adverse events reported in rare case reports and case series include cerebrovascular dissection or occlusion; femoral or vertebral compression fracture; and injuries of the sciatic, median, ulnar, and common peroneal nerves. In addition, poses that involve extreme flexion or extension may be associated with an increased risk of a compression fracture in patients with osteoporosis, osteopenia, or bone metastases [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Guidelines are available from an expert consensus group on safety of exercise interventions in cancer patients with bone metastases, but they do not cover yoga [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].

Interaction software programs were used to screen for potential medication interactions (PMIs), which were identified in 1747 cases and were related to prescription medications (70 percent), herbs and supplements (56 percent), and with anticancer therapies (22 percent). More than one-half of identified PMIs were of moderate severity (54 percent), but 38 percent were considered major severity (which included "contraindicated" and "high-risk" PMIs), with herb and supplement users at significantly higher risk for a major interaction (92 versus 70 percent).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4008537749"><span class="h3">Specific interactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Dietary supplement use among cancer patients can present risks at all stages of treatment including during surgery, systemic therapy, and radiation therapy. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the perioperative period, dietary supplements such as botanicals can increase the risk of bleeding (eg, garlic, ginkgo, and ginseng) and increase sedation with anesthesia (eg, kava and valerian) [<a href="#rid48">48</a>].

Acupuncture is considered a part of traditional Chinese medicine and has been practiced for thousands of years. Traditionally it is thought to stimulate the flow of a form of energy called <em>qi</em> (chee) throughout the body via a meridian system. Traditional Chinese acupuncture, which is commonly used in North America, utilizes needle manipulation to produce a <em>de qi </em>sensation (a soreness, fullness, heaviness, or local area distension) [<a href="#rid63">63</a>], along with a period of needle retention or rest with the needles inserted.

The trance‐like state of hypnosis allows a patient to be more aware, focused, and open to suggestion. A person in a hypnotic state can concentrate more clearly on specific feelings, thoughts, images, sensations, or behaviors without distraction. The hypnotic state is obtained by first relaxing the body and then shifting attention toward a narrow range of objects or ideas given by the hypnotist or hypnotherapist. A person under hypnosis may feel calmer and more relaxed. In patients with cancer, hypnosis is often used to help relieve stress, anxiety, and pain.</p><p>Hypnosis can be defined as an induced state of attentive, focused concentration with suspension of some peripheral awareness. Major components of the hypnotic state include absorption (capacity to contemplate deeply a selected theme or focal point), controlled alteration of one's attention, dissociation (the capacity to compartmentalize different aspects of an individual experience), and suggestibility (the capacity for heightened responsiveness to instructions) [<a href="#rid94">94-96</a>]. Hypnosis has been increasingly utilized for chronic and acute pain conditions and is increasingly accepted for both acute and procedure-related pain [<a href="#rid97">97</a>].</p><p>The mechanisms responsible for hypnotic phenomena are not entirely clear. Research in breast cancer surgical patients suggests that the benefits are mediated by altered response expectancies (ie, specific expectations for nonvolitional events such as the occurrence of pain and fatigue after an operation) and diminished emotional distress when stressful surgical procedures are undertaken [<a href="#rid98">98,99</a>]. Hypnosis may also provide therapeutic benefit by decreasing the unpleasantness of the sensation, or reducing the attention paid to the painful sensation and refocusing attention elsewhere [<a href="#rid100">100-103</a>].</p><p>Patients vary widely in their ability to achieve a hypnotic state. Typically, individuals have been classified as "high hypnotizables" or "low hypnotizables," as assessed by validated instruments such as the Penn State Scale of Hypnotizability [<a href="#rid104">104</a>] or the Stanford Hypnotic Clinical Scale [<a href="#rid105">105</a>]. These scales of hypnotic susceptibility provide a relatively stable measurement of individual differences [<a href="#rid106">106</a>]. Cooperation and suggestibility are important foundations for hypnotizability. The trait of suggestibility alone, however, does not determine the potential for hypnotic induction and does not imply that any particular outcomes will be achieved. To allay concerns, some patients need reassurance that hypnosis cannot induce behaviors that would not be desired or are contrary to the patient's values. While individuals who are "high hypnotizables" are more responsive to hypnotic suggestions of analgesia, there is evidence that distraction, relaxation, and hypnotic suggestions of analgesia typical of a hypnotic session can modulate the pain experience even in patients with a medium or low level of hypnotizability [<a href="#rid107">107</a>]. This can result in an improved ability to achieve cognitive control of pain and, therefore, to experience symptom improvement.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2551485403"><span class="h3">Training and credentialing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mental health and medical professionals typically practice hypnosis as a specialty or subspecialty.

Currently, there are no accredited schools offering standard college or university degrees in hypnosis; therefore, training in one of the above professions is typically required before acceptance into one of many training or certification programs.

It is based on two theories: "Like cures like" and "law of minimum dose." "Like cures like" or The Law of Similars is the concept that symptoms can be cured by a substance that produces similar symptoms in healthy people. For example, large quantities of coffee can make people sleepless and agitated, whereas a homeopathic preparation of coffee could be used to treat people with insomnia and agitation. "Law of minimum dose" is the concept that the smallest dose necessary to elicit a healing response in a patient should be used. Homeopathic products are made by a process of dilution and succussion; with each dilution of the original substance (eg, plant, mineral, herb) the remedy or medicine is vigorously shaken or succussed. As the number of dilutions and succussions increases the medicine is thought to be more potent, even though less of the original substance remain. [<a href="#rid142">142,143</a>].</p><p>Homeopathic products come from plants, minerals, or animals. Homeopathic products are often made as sugar pellets to be placed sublingually under the tongue, they may also be in other forms such as ointments, gels, drops, creams, and tablets. Homeopathic medicines, called remedies, may be used in chronic conditions and acute illnesses and injuries. Treatments are individualized to each person and it's common for different people with the same condition to receive different treatments.
