         There is increasing evidence that adult hypertension has its antecedents during childhood as childhood blood pressure (BP) predicts adult BP [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. Hypertension in childhood and adolescence may contribute to premature atherosclerosis and the early development of cardiovascular disease. As a result, identifying and successfully treating children with hypertension may have an important impact on long-term outcomes of cardiovascular disease. (See

         High BP, including hypertension, is defined from normative distribution of BP data in healthy children that includes children from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and other screening studies. This is in contrast with adult hypertension, which is primarily defined by clinical outcome data (ie, risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality) from large trials of antihypertensive therapy. However, these outcome measures cannot be applied to children, because cardiovascular events other than left ventricular hypertrophy do not typically occur in childhood. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3852.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of hypertension in adults"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Pediatric BP levels are interpreted based on sex, age, and height. In the 2017 AAP guidelines, normative tables  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63856" href="/z/d/graphic/63856.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         and
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52646" href="/z/d/graphic/52646.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ) were revised by using data only from normal-weight children. The revised tables excluded BP data from overweight and obese children (ie, children with body mass index ≥85
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         percentile) that were previously included in normative BP databases. As a result, BP values are several mmHg lower than in similar tables in previously published normative values by the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Of note, the definitions for adolescents are aligned with adult guidelines for the detection of elevated BP.

         Tracking refers to the pattern of repeated BP measurements over time. The clinical importance of tracking in children with annual BP over the age of three years is related to the ability to predict BP status later in childhood and adulthood. Children, especially adolescents, who are hypertensive are more likely to remain hypertensive throughout childhood and as adults, particularly in the presence of a family history of hypertension, increased body weight, or increased left ventricular mass [

          17-24

        </p>
        <p>
         However, there are data that, in some children, hypertension or elevated BP will return to normal levels. This was illustrated in a primary care study based on data from the electronic medical records of almost 400,000 children that reported subsequent normalization of BP for most children who met criteria for either hypertension or elevated BP with ≥3 BP measurements recorded over 36 months [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. Over a second concurrent 36-month period, no abnormal BP levels of the ≥3 BP measurements were recorded of 50 percent of children previously diagnosed during the first time period with hypertension (933 of 1881) or 70 percent of those diagnosed with elevated BP (1492 of 2144). Of note, a minority of patients had significant increases of BP, with 12 percent of children with elevated BP progressing to a higher BP category and 5 percent of children with stage 1 hypertension progressing to stage 2 hypertension in the second 36 months. Also, only one-half of the 7775 children with abnormally elevated BP in the first 36-month period had ≥3 BP measurements recorded during the second 36-month period. Limitations of this study included the small number of children in the entire cohort with longitudinal BP measurements necessary for study inclusion and those due to data extraction from the electronic medical record, such as inability to determine if measurements were done appropriately and whether interventions (eg, lifestyle changes) were implemented. Nevertheless, these results highlighted normalization of BP for many children with abnormally high BP and the need to ensure that these children have adequate follow-up with subsequent BP measurements. Further studies are needed to verify these results, and, if findings are consistent regarding subsequent normalization of BP, this raises the possibility that criteria may need to be modified to include longer follow-up BP monitoring before diagnosing a child with hypertension.

         In 2020, the United States Preventive Services Task Force reaffirmed their previous conclusion based on a systematic reevaluation of the available evidence that there was inadequate evidence to support for or against BP screening in asymptomatic children and adolescents [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26

The task force recommendation is based on their assessment of inadequate evidence regarding accuracy of screening and the benefits of interventions (nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic measures) in long-term reduction of BP or effectiveness in reducing adverse health outcomes associated with high BP in adults and no direct evidence of benefit that pediatric screening reduces adverse health outcomes. In addition, there is insufficient evidence regarding whether there is harm associated with either early detection of high BP or interventions to treat high BP.

         The cuff should be inflated to 20 to 30 mmHg above the anticipated SBP and then deflated slowly at a rate of 2 to 3 mmHg per heartbeat. The SBP is equal to the pressure at which the brachial pulse (initial tapping sound) can first be heard by auscultation (Korotkoff phase I). As the cuff is deflated below the SBP, the pulse continues to be heard until there is abrupt muffling (Korotkoff phase IV) followed by disappearance of sound (Korotkoff phase V) [

         To directly compare BP values with normative data, BP measurement is performed in the right arm after the patient has been resting comfortably for at least three minutes in a seated position in a quiet environment. (See

         In the initial evaluation for hypertension, BP measurements are obtained in both upper and lower extremities to detect the possible presence of coarctation as the cause of hypertension. (See

         At each visit, at least two BP measurements are obtained and spaced one or two minutes apart. The values should be less than 5 mmHg apart, and continued measurements are made until a stable value is attained. The recorded value on the patient's chart is the average of the last two measurements. (See

Alternatively, the patient could be referred to a subspecialist with expertise in the evaluation and management of elevated pediatric BP within one week. If, at the next visit, the BP is still at the stage 2 level, diagnostic evaluation including ABPM and treatment by a specialist should be considered. (See

         Blood pressure (BP) changes continually in response to physiologic and environmental stimuli and is higher when individuals are active and/or ambulatory versus when they are at rest. Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) is used increasingly because of its ability to records numerous BP readings during a 24-hour time period while the child is engaged in their normal activities, including sleep [

          Patient selection
         </strong>
         – We suggest using ABPM to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension in children, where available, as recommended in guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,27
         </a>
         ]. ABPM is particularly valuable to identify children whose clinic BP is spuriously elevated due to anxiety (eg, white coat hypertension) or those with masked hypertension, in which home BP is higher than office BP measurements. It also provides information about circadian BP patterns that can be useful for evaluating children with chronic kidney disease, diabetes, autonomic dysfunction, or episodic hypertension and the BP response to therapeutic intervention. Considerations and selection of patients for ABPM are discussed elsewhere. (See
