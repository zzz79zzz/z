         During the normal transition to extrauterine life, blood glucose concentration in the healthy term newborn falls during the first one to two hours after delivery, reaching a nadir with a median concentration of approximately 55 mg/dL. It is important to differentiate this normal physiologic transitional response from disorders that result in persistent or recurrent hypoglycemia, which if left untreated may lead to significant neurologic and developmental sequelae.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will discuss the management and outcome of neonatal hypoglycemia, including evaluation of persistent hypoglycemia. The physiology of normal transient neonatal low blood glucose levels causes of persistent or pathologic neonatal hypoglycemia, and the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia are discussed separately.

         Clinical guidelines have been developed by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Pediatric Endocrine Society (PES) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. The goals of these guidelines are to reduce neurologic impairment due to neonatal hypoglycemia (see
         <a class="local">
          'Neurodevelopmental outcome'
         </a>
         below), while minimizing overtreatment of neonates with normal transitional low glucose concentrations. In addition, the PES guidelines provide guidance on how and when to identify infants with a serious underlying persistent hypoglycemic disorder. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Society guideline links'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, it is important to recognize that a precise blood glucose level and/or duration of hypoglycemia that accurately predict poor neurodevelopmental outcome have not been established (see
         <a class="local">
          'Neurodevelopmental outcome'
         </a>
         below). An optimal management strategy based on specific blood glucose thresholds to reduce adverse long-term neurologic outcomes has not been identified [

         Newborns with hypoglycemia who have severe signs and symptoms (lethargy, coma, seizures) require urgent intervention. These signs are an indicator of possible brain injury. For this reason, intravenous (IV) dextrose is used to increase blood glucose (BG) levels in these patients [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Therapy should be initiated while awaiting laboratory confirmation of low plasma glucose levels. Although these severe symptoms most commonly occur when BG is &lt;25 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L), there is great variability in the clinical response in neonates to low BG [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]; some newborns become symptomatic at the same or even higher BG levels than those observed in asymptomatic infants. As a result, there is not a precise numerical BG level that accurately predicts when and if a neonate will present with severe symptoms. (See

          Maximum infusion rate
         </strong>
         – The maximum rate of glucose infusion for treatment is limited by the maximum amount of fluids that can be administered to a patient (this is variable for each patient, but we have used rates as high as 200 mL/kg per day while monitoring for evidence of hyponatremia and fluid overload) and the maximum concentration of dextrose for the type of vascular access. In general, if the glucose infusion rate exceeds 12 mg/kg per minute or infusion rates exceed 160 mL/kg per day, other interventions should be considered. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Other therapeutic options'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The maximum dextrose concentrations for fluid administered through a peripheral IV catheter or a low lying umbilical venous catheter is 12.5 percent, and through a central venous catheter (including a centrally positioned umbilical venous catheter) is 25 percent. In severe cases, rates of fluid administration required to deliver sufficient glucose to treat hypoglycemia may be greater than the rate of maintenance fluids. In these cases, the patient's fluid balance and clinical status should be monitored closely for volume overload, looking for evidence of pulmonary edema, heart failure, and hyponatremia. Infants who depend upon high infusion rates or a dextrose concentration &gt;12.5% require placement of a central venous catheter. In some cases, diuretics may be warranted to manage fluid overload.

          Weaning and transition to oral feeds
         </strong>
         – When the BG is stabilized and maintained within the target range, the glucose infusion rate can be tapered slowly, and the infant can be transitioned to oral feeds.

         ]. If one is considering using diazoxide for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, consultation with a pediatric endocrinologist is warranted. This is to assist in determining whether hyperinsulinism is the cause of hypoglycemia, identifying the underlying etiology of the hyperinsulinism and whether diazoxide is appropriate, and guiding the initial dosing and monitoring of diazoxide therapy. In addition, the endocrinologist is typically the clinician who will manage these infants in the outpatient setting. Identifying infants with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is discussed in detail separately. (See

          table 1
         </a>
         ). If the BG remains below threshold after treatment with dextrose gel and oral feeding, IV dextrose is administered. In addition, IV dextrose is generally warranted if BG remains &lt;45 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) after three feedings or if the newborn requires &gt;5 doses of dextrose gel during the course of their birth hospitalization.

         A neonatal 40% dextrose gel is commercially available for this purpose; however, it may not be available in all settings. If a neonatal product is not available, over-the-counter (OTC) gels that are commonly used for treatment of hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes can be used. These OTC products have varying glucose concentrations, hence it is important to appropriately adjust the amount given based on the concentration to ensure that the recommended dose of 200 mg/kg is administered [

          21

         ]. In the larger of the two trials, the Sugar Babies trial (n=237), neonates assigned to dextrose gel were less likely to have treatment failure (defined as BG &lt;45 mg/dL [2.5 mmol/L] after two treatment attempts) compared with those assigned to placebo (14 versus 24 percent; RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33-0.98 [

         ]. Dextrose gel was effective in raising BG levels both in infants who received breast milk and those who received formula, though the absolute increase was greater among formula-fed infants. Three infants in the trial experienced severe hypoglycemia (ie, BG &lt;18 mg/dL [&lt;1 mmol/L]), all three were in the placebo group. There were no other serious adverse events reported in the trial. In a follow-up report of the Sugar Babies trial, rates of neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) at age two years were similar in both groups (38 versus 34 percent: RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.75-1.63), as were rates of processing difficulty (10 versus 18 percent; RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.23-1.15) [

          Prophylactic early use in at-risk infants

         – We suggest
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         using dextrose gel to prevent hypoglycemia in at-risk newborns in the absence of documented hypoglycemia. The rationale for prophylactic therapy is based upon the notion that identifying and treating hypoglycemia after the first feeding may not be sufficient to prevent adverse sequalae (ie, NDI). In addition, it was thought that prophylactic use of dextrose gel might reduce the need for laboratory testing and other interventions that often separate mother and newborn and interfere with breastfeeding. However, the available evidence does not support this approach. The clinical trial data suggest prophylactic dextrose gel modestly reduces the incidence of hypoglycemia, but it does not appear to reduce the risk of NDI [
         <a href="#rid27">

         The two trials investigating this question were the prevention of neonatal hypoglycemia (hPOD) trial, which was a multicenter randomized trial involving 2149 newborn infants at risk for hypoglycemia (maternal diabetes, large or small for gestational age, late preterm) and the pre-hPOD trial, which was a similar trial that enrolled 416 at-risk newborns [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,30
         </a>
         ]. In a meta-analysis of both trials, early (ie, within one hour after birth) prophylactic administration of oral dextrose gel reduced the incidence of hypoglycemia compared with placebo (38 versus 43 percent, relative risk [RR] 0.87, 95% CI 0.79-0.95) [

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Both trials reported outcomes at two years [

          28,29
         </a>
         ], which were not pooled in the meta-analysis because the two-year outcomes for hPOD were not yet available. In hPOD, two-year outcomes were reported only for a subset of the full trial cohort because many participants could not travel to the study centers due to COVID restrictions. Among the 1197 children who underwent follow-up evaluation, overall rates of NDI were similar between those who received dextrose gel compared with placebo (21 versus 19 percent; adjusted RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.90-1.41) [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. However, children in the dextrose gel group had a higher rate of motor delay (2.5 versus 0.7 percent; adjusted RR, 3.79, 95% CI 1.27-11.32) and slightly lower composite scores for cognitive, language, and motor performance on standardized testing (with mean differences ranging from one to two points on a 100-point scale). The reasons why children in the dextrose gel group would have adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes is unclear. It could represent a chance finding given that &gt;30 secondary outcomes were evaluated. The earlier pre-hPOD trial did not detect any differences in neurodevelopment or executive function at age two years between children who received dextrose gel versus placebo [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. Taken together, these trials suggest that early prophylactic use of dextrose gel modestly reduces the incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia, but it does not appear to reduce the need for IV therapy, nor separation from the parents/caregivers, nor the risk of NDI. As such, we suggest not using this approach.

         It is important to ensure that neonates are able to maintain plasma glucose concentrations in a normal range through cycles of feeding and fasting prior to discharge. However, data are lacking to determine the optimal discharge criteria, particularly the minimal required threshold glucose level.

          General criteria
         </strong>
         – In our practice, for infants who have been identified as having hypoglycemia, preprandial BG through three feed-fast cycles should be &gt;50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) in infants &lt;48 hours of age, and &gt;60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L) in those who are ≥48 hours of life [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,7
         </a>
         ]. In general, if a neonate can maintain BG &gt;60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L) after a 6- to 8-hour fast, it is likely that the infant is safe for discharge [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Other experts suggest a higher threshold of maintaining a preprandial BG &gt;70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) through several feed-fast cycles [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Although this higher threshold would be more sensitive for identifying newborns with persistent hypoglycemia, it lowers specificity so that the number of unnecessary evaluations may increase. It also prolongs hospitalization, which may have an inadvertent negative effect on maternal-infant bonding for infants without persistent hypoglycemia.

         Preterm infants ≤34 weeks are at risk for low hypoglycemia, likely due to immaturity of counter-regulatory hormone systems and poor nutrient reserves [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33

         ]. In addition, infants managed with parenteral nutrition are at risk of having hypoglycemia when transitioning to bolus enteral feeds [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. Even on full bolus enteral feeds, preterm infants have episodes of both low and high blood glucose (BG) levels [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35,36
         </a>
         ]. It appears that infants who are at risk for growth failure are also at risk for recurrent and persistent episodes of hypoglycemia [

          33
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Although a safe plasma glucose concentration for these infants has not been established, experts in the field, including the author of this topic, suggest maintaining BG &gt;50 to 60 mg/dL (2.8 to 3.3 mmol/L). This is likely to be a safe strategy to avoid long-term neurologic sequelae [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,37,38
         </a>
         ]. However, setting the targeted threshold levels must also take into account the patient's overall clinical and nutritional status. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         The management for asymptomatic preterm infants who are able to receive sufficient nutrition through enteral feeds entails early feeds and monitoring BG levels [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. For those who are not expected to be able to receive enough enteral nutrition due to prematurity, parenteral nutrition, which includes dextrose, should be started promptly. These issues are discussed separately. (See

         Persistent hypoglycemia is defined as low plasma glucose concentrations that persist beyond the first 48 hours after birth or the requirement of

         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The normal physiologic transitional drop in blood glucose generally resolves within this timeframe. Thus, infants with persistent hypoglycemia beyond 48 hours after birth are more likely to have a pathological hypoglycemia disorder (transient or permanent). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5053.html" rel="external">
          "Pathogenesis, screening, and diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia", section on 'Normal transitional low glucose levels'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, evaluation for hypoglycemic disorders should generally be deferred until 96 hours to a week or more after birth to ensure that the transitional period of adjusting the source of glucose from a continuous supply provided by the mother through the placenta to an intermittent supply from oral feeds has passed. In our practice, we recommend waiting at least seven days unless more intensive therapies (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13335" href="/z/d/drug information/13335.html" rel="external">
          glucagon

         ) are being considered. We wait even longer for evaluation if the patient has a known risk factor for hypoglycemia or if the results of the evaluation are not expected to change management.
        </p>
        <p>
         Deferring the evaluation is necessary because the biochemical features of normal physiologic transitional hypoglycemia (mild hyperinsulinism) can be difficult to distinguish from a pathologic process. For example, the constellation of findings consistent with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in an older child (ie, inappropriately elevated serum insulin levels, low ketone body [beta-hydroxybutyrate] and free fatty acid concentrations, and a brisk rise in glucose concentrations following
         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13335" href="/z/d/drug information/13335.html" rel="external">
          glucagon
         </a>
         administration) is also seen in an asymptomatic and otherwise healthy term infant &lt;48 hours old with normal low blood glucose levels. It remains uncertain exactly when this group of biochemical findings changes from normal physiology to representing a pathological hypoglycemic condition. However, for most healthy term newborns, this transition is believed to take place by 48 to 96 hours of age [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,39

         Once persistent hypoglycemia is established, further evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying cause. Most cases of persistent hypoglycemia in term infants will have biochemical features of hyperinsulinism and typically resolve in the first few weeks of life. However, some cases may persist and require ongoing medical management. This is true even in the absence of a suspected or defined genetic hypoglycemia disorder [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40,41
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, the clinician needs to determine the appropriate and safe point at which glucose monitoring can be discontinued and when hospital discharge should occur, versus when it is likely that an ongoing hypoglycemic disorder exists, which requires further intervention and/or evaluation [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Performing a safety fast prior to discharge may be helpful to make this determination, as discussed above. (See

         The evaluation consists of a thorough history, physical examination, and, in some cases, laboratory evaluation. (See

         Because tests performed when the blood glucose (BG) levels are normal are generally not helpful in determining the underlying cause of hypoglycemia, critical blood test samples for the diagnostic evaluation should be obtained when BG levels are &lt;50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) when measured in a laboratory, or &lt;40 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L) when measured with a bedside glucometer. This difference in suggested blood glucose threshold is due to the inaccuracy of a bedside glucometer for diagnosing neonatal hypoglycemia. (See

        <p>
         If a hypoglycemic episode does not develop spontaneously, it may be necessary to perform a six- to eight-hour fast (one skipped feed), which usually will result in an appropriately low BG. During the fast, frequent monitoring of vital signs, and BG levels (every hour) should be performed. If the BG concentration drops to &lt;50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) prior to six to eight hours, the critical blood samples should be obtained and then the fast terminated.

         These initial tests are used to distinguish diagnostic categories for neonatal hypoglycemia and help determine if other blood tests should be obtained, including plasma C-peptide, acylcarnitine profile, plasma free and total carnitine levels, serum amino acids, urine organic acids, or specific genetic tests  (

         Hypoglycemia with severe neuroglycopenic signs can result in brain injury that can be detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, there are no available data that clearly define the glucose concentration or the duration of hypoglycemia associated with brain damage detected by MRI or other long-term neurologic sequelae.

         A systematic review of the literature published in 2006 reported inconclusive evidence on the effect of neonatal hypoglycemia on neurodevelopment [

         The CHYLD (Children with HYpoglycemia and their Later Development) study was designed to examine the impact of neonatal hypoglycemia on infant and child development. It prospectively followed 528 infants who were born at ≥35 weeks gestation with risk factors for hypoglycemia (maternal diabetes, large for gestation, fetal growth restriction [FGR], or prematurity &lt;37 weeks gestation) [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. All infants in the study were monitored for hypoglycemia and those with documented hypoglycemia (ie, blood glucose [BG] &lt;47 mg/dL [2.6 mmol/L]) received treatment to maintain blood glucose above this threshold during the first 48 hours after birth. At two years of age, infants who received treatment for hypoglycemia had similar neurodevelopmental outcomes compared with those who did not require intervention. At follow-up in early childhood (mean age 4.5 years), children treated for neonatal hypoglycemia had higher rates of poor executive and visual motor function compared with those who did not require treatment [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. However, by school age (mean age 9.4 years), rates of low educational achievement were similar in both groups (47 versus 48 percent) [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>

         A retrospective observational study of all newborn infants born at a single tertiary United States center reported that children who had experienced transient neonatal hypoglycemia (defined as BG &lt;40 mg/dL [2.22 mmol/L]) had lower scores for literacy and math at fourth grade after adjusting for confounding factors [

         In preterm infants, controversy exists as to whether asymptomatic hypoglycemia causes neurologic injury and whether the threshold glucose concentrations for intervention should be lower in preterm than in term infants. Several studies report neurodevelopmental sequelae due to repeated or prolonged asymptomatic episodes of neonatal hypoglycemia in preterm patients. As a result, experts in the field, including the author, use a lower blood glucose level for intervention in preterm infants compared with term infants. (See

         Retrospective data analysis of a multicenter trial in preterm infants showed a correlation between prolonged hypoglycemia (BG &lt;47 mg/dL [2.6 mmol/L] on five different days during the first two months of age) and lower Bayley mental and psychomotor scores at 18 months corrected age [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48

         ]. Developmental delay or cerebral palsy was 3.5 times greater (95% CI 1.3-9.4) in the hypoglycemic infants. However, the frequency of glucose testing was variable and occurred more often in sicker infants. Furthermore, only arithmetic and motor scores were lower in hypoglycemic infants at 7.5 to 8 years of age [

         The long-term impairment of neurodevelopment may be greater in preterm infants with repeated hypoglycemic episodes who are also small for gestational age (SGA).

          At-risk newborns without documented hypoglycemia
         </strong>
         – For term and late preterm newborns who are at risk for hypoglycemia (maternal diabetes, small or large for gestational age, late preterm), we suggest early initial oral feeding (ie, within the first hour after birth) rather than prophylactic use of
         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13222" href="/z/d/drug information/13222.html" rel="external">

          Preterm infants
         </strong>
         – Preterm infants born at ≤34 weeks gestation are at increased risk for hypoglycemia. The management for asymptomatic preterm infants who are able to receive sufficient nutrition enterally entails early feeds and monitoring of BG levels. For those who are not expected to be able to receive enough enteral nutrition due to prematurity, parenteral nutrition, which includes dextrose, should be started promptly. These issues are discussed separately. (See

Other initial tests to consider include bicarbonate, lactate, and free fatty acids. The results of these tests help categorize the type of disorder and determine if additional testing is warranted  (
