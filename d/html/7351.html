These are acquired via pregnancy, transfusion, and/or prior transplant. The presence of these anti-HLA antibodies in the potential recipient's blood is called <strong>HLA sensitization</strong>.</p><p>If not adequately suppressed, the presence of such antibodies is likely to result in antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) and early graft loss. ABMR was recognized early in the history of transplantation as hyperacute rejection caused by the presence of preformed antibodies, most typically in the form of antibodies to donor HLAs. Introduction of pretransplant crossmatch techniques has essentially eliminated hyperacute rejection.</p><p>Waitlist times can exceed several years to decades, with disproportionately longer wait for patients with blood group B or O. The time spent on dialysis waiting for the appropriate deceased-donor allograft (DDA) to whom HLA antibodies do not exist has a significant adverse effect on both quality and quantity of life. Preemptive transplantation (performed prior to the need for dialysis) provides improved patient and allograft survival compared with results in patients maintained on dialysis for an extended period of time prior to transplantation.</p><p>According to 2022 data from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), approximately 12 percent of patients on the DDA waiting list are highly presensitized to HLA (defined as ≥80 percent calculated panel reactive antibody [CPRA]) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. As a result, such patients are less likely to be transplanted or will spend an extended period of time on the waiting list, pending availability of a suitable donor kidney. Many of these patients have potential living donors that are excluded without further workup based upon an initial positive crossmatch with the potential recipient, indicating the presence of preformed HLA antibodies.</p><p>The increased risk of hyperacute ABMR and subsequent allograft loss when transplanting against preformed HLA antibodies has engendered a general avoidance of this practice. However, reports of successful transplantation across HLA barriers using various desensitization protocols designed to reduce the amount of preexisting antibody to a level that allows for successful engraftment have stimulated increased interest in using immunologically incompatible grafts [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Patients with a willing but HLA-incompatible donor may wait for a deceased-donor organ or receive a living-donor organ through desensitization, kidney paired donation (KPD), or a combination of both. The choice between desensitization or KPD for an individual recipient depends upon the likelihood of finding a suitable match through KPD and the chances of successful desensitization.</p><p>This topic will review the approaches used in kidney transplantation to overcome the HLA-sensitization barrier. An overview of HLA sensitization and crossmatch testing, KPD, and the diagnosis and treatment of ABMR are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116878.html" rel="external">"Kidney transplantation in adults: Overview of HLA sensitization and crossmatch testing"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115382.html" rel="external">"Kidney transplantation in adults: Kidney paired donation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7352.html" rel="external">"Kidney transplantation in adults: Clinical features and diagnosis of acute kidney allograft rejection"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7326.html" rel="external">"Kidney transplantation in adults: Prevention and treatment of antibody-mediated rejection"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1737752969"><span class="h1">ASSESSMENT OF PATIENT SENSITIZATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HLA sensitization of a potential transplant recipient is first assessed at the time of initial transplant evaluation. The objective is to measure the degree of HLA sensitization, which can be characterized by both the breadth and strength of HLA antibodies. Panel reactive antibodies (PRA) is an estimate of the percentage of the population to which the candidate has antibodies against and is a characterization of the breadth of HLA sensitization. The PRA inversely correlates with the likelihood of a compatible donor match, with higher PRA associated with lower chances of compatible transplantation. On the other hand, HLA antibody strength, represented by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) or dilutional titers, is one of the main determinants of the ability of successful desensitization for transplant. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116878.html" rel="external">"Kidney transplantation in adults: Overview of HLA sensitization and crossmatch testing"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7309.html" rel="external">"Kidney transplantation in adults: Evaluation of the potential kidney transplant recipient", section on 'Laboratory and imaging tests'</a>.)</p><p>Transplant centers vary in their approach to measuring HLA sensitization, but all assess for the presence of HLA antibodies by testing patient sera against solubilized HLA antigens attached to solid beads. At our center, we first perform a multiple-antigen flow cytometry bead assay to screen for the presence of HLA antibodies; if positive, a single-antigen bead assay (Luminex) is performed to identify the specific HLA antigens to which the patient has antibodies. At our center, antigens with an MFI <strong>≥5000</strong> are designated as "unacceptable antigens" and entered into UNet, the computer system operated by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). If an unacceptable antigen for a specific patient is listed in UNet, kidneys from donors with that antigen will not be offered to the patient. A calculated panel reactive antibody (CPRA) is computed based upon the patient's unacceptable antigens. It should be noted that MFI levels can vary by approximately 20 to 25 percent between HLA labs [<a href="#rid3">3</a>] and that MFI threshold levels used to designate an unacceptable antigen are not standardized across transplant centers. In addition, different labs report antibody strength in multiple ways, including MFI and dilutional titers. Dilutional titers more accurately represent the antibody quantity than MFI, especially for high-titer antibodies [<a href="#rid4">4</a>], but either method of reporting is acceptable within the range of antibody strength typically used for classifying an antibody unacceptable for transplant. There is no standard CPRA threshold that defines allosensitization. At our center, patients who have a <strong>CPRA ≥30 percent</strong> or who are seeking a retransplant are considered to be <strong>sensitized</strong> and potentially qualify for desensitization. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22598917"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO THE SENSITIZED TRANSPLANT CANDIDATE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once the extent of patient sensitization has been established, the need for desensitization prior to transplantation is determined. Our approach varies depending upon whether or not the transplant candidate has a potential living donor and is discussed below  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef119890" href="/z/d/graphic/119890.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1477575649"><span class="h2">Patients with a potential living donor</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In sensitized patients (ie, CPRA ≥30 percent or seeking retransplantation) with one or more potential living donors, we first perform a virtual crossmatch to determine if the patient has donor-specific antibodies (DSAs)  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef119890" href="/z/d/graphic/119890.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). We routinely perform a complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) T and B cell crossmatch and T and B cell flow cytometry crossmatch when the donor is identified. This information is used to help define the potential risk of antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) and plan for desensitization, if appropriate, or to recommend against transplantation with a particular donor. In addition, all sensitized patients with a potential living donor are also listed for a deceased-donor transplant. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116878.html" rel="external">"Kidney transplantation in adults: Overview of HLA sensitization and crossmatch testing"</a>.)</p><p>Our subsequent approach is based upon the results of the CDC and flow crossmatch:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Positive CDC crossmatch</strong> – A positive CDC crossmatch is considered to be a contraindication to transplantation with a potential donor at our center although there are some centers that would consider it. In a large, multicenter study of 22 transplant centers in the United States that perform HLA-incompatible kidney transplants, the incidence of all-cause graft loss at one and five years was 19 and 40 percent, respectively, among recipients of a positive cytotoxic crossmatch [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Given the high risk of ABMR and graft loss in patients with a positive CDC crossmatch, we do <strong>not </strong>desensitize these patients. We evaluate other potential living donors or advise enrolling in a kidney paired donation (KPD) program. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7326.html" rel="external">"Kidney transplantation in adults: Prevention and treatment of antibody-mediated rejection", section on 'Patients with preexisting DSA before transplant'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115382.html" rel="external">"Kidney transplantation in adults: Kidney paired donation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Negative CDC crossmatch and positive flow cytometry crossmatch</strong> – In patients with a negative CDC crossmatch but a positive flow cytometry crossmatch, our approach depends upon the strength of the flow crossmatch, as determined by the median channel shift (MCS):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If the MCS is ≤250, we offer HLA desensitization depending upon the overall specificity and strength of DSAs. To assess this, we calculate a relative intensity score (RIS) for the patient, assigning 10 points for each DSA in the strong-binding range (MFI ≥10,000), 5 points for each moderate-intensity DSA (MFI 5000 to 9999), and 2 points for each weak DSA (MFI &lt;5000) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. If the RIS is less than 17 points, we proceed with our standard desensitization protocol and transplantation. In rare cases in which a patient has an MCS ≤250 but an RIS greater than 17 points (most patients with an RIS &gt;17 have an MCS &gt;250), we would not attempt desensitization and would pursue other potential donors or KPD. (See <a class="local">'Living-donor transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If the MCS is &gt;250, we typically do not perform desensitization and prefer to pursue other potential donors or KPD. (See <a class="local">'Living-donor transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Negative CDC crossmatch and negative flow cytometry crossmatch</strong> – Such patients can either be DSA negative, crossmatch negative or DSA positive, crossmatch negative. Included are patients who have historical DSA, not present at the time of transplant, a scenario often encountered because DSA can fluctuate above and below the level of detection. Furthermore, patients may have memory B cells that can re-emerge upon antigen stimulation. As an example, mothers may have previous exposure to HLA antigens from childbirth and are capable of a memory response when receiving a transplant from a child even if DSA are not detectable on screening. Thus, sensitized patients with a negative crossmatch are at risk for developing acute and/or chronic ABMR [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], and we proceed with desensitization in conjunction with transplantation, even with a negative crossmatch [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. However, it should be noted that some centers do not administer desensitization in this scenario. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2899771263"><span class="h2">Patients without a potential living donor</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In sensitized patients (CPRA ≥30 percent) who do not have a potential living donor, we list for deceased-donor transplant and offer pretransplant desensitization once the patient is considered to be within reasonable range for a deceased-donor kidney transplant offer. This is determined based upon the number of years of waiting time accrued and number of points allotted by the kidney allocation system for their degree of allosensitization. (See <a class="local">'Deceased-donor transplantation'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7337.html" rel="external">"Kidney transplantation in adults: Organ sharing", section on 'National deceased-donor kidney allocation policy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H394392719"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO HLA-INCOMPATIBLE TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Approaches to HLA-incompatible transplantation vary among transplant centers and are usually institution specific. The ability to safely and successfully perform desensitization involves ready access to a multidisciplinary team including an HLA laboratory, plasmapheresis team, transplant pathology, and transplant pharmacy, among others. The approach used at our center is described below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3340331431"><span class="h2">Pretransplant HLA desensitization</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1165277718"><span class="h3">Overview of desensitization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The overall goal of HLA desensitization is twofold:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To increase the chance of successful kidney transplantation in patients with broad HLA antibody sensitization</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To prevent antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) in such patients after transplantation</p><p></p><p>Desensitization may be performed in patients awaiting either living- or deceased-donor transplantation. The goals of desensitization are similar in both contexts, but the approach may be slightly different because of the unpredictable timing of deceased-donor transplantation in relation to administration of desensitization therapy. Although there is no uniformly accepted HLA-desensitization protocol, most commonly used protocols employ a combination of the following strategies:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Immunomodulation of the recipient immune system, typically with intravenous immune globulins (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">IVIG</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Depletion of the B cell population responsible for anti-HLA antibody production, most commonly with the anti-CD20 agent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Removal of circulating anti-HLA antibodies, typically with extracorporeal methods such as plasmapheresis</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H219795577"><span class="h3">Our approach to desensitization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HLA-desensitization strategies vary at different transplant centers depending upon clinical experience and preference. There are no high-quality data in the form of randomized controlled trials comparing existing desensitization approaches, and the optimal therapy is undefined. For most transplant candidates who qualify for HLA desensitization, we suggest pretransplant desensitization with high-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> rather than high-dose IVIG alone or other desensitization regimens. In our experience, desensitization with this protocol has been shown to reduce both the breadth (CPRA) and strength (MCS or titer) of antibody and shorten the time to transplantation [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>], permitting transplantation in approximately 75 to 80 percent of patients [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Our specific protocols for living-donor and deceased-donor transplantation are detailed below. (See <a class="local">'Living-donor transplantation'</a> below and <a class="local">'Deceased-donor transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p>The combination of high-dose (2 g/kg per dose) <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> has been found to be safe and effective in reducing anti-HLA antibody levels and increasing rates of transplantation among highly sensitized patients awaiting transplant from either a living or deceased donor.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In an open-label, phase I/II study, 20 highly sensitized kidney transplant candidates received <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> (2 g/kg on days 0 and 30) plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> (1 g on days 7 and 22) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. After receiving this regimen, patients were eligible for kidney transplantation from either a living or deceased donor. With this approach, 16 of 20 patients received a kidney transplant. Treatment with IVIG and rituximab decreased mean PRA levels from 77 percent before treatment to 44 percent after treatment and lowered the mean time to transplantation from 144 to 5 months. The acute rejection rate was 50 percent; however, most episodes were reversible, and at one year, the mean serum creatinine concentration was 1.5 mg/dL (133 micromol/L), with patient and allograft survival rates of 100 and 94 percent, respectively.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a follow-up study of 76 highly sensitized patients (75 percent with PRA ≥80 percent), desensitization with a similar protocol reduced classes I and II flow cytometry PRA levels and flow cytometry crossmatch MCS, permitting transplantation in all patients [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p>The addition of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> appears to be superior to high-dose IVIG alone for the desensitization of highly sensitized transplant candidates. The following studies illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One randomized trial compared the use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> with IVIG plus placebo for desensitization among highly sensitized kidney transplant candidates awaiting deceased-donor kidney transplantation [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Patients were randomly assigned to receive IVIG 2 g/kg (maximum dose 140 g) on days 1 and 20 with either rituximab (1 g) or placebo on day 15. The study intended to enroll 90 patients but was stopped early after only 15 patients were enrolled due to the occurrence of three serious adverse events, all of which were episodes of ABMR.

Patients with a pretransplant MCS ≥300 received plasmapheresis prior to transplantation to achieve an MCS &lt;300 by the day of transplant.

The percentage of patients who had a B cell flow cytometry crossmatch MCS &gt;200 at six months was similar between eculizumab-treated patients and controls (46 versus 41 percent), suggesting no additional benefit of eculizumab on the reduction of DSA compared with standard therapy. Among these patients, there was no difference in transplant glomerulopathy at one year (50 versus 36 percent). By contrast, among patients who exhibited an improvement in MCS to &lt;200 at six months, none of the eculizumab-treated patients had transplant glomerulopathy at one year, compared with 42 percent of historical controls.

In addition, an adjusted analysis to account for differences in baseline characteristics between the groups was not performed, and, therefore, it cannot be concluded whether the difference in infection-related death between ABO-incompatible and ABO-compatible recipients was attributable to desensitization versus other factors.</p><p></p><p>Before beginning desensitization, we vaccinate against encapsulated organisms such as meningococcus and pneumococcus in preparation for the possibility that a patient might require complement inhibition (ie, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8836" href="/z/d/drug information/8836.html" rel="external">eculizumab</a>) as rescue therapy for ABMR after transplant. In addition, we follow American Society of Transplantation pre- and posttransplant vaccine guidelines for all patients, including but not limited to vaccines against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), hepatitis B, and varicella [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. Importantly, we have observed that patients treated with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies did not develop antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccination; however, they did develop robust T cell responses, which, we feel, afforded protection against severe infection in these patients [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].</p><p>There is minimal effect of vaccines on HLA sensitization [<a href="#rid52">52-56</a>], and we do not alter the desensitization or HLA antibody monitoring schedule because of vaccination.  </p><p>In all recipients of an HLA-incompatible transplant, we administer antimicrobial and antiviral prophylaxis with a regimen that is identical to that administered to recipients of an HLA-compatible transplant. This includes prophylaxis against <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia (PJP), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease, and herpes simplex infection (in patients who are at low CMV risk). In addition, we also administer antifungal prophylaxis although this practice may vary by transplant center. A detailed discussion of the different prophylactic regimens is presented separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1408.html" rel="external">"Prophylaxis of infections in solid organ transplantation", section on 'Pneumocystis pneumonia'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/105281.html" rel="external">"Prevention of cytomegalovirus disease in kidney transplant recipients", section on 'Universal prophylaxis (high risk)'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1408.html" rel="external">"Prophylaxis of infections in solid organ transplantation", section on 'Antifungal prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4207961697"><span class="h2">Malignancy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Studies evaluating malignancy risk in HLA-incompatible kidney transplantation are limited, and data from the ABO-incompatible transplant population are generally extrapolated to the HLA-incompatible transplant population. Most studies have found that ABO-incompatible recipients do not have an increased risk of malignancy compared with ABO-compatible transplant patients. In one single-center study of 69 ABO-incompatible, 27 HLA-incompatible, and 10 ABO- and HLA-incompatible living-donor kidney transplant recipients, malignancies were uncommon overall, and their incidence was not significantly different between the three groups [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113661.html" rel="external">"Kidney transplantation in adults: ABO-incompatible transplantation", section on 'Malignancy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H786624910"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/z/d/html/110754.html" rel="external">"Society guideline links: Kidney transplantation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1863320231"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Overview</strong> – A significant number of kidney transplant candidates with otherwise suitable living donors are relegated to the deceased-donor waiting list because of preformed human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies. These are acquired via pregnancy, transfusion, or prior transplant. The presence of these anti-HLA antibodies in the potential recipient's blood is called HLA sensitization. Although transplanting against preformed HLA antibodies is associated with an increased risk of antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) and allograft loss, desensitization protocols designed to reduce the amount of preexisting antibody to a level that allows for successful engraftment may permit transplantation in select recipients. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assessment of patient sensitization </strong>– The degree of HLA sensitization of a potential transplant recipient is first determined at the time of initial transplant evaluation by testing patient sera against solubilized HLA antigens attached to solid beads. HLA sensitization is reported as the calculated panel reactive antibody (CPRA), which is computed based upon the patient's unacceptable antigens. There is no standard CPRA threshold that defines allosensitization. At our center, patients who have a <strong>CPRA ≥30 percent</strong> or who are seeking a retransplant are considered to be <strong>sensitized</strong> and potentially qualify for desensitization. (See <a class="local">'Assessment of patient sensitization'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Approach to the sensitized transplant candidate </strong>– Once the extent of patient sensitization has been established, the need for desensitization prior to transplantation is determined. Our approach varies depending upon whether or not the transplant candidate has a potential living donor  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef119890" href="/z/d/graphic/119890.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Approach to the sensitized transplant candidate'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Approach to HLA-incompatible transplantation </strong>– Approaches to HLA-incompatible transplantation vary among transplant centers and are usually institution specific. There are no high-quality data in the form of randomized controlled trials comparing existing desensitization approaches, and the optimal therapy is undefined. The approach used at our center is as follows (see <a class="local">'Approach to HLA-incompatible transplantation'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Pretransplant desensitization </strong>– For most transplant candidates who qualify for HLA desensitization, we suggest pretransplant desensitization with high-dose intravenous immune globulins (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">IVIG</a>) and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> rather than high-dose IVIG alone or other desensitization regimens (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Our center-specific protocols for living-donor and deceased-donor transplantation are detailed above. (See <a class="local">'Living-donor transplantation'</a> above and <a class="local">'Deceased-donor transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Transplant immunosuppression </strong>– Recipients of an HLA-incompatible kidney transplant are considered to be at high risk for rejection and should receive lymphocyte-depleting antibodies (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10026" href="/z/d/drug information/10026.html" rel="external">rabbit antithymocyte globulin</a> [rATG]-Thymoglobulin or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8725" href="/z/d/drug information/8725.html" rel="external">alemtuzumab</a>) for induction immunosuppression therapy. At our center, we prefer to administer alemtuzumab. However, alemtuzumab is not readily available to all medical centers that perform kidney transplantation. In addition to alemtuzumab, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> are also administered near the time of transplant to reduce or eliminate anti-HLA antibody rebound in the early posttransplant period. Maintenance immunosuppression is similar to that used in most HLA-compatible kidney transplant recipients. (See <a class="local">'Transplant immunosuppression'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Posttransplant monitoring </strong>– Following HLA desensitization and transplantation, patients are monitored using an approach that is similar to that used in recipients of HLA-compatible transplants. In addition, we routinely monitor donor-specific antibody (DSA) levels monthly for the first three months posttransplant; then at months 6, 9, and 12; and annually thereafter. Patients with persistent or de novo DSAs should be evaluated with a kidney allograft biopsy to exclude the possibility of ABMR. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring after transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Outcomes </strong>– In our experience, patient and graft survival are comparable between highly sensitized recipients administered desensitization before transplant and less sensitized recipients not receiving pretransplant desensitization. Overall, however, an increasing degree of incompatibility is associated with a higher risk of graft loss and death. (See <a class="local">'Outcomes of HLA-incompatible transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complications </strong>– Complications of HLA-incompatible transplantation include a higher risk of acute rejection, mostly due to ABMR. Data on infection-related complications in this population are limited, with some studies showing similar rates of overall infections compared with average transplant recipients. (See <a class="local">'Complications of HLA-incompatible transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3016181592"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Christina L Klein, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li class="breakAll">http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov (Accessed on February 02, 2023).</li><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Sethi S, Choi J, Toyoda M, et al.
