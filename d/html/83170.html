         Bipolar disorder is characterized by episodes of mania  (

         ]. The subtypes of bipolar disorder include bipolar I and bipolar II. Patients with bipolar I disorder experience manic episodes, and nearly always experience major depressive and hypomanic episodes. Bipolar II disorder is marked by at least one hypomanic episode, at least one major depressive episode, and the absence of manic episodes. Additional information about the clinical features and diagnosis of bipolar disorder is discussed separately. (See

         Onset of postpartum bipolar mood episodes occurs within a limited time period following birth of a live child. However, there is no established cutoff that separates postpartum-onset mood episodes from subsequent nonpostpartum episodes [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5

         Postpartum bipolar mood episodes are usually treated by perinatal or general psychiatrists in collaboration with obstetricians, primary care clinicians, and neonatologists or pediatricians [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,8-12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         For postpartum bipolar patients, treatment is based upon randomized trials for the general treatment of bipolar patients, as well as observational studies and clinical experience with postpartum patients [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Factors involved in choosing a drug regimen include past response to medications, whether the patient is breastfeeding, side effect profiles, patient preference, comorbid general medical conditions, potential for drug-drug interactions, and cost.
        </p>
        <p>
         We try to avoid medications associated with weight gain and sedation (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9716" href="/z/d/drug information/9716.html" rel="external">
          olanzapine

         Family meetings can accomplish several tasks, such as educating family members about the illness, providing support and allaying their concerns, obtaining additional history about prior treatment, and recruiting them to support patient adherence with treatment [

         The setting for treatment of postpartum bipolar patients depends upon the type and severity of symptoms, level of psychosocial functioning, and available support. Inpatient hospitalization may be required for safety and stabilization, particularly for severely ill patients with one or more of the following features [

         In addition, the threshold for admission is lower in patients with poor social support or previous severe mood episodes [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. It may be feasible to treat moderately ill postpartum bipolar patients in a partial hospital (day) program, including patients with suicidality that does not pose an imminent risk (eg, fleeting thoughts of killing oneself with vague or nonexistent plans and no intent). An outpatient clinic may be suitable for less acutely ill patients (eg, thoughts that family members would be better off if the patient was dead, with no plan or intent to commit suicide).

         </span>
         We typically monitor postpartum bipolar patients most closely (eg, weekly) during the first several weeks (eg, four) following parturition, when the large majority of mood episodes occur [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18-20
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         For postpartum bipolar patients who suffer a mood episode, the frequency of visits depends upon the patient’s clinical status. Hospitalized patients are assessed daily, and patients with active suicidal ideation, a specific plan, and intent to kill themselves may require constant observation. Outpatients are commonly seen on a weekly basis until they have responded (ie, the patient’s safety has stabilized and the number, intensity, and frequency of psychotic and mood symptoms has improved substantially). Following response, patients can be seen every two to four weeks until they remit.
        </p>
        <p>
         For postpartum bipolar patients who remit and remain stable, monitoring can be tapered, with progressively longer intervals between assessments. As an example, a patient who is seen every two weeks at the time of remission can be seen every two weeks for one to three more visits, then every month for one to three visits, and then every two months for one to three visits. Continuously stable patients can be seen every three to six months. More frequent visits should be scheduled for patients who develop symptoms or side effects (eg, sedation that interferes with infant care).

         For postpartum bipolar patients who are treated with pharmacotherapy and have sufficient resources, we often suggest formula feeding the baby to avoid exposure to medications through breast milk [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,21
         </a>
         ]. All psychotropic drugs appear to be excreted in breast milk at varying concentrations [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Although breastfeeding has many potential benefits for both the mother and child, the mother’s clinical status and need for pharmacotherapy should take priority over the method of feeding the infant [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, breast milk is a reasonable alternative to formula for postpartum bipolar patients treated with pharmacotherapy. There are several benefits to breastfeeding, and many patients would rather forego medications than breastfeeding. We attempt to use drugs compatible with breastfeeding and doses at the low end of the therapeutic range, especially for infants less than three months of age, because their capacity to metabolize and clear medications is less than that of older infants [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Exposure to psychotropic agents through breastfeeding should also be minimized in premature infants, because their decreased ability to metabolize and/or eliminate medications increases steady state plasma concentrations [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25,26
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Postpartum bipolar patients should attempt to recruit family and friends to help with the newborn’s nighttime feedings, to prevent sleep deprivation and the associated risk of recurrent mood episodes [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,13,23,27,28
         </a>
         ]. Newborns fed with formula during the day are fed formula at night. Infants who are breastfed during the day can be fed at night with breast milk expressed while awake earlier in the day, or with supplemental formula.

        <p>
         The use of psychotropic medications in breastfeeding patients is discussed separately. (See

         Observational studies that suggest recurrent mood episodes are less frequent among postpartum bipolar patients who are treated with maintenance medications, compared with untreated patients. As an example, a meta-analysis of eight prospective and retrospective observational studies found that postpartum mood episodes occurred in fewer patients who received maintenance pharmacotherapy (n = 98), compared with patients who remained medication free (n = 107; 29 versus 65 percent) [

         For euthymic bipolar patients who are receiving intrapartum maintenance pharmacotherapy and are not breastfeeding, we continue the same medications after delivery. However, doses should generally be decreased. Prenatal physiologic changes (eg, increased renal elimination, volume of distribution, and cardiac output) reverse after parturition, which typically causes serum drug concentrations to increase [

         For postpartum bipolar patients, we suggest adjunctive psychoeducation or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), based upon randomized trials that did not focus upon postpartum patients. Although no head-to-head trials have compared these psychotherapies, we generally choose psychoeducation because there are more data supporting its use, it is easier to administer than CBT and thus usually more available, and psychoeducation is generally an element of CBT. The evidence of efficacy for reducing recurrent mood episodes with other psychotherapies, such as family therapy and interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, is not as compelling. (See

         Postpartum patients with psychotic mania typically require hospitalization for management by psychiatrists and other mental health clinicians. Patients can breastfeed their babies provided that nursing staff are present; however, many patients are too disorganized and impulsive to breastfeed. The safety of using psychotropic drugs during breastfeeding is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1720.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         For patients with postpartum mania with psychotic features, we suggest the following treatment algorithm. Patients initially receive step 1 and progress through each step until they respond. The algorithm is largely based upon a standardized treatment protocol evaluated in an observational study [

          Step 1
         </strong>
         – Benzodiazepine monotherapy (eg,

          lorazepam
         </a>
         ) at bedtime for up to three nights, to ascertain whether sleep restoration and treatment of anxiety or mild agitation improves the syndrome. However, for patients with moderate to severe agitation, or patients with assaultive or grossly disorganized behavior, treatment commences at step 2. In addition, step 1 is skipped for patients who were treated with an antipsychotic immediately prior to admission. Patients unresponsive to benzodiazepine monotherapy are treated with step 2 therapy.

        <p>

          Step 2
         </strong>
         – Benzodiazepine plus an antipsychotic for two to three weeks. However, antipsychotic monotherapy is a reasonable alternative to combination treatment, especially for patients who do not tolerate benzodiazepines, are breastfeeding and concerned about the risks to their infants, and patients with substance use disorders. Either first-generation antipsychotics (eg,

         Patients who do not respond to the benzodiazepine plus antipsychotic within two to three weeks or do not tolerate the antipsychotic are switched to a different antipsychotic.

The antipsychotics are switched by tapering and discontinuing the failed drug at the same time that the new drug is titrated up.

Treatment consisted of a four-step standardized protocol in which patients initially received step 1; unresponsive patients progressed through each step until they responded. Step 1 involved

         Electrode placement and other aspects of ECT technique for treating bipolar disorder have not been standardized. Thus, ECT is typically administered with the same technique used for other indications and is generally given three times per week on alternating days. Most patients regardless of indication remit with 6 to 12 treatments, but some patients may require 20 or more. The technique for performing ECT is discussed separately. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Breastfeeding typically is not interrupted during a course of ECT because of the minimal amounts of anesthetic drugs (eg,

         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. However, other drugs that may be used during ECT, such as antihypertensives, antireflux drugs (eg, histamine-2 receptor antagonists), and analgesics may be excreted into breast milk. Exposure to medications can be decreased by delaying lactation for several hours after an ECT treatment, or alternatively, collecting and storing breast milk prior to ECT for bottle feeding.

          Feeding the infant
         </strong>
         – Postpartum bipolar patients who are treated with pharmacotherapy and have sufficient resources are often encouraged to formula feed their infants to avoid exposure to medications through breast milk. However, breastfeeding is a reasonable alternative; we attempt to use drugs compatible with breastfeeding and doses at the low end of the therapeutic range. (See
         <a class="local">

          Who are not breastfeeding
         </strong>
         – For euthymic bipolar patients who are receiving intrapartum maintenance pharmacotherapy and are not breastfeeding, we continue the same medications after delivery to prevent or delay recurrent mood episodes. However, doses should be decreased. For patients who discontinued maintenance pharmacotherapy prior to conception or during pregnancy, are medication-free at the time of delivery, and are not breastfeeding, we typically resume the previous regimen after childbirth when patients are medically stable.
