         Atrial septal defect (ASD) is the most common congenital lesion in adults after bicuspid aortic valve. Although patients with this defect are often asymptomatic until adulthood, potential complications of an untreated ASD include atrial arrhythmias, paradoxical embolization, cerebral abscess, right ventricular failure, and pulmonary hypertension that can become irreversible and lead to right-to-left shunting (Eisenmenger syndrome).

         This topic will review surgical and percutaneous closure of ASDs in adults.

         Preprocedural assessment in patients with indications for ASD closure includes review of the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Some patients require additional testing such as transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), cardiovascular computerized tomography (CT), or cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging to confirm the diagnosis and identify or exclude associated defects prior to surgical or percutaneous closure. In patients with pulmonary hypertension, cardiac catheterization is recommended to determine the best management strategy.

         Conditions that are likely to require surgical correction should be identified prior to intervention:

         Primum ASD, sinus venosus ASDs, and coronary sinus defects generally require surgical closure.

         </span>
         Primum ASD is usually accompanied by a cleft mitral valve. A cleft mitral leaflet should be repaired at the time of ASD closure, even if associated mitral regurgitation is not severe, to avoid the need for another operation since mitral regurgitation usually progresses. Primum ASDs may also be associated with tricuspid valve abnormalities, left ventricular (LV) outflow tract obstruction, ventricular septal defects, and are part of a spectrum of defects involving the atrioventricular septum (atrioventricular septal defect).

         Superior sinus venosus ASDs are usually associated with one or more anomalous right-sided pulmonary veins. Sinus venosus ASDs and the associated anomalous veins are often missed on standard TTE. Agitated

         contrast administered during a TTE and injected into an upper extremity should demonstrate prompt filling of the left heart chambers with bubbles in the presence of a superior sinus venosus atrial septal defect. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Additional imaging by TEE, CT, or CMR should be performed to identify the anomalous pulmonary vein anatomy. However, these types of ASDs and anomalous pulmonary veins can be missed even with advanced imaging techniques. These defects should be sought in patients with right heart enlargement. Our practice is to delineate the anatomy, including all of the anomalous pulmonary veins, with CT or CMR before the patient goes to the operating room for surgical intervention.

         Coronary sinus defects (also known as "unroofed coronary sinus") are often missed despite echocardiography. They are often associated with persistent left superior vena cava (SVC) and may accompany other congenital anomalies including ostium primum or secundum ASDs. Observation of agitated

         Some patients with ASDs have concomitant valve disease (in addition to cleft mitral valve with primum ASD as discussed above). Moderate or more tricuspid regurgitation may persist after ASD closure in the adult. When there is moderate or more tricuspid regurgitation, we favor surgery for both ASD closure and tricuspid repair [

          Secundum ASDs
         </strong>
         – Percutaneous transcatheter device closure is an excellent alternative to surgical repair for most patients with secundum ASDs. Surgical closure is recommended for patients with secundum ASD requiring closure when percutaneous repair is not feasible or appropriate [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Anatomic requirements for percutaneous closure are discussed below. A secundum ASD with a large atrial septal aneurysm or a multifenestrated atrial septum requires careful evaluation to determine whether percutaneous device closure will provide effective closure of the atrial shunt [
         <a href="#rid1">

          Coronary sinus defect

         – Given the proximity of the coronary sinus ostium to the inferior atrial free wall and the association between coronary sinus defect and a persistent left-sided SVC, device closure is not recommended. Cases of "reroofing" of the coronary sinus using a covered stent have been reported [

         Observational studies comparing surgical and percutaneous transcatheter closure of secundum ASD suggest that mortality rates are similar. The rate of procedural success is comparable or slightly higher with surgery, while the rate of early complications is lower and length of hospital stay is shorter with the percutaneous approach. Differing types of complications occur following the two procedures, as illustrated by the following studies.

        <p>
         A systematic review compared short-term (follow-up generally less than 12 to 18 months) outcomes following surgical and percutaneous closure of secundum ASD in 13 observational studies with a total of 3082 patients [

Rescue operation for device adverse events (0.83 percent) was 2.1 times more likely than reoperation for surgical closure (0.39 percent). However, this study was subject to a number of statistical and methodological limitations, including reliance upon databases that did not capture all adverse events, use of an estimate of total number of device closures, and inclusion of patent foramen ovale closures in the device closure group.

Perforated aneurysms can be closed surgically or percutaneously, depending upon their morphology. In a retrospective review of 50 patients, perforated aneurysms were classified as follows [

         Thirty-two had systemic thromboembolism or transient ischemic attacks, eight presented with dyspnea on exertion, and 10 were asymptomatic but had significant left-to-right shunt and right ventricular volume overload. Transcatheter device closure using an Amplatzer Septal Occluder or CardioSEAL device (no longer available) was possible in all 18 patients with a type A aneurysm. In the nine patients with a type B aneurysm, five had successful device closure, while four required surgery. Device closure was achieved in all 10 patients with a type C aneurysm, but four had a residual shunt. All 13 patients with a type D aneurysm underwent surgery.

         The traditional surgical approach for ASD repair has been a median sternotomy, with minimally invasive, including robotic, approaches evolving over time [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Pericardial or Dacron patch closure is generally the surgical treatment of choice for secundum, primum, and sinus venosus ASD repair. Primary closure of the defect (suture closure) is generally not recommended [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ] except for very small defects. Some surgeons advocate cannulation of the SVC rather than the right atrium to reduce the incidence of postoperative arrhythmias [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. (See

          "Management and outcome of atrioventricular (AV) canal defects"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         A coronary sinus defect without a left SVC may be closed by direct suture closure or closure of the mouth of the coronary sinus. In the presence of a left SVC, creation of an intra-atrial baffle is typically indicated to direct the systemic venous return from the SVC to the right atrium [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (expected to be present with sinus venosus ASD) should be repaired by baffling the anomalous veins to the SVC as part of a Warden procedure or directly into the left atrium. In patients with sinus venosus ASD with anomalous pulmonary venous drainage entering the mid- or upper SVC, the Warden procedure is used. This procedure involves anastomosis of the cephalic SVC to the right atrial appendage, and the caudal SVC, which includes the anomalous pulmonary veins, is baffled to the left atrium [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,14
         </a>
         ]. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Comprehensive preoperative delineation of associated lesions such as tricuspid or mitral valve regurgitation and the presence, number and course of the anomalous pulmonary veins is important to plan the operation. This is generally performed using a combination of echocardiography and cross-sectional imaging. Intraoperative TEE is routinely used to identify any additional defects, the adequacy of repair, and residual flow across the surgical site  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef54350" href="/z/d/graphic/54350.html" rel="external">
          movie 1
         </a>
         ). TEE is used to evaluate patients following repair including the atrial septum, redirected pulmonary veins, and valves. Tension from repair on the valvular annulus can distort the geometry of leaflet coaptation.

         There are a number of postoperative considerations in patients undergoing ASD repair.
        </p>
        <p>
         Beta blockers may be helpful for patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter. The evidence for this recommendation comes from data in patients undergoing other types of cardiac surgery. The benefit is seen when therapy is begun prior to or immediately after surgery and is independent of the agent or dose used. The optimal duration of therapy is uncertain, but beta blockers are often continued until the first postoperative visit. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1011.html" rel="external">
          "Atrial fibrillation and flutter after cardiac surgery", section on 'Prevention of atrial fibrillation and complications'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         We favor anticoagulation for several months after surgery in adults undergoing ASD closure because of concern about postoperative AF and the small chance that thrombus can attach to the atrial septal patch. Long-term periodic follow-up is indicated because of the late occurrence of AF, atrial flutter, and stroke, particularly in adults over age 40 [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21,22
         </a>
         ]. Patients with preoperative atrial tachyarrhythmias are at particular risk.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some patients require permanent pacemaker placement early postoperatively to treat sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular (AV) conduction block after surgical ASD closure. Surgery can damage the AV node or its blood supply. In addition, there may be a small increase in the lifetime risk of developing sinus and AV nodal dysfunction following surgical ASD closure.

         The effect of surgical ASD repair is influenced by the type of ASD, the patient's age, the size of the defect, the size and function of the right ventricle, the presence of comorbidities, including pulmonary hypertension, and the experience of the surgeon. As noted above, complications after surgical ASD closure include bleeding requiring blood transfusion, infection, stroke, atrial arrhythmias, pericardial effusion or pericarditis, and, rarely, incomplete repair, incorrect patch placement directing the inferior vena cava to the left atria, or patch dehiscence requiring reoperation.

         The outcomes in such patients were evaluated in a large retrospective study in which 6 percent of 702 patients with an isolated ASD (secundum or sinus venosus type) had pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR] of 7 Wood units (WU) x m

         However, this series was published in 1987, well before therapies for pulmonary hypertension were available or routinely used in this population. Improvements in the medical therapy for pulmonary vascular disease allow for preclosure and postclosure treatment of pulmonary hypertension in select patients. This approach is complex and requires input from adult congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension experts. (See

          23

The 27-year survival rates for patients in the younger two quartiles at the time of surgery (≤11 years and 12 to 24 years) were not different from age-matched controls (97 and 93 percent). In contrast, 27-year survival was significantly less than controls for patients in the third quartile (25 to 41 years; 84 versus 91 percent) or fourth quartile (&gt;41 years; 40 versus 59 percent).

However, sinus venosus ASD is frequently accompanied by partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage that should be corrected at the time of defect repair; the operation should be performed by an experienced congenital heart surgeon. Potential complications following sinus venosus ASD closure with baffling of anomalous pulmonary venous connection are baffle leak, SVC stenosis, pulmonary vein stenosis, and sinus node dysfunction.

          32
         </a>
         ]. The ratios of pulmonary to systemic blood flow (Qp/Qs) were 2.5 and 2.7, respectively. Patients with a sinus venosus ASD were more likely to have pulmonary hypertension (26 versus 9 percent) and elevated PVR (16 versus 4 percent). In addition, elevated PVR occurred at a younger age in those with a sinus venosus ASD. The overall shunt size in sinus venosus ASD with associated anomalous pulmonary venous connection is larger than most other ASDs.
        </p>
        <p>
         These observations suggest that patients with sinus venosus ASDs should have closure and pulmonary vein redirection at the time that the diagnosis is made, and they should be monitored for arrhythmias and the development of pulmonary hypertension after closure.

         Percutaneous device closure is an alternative to surgical closure in patients with secundum ASDs who have appropriate anatomic characteristics. Three devices have both US Food and Drug Administration approval and CE-mark and are commercially available in the United States and Europe for percutaneous ASD closure [

          picture 1

         ), and the Gore CARDIOFORM ASD Occluder. The Occlutech ASD Occluder, the Ceraflex ASD Occluder, and the Nit-Occlud ASD-R have received CE-mark and are in clinical use in Europe [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36,37
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Of note, the Gore CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder does not have self-centering properties, which limits its use for larger defects and it is used mostly for patent foramen ovale closure. However, in selected patients with centrally located ASDs or multiperforated atrial septum, the CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder is a valid alternative device with less foreign material and excellent occlusion properties.
        </p>
        <p>
         The self-centering Gore CARDIOFORM ASD occluder has been introduced, expanding the catheter interventional treatment possibilities for patients with large ASDs and deficient aortic rims [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38-40
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The CARDIOFORM devices are characterized by a relatively stiff delivery mechanism, so the angulation of the device can change notably after device release. The original delivery system of the Amplatzer ASD occluder was relatively stiff as well. The improved Amplatzer Trevisio delivery system has a soft distal delivery cable that allows for better device alignment to the interatrial septum [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The Occlutech and Ceraflex occluders have even more flexible delivery mechanisms, which enable optimal septal alignment prior to device release. The device remains in its final configuration and does not change its angulation at release. An additional advantage of the flexible properties of the Occlutech and Ceraflex occluders is that the left atrial disc has less of a tendency to slip along the aortic root into the right atrium during device placement, and hence, fewer adjunctive procedures (eg, device deployment with an additional balloon) are needed [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A few other devices that had been approved and were previously used for ASD closure are no longer available, including the CardioSEAL Septal Occlusion System, the STARFlex device (a next-generation version of the CardioSEAL device), and the Gore HELEX (a predecessor of the CARDIOFORM device).

         As noted above, severe fixed pulmonary hypertension is considered a contraindication to ASD closure. However, advances in the medical management of patients with pulmonary vascular disease, together with the development of novel percutaneous closure techniques, may make ASD closure feasible in this setting. It has been suggested that patients with a net left-to-right shunt, a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) less than 800 to 960 dyn-s/cm

         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         The potential efficacy of percutaneous closure was demonstrated in a report of 29 patients with a secundum ASD and a baseline peak pulmonary artery pressure &gt;40 mmHg (mean 65 mmHg) in whom an Amplatzer device was implanted [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. Complete ASD occlusion was achieved in 28 patients (97 percent). Immediately after the procedure, the mean peak pulmonary artery pressure decreased to 54 mmHg; at a mean of 21 months, it decreased further to 31 mmHg. There were no procedural complications. Functional status was improved after the procedure and was maintained at a mean of 21 months. Six of 12 patients who had AF at baseline recovered sinus rhythm by discharge.

         </span>
         Unrecognized LV diastolic dysfunction may be present in older patients with ASDs. The presence of the left-to-right shunt at the atrial level may function to "offload" the stiff LV in these patients. One series demonstrated that temporary test occlusion of the ASD with a soft balloon catheter in adult patients may help identify individuals whose left heart filling pressures will worsen if device closure is performed [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. Although this finding is not necessarily a contraindication to device closure, balloon test occlusion may provide useful information for evaluating older patients for ASD closure.
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with suspected pulmonary hypertension, defined as a mean pulmonary arterial pressure ≥20 mmHg, the hemodynamics need to be assessed prior to ASD closure to determine the relative contribution of elevated PVR (precapillary pulmonary hypertension) versus elevated left atrial pressure (postcapillary pulmonary hypertension). Isolated precapillary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is present if the left atrial or wedge pressure is ≤15 mmHg and the PVR is ≥2 WU. In isolated postcapillary pulmonary hypertension, the left atrial or wedge pressure is ≥15 mmHg and PVR is lower than 2 WU. In most older adults with ASD and PAH, a combination of both is present [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with PVR &gt;4 WU, pulmonary vasoreactivity testing should be performed. In patients with postcapillary pulmonary hypertension, a balloon test occlusion of the ASD should be performed assessing the left atrial pressure or the LV end-diastolic pressures (LVEDP). A rise of the LVEDP to &gt;20 mmHg or a pressure increase &gt;10 mmHg indicates severe diastolic LV dysfunction with the risk of postclosure pulmonary edema. In these patients, the ASD closure procedure may be abandoned or a fenestrated ASD occluder may be chosen.

         Percutaneous device closure is generally applicable only to
         <strong>
          secundum ASDs
         </strong>
         [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Primum and coronary sinus defects are not often amenable to percutaneous repair, although cases of percutaneous repair of these defects have been reported [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-5,47
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The ideal lesion for percutaneous closure is a secundum defect ≤38 mm in diameter with a rim of tissue around the defect of at least 5 mm to prevent obstruction of the coronary sinus, right pulmonary veins, venae cavae, or atrioventricular valves. The presence of a "retroaortic" superior-anterior atrial septal rim is favorable for device closure, but septal deficiency in this region is common and not necessarily a contraindication to percutaneous closure. Retroaortic rim deficiency has been associated with risk of erosion, as discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Erosion'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Approximately one-half to two-thirds of secundum ASDs in adults meet these criteria [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48,49
         </a>
         ]. While smaller defects are often more amenable to device closure, larger defects can also be closed percutaneously. The Amplatzer device is available in sizes ranging from 4 to 38 mm, reflecting the diameter of the central device of the waist and generally correlating with the size of the ASD to be closed. By comparison, the CARDIOFORM septal device comes in only three sizes (20, 25, and 30 mm), reflecting the diameter of the device disk at full deployment. It can be used to close defects up to approximately 18 mm in diameter. The self-centering Gore CARDIOFORM ASD occluder is available in five sizes (27 to 48 mm disk diameter) and even large ASDs (up to 35 mm) with deficient aortic rims may be treated successfully with this double-disk device. Closure of multiple ASDs has been performed using one or more closure devices, including use of an Amplatzer multifenestrated "cribriform" septal occluder device or one or more CARDIOFORM device [

         The use of TEE or intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) can facilitate the deployment of percutaneous ASD closure devices. Measurement of the size and location of the ASD by TEE can help select the appropriate device. In addition, TEE and ICE can be used to guide the procedure in real time, an approach that may eliminate the need for fluoroscopy [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54-60
         </a>
         ]. Two- and three-dimensional (3D) TEE is particularly helpful when multiple devices are inserted to close multiple ASDs [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. TEE or ICE during the procedure can also determine whether disruption of systemic or pulmonary venous inflow or valve function occurs with device placement.
        </p>
        <p>
         ICE has some advantages compared with TEE. It does not require endotracheal intubation or general anesthesia [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57,60
         </a>
         ], it permits continuous monitoring during the procedure, and it may shorten the duration of the procedure [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In one series, 94 patients underwent ICE during percutaneous closure of an ASD or patent foramen ovale (PFO) [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. All devices were deployed successfully. During the procedure, ICE identified a previously unrecognized anatomical diagnosis in 32 patients (an additional ASD or PFO, a redundant atrial septum, or an atrial septal aneurysm). Procedural complications occurred in four patients: atrial fibrillation (AF) in three and supraventricular tachycardia in one. Two of the arrhythmias resolved spontaneously and two required cardioversion with no recurrence.
        </p>
        <p>
         3D echocardiography enables direct and complete visualization of the ASD, so that the area of the defect can be estimated and the anatomy of the entire interatrial septum can be defined. This 3D information facilitates optimal deployment and positioning of all types of interatrial closure devices.
        </p>

         Clinical series suggest that percutaneous ASD closure can be safely and effectively performed using only echocardiographic guidance without fluoroscopy [

         Sudden death has rarely been reported following percutaneous device implantation [
         <a href="#rid63">
          63,73
         </a>
         ], though the risk of sudden death may be largely related to associated conditions rather than device implantation. The frequency with which this might occur was addressed in a review of three databases involving 777 patients who received a device for an ASD or ventricular septal defect [
         <a href="#rid73">
          73
         </a>
         ]. At a median follow-up of 25 months, sudden death occurred in nine patients (1.2 percent); three had undergone device closure of an ASD alone. Patients who experienced sudden death were more likely to have had multiple devices inserted and to have a history of serious tachyarrhythmias, severe valve regurgitation, one or more cardiac surgeries, pulmonary hypertension, and ventricular dysfunction. Since these conditions may be associated with risk of sudden death, the relationship between the risk of sudden death and device insertion is uncertain. As discussed below, erosion is a potential cause of sudden death after Amplatzer septal occluder (ASO) implantation.

          —
         </span>
         An uncommon early or late and potentially catastrophic complication following implantation of certain percutaneous ASD closure devices is erosion with perforation of one or both atria and/or the aorta [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,78-81
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         This complication has been reported mainly with the ASO device. In an analysis using the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, erosion was estimated to occur in 0.1 to 0.3 percent of ASO implants (eg, an estimate of 51 in 18,333 implants) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,78,82
         </a>
         ]. Erosion has not been reported with the Gore HELEX or CARDIOFORM devices.
        </p>
        <p>
         Symptoms and signs of erosion include chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope, pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, hemodynamic compromise, and sudden cardiac death [
         <a href="#rid79">
          79,83
         </a>
         ]. Of 100 documented and nine suspected cases of erosion in a later MAUDE database analysis, 80 devices were explanted and there were 13 deaths [
         <a href="#rid79">
          79,83
         </a>
         ]. Although most cases present within hours, days, or months following implantation, some cases present years later [
         <a href="#rid79">
          79
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Given the risk of erosion, all patients with an ASO device should receive follow-up, with closer monitoring of patients with any of the above potential risk factors or the presence of even a very small pericardial effusion [
         <a href="#rid80">
          80
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Although risk factors for erosion have been proposed [
         <a href="#rid80">
          80
         </a>
         ], a review found that there are neither conclusive data nor consensus about the causes of erosion by the ASO [
         <a href="#rid79">
          79
         </a>
         ]. As an example, an expert panel and experienced operators have offered differing opinions regarding the role of oversizing or undersizing in the development of erosions [
         <a href="#rid84">
          84
         </a>
         ]. Proposed potential risk factors include protrusion of the device into the atrial wall or aorta, device-oversizing (ie, ASO &gt;1.5 times the native diameter of the ASD), splaying or flaring of the device around the aortic root after implantation, presence of a condition predisposing to aortic dilation (eg, bicuspid aortic valve), rotation or translation of the device relative to the heart after implantation (which may cause cutting of the atrial free wall), absent or deficient aortic or superior rim, "malaligned septum" (aorta not centered in relation to the septum), and thicker device profile at the time of deployment [
         <a href="#rid79">
          79,80,84,85
         </a>
         ]. A later case control study of 125 erosions reported to St. Jude Medical (the original manufacturer of the ASO) reported relative risk factors for device erosion [
         <a href="#rid86">
          86
         </a>
         ]. Deficiency of the retroaortic rim (&lt;5 mm) was significantly more common among patients who experienced an erosion (94 versus 24 percent in the nonerosion cohort, odds ratio [OR] 45). A balloon-sized defect diameter &gt;5 mm larger than the static diameter was also associated with risk of erosion (OR 5.4). Larger device size relative to patient weight was also associated with an increased incidence of erosion. This study was limited by incomplete echocardiographic data for both the erosion and control cohorts.
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with deficient aortic rims, the Gore CARDIOFORM ASD occluder may be a good alternative to a double-disk metal occluder since it is softer. However, long-term data are not available. Wire fracture
         <strong>
         </strong>
         occurred in a relatively large percentage (36 percent) at the six-month follow-up in patients treated with the self-centering Gore CARDIOFORM ASD occluder. In affected patients, it was without clinical sequelae, residual shunt, or device instability [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38

         ]. More and longer follow-up information is necessary to understand the clinical importance of this relatively frequent complication.

          EFFECT OF DEFECT CLOSURE ON RISK OF ATRIAL ARRHYTHMIAS

         Atrial arrhythmias, primarily atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, occur in approximately 20 percent of adult patients with an ASD and are often the presenting symptom [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21,22,25,90
         </a>
         ]. The risk of these arrhythmias increases with patient age (especially over age 40) and with higher pulmonary artery pressures [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22,90
         </a>
         ]. In a report of 211 adults, for example, the incidence of AF or atrial flutter prior to surgery was 1 percent for those aged 18 to 40, 30 percent for those aged 40 to 60, and 80 percent in those over the age of 60 [
         <a href="#rid90">
          90
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Observational data suggest that ASD closure may reduce but does not eliminate the risk of atrial tachyarrhythmias. The effect of surgical or percutaneous defect closure on the prevalence of atrial arrhythmias was evaluated by a systematic review, including 26 studies in which a total of 1841 patients (with median or mean age at least 18 years prior to intervention) underwent surgical closure and 945 patients underwent percutaneous closure [
         <a href="#rid91">
          91
         </a>
         ]. Meta-analysis demonstrated a reduction in the prevalence of atrial tachyarrhythmias after ASD closure (odds ratio [OR] = 0.66, 95% CI 0.57-0.77). This effect was found after both surgical closure (OR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.60-0.87) and percutaneous closure (OR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.32-0.76). A significant decline in atrial tachyarrhythmias was seen both at &lt;30 days and midterm (30 days to five years) follow-up. Limitations of the analysis include differences in methods for monitoring arrhythmias before and after closure in most of the studies.
        </p>
        <p>
         The risk of AF after ASD closure is presumably primarily related to preexisting and irreversible factors, such as incomplete atrial remodeling, that predispose to the arrhythmia. Surgical techniques, such the Maze procedure performed at the time of surgical ASD closure, decrease the long-term incidence of AF in selected patients [
         <a href="#rid90">
          90,92,93
         </a>
         ]. This procedure involves the placement of incisions or cryolesions in the atria to interrupt the macroreentrant circuits that sustain atrial flutter and AF (see

          "Atrial fibrillation: Surgical ablation"

         – Preprocedural assessment in patients with indications for atrial septal defect (ASD) closure includes review of the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE; and other imaging such as transesophageal echocardiogram [TEE], cardiovascular magnetic resonance [CMR] imaging, or computerized tomography [CT], as needed) to confirm the diagnosis and identify or exclude associated defects prior to surgical or percutaneous closure; associated defects may help determine the most appropriate closure technique.

         – Percutaneous device closure is an alternative to surgical closure in patients with secundum ASDs that have appropriate anatomic characteristics.

         – Surgery is required for closure of primum ASDs and coronary sinus defects. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Options for closure based upon type of ASD'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Outcomes
         </strong>
         – Mortality rates are similar with surgical and percutaneous ASD closure, the rate of procedural success is comparable or slightly better with surgery, and the rate of early complications and length of hospital stay are reduced with the percutaneous approach. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Percutaneous versus surgical closure for secundum ASD'

          Percutaneous closure outcomes
         </strong>
         – Complications of percutaneous ASD closure include device embolization or malposition, device erosion, wire fracture, atrial arrhythmias, and access site complications. Complications of surgical ASD closure include bleeding, infection, stroke, and atrial arrhythmias. (See
         <a class="local">

         An uncommon early or late and potentially catastrophic complication following Amplatzer septal occluder implantation is erosion with perforation of one or both atria and/or the aorta. (See

          Surgical closure outcomes
         </strong>
         – Surgical closure in appropriate candidates &lt;25 years old with ostium secundum ASD without pulmonary hypertension or significant comorbidity is associated with low postoperative mortality (&lt;1 percent) and normal life expectancy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Without pulmonary hypertension'

         <strong>
          Effect of age
         </strong>
         – Patients under and over 40 years old with appropriate indications benefit from ASD closure. Younger patients (&lt;40 years) have better long-term outcomes following surgical ASD closure than older patients [

         <strong>
          Risk of atrial arrhythmias
         </strong>
         – Observational data suggest that ASD closure may reduce but does not eliminate the risk of atrial tachyarrhythmias, so other treatments, such as the Maze procedure performed at the time of ASD closure, may be helpful in selected patients. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Postprocedural assessment
         </strong>
         – TTE should be performed following surgical or percutaneous closure to evaluate the adequacy of the repair, and to document the expected postoperative decreases in right heart chamber size and pulmonary pressures. (See
