In addition, other patients with angina refractory to medical therapy may receive a recommendation for CABG if PCI cannot be performed. The procedure involves the construction of one or more grafts between the arterial and coronary circulations.</p><p>This topic addresses issues related to late survival following CABG. The following issues are discussed separately: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Operative mortality (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1561.html" rel="external">"Operative mortality after coronary artery bypass graft surgery"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Early noncardiac complications (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1585.html" rel="external">"Early noncardiac complications of coronary artery bypass graft surgery"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Medical therapy to prevent complications (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1556.html" rel="external">"Coronary artery bypass surgery: Perioperative medical management"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Choice of graft (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1554.html" rel="external">"Coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Graft choices"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Early cardiac complications (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1584.html" rel="external">"Early cardiac complications of coronary artery bypass graft surgery"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vein graft stenosis (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1565.html" rel="external">"Coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Prevention and management of vein graft stenosis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Late recurrent angina (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1588.html" rel="external">"Late recurrent angina pectoris after coronary artery bypass graft surgery"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14980244"><span class="h1">SURVIVAL RATES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many studies of late survival after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) were carried out before long-term interventions aimed at reducing overall cardiovascular risk, such as statin therapy, were routinely employed. Thus, past estimates of long-term survival after CABG are of uncertain applicability to current practice. In addition, survival rates vary with the population studied [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p>The best available data on long-term survival after CABG come from two 2012 reports:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The ASCERT study linked data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Data base and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (United States) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. This study included nearly 350,000 isolated CABG patients aged ≥65 years who were discharged between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2007. Kaplan-Meier estimated mortality was 3.2 percent at 30 days, 6.4 percent at 180 days, 8.1 percent at one year, 11.3 percent at two years, and 23.3 percent at three years of follow- up.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a report from the New York State Cardiac Surgery Reporting System database, the one-, three-, five-, and seven-year mortality rates of 8597 patients who underwent isolated CABG were 6.2, 11.2, 17.6, and 24.2 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14980250"><span class="h1">POSSIBLE PREDICTORS OF MORTALITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Graft patency, advancement of disease in native vessels, and comorbid conditions are major predictors of long-term mortality, particularly in patients aged 65 years or older. The ASCERT study (see <a class="local">'Survival rates'</a> above) made the following observations [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Risk factors such as emergency status, shock, and reoperation are strong predictors of short-term outcome, but become nonsignificant within two years.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other risk factors such as dialysis-dependent renal failure, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and smoking become more important with time.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age (increment of 10 years), chronic lung disease (≥moderate), and serum creatinine 1.5 to 2.5mg/dL predict poor outcomes both short- and long-term. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3861066263"><span class="h2">Preoperative factors</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H370354140"><span class="h3">Preoperative hemoglobin level</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lower preoperative hemoglobin (as a continuous variable) and anemia (defined as &lt;13 mg/dL for men and &lt;12 mg/dL for women) were independent predictors of higher late mortality (after 30 days) in a study of over 10,000 patients undergoing isolated CABG [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H547262059"><span class="h3">Chronic kidney disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chronic kidney disease, even if mild, is associated with increased perioperative mortality after CABG. The mechanisms by which this occurs are not completely understood. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7190.html" rel="external">"Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1585.html" rel="external">"Early noncardiac complications of coronary artery bypass graft surgery", section on 'Acute kidney injury'</a>.)</p><p>The baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is also a predictor of long-term mortality after CABG. This was illustrated in a series of 2607 consecutive patients undergoing CABG in whom the baseline serum creatinine was used to estimate the GFR [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. At 2.3 years, the estimated GFR was an independent predictor of mortality in models with other univariable predictors and in the EuroSCORE cardiac operative risk evaluation (hazard ratio [HR] 0.80 to 0.88 per 10 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> increase in estimated GFR compared with an HR of 0.71 without adjustment).</p><p>One mechanism by which chronic kidney disease might lead to a lower survival is by causing a lower rate of bypass graft patency. This question was evaluated in the PREVENT IV trial, in which there was no significant difference between saphenous vein or internal thoracic artery graft failure rates in patients with or without preoperative renal dysfunction at two years [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1554.html" rel="external">"Coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Graft choices", section on 'Late occlusion'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H254028708"><span class="h3">Cardiovascular risk factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other variables affecting long-term outcome have been described in several reports and consist mostly of the known coronary risk factors [<a href="#rid7">7-10</a>]. In the CASS registry, factors impacting negatively upon late survival, other than the use of saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) alone, were heavier weight, MI, diabetes, smoking, and left main and left anterior descending disease [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. This issue was also addressed in a study of 3559 patients who underwent CABG at a single center and were followed for ≥25 years; the following predictors of survival were reported [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age - Relative risk 1.54 for each decade</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Total cholesterol - Relative risk 1.11 for each 50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) increase</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diabetes mellitus - Relative risk 1.45</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Systemic hypertension - Relative risk 1.28</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cigarette smoking - Relative risk 1.33</p><p></p><p>As described below, chronic kidney disease is now recognized as an important adverse predictor of survival after CABG.</p><p>In a retrospective review of 6428 patients who were followed for a median of eight years after CABG, over 90 percent of those who died had at least one of these risk factors [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. The HR increased from 1.64 when one factor was present to 3.95 when all four risk factors were present. Women with this quartet had a poorer outcome than men (HR 13.4 versus 2.6).</p><p>The impact of therapies to lower cardiovascular risk is discussed below.

In a retrospective cohort study at 40 United States Veterans Association medical centers, 13,554 patients underwent CABG and were followed for mortality outcomes. Frailty was quantified by the Veterans Administration Frailty Index (VA-FI), which uses 30 pertinent diagnosis codes. Patients were classified as nonfrail (VA-FI ≤0.1), prefrail (VA-FI ≤0.2), or frail (VA-FI &gt; 0.2). Frail patients were older and had higher comorbidity burdens than pre- and nonfrail patients. Compared with nonfrail patients, frail and prefrail patients had increased mortality at five years (13 versus 24.8 percent [HR 1.75; 95% CI 1.54-2.00] and 13 versus 16.8 percent [HR 1.2; 95% CI 1.08-1.34], respectively). Compared with nonfrail patients (mean 362 [SD 12]), prefrail (mean 361 [SD 14]) and frail patients (mean 358 [SD 18]) spent fewer days alive and out of the hospital in the first postoperative year.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2400938926"><span class="h2">Surgical factors</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14980256"><span class="h3">Use of the left internal thoracic artery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The higher long-term patency seen with arterial compared to SVGs  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72584" href="/d/graphic/72584.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) translates into improved long-term survival  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69211" href="/d/graphic/69211.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). This issue is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1554.html" rel="external">"Coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Graft choices", section on 'Arterial grafts'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14980327"><span class="h3">Two arterial grafts</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Placement of two (rather than one) arterial grafts should be attempted in most patients with a life expectancy of greater than 7 to 10 years. Although the use of two arterial grafts, compared with one, has not been clearly shown to improve survival, benefits include a lower rate of repeat revascularization and myocardial infarction, particularly when a radial artery is used as the second arterial graft. This issue is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1554.html" rel="external">"Coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Graft choices", section on 'Arterial grafts'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14980333"><span class="h3">Incomplete revascularization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While complete revascularization (CR) has been the usual goal for CABG, the evidence to support superiority of CR compared to incomplete revascularization (IR) is not consistent, with studies suggesting that incomplete revascularization (IR) may be equally safe and effective.</p><p>Multiple older studies (1992 to 2000) support CR [<a href="#rid11">11-13</a>]. For example, in a report from the CASS registry of patients who underwent CABG for three vessel disease, placing grafts to three or more vessels was independently associated with improved survival at five years (87 to 90 percent versus 78 percent with a graft to only one vessel) and event-free survival at six years (30 versus 23 percent with a graft to only one vessel) in patients with severe but not mild to moderate angina [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. </p><p>The applicability of these older studies to the current era is uncertain and the effect of other confounding high-risk factors is difficult to control. </p><p>The following studies do not support an advantage to CR:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a review from the BARI trial comparing CABG to PCI (bare metal stents), there was no independent survival advantage from CR compared to IR [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the ARTS I trial comparing CABG to PCI (bare metal stents) in patients with multivessel disease, there was no difference in mortality out to five years in the two groups [<a href="#rid15">15</a>], despite a higher rate of CR with CABG (84 versus 71 percent) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. However, stented patients with IR were more significantly more likely to require CABG at one year (10 versus 2 percent of stented patients with CR). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1579.html" rel="external">"Revascularization in patients with stable coronary artery disease: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery versus percutaneous coronary intervention"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A single-center registry report of 514 patients undergoing CABG for multivessel coronary artery disease compared outcomes between those who received CR (67 percent) and those who received IR (33 percent) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Multiple analyses using differing definitions of IR (applied to the diagnostic angiogram prior to revascularization) found no significant difference in the adjusted rates of five-year death or the composite of death, MI, or stroke between those with CR and those with IR.</p><p></p><p>We believe that the goal for surgical revascularization should remain CR (with arterial grafts), whenever possible and safe. However, the above findings suggest that not all patients who undergo CABG require CR. In the setting of a left internal thoracic artery (ITA) conduit to the LAD, IR may be appropriate for non-LAD vessels that are small or to vessels that supply only a small amount of viable myocardium. In addition, IR, as part of a strategy to simplify the surgical procedure in order to reduce operation-related complications, may be reasonable. This may be a situation in which a combined (staged) revascularization approach, with both CABG and PCI, may be reasonable.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14980586"><span class="h3">Vein graft failure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The issue of whether vein graft patency affects long-term outcomes in patients who receive a left ITA graft was evaluated in the PREVENT IV trial of over 1800 patients who underwent CABG and had an angiogram performed up to 188 months after surgery. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1554.html" rel="external">"Coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Graft choices", section on 'Late occlusion'</a>.) Over 92 percent of patients received an ITA graft. The main outcome measure of death, MI, and repeat revascularization through four years occurred more often in patients who had any vein graft failure compared with those who had none (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.68, 95% CI 1.21-2.06) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. This finding was due principally to a higher rate of repeat revascularization; there were no significant differences in the rates of death or MI. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14980592"><span class="h3">Endoscopic vein-graft harvesting</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Endoscopic vein-graft harvesting is preferred to an open technique due to a comparable rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) such as mortality or vein-graft failure but a lower incidence of wound (leg) complications, better cosmetic appearance, and less pain. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1585.html" rel="external">"Early noncardiac complications of coronary artery bypass graft surgery", section on 'Leg wound complications'</a>.)</p><p>Early observational studies of relatively small size came to differing conclusions regarding MACE [<a href="#rid19">19-22</a>].</p><p>The 2018 REGROUP trial randomly assigned 1150 patients undergoing CABG to open or endoscopic vein-graft harvesting [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. All vein-graft harvesting was performed by operators with a high level of clinical experience. During a median follow-up of almost three years, there was no significant difference in the rate of a primary composite outcome that included all-cause death, nonfatal MI, and repeat revascularization (15.5 versus 13.9 percent; HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.83-1.51). The rates of the individual outcomes were similar. There was a trend toward more leg wound infections in the open harvest group.

For patients without other clear indications for beta blocker use, such as those with heart failure, we suggest that they <strong>not</strong> be routinely used long-term based on the following evidence:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Older randomized trials performed before the routine use of other preventive strategies did not find evidence of benefit [<a href="#rid40">40,41</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 2015 observational study evaluated long-term outcomes in 5926 patients who underwent CABG between 2004 and 2008 [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. The primary outcome was all-cause death and the analysis evaluated patients with and without MI and by beta blocker use. After a median duration of 3.0 years, 5.3 percent died (54 percent from a cardiac cause) and this rate was similar between those with and without prior MI. In a matched cohort analysis of 1096 users and never users, the rate of death was significantly higher in the never user group (HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.01-2.24). This benefit was present for individuals with and without prior MI. However, as patients who consistently take medications generally have better outcomes compared to those who do not, our confidence is low that the findings in this study represent an effect resulting from beta blocker use.</p><p></p><p>While we do not recommend the routine use of beta blockers in patients who have undergone complete and successful revascularization, their use is appropriate in some patients, such as those with heart failure or those with rapid ventricular rates in atrial fibrillation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/121086.html" rel="external">"Primary pharmacologic therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction", section on 'Beta blocker'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/938.html" rel="external">"Control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation who do not have heart failure: Pharmacologic therapy"</a>.)</p><p>The role of long-term beta blocker use after CABG in patients with prior MI has not been well studied. Our experts have varying approaches, with some continuing them indefinitely, some stopping at one or three years, and a few stopping after successful revascularization.

However, these trials cannot be used to support a specific benefit from ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) since the blood pressure was also significantly lower in the ACE inhibitor group (eg, 128/75 versus 136/81 mmHg with placebo at one year in the APRES trial). In a number of other trials that have evaluated ACE inhibitors or ARBs compared to placebo or other antihypertensive in high-risk groups, the intervention that was associated with the lower blood pressure consistently produced the better outcome. </p><p>In addition, individuals at low risk of cardiovascular events after CABG may not derive specific benefit from angiotensin inhibition. This issue was addressed in the IMAGINE trial in which 2553 low-risk patients following CABG were randomly assigned to either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9843" href="/d/drug information/9843.html" rel="external">quinapril</a> (target dose 40 mg daily) or placebo [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. Low-risk was defined as stable patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≥40 percent and no other clear indication such as uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes with microalbuminuria, or insulin dependency. After a median follow-up of almost three years, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the combined primary end point (cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, nonfatal MI, coronary revascularization, unstable angina or heart failure requiring hospitalization, documented angina, or stroke).</p><p>These findings do not preclude the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs nor do they minimize the utility of these drugs as first-line therapy in all CABG patients who have specific indications for their use, such as left ventricular systolic dysfunction or proteinuric chronic kidney disease. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14981551"><span class="h1">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, “The Basics” and “Beyond the Basics.” The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
