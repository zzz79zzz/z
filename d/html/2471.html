         For patients with locoregional colon cancer, including stage III (node-positive) disease, surgical resection is the only curative treatment. Outcome is most closely related to the extent of disease at presentation  (

         For patients who have undergone potentially curative resection, disease recurrence is thought to arise from clinically occult micrometastases that are present at the time of surgery. The goal of postoperative (adjuvant) therapy is to eradicate these micrometastases, thereby increasing the cure rate.
        </p>
        <p>
         The benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy have been most clearly demonstrated in stage III (node-positive  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438" href="/z/d/graphic/111438.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         )) disease, in which fluoropyrimidine-based adjuvant chemotherapy provides an approximately 30 percent reduction in the risk of disease recurrence and a 22 to 32 percent reduction in mortality [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]; the added benefit from
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10180" href="/z/d/drug information/10180.html" rel="external">
          oxaliplatin
         </a>
         , while likely to be significant, has not been quantified, since there are no trials directly comparing an oxaliplatin-containing adjuvant therapy regimen versus resection alone. By contrast, the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II disease remains controversial.
        </p>
        <p>
         Historically, the gold standard to define benefit from adjuvant therapy has been improvement in overall survival. However, disease-free survival (DFS; defined as the time from randomization to any event, irrespective of cause [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]) at three years appears to be an acceptable surrogate for five-year overall survival, especially for stage III disease [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6
         </a>
         ]. Thus, three-year DFS is a widely accepted endpoint to define benefit from adjuvant therapy in colon cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the duration of follow-up that is required to see DFS benefits translating into prolonged overall survival may be longer because of the prolongation in median survival that is associated with newer treatments for metastatic disease. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15802.html" rel="external">
          "Systemic therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer: General principles", section on 'Available agents'

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Nonetheless, two- or three-year DFS is now accepted as a legitimate endpoint for treatment benefit, at least for stage III disease [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Significant improvements in three-year DFS formed the basis for the approval of adjuvant FOLFOX (

          TIMING OF ADJUVANT THERAPY
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Adjuvant chemotherapy is typically started only after recovery from surgery. There is no agreement as to the optimal time to initiate adjuvant chemotherapy. Guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ] do not explicitly state a time interval within which chemotherapy should commence, while updated guidelines from the European Society of Medical Oncology suggest that adjuvant therapy be initiated as soon as possible after surgery, and ideally no later than eight weeks [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Adjuvant colon cancer trials typically mandate initiation of chemotherapy within six to eight weeks of resection, and this has become an accepted approach.
        </p>
        <p>
         In clinical practice, the interval between surgery and initiation of chemotherapy is often longer than eight weeks; the reasons are often multifactorial, but the dominant reason is delayed recovery from surgery [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10-14
         </a>
         ]. A major advantage of laparoscopic as compared with open resection is its association with earlier initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/82949.html" rel="external">
          "Surgical resection of primary colon cancer", section on 'Open versus laparoscopic colectomy'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Other factors that may delay initiation of adjuvant therapy include inefficiencies in the health care system or shortages of resources to deliver care [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17
         </a>
         ], and patient-related issues such as greater levels of comorbidity, lack of social support, and lower socioeconomic status [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Whether a delay in the administration of adjuvant therapy compromises outcomes is controversial. There are no randomized trials addressing this issue in patients with resected colon cancer. Several retrospective studies are available, most of which consist predominantly or exclusively of patients with stage III disease, and only one of which included patients receiving an oxaliplatin-based regimen [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. In general, the data are conflicting. While several reports suggest worse overall and event-free survival with a delay beyond eight weeks [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,18-21
         </a>
         ], one suggests worse overall survival with a delay beyond 12 weeks [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ], another suggests worse overall survival but no impact on event-free survival with a delay beyond 60 days [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ], and two others suggest no significant impact on either disease-free or overall survival with a delay beyond 45 or 56 days [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23,24
         </a>
         ]. In adjuvant therapy trials in which time between surgery and initiation of chemotherapy has been examined as a prognostic factor for outcome, delay beyond six to eight weeks has not been associated with inferior outcomes [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25-27
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The adverse impact of delaying chemotherapy beyond eight weeks has been addressed in two meta-analyses:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         One meta-analysis consisted of eight studies that compared outcomes among patients with colon or rectal cancer who had delayed chemotherapy and those who started within eight weeks of surgery [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. A delay of chemotherapy beyond eight weeks was associated with a significantly higher risk of death (relative risk 1.20, 95% CI 1.15-1.26), although relapse-free survival was not significantly affected. This suggests that most of the mortality was from surgery-related complications and was not cancer related.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The second meta-analysis included 10 studies (one randomized trial and nine cohort/population-based studies), totaling over 15,000 patients [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. Delaying adjuvant chemotherapy beyond 12 weeks after surgery was associated with a significant increase in mortality (hazard ratio [HR] for death 1.14, 95% CI 1.10-1.17) and disease relapse (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.10-1.18).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         These data support the conclusion that adjuvant chemotherapy should be started within eight weeks of surgery if at all possible. A delay beyond two months may compromise the effectiveness of chemotherapy, but it is not clear whether there is any cutoff point beyond which the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy are lost. At least some data point toward a persistent benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy even if treatment is delayed beyond 24 weeks postresection, although the magnitude is less than if treatment had been administered within eight weeks of resection [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, both of the meta-analyses included only trials of adjuvant fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. Whether this recommendation applies to oxaliplatin-based regimens (which are preferred for most patients with stage III tumors) is unclear. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Oxaliplatin-based therapy'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         This issue was addressed in a population-based analysis of 635 patients with stage III colon cancer, derived from the database of the British Columbia Cancer Agency, who initiated adjuvant chemotherapy with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/z/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">
          fluorouracil

          oxaliplatin
         </a>
         between 2006 and 2011 [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. The median time from surgery to initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy was 8.3 weeks. At a median follow-up of 57.9 months, five-year relapse-free survival was 70.9 percent for those patients who initiated adjuvant chemotherapy within eight weeks and 72.1 percent for those who started after eight weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite these data, we still suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy be started within eight weeks of surgery if at all possible.

         We recommend an oxaliplatin-based regimen, rather than a fluoropyrimidine-based regimen alone, for fit patients with resected stage III disease who are younger than age 70 and likely to tolerate

          oxaliplatin

         , and for those whose tumors are mismatch repair enzyme deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite unstable. The survival benefit of adding oxaliplatin to adjuvant fluoropyrimidines in patients with resected stage III colon cancer has been shown in multiple randomized trials, and benefit appears to be evident across diverse practice settings and patient subgroups. However, the benefits of an oxaliplatin- over a non-oxaliplatin-containing regimen are less well established in individuals 70 and over. In the setting of a dMMR colon cancer, fluoropyrimidines alone are ineffective for adjuvant therapy. (See

A significant number of patients report local pain when oxaliplatin is infused via a peripheral vein, and many centers routinely infuse the drug via a central line. (See

        <p>
         Toxicity was prominent in both groups. Hospitalization for diarrhea or dehydration was required in 51 patients receiving FLOX and in 28 patients in the control group (5.5 versus 3 percent, p = 0.08) [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. While the risk of death within 60 days of starting treatment was 1.2 percent overall and similar in both groups, five deaths in the FLOX group were directly attributed to chemotherapy-induced enteropathy, versus one in the control group. Grade 3 or 4 vomiting (13 versus 9 percent) and grade 3 neurosensory toxicity (8.2 versus 0.2 percent) were also significantly more common with FLOX.

         In our view, FLOX appears to be more toxic than combinations of

          oxaliplatin
         </a>
         with infusional FU/LV (eg, FOLFOX), and it is not a preferred regimen. Furthermore, in the setting of metastatic disease, bolus regimens that are similar to FLOX have proven to be inferior to FOLFOX (eg, in the Three Regimens of Eloxatin Evaluation [TREE] trials [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38

        <p>
         For these reasons, we prefer FOLFOX over FLOX as long as ambulatory infusional therapy is feasible. Guidelines for adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [

However, one potential setting in which FLOX may be an appropriate alternative is for patients who develop fluoropyrimidine-related cardiotoxicity while receiving an infusional regimen (such as FOLFOX or CAPOX). Limited data suggest that some patients may be able to safely resume therapy using a bolus FU-containing regimen (such as FLOX,  (

         Based on the MOSAIC and NSABP C-07 trials and an analysis of the International Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy (IDEA) collaboration (six separate randomized trials of six versus three months of adjuvant oxaliplatin-based therapy), we continue to suggest six months of therapy for individuals with high-risk cancers (T4N2  (

However, patients with high-risk cancers should be counseled about the small magnitude of improvement in five-year overall survival offered by an additional three months of therapy in the most recent analysis of the IDEA collaboration (74.1 versus 72 percent, absolute difference 2.1 percent, HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.95-1.19), which must be counterbalanced by the attendant increase in neuropathy. On the other hand, given the similar five-year overall survival for three versus six months of therapy (89.6 versus 88.9 percent, absolute difference 0.7 percent) and the significantly lower rates of

         If three months of adjuvant oxaliplatin-based therapy is chosen, a subset analysis of the IDEA collaboration suggests that CAPOX/XELOX may be a better choice than FOLFOX (although this was not a randomized comparison in any of the six trials), and it avoids the need for an ambulatory infusion pump. Another option is three months of

         These recommendations are consistent with a year 2019 Clinical Practice Guideline from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), which states that six months of adjuvant oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy should be offered to patients with stage III colon cancer who are at a higher risk of recurrence (T4 and/or N2), but that for lower risk patients, either three or six months of therapy may be offered [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. The ASCO expert panel recommended a shared decision-making approach, taking into account patient characteristics, values, and preferences, and the potential for benefit and risks of harm associated with treatment duration. The guideline did not recommend one oxaliplatin-containing regimen over another for patients who choose three months of adjuvant therapy, but they noted that three months of treatment was inferior to six months among patients receiving FOLFOX but not CAPOX.

         Our recommendations are also consistent with updated guidelines from the NCCN, which suggest three months of CAPOX or three to six months of FOLFOX for low-risk stage III disease, and three to six months of CAPOX or six months of FOLFOX for high-risk stage III disease [

In the pooled analysis, the upper limit of the noninferiority margin was arbitrarily set to no more than a 12 percent relative risk increase in disease recurrence (ie, HR for the upper 95% CI less than 1.12), corresponding to a worsening of three-year DFS of 2.7 percentage points.

The authors concluded that while noninferiority could not be shown for three versus six months of treatment, the very small absolute difference in five-year overall survival supports the use of three months of adjuvant CAPOX for most patients with stage III colon cancer, given the substantial reduction of toxicities, inconveniences, and cost associated with a shorter treatment duration.

         For patients treated with CAPOX, the results for both five-year overall survival and disease-free survival with three versus six months of therapy fell within the prespecified margins of noninferiority. However, further analysis of CAPOX-treated patients with low-risk versus high-risk disease revealed that these noninferiority margins were met only for the low-risk group and not for the high-risk group. Despite this, the absolute magnitude of difference for three versus six months of CAPOX in the high-risk group was only 1 percent in favor of six months of therapy (five-year overall survival 71.4 versus 72.4 percent).

         – Another option to mitigate treatment-related neurotoxicity is three months of oxaliplatin plus a fluoropyrimidine followed by three additional months of fluoropyrimidine alone. The benefit of this strategy over six months of oxaliplatin-containing therapy was addressed in a randomized trial in which 1788 patients (78 percent stage III, the remainder high-risk stage II) were assigned to oxaliplatin (three versus six months) with six months of fluoropyrimidine [

Neuropathy rates (any grade) were 69.5 versus 58.3 percent (p = 0.0001), though there were no significant differences in rate of ≥grade 3 neuropathy between the arms. Unpreplanned subgroup analysis suggested noninferiority for three versus six months of oxaliplatin among those receiving CAPOX (HR 0.713, 95% CI 0.530-0.959) but not FOLFOX (HR 1.102, 95% CI 0.847-1.435).

         Extramural tumor deposits that are outside of lymph nodes appear to influence prognosis adversely, both in patients with and without lymph node metastases. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         The possibility that these tumor deposits might influence decision-making on the duration of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage III colon cancer was addressed in the phase III IDEA France trial (PRODIGE-ACCORD), which tested three versus six months of adjuvant oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ]. In a posthoc analysis, 184 (9.5 percent) of the 1942 patients had tumor deposits, including approximately 8 percent of those with otherwise low-risk stage III tumors (ie, pT1-3 and pN1). In multivariate analysis, the presence of tumor deposits was associated with a significantly higher risk of both disease recurrence and death. Of 1454 pN1-staged patients, 35 (2.4 percent) were restaged to pN2 by the addition of tumor deposits to the lymph node metastasis count, and these patients had a lower three-year DFS rate than did those whose tumors remained pN1 despite the addition of tumor deposits to the positive node count (61 versus 79 percent), and the pN2-restaged patients had a similar DFS as did those whose tumors were initially staged pN2. These findings could potentially modify the optimal duration of chemotherapy in patients who are restaged to pN2 disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         These data are derived from posthoc analysis, and as such, should be considered hypothesis generating. They need to be confirmed in prospective studies before it can be concluded that extramural tumor deposits should influence the duration of chemotherapy. However, given the growing data on the adverse prognostic influence of tumor deposits, we counsel patients on considering six rather than three months of adjuvant chemotherapy if there are &gt;3 extramural non-nodal tumor deposits, but emphasize the uncertainty of benefit from three additional months of chemotherapy in this setting.

         Most American patients receive a racemic mixture of d,l-leucovorin (LV calcium), and this is the version that has been used in most reported clinical trials. However, the l isomer is the biologically active moiety, and an intravenous preparation of l-leucovorin is now commercially available in the United States (

         The largest of these, the International Multicentre Pooled Analysis of Colon Cancer Trials (IMPACT), consisted of pooled data from 1526 patients with resected Dukes' B (node-negative) or C (node-positive) colon cancer who were enrolled in three independent trials in Italy, Canada, and France [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61,62

         A lack of superiority but a more favorable side effect profile for continuous infusion FU over bolus FU plus LV has been shown in at least four trials [

As an example, the Pan-European Trials in Adjuvant Colon Cancer (PETACC) 02 trial directly compared 24 weeks of the Mayo regimen (low-dose bolus FU plus LV daily for five days) versus 24 weeks of high-dose infusional FU (given three different ways depending on geographic region) with or without LV [

Compared with bolus FU/LV, treatment with high-dose infusional FU caused less mucositis and neutropenia, similar rates of diarrhea, and more hand-foot syndrome. However, treatment-related toxicity differed according to the high-dose infusional FU schedule, and it was lowest with short-term infusional FU plus LV (the so-called de Gramont schedule, see below).

         is absorbed intact through the intestinal wall and then converted into FU in three sequential enzymatic reactions. The final requisite enzyme, thymidine phosphorylase, is present at consistently higher levels in tumor compared with normal tissue, forming the basis for enhanced selectivity for tumor cells and better tolerability.

         The benefit of oral fluoropyrimidines was addressed in a meta-analysis of individual data from five Japanese trials involving 5232 patients with resected stage I, II, or III colon cancer who were randomly assigned to adjuvant oral fluoropyrimidines (FU, UFT, or hexacarbamoyl FU) or observation [

         No trial has directly compared three versus six months of adjuvant fluoropyrimidines alone. A meta-analysis of four nonrandomized trials totaling 2290 patients concluded that the standard six-month regimen was associated with significantly better survival (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.52-0.68) [

         For patients who have tumors with MSI-H or dMMR, we suggest not using fluoropyrimidines alone. If adjuvant chemotherapy is needed, an oxaliplatin-based regimen should be at least attempted.

         Approximately 5 to 15 percent of colorectal cancers have sporadic or inherited (Lynch syndrome) deficiency of a mismatch repair protein, most commonly mutL homolog 1 (MLH1) or mutS homolog 2 (MSH2). MSI-H is the biologic footprint of tumors that are dMMR. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Most studies support the view that dMMR colon cancers are resistant to fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy [
         <a href="#rid76">
          76,88-95
         </a>
         ]. Despite the lack of data from prospective randomized trials, data from nonrandomized trials as well as the ACCENT pooled analysis of data from a subset of patients enrolled in 12 colon cancer adjuvant therapy trials are fairly compelling as to the retained efficacy of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in these patients, particularly for stage III colon cancer [
         <a href="#rid94">
          94-96
         </a>

          oxaliplatin
         </a>
         must be carefully considered. One option is to start with half-dose oxaliplatin (as was done in the FOCUS2 trial conducted in patients with metastatic disease [
         <a href="#rid97">
          97

         ]) and dose escalate as tolerated.

         The impact of mismatch repair status on adjuvant therapy decision making for stage II disease is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         MSI-H/dMMR may also indicate the presence of Lynch syndrome, an inherited condition that predisposes to several cancers in addition to colorectal cancer. Although over 90 percent of Lynch syndrome-related colorectal cancers will demonstrate microsatellite instability, 15 percent of sporadic colorectal cancers also are MSI-H. Thus, the finding of MSI-H in a colorectal cancer is not specific for Lynch syndrome. An algorithm to guide the need to refer for germline genetic assessment for Lynch syndrome in the setting of an MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer is provided  (

While some of these tools can assist in estimating the potential benefit of FU-based versus oxaliplatin-containing adjuvant therapy, in our opinion, these tools are best used as a rough guide to explain the degree of absolute benefit that may be achieved by receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy rather than as a tool to estimate the potential benefit of specific regimens.

Although the group receiving intraportal therapy had significantly better three-year disease-free survival (85 versus 76 percent, p = 0.03) and a significantly lower rate of distant metastasis (13 versus 23 percent), this did not translate into significantly better three-year overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] for death 0.33, 95% CI 0.182-1.231).

          —
         </span>
         The role of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) in patients with resected colon cancer is poorly defined. Despite the absence of data from randomized trials proving benefit, we offer adjuvant RT to the following subgroups of patients who have an estimated risk of local recurrence ≥30 percent: ascending or descending colon primary with either T4b disease or a positive resection margin.
        </p>
        <p>
         Postoperative RT is not usually considered a routine component of care for completely resected colon cancer. This is in contrast to patients with rectal cancer, in whom effective adjuvant therapy for both transmural and node-positive disease includes RT. Local recurrence is more frequent with rectal cancer due to the local anatomy and the difficulty in obtaining adequate resection margins. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2529.html" rel="external">
          "Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma in patients not receiving neoadjuvant therapy"

        <p>
         However, in colon cancer, increasing tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) stage  (

         <a href="#rid128">

         </span>
         The ascending and descending colon are considered anatomically "immobile" structures. The anatomic constraints caused by the close proximity of these bowel segments to retroperitoneal tissues may preclude wide resection, increasing the risk of residual disease and local failure.

         </span>
         The midsigmoid and midtransverse colon are not fixed structures, and a wide margin in the mesentery is usually achievable. In the absence of adherence to local organs, local failure at these sites is uncommon.

         Local failure rates for tumors arising in the cecum, hepatic and splenic flexure, or proximal and distal sigmoid vary depending on the amount of mesentery present, the extent of primary disease, and the adequacy of the radial margins.

         Retrospective single-institution series suggest that failure rates within the operative bed for high-risk patients after resection alone are at least 30 percent and that this risk can be reduced substantially by RT [

        </p>
        <p>
         Local failure rates in patients treated with RT for T4N0 and T4N+ disease were 7 and 28 percent, respectively; the corresponding values for patients undergoing surgery alone were 31 and 53 percent. Disease-free survival rates for T4N0 and T4N+ tumors in the irradiated group were 79 and 53 percent, compared with 63 and 38 percent, respectively, with surgery alone.
        </p>
        <p>
         No significant outcome differences could be shown with RT in patients with T3N0 or T3N+ disease without perforation or fistula formation. However, many of these patients were referred for RT because of concerns about adequacy of resection, raising the possibility of selection bias. Nevertheless, the authors concluded that patients with T4 tumors, perforation/abscess formation, a fistula at the tumor site, or positive resection margins all benefited from postoperative RT.

         On the other hand, a retrospective analysis of data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) on over 23,000 patients with pathologic T4 or margin-positive colon cancer who were treated between 2004 and 2016 and who received multiagent adjuvant chemotherapy concluded that, while adjuvant RT was used infrequently (7 percent of the total), it was associated with improved survival in patients with both pathologic T4 disease and positive margins [
