As described below, it can also detect trisomy 18. (See <a class="local">'Detection of trisomy 18'</a> below.)</p><p>The combined test performs slightly better than the second-trimester quadruple test (ie, the DR is higher and/or the FPR is lower) when the comparison has been calculated after adjustment for the expected natural losses of Down syndrome fetuses between the first and second trimesters  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57348" href="/d/graphic/57348.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Timing of blood sample and ultrasound</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>First-trimester Down syndrome screening is performed in the late first trimester, usually between 10+0 and 13+6 weeks of gestation, depending on which markers are used [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. The blood tests and ultrasound examination for the combined test are most commonly performed on the same day between 11+0<sup> </sup>and 13+6 weeks of gestation. Some protocols opt for blood collection as early as 9+0 weeks of gestation so that the chemistry results are available for immediate reporting when the ultrasound is performed a week or more afterwards.</p><p>First-trimester testing should not be offered if chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is not available to establish a definite diagnosis. Such patients are better off having a serum integrated test with amniocentesis as the follow-up diagnostic test.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/435.html" rel="external">"Enlarged nuchal translucency and cystic hygroma", section on 'Anatomy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Measurement</strong> – NT thickness is measured by ultrasound between 10+3 and 13+6 gestational weeks. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/435.html" rel="external">"Enlarged nuchal translucency and cystic hygroma", section on 'Procedure'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Enlargement in Down syndrome</strong> – The NT measurement is, on average, increased in fetuses with Down syndrome [<a href="#rid9">9,22,23</a>]. There is a slight reduction in the NT median MoM from 10+0 to 13+0 weeks. However, there is a concomitant decrease in the spread of the observations at each week (standard deviation) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Overall, this leads to an increase in NT performance as a screening marker for Down syndrome with advancing gestation between 10+0 and 13+0 weeks [<a href="#rid8">8,18,24,25</a>]. Specifically, NT provides 51 percent detection of Down syndrome for a 5 percent FPR at 10 weeks, 59 percent at 11 weeks, and 62 percent at 12 to 13 weeks [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Thus, although NT performs well as a screening marker throughout the first trimester, measurements are ideally performed at 12 or 13 weeks of gestation. With the combination of multiple markers, including PAPP-A and hCG/free beta-hCG, screening performance is very similar at 11 to 13 weeks, and targeting 12 weeks is reasonable.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Performance of NT as a screening marker has not been consistent from study to study, presumably because of variability in operator expertise and quality of equipment [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. For this reason, proper training and ongoing quality management are essential components of screening programs that involve measurement of NT [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The best interpretation of NT is by screening programs that combine its measurement with maternal age and first trimester serum markers to provide a patient specific risk of Down syndrome. One exception to this recommendation is for fetuses with a cystic hygroma or significantly enlarged NT. These pregnancies are at particularly high risk of aneuploidy. Many experts proceed directly to karyotype (some choose microarray) assessment in these cases, rather than checking maternal serum biochemical marker levels. The optimum threshold for proceeding to chromosomal analysis without maternal serum screening is unclear. NT thresholds in the range of 3.0 to 4.0 mm have been suggested, given the relatively high risk of Down syndrome at this level. Enlarged NT has also been associated with other structural malformations. These issues are discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/435.html" rel="external">"Enlarged nuchal translucency and cystic hygroma"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3156092294"><span class="h2">Advantages and disadvantages of the combined test</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are obvious advantages to performing Down syndrome screening early in pregnancy. Early risk assessment and diagnosis of fetal abnormalities allow maximum time for decision-making; privacy, since others may not be aware of the pregnancy; and, if chosen, safer methods of pregnancy termination. However, this assumes that a screen-positive result can be further assessed by a diagnostic test; the combined test should not be offered if CVS is not available for immediate diagnostic testing.</p><p>Less obvious consequences include the identification of a fetus with Down syndrome that would have been spontaneously lost (approximately 15 percent of all Down syndrome pregnancies are spontaneously lost between 11 and 16 weeks of gestation compared with less than 2 percent of euploid pregnancies).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H107527319"><span class="h2">Other first-trimester serum and sonographic markers of Down syndrome</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>hCG, PAP-A, PlGF, AFP, and NT</strong> – The performance of the first-trimester combined test can be enhanced by adding placental growth factor (PlGF) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) to the combined test [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. PlGF and AFP levels are, on average, lower in pregnancies affected with fetal Down syndrome. Several studies have shown that a combination of four serum markers (PlGF, AFP, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG], and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A) between 11+0 and 13+0 weeks of gestation can detect up to 90 percent of Down syndrome pregnancies but with an FPR of approximately 20 percent [<a href="#rid28">28,30,31</a>]. Such testing would only be reasonable with reflexive cell-free DNA testing for those with initial screen-positive results [<a href="#rid32">32</a>] and may be useful in areas where NT is unreliable, unavailable, or too costly for routine use.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Additional sonographic markers</strong> <strong>(eg, absent nasal bone)</strong> – First-trimester combined screening can also be improved by assessing two or three ultrasound markers in addition to NT, such as nasal bone (present versus absent) and bladder size (megacystis [defined by longitudinal bladder length ≥7 mm at 10 to 14 weeks of gestation] present versus absent). Disadvantages include the additional expertise and costs involved. Additional markers are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/447.html" rel="external">"Sonographic findings associated with fetal aneuploidy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">INTEGRATED TESTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Integrated screening tests use markers measured in both the first and second trimesters to provide a single patient-specific estimate of risk for a Down syndrome pregnancy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2932766131"><span class="h2">Full integrated test</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Components and timing</strong> – A serum sample is assayed for pregnancy-associated plasma protein A between 10+0 and 13+6 weeks and an ultrasound measurement of NT, along with estimation of gestational age by crown-rump length, is performed between 11+0 and 13+6 weeks. The information is not analyzed until a second-trimester serum sample is drawn and the quadruple test markers are measured (alpha-fetoprotein, unconjugated estriol, inhibin A, and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG]) at 15+0 to 22+6 weeks  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76911" href="/d/graphic/76911.html" rel="external">table 1B</a>). Beta-hCG can be used as a marker in either the first or second trimester, but it is routinely measured in the second trimester when its performance is better.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The six marker values are used, together with maternal age, to calculate a single patient-specific risk for Down syndrome, and a report is generated. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pattern</strong> – The pattern in pregnancies affected by Down syndrome is decreased PAPP-A, enlarged NT, decreased AFP, decreased unconjugated estriol, increased inhibin A and increased hCG  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71552" href="/d/graphic/71552.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Performance</strong> – The full integrated test achieves an 85 percent detection rate (DR) at a 1 percent false positive-rate (FPR). If a 90 percent DR is the target, the FPR will be 2 percent  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57348" href="/d/graphic/57348.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Advantages and disadvantages</strong> – The advantage of the integrated test is that at an equivalent DR, it has a substantially lower FPR than the combined or quadruple test [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. A reduction in the FPR in screening tests is highly desirable. Any reduction in false positives while maintaining a high DR will increase the safety of the screening process because there will be fewer procedure-related miscarriages per Down syndrome pregnancy identified. A lower FPR will also decrease the number of patients who are anxious due to a false positive result; such anxiety appears to decrease participation in Down syndrome screening in the next pregnancy [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The disadvantage of the integrated test is that final test results are not available until the second trimester. This problem can be largely mitigated by using a sequential approach, but if used, chorionic villus sampling (CVS) should be available, otherwise there is little advantage of providing the first-trimester results. (See <a class="local">'Sequential screening'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Like the combined test, the integrated test can also detect trisomy 18, which is associated with a different pattern of test results  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71552" href="/d/graphic/71552.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Detection of trisomy 18'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Serum integrated test</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Components and timing</strong> – The serum integrated test is the same as the full integrated test but without ultrasound measurement of NT. (See <a class="local">'Full integrated test'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Performance</strong> – This test has the highest DR among screening tests that do not include NT measurement or cell-free DNA  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57348" href="/d/graphic/57348.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See <a class="local">'Choice of screening test'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Advantages and disadvantages</strong> – The advantages and disadvantages of screening across two trimesters are discussed above. (see <a class="local">'Full integrated test'</a> above) An advantage of the serum-integrated test is that it provides an option to patients in areas where expertise in measurement of NT is not available. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Sequential screening</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Components and timing</strong> – The sequential screening process involves performing the first-trimester portion of the integrated screen and then offering counseling and CVS to patients whose results place them at very high risk (eg, ≥1 in 50, or approximately the highest 0.5 percent) of an affected fetus. Patients whose screen does not place them at very high risk do not receive early results and go on to complete the second-trimester portion of the test. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Performance</strong> – One investigator estimated an 86 percent DR was achieved at a 2 percent FPR in a sequential test in which the first-trimester cut-off for offering invasive testing was set at 1 in 40 and the integrated cut-off was set at 1 in 110 [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. In the FASTER trial discussed below, sequential screening detected 95 percent of Down syndrome fetuses with an FPR of 5 percent (2.5 percent in the first-trimester portion and 2.5 percent in the integrated portion of the test) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. These rates approach those of full integrated screening but have the benefit of availability of early results for the highest risk patients [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Issues related to this type of sequential testing have been reviewed elsewhere [<a href="#rid33">33,35</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Advantages and disadvantages</strong> – The rationale for not releasing first-trimester risk results to patients in the group with risks less than the cut-off is that this information may lead to diagnostic testing in those at moderate risk and increase the actual FPR of the sequential test without a substantial increase in detection. Many patients with somewhat elevated risks in the first trimester will have quite low risks once the results of second-trimester testing are included.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Reporting a first-trimester Down syndrome risk and a separate and independent second-trimester Down syndrome risk is relatively uncommon but has important disadvantages. These were illustrated in a multicenter study of the first-trimester combined test sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Independent first- and second-trimester testing (the results of first-trimester screening were not incorporated into the total risk assessment) resulted in a very high DR (overall approximately 98 percent) but at an inappropriately high FPR (approximately 17 percent). Reporting both risks leads to physician and patient confusion and unpredictable screening performance.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">CHOICE OF SCREENING TEST</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients can be informed:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>The full integrated test </strong>(first-trimester NT, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A [PAPP-A], and second-trimester alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], unconjugated estriol [uE3], beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG], and inhibin A)<strong> is the most efficient serum-based screening test (high detection rate [DR], low false-positive ratio [FPR])</strong>. The rate of procedure-related unaffected fetal loss would be 9 losses per 100,000 patients screened compared with approximately 45 losses per 100,000 when either the combined test or the second-trimester quadruple test is performed.

A summary of results from these trials, including FPRs for various detection rates (DRs), is provided in the tables  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57348" href="/d/graphic/57348.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h2">Screen-positive first-trimester combined test results</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Defining screen-positive</strong> – A screen-positive test result indicates that the individual's risk of having a child with Down syndrome is equal to, or exceeds, a specific cut-off level that was predetermined by the laboratory based on the performance characteristics of the chosen screening test. This cut-off level is program/laboratory-specific and based on the combination of markers used, among other factors. A typical cut-off for the combined test is the term risk of Down syndrome of ≥1 in 300. This is associated with a false-positive rate (FPR) of approximately 5 percent (eg, approximately 5 per 100 screened patients will have risks higher than 1 in 300, such as 1 in 250 or 1 in 75). The odds of Down syndrome in this group of patients is approximately 1 in 20 (eg, for every 20 patients who are screen-positive, 1 will have a Down syndrome fetus and 19 will have a normal fetus)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54782" href="/d/graphic/54782.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/414.html" rel="external">"Maternal serum marker screening for Down syndrome: Levels and laboratory issues", section on 'Effect of maternal age'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Giving the information to the patient</strong> – The patient's risk of having an affected fetus/child is calculated from their age and screening test results and provided in the report (eg, Down syndrome risk 1 in 90). This can be explained to the patient as, "Your screening test result for Down syndrome is 1 in 90, meaning that among a group of 90 individuals with this test result, one will have a fetus with Down syndrome, while the remaining 89 will not." </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">It is important to note whether the risks reported are at term (ie, chance of an infant with Down syndrome at birth), at mid-trimester (the chance that an amniocentesis will identify and affected fetus), or in the late first trimester (chance that chorionic villus sampling [CVS] will identify an affected fetus). For example, a term risk of 1 in 90 translates to a mid-trimester risk of approximately 1 in 68 and a late first-trimester risk of 1 in 61. These differences reflect the ongoing risk of fetal loss associated with Down syndrome pregnancies [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Genetic counseling</strong> – After a positive screening test, it is helpful to have a genetic counselor meet with the parents to discuss the results along with diagnostic and management options. This would include information about the natural history of Down syndrome. Nondirective information enables the parents to balance the risks, limitations, and benefits of prenatal screening and diagnostic testing with the medical, educational and social issues involved in raising a child with Down syndrome or pregnancy termination.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic testing</strong> <strong>versus secondary screening</strong> – Patients with positive screening results are offered definitive fetal chromosomal analysis (karyotype, microarray) by CVS if they present prior to 14 weeks of gestation. Alternatively, they may choose to undergo secondary screening using a maternal plasma-based test for cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Although not diagnostic, the high sensitivity and specificity of the cfDNA test will reassure many individuals whose cfDNA test suggests a very low risk of Down syndrome, and thus allow them to avoid the cost and risk associated with an invasive diagnostic test. For those patients with a positive cfDNA test, the risk of Down syndrome is increased but still requires confirmation by an invasive diagnostic test (CVS, amniocentesis). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/426.html" rel="external">"Down syndrome: Overview of prenatal screening", section on 'Screen-positive test result'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/458.html" rel="external">"Prenatal screening for common aneuploidies using cell-free DNA"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">These two approaches were compared in a multicenter trial that explored the outcomes of individuals with a positive first-trimester combined test randomly assigned to follow-up with secondary cfDNA screening or an invasive diagnostic test [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. No Down syndrome pregnancies were missed. There were 11 (1.5 percent) additional chromosome anomalies identified among the 751 individuals who underwent invasive testing; however, only two abnormalities with potential clinical consequences would have been missed. Four of the 11 genetic abnormalities would not be associated with clinical consequences and five could have been identified with a more complete cfDNA test (two mosaic trisomy 13, three sex chromosome aneuploidy). As expected, the number of invasive procedures performed in each group was dramatically different (84 [8 percent] in the cfDNA group versus 751 [77 percent] in the no cfDNA group). Seven of 751 patients (0.93 percent) in the invasive testing group who underwent an invasive procedure had a miscarriage versus none of the 84 patients who had an invasive procedure performed after a positive cfDNA test result; however, there was no significant difference between groups in overall miscarriage rates before 24 weeks (0.8 percent for both groups). A major limitation of the trial was that patient compliance with the study protocol differed dramatically: 99 percent of the individuals allocated to cfDNA screening complied while only 74 percent complied with immediate invasive testing. In addition, the trial was underpowered to identify the procedure-related risk of invasive testing (approximately 0.2 percent) cited in large contemporary observational studies.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h2">Screen-positive integrated test results</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Defining screen-positive</strong> – A positive test result means the patient's risk of having a baby with Down syndrome is greater than a specified cut-off level; it does not provide a definitive diagnosis of Down syndrome. The cut-off chosen for screen-positive in the integrated test is often higher than that of the combined or quadruple test in order to obtain this test's low FPR while still maintaining a high detection rate (DR). A typical cut-off for the integrated test is a midpregnancy risk of Down syndrome of ≥1 in 100. This cut-off is associated with an FPR of 1 to 2 percent and odds of Down syndrome among the screen-positive individuals is approximately 1 in 5 to 1 in 10  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54782" href="/d/graphic/54782.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Counseling and management</strong> – The same counseling issues that apply to patients with first-trimester screen-positive results are applicable to those with a screen-positive integrated test result, except that amniocentesis is the diagnostic test offered instead of CVS since the screening result is provided in the early second trimester. Alternatively, as discussed above, they may choose to undergo secondary screening using a maternal plasma-based test for cfDNA. Although not diagnostic, the high sensitivity and specificity of this test will reassure many of these patients and allow them to avoid the risk associated with an invasive diagnostic test.

The single false negative case was screen-positive for trisomy 21 [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Thus, screening identified 91 percent of the 11 cases of trisomy 18, with a false-positive rate (FPR) of 2 percent using a risk cut-off of 1 in 150. Of course, due to the high spontaneous loss rate in affected pregnancies, some missed cases might spontaneously abort and never be identified as a false negative. In the FASTER trial, 9 of 15 (60 percent) of trisomy 18 cases were identified using a similar first-trimester algorithm, at a 0.1 percent FPR [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When screening for trisomy 18, it is appropriate to keep the FPR very low (less than 0.5 percent) so that only a small number of very high-risk individuals will be offered invasive diagnostic testing to detect a fetal abnormality that is often spontaneously lost (72 percent frequency of miscarriage or stillbirth between 12 weeks and term [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]). If the FPR is kept too low, the detection rate (DR) will also be reduced but many cases will be detected sonographically in the second trimester (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/447.html" rel="external">"Sonographic findings associated with fetal aneuploidy", section on 'Trisomy 18 (Edward syndrome)'</a>).

The risk of a trisomy 18 pregnancy among screen-positive individuals was 1 in 4. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The addition of NT to a trisomy 18 screening algorithm (full integrated test) will further improve the performance of the test.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H808827605"><span class="h2">Additional findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The presence of anatomic findings suggestive of trisomy 18 on ultrasound examination is highly dependent upon gestational age and most reliable at ≥20 weeks of gestation (DR 93 versus 76 percent at &lt;20 weeks [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]). Thus, a scan at 19 to 20 weeks is a practical approach. Nearly all cases of trisomy 18 will have some ultrasound finding, but a portion of these will be only a "soft marker" that is also commonly seen in unaffected pregnancies.

Thus, there is no need for a special screening program for trisomy 13. Most will be identified as being positive for trisomy 18, with a similarly poor prognosis. In one series of 26 ongoing pregnancies with trisomy 13, there were 12 intrauterine deaths (46.2 percent) [<a href="#rid46">46</a>].
