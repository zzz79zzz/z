ATI should be considered for patients with predicted difficulty with airway management or who may not tolerate the apneic phase following neuromuscular paralysis.</p><p>This topic will discuss patient preparation and techniques for ATI. Approach to the management of the difficult airway, including the decision to perform awake intubation, is discussed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/275.html" rel="external">"Approach to the difficult airway in adults for emergency medicine and critical care"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90615.html" rel="external">"Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H142322012"><span class="h1">DECISION TO PERFORM AWAKE INTUBATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Tracheal intubation is typically performed in an unconscious patient (ie, after receiving an induction dose of an anesthetic agent). Awake tracheal intubation (ATI) should be considered in patients with predicted difficulty with airway management, and in other patients who would benefit from maintaining spontaneous ventilation, intrinsic airway tone, or airway protective reflexes until an endotracheal tube is placed and mechanical ventilation is started [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. ATI should also be considered in patients who are at risk for cardiovascular decompensation with administration of induction agents, particularly in the emergency department or in the intensive care unit (ICU).</p><p>The decisions to perform ATI for anesthesia and in the emergency department or the ICU are discussed separately, and appear in the 2022 American Society of Anesthesiologists guidelines for difficult airway management [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], the 2021 Canadian Airway Focus Group guidelines [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], and in difficult airway algorithms  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef134460" href="/d/graphic/134460.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef140479" href="/d/graphic/140479.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90615.html" rel="external">"Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults", section on 'Awake intubation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/275.html" rel="external">"Approach to the difficult airway in adults for emergency medicine and critical care", section on 'Decision to perform awake intubation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>ATI is distinct from an awake flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopic airway examination performed as part of a difficult airway assessment (eg, suspected laryngeal mass) or in a patient unlikely to need tracheal intubation, which is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/275.html" rel="external">"Approach to the difficult airway in adults for emergency medicine and critical care", section on 'Awake airway examination'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1160039774"><span class="h1">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The absolute contraindication to awake tracheal intubation (ATI) is patient refusal despite explanation of the benefits and risks of the procedure. We avoid ATI in the following as it may be difficult, impossible, or ultimately less safe than a well-prepared rapid sequence intubation with a rigid laryngoscope and clear backup plans for rescue oxygenation:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients who require immediate intubation – When there is little or no time to perform ATI (eg, profound uncorrectable worsening hypoxemia or rapidly progressive upper airway swelling), the "forced to act" principle is invoked [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In this situation, a rapid sequence intubation (RSI; also called rapid sequence induction and intubation [RSII]) should be performed instead of ATI, despite anticipated anatomic challenges, as it offers the best opportunity to secure the airway immediately [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients who are uncooperative or combative</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with local anesthetic allergy</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with excessive airway bleeding or secretions, which may obscure the view during laryngoscopy</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lack of availability of a clinician experienced in awake intubation or the necessary equipment</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3965288458"><span class="h1">CHOOSING THE APPROACH</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1497295301"><span class="h2">Visualization device</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Awake tracheal intubation (ATI) is usually performed with either a flexible intubating scope or a video laryngoscope (VL). Awake direct laryngoscopy and blind intubation are very rarely used and are not described here.</p><p>The choice of intubating device is based on patient factors, clinician expertise, and availability of equipment. Neither flexible scope intubation nor VL is successful 100 percent of the time; clinicians should maintain skills in using both devices for ATI. This is particularly important for flexible scope intubation since use of a flexible intubating scope for airway management is less common. Examples of considerations when choosing the intubation device include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Flexible scope intubation is used for nasal intubation and may be preferred for oral intubation in patients with very restricted mouth opening, large oral or hypopharyngeal masses, or fixed flexion deformity of the neck.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>VL intubation may be preferred in patients with airway bleeding. Conventional blade VLs (eg, Macintosh style blade) may be particularly useful because they allow direct laryngoscopy if the camera is obscured by blood.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Awake VL intubation typically requires more complete anesthesia (nerve block or topical) or a deeper degree of sedation compared with ATI with a flexible intubating scope [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. In patients with a strong gag reflex, glossopharyngeal nerve blocks may facilitate awake VL intubation.</p><p></p><p>Reported success rates and adverse events are similar after ATI with VL compared with flexible intubating scope:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ATI for anesthesia </strong>–<strong> </strong>Reported success rates are high for ATI with both VL and with flexible intubating scope for anesthesia. In a 2018 meta-analysis of 8 trials (429 patients) that randomly assigned patients with known or predicted airway difficulty to use of VL versus flexible intubating scope for awake oral or nasal intubation for elective surgery, the rates of first attempt success, failure of intubation with the initial technique, and patient satisfaction were similar in the two groups [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Intubation success was &gt;96 percent with the first used device whether VL or flexible scope was used first. Limited adverse events were reported; the incidence of hoarseness or sore throat and oxygen desaturation were similar in the two groups.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ATI in the emergency department (ED) </strong>–<strong> </strong>Data are limited regarding devices used for ATI in the ED. In a multi-center ED registry (the National Emergency Airway Registry [NEAR]), ATI (defined as an intubation attempt after either topical anesthesia alone or topical anesthesia combined with sedation) was performed in fewer than 0.5 percent of all intubations [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Flexible scopes were used in the majority of ATIs (78 percent). The overall first attempt success rate was 85 percent; all patients were ultimately intubated, with one patient requiring a surgical airway. For patients intubated with a flexible scope, first attempt success was greater with nasal compared with oral intubation (91 versus 73 percent). The first attempt was successful in 89 percent of patients intubated with a VL. Conclusions are limited by the small number of patients intubated awake.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3505073086"><span class="h2">Nasal versus oral route</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We prefer the oral route for flexible scope intubation unless the patient has trismus or an obstructive lesion of the oral cavity. The choice between nasal and oral intubation is usually dictated by clinical circumstances and the visualization equipment (ie, VL is always oral route). This choice for flexible scope intubation is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89917.html" rel="external">"Flexible scope intubation for anesthesia", section on 'Overview'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H767826237"><span class="h1">PREPARATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1213916962"><span class="h2">Checklists</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Awake tracheal intubation (ATI) requires careful planning and diligent preparation.

This will decrease the risk of cognitive overload and allow the primary operator to focus on the ATI procedure. If a flexible intubating scope is being used, ideally an assistant who is familiar with the equipment should be present. The assistant, if available, can facilitate the provider's access to the equipment as needed. Prior to starting the procedure, individual roles for the team members should be assigned, communicated, and confirmed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1152179490"><span class="h1">PATIENT PREPARATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Thoroughly informing the patient and securing patient cooperation maximizes the chance of a successful awake tracheal intubation (ATI).

Even small amounts of secretions can impair airway visualization by a flexible intubating scope or video laryngoscope (VL). Secretions can also decrease the efficacy of topical local anesthetics [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. We administer glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intravenously (IV) 15 to 30 minutes before beginning the procedure if time permits [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. We do not delay applying topical anesthesia if glycopyrrolate is not readily available and do not use glycopyrrolate if time is limited.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H216025892"><span class="h2">Nasal vasoconstrictors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prior to awake nasal intubation, we suggest applying a topical vasoconstrictor (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10186" href="/d/drug information/10186.html" rel="external">oxymetazoline</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9768" href="/d/drug information/9768.html" rel="external">phenylephrine</a>) to the nasal passages to reduce the risk of bleeding and enlarge the caliber of the nasal passages [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. We apply nasal vasoconstrictors prior to oral intubation as well if nasal intubation would be a viable backup plan should oral intubation fail.</p><p>Commercially available nasal decongestants containing either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10186" href="/d/drug information/10186.html" rel="external">oxymetazoline</a> 0.05% or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9768" href="/d/drug information/9768.html" rel="external">phenylephrine</a> 0.5% may be used to constrict the vessels of the nasal mucosa. Some authors of this topic prefer oxymetazoline because it may be a more potent vasoconstrictor compared with phenylephrine [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. We administer two sprays of oxymetazoline or phenylephrine to each nostril for vasoconstriction at the same time as antisialagogue administration. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89917.html" rel="external">"Flexible scope intubation for anesthesia", section on 'Nasal preparation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1455055500"><span class="h2">Aspiration prophylaxis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients at high risk of aspiration  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef98506" href="/d/graphic/98506.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), we take measures to prevent aspiration or mitigate risk should aspiration occur, such as the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Especially in a patient with a full stomach, ensure a smooth course, avoiding gagging, coughing, and vomiting. Whenever possible the intubation should not be rushed, and adequate time should be allowed for optimal anesthetic effect.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Position the patient head up, either sitting or ramped.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If time permits, pre-medicate with antacids (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8436" href="/d/drug information/8436.html" rel="external">famotidine</a> 20 mg IV, sodium citrate 30 mL orally) and/or prokinetic agent (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9642" href="/d/drug information/9642.html" rel="external">metoclopramide</a> 10 mg IV). For maximal effect, famotidine and metoclopramide should be given at least 60 minutes prior and sodium citrate can be given just prior to induction. Premedication for aspiration prophylaxis is not routinely performed in the emergency department (ED) or intensive care unit, as supporting evidence is limited; the rationale and evidence are discussed separately [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94214.html" rel="external">"Rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) for anesthesia", section on 'Premedication'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/264.html" rel="external">"Procedural sedation in adults in the emergency department: General considerations, preparation, monitoring, and mitigating complications", section on 'Aspiration'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Maintain airway protective reflexes. Airway anesthesia can compromise airway protective reflexes. In patients at high risk of aspiration, we avoid laryngeal and subglottic anesthesia until immediately prior to delivering the endotracheal tube. During flexible scope intubation, this can be accomplished by spraying local anesthetic solution through the flexible intubating scope as it is advanced during the process of laryngoscopy and intubation.

Therefore, both tube positioning and ventilation must be confirmed as follows (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/260.html" rel="external">"Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults", section on 'Confirming proper tracheal tube placement'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/273.html" rel="external">"Carbon dioxide monitoring (capnography)", section on 'Verification of ETT placement'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Visualization</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>During flexible scope intubation, after the ETT is in place, tracheal rings should be visualized beyond the tip of the ETT prior to removing the scope.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>During laryngoscopy, the ETT should be seen passing though the vocal cords.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">AND</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Capnography</strong> – At least seven exhalations with a consistent end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) level must be verified to rule out an unrecognized misplaced intubation in the esophagus.</p><p></p><p>Once a two-point check to confirm successful awake tracheal intubation is completed, general anesthesia can be safely induced or further sedative agents can be safely administered.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2253622351"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT OF UNSUCCESSFUL OR FAILED INTUBATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Awake tracheal intubation (ATI) has a very high success rate without major differences between the different techniques, routes of intubation, or specialty of airway operator.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Unsuccessful intubation attempt</strong> – An unsuccessful attempt is defined as an unplanned withdrawal of the flexible intubating scope, laryngoscope, or endotracheal tube (ETT) from the airway [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Decision to perform awake intubation'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90615.html" rel="external">"Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults", section on 'Awake intubation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/275.html" rel="external">"Approach to the difficult airway in adults for emergency medicine and critical care", section on 'Awake techniques'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Contraindications and precautions</strong> – The only absolute contraindication to ATI is patient refusal. We avoid ATI in a patient who requires rapid, immediate intubation, is uncooperative, has a local anesthetic allergy, or has excessive airway bleeding or secretions. (See <a class="local">'Contraindications and precautions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Choosing the approach</strong> – The decision to perform ATI with a flexible intubating scope or a video laryngoscope (VL) depends on patient factors, clinician expertise, and availability of equipment. VL is preferred in a patient with active airway bleeding and flexible scope intubation is preferred in a patient with restricted mouth opening. We prefer the oral rather than nasal route for flexible scope intubation unless the patient has trismus or an obstructive lesion of the oral cavity. (See <a class="local">'Choosing the approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient preparation</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Antisialagogues</strong> – For patients who undergo ATI, we suggest administering <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8496" href="/d/drug information/8496.html" rel="external">glycopyrrolate</a> (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). We administer 0.2 mg intravenously 15 to 30 minutes prior to intubation. This dries airway secretions and may improve visualization. (See <a class="local">'Antisialagogues'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Nasal vasoconstrictors</strong> – For patients who will undergo nasal ATI as the initial or backup plan should oral intubation fail, we suggest applying a topical nasal vasoconstrictor (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>)to reduce the risk of bleeding and enlarge the caliber of the nasal passages. Reasonable options are <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10186" href="/d/drug information/10186.html" rel="external">oxymetazoline</a> 0.05% or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9768" href="/d/drug information/9768.html" rel="external">phenylephrine</a> 0.5%, two sprays to each nostril. (See <a class="local">'Nasal vasoconstrictors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Other measures</strong> – These include aspiration prophylaxis for patients at high risk of aspiration  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef98506" href="/d/graphic/98506.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), cardiopulmonary monitoring, and providing supplemental oxygen. (See <a class="local">'Aspiration prophylaxis'</a> above and <a class="local">'Monitoring'</a> above and <a class="local">'Supplemental oxygen'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Airway anesthesia</strong> – The airway must be anesthetized for awake intubation. For patients undergoing ATI, we suggest topical airway anesthesia with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> rather than other agents or forms of anesthesia (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). We use nebulized 4% lidocaine with low oxygen flow rates (2 to 4 L/min). A reasonable alternative is atomized 4% lidocaine to the oropharynx and hypopharynx with a malleable laryngotracheal mucosal atomization (LTA) device followed by topical 5% lidocaine ointment applied to the back of the tongue using a tongue depressor. (See <a class="local">'Topical anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If performing a flexible scope intubation, we anesthetize the larynx with the "spray-as-you-go" method. If performing VL, we anesthetize the larynx by applying local anesthetic with an LTA device.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Alternative/adjunct nerve blocks and percutaneous topical anesthesia techniques include the following (see <a class="local">'Choice of technique'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Transtracheal block (see <a class="local">'Trachea (transtracheal injection)'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Sphenopalatine and anterior ethmoidal nerve blocks (see <a class="local">'Nerve blocks for nasal cavity'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Glossopharyngeal nerve block (see <a class="local">'Glossopharyngeal nerve block'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Superior laryngeal nerve block (see <a class="local">'Superior laryngeal nerve block'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sedation</strong> – Sedation should not be used to compensate for inadequate airway anesthesia. The sedation plan should be individualized based on the indication for intubation, the patient's ability to cooperate, and clinician familiarity with agents. Options include opioids, benzodiazepines, alpha-2 agonists, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8588" href="/d/drug information/8588.html" rel="external">ketamine</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8428" href="/d/drug information/8428.html" rel="external">etomidate</a>, alone or in combination. (See <a class="local">'Sedation/analgesia'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94529.html" rel="external">"Monitored anesthesia care in adults", section on 'Drugs used for sedation and analgesia for monitored anesthesia care'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/139217.html" rel="external">"Procedural sedation in adults in the emergency department: Medication selection, dosing, and discharge criteria", section on 'Medications'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Procedure</strong> – Techniques for awake flexible scope intubation and awake VL are similar to those in an unconscious patient, with some minor differences described above. (See <a class="local">'Procedure'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89917.html" rel="external">"Flexible scope intubation for anesthesia", section on 'Technique'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/107795.html" rel="external">"Video laryngoscopes and optical stylets for airway management for anesthesia in adults", section on 'Videolaryngoscopy technique'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Confirming endotracheal tube position </strong>–<strong> </strong>A two-point check that includes visualization and capnography must be used to verify the correct placement of an endotracheal tube.
