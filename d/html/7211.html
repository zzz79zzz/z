         Acute (AKI) or subacute kidney injury in patients with multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies results from a variety of mechanisms. These include light chain cast nephropathy, hypercalcemia, nephrotoxic agents (eg, radiocontrast, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), and, infrequently, hyperviscosity syndrome, severe hyperuricemia, and monoclonal immunoglobulin-related glomerulopathies (such as type 1 cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis, proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits [PGNMID], C3 glomerulopathy with monoclonal gammopathy, and immunotactoid glomerulopathy). Specific treatment is directed at the cause of AKI [
         <a href="#rid3">

         , unless contraindicated (eg, heart failure or persistent oligoanuric AKI). This decreases the light chain concentration within the tubular lumen and minimizes light chain precipitation. If volume depletion is clinically present, we provide isotonic fluids for initial volume replacement. In the absence of (or following the correction of) volume depletion, we administer one-half isotonic

         at an initial rate of 150 mL/hour, adjusted to maintain the urine output at approximately 100 to 150 mL/hour (approximately 3 L/day). Although debated, volume replacement with isotonic

         The treatment of light chain cast nephropathy consists of anti-myeloma therapy, fluid management, and, in patients with severe AKI, dialysis. Extracorporeal methods to remove serum free light chains (SFLCs), such as plasmapheresis and high-cutoff dialysis, can be used as adjunctive therapy. The benefits of extracorporeal light chain removal remain undetermined; however, the majority of UpToDate authors of this topic support its use. In patients who are unresponsive to therapy despite adequate suppression and removal of SFLCs, a kidney biopsy (if not yet performed) is typically performed to investigate causes other than light chain cast nephropathy and may be useful to evaluate the probability of renal response [

          bortezomib

         , and dexamethasone, or CyBorD) as rapidly as possible to decrease light chain production (with the possible exception of patients who are in preterminal stages of disease) [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>
         ]. The balance between efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy should be carefully considered in patients with light chain cast nephropathy, who are often older and present with other comorbidities. In one randomized, controlled trial, the bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (CyBorD) triplet did not improve renal response rates compared with the bortezomib-dexamethasone doublet in patients with initial light chain cast nephropathy who did not require dialysis. However, there was a trend for higher probability of renal response with CyBorD in those with severe AKI (stage 3). Thus, a triplet regimen appears desirable in young, fit patients, particularly those presenting with severe AKI. In older and frail patients, the doublet bortezomib-dexamethasone regimen remains the standard first-line treatment [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Bortezomib can be administered to patients with kidney function impairment, including those with severe kidney function impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;30 mL/min per 1.73 m
         <sup>

         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ] and does not require renal dose adjustment. Although other proteasome inhibitors (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="86042" href="/z/d/drug information/86042.html" rel="external">
          carfilzomib

         ) are available for the treatment of multiple myeloma, we do not routinely use these agents to treat light chain cast nephropathy given that there is less robust evidence on the use and safety of these agents in patients with underlying kidney function impairment. In addition, the use of carfilzomib has been associated with AKI and thrombotic microangiopathy in some patients. (See

          bortezomib

         is given at a dose of 40 mg on days 1 through 4, 8, and 15. This is different than the usual weekly administration of these agents in patients with multiple myeloma without AKI. However, beginning with the second cycle, these agents are administered as they are in patients with multiple myeloma who do not have AKI.

Hematopoietic cell transplantation may be performed among patients with all stages of kidney disease, even among patients on dialysis, although morbidity and mortality rates increase with the severity of kidney failure [

         Intravenous fluid therapy, with the goal of attaining a daily urine output of approximately 3 liters, should be provided to all patients with light chain cast nephropathy unless contraindicated (eg, heart failure or persistent oligoanuric AKI). This will decrease the light chain concentration within the tubular lumen and minimize light chain precipitation.

         In the absence of (or following the correction of) volume depletion, a reasonable regimen is the administration of one-half isotonic

         at an initial rate of 150 mL/hour, adjusted to maintain the urine output at approximately 100 to 150 mL/hour (approximately 3 L/day). Alternatively, isotonic

          sodium bicarbonate

         can be administered, particularly in patients with acidic urine; achieving a urine pH &gt;7.0 may decrease the precipitation of monoclonal light chains. Either of these regimens require careful monitoring and may require modification in patients who cannot excrete the administered fluid because of kidney or heart failure. A loop diuretic should be reserved for patients who develop hypervolemia. Loop diuretics should be used judiciously since there is some concern that they may promote cast formation [

         Until more evidence is available, conventional dialysis should be initiated for the usual indications (eg, fluid overload, hyperkalemia, and uremia) and not for the removal of free light chains. Among patients with AKI who require dialysis, hemodialysis is the preferred modality. Peritoneal dialysis is an option for patients who develop end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and require chronic dialysis. (See

         The removal of nephrotoxic free light chains can be enhanced with the use of extracorporeal methods such as plasmapheresis and high-cutoff dialysis (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59043" href="/z/d/graphic/59043.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). High-cutoff dialysis employs dialyzers with pore sizes that are significantly larger than those of standard high-flux dialyzers and which permit the efficient passage of proteins as large as 25 to 50 kilodaltons. The larger pore size allows a higher rate of SFLC removal [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. High-cutoff dialyzers are not commercially available in the United States but are available in Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
         If used, extracorporeal free light chain removal should be performed in conjunction with bortezomib- and dexamethasone-containing chemotherapy, which is needed to reduce the rate of light chain production, and
         <strong>
          should not
         </strong>
         be performed without chemotherapy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6647.html" rel="external">

         The benefit of extracorporeal free light chain removal in patients with AKI has
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         been established. Thus, the use of extracorporeal methods in the treatment of light chain cast nephropathy remains controversial, and some clinicians do not use these therapies in this setting.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, given a
         <strong>
          possible
         </strong>
         reduction in dialysis dependency among survivors, the majority of authors of this topic suggest the use of extracorporeal light chain removal, using plasmapheresis or high-cutoff hemodialysis, in individuals with AKI who have a diagnosis of light chain cast nephropathy. The authors recognize that the strength of this recommendation is weak.
        </p>
        <p>
         If access to both plasmapheresis and high-cutoff hemodialysis is available, three authors (S.V.R., N.L., and F.B.) would prefer to use high-cutoff hemodialysis, whereas one author (A.K.) would prefer to use plasmapheresis. (See

         The typical plasmapheresis regimen for light chain cast nephropathy is five to seven exchanges within 7 to 10 days, using albumin as the replacement fluid. However, the duration of plasmapheresis should be guided by SFLC levels, which we measure daily. The plasmapheresis prescription is presented elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7941.html" rel="external">
          "Therapeutic apheresis (plasma exchange or cytapheresis): Indications and technology", section on 'Technology'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The goal of plasmapheresis is a 50 to 60 percent or greater reduction in the pathogenic SFLC level; this degree of light chain reduction is associated with higher probability of recovery of kidney function [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,18
         </a>
         ]. If the SFLC level is not reduced to this degree after five to seven plasmapheresis treatments, it is likely that the concomitantly administered chemotherapy is not effectively controlling light chain production. Alternative treatments for multiple myeloma are warranted in such patients. Some patients are dependent upon plasmapheresis to lower SFLC levels; in these patients, the decision to continue plasmapheresis is based upon the availability of other chemotherapeutic options. If other treatment options are available, we continue plasmapheresis; otherwise, we stop plasmapheresis.
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients who also require dialysis on the same day, dialysis should be performed after plasmapheresis. Dialysis corrects the alkalemia that can develop among patients receiving citrate anticoagulation with plasmapheresis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Dialysis'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         If plasmapheresis is initiated following a kidney biopsy, there is a potential risk of postbiopsy bleeding from apheresis-induced removal of coagulation factors. Partial replacement of the fluid removed with fresh frozen plasma (FFP; 1 to 2 liters toward the end of the apheresis) rather than albumin should attenuate the coagulopathy. Replacement with FFP may also be reasonable for the final treatment prior to catheter removal. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7941.html" rel="external">

         As mentioned above, high-cutoff dialyzers are not available in the United States but are available in Europe. Clinicians who have access to high-cutoff dialyzers and wish to perform extracorporal light chain removal with high-cutoff hemodialysis should use the regimen described in the Studies in Patients with Multiple Myeloma and Renal Failure Due to Myeloma Cast Nephropathy (MYRE) trial [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ] (see
         <a class="local">
          'Efficacy studies'
         </a>
         below). In this randomized multicenter trial, patients with light chain cast nephropathy and severe AKI who were treated with high-cutoff hemodialysis received eight five-hour sessions (blood flow rate ≥250 mL/min and dialysate flow rate ≥500 mL/min) over 10 days. If needed, patients received three additional weekly sessions until completion of three cycles of chemotherapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients treated with high-cutoff hemodialysis may develop hypoalbuminemia due to losses of albumin through the larger membrane pores. Thus, a serum albumin level should be obtained at the beginning of each dialysis session, and, if low, intravenous albumin should be administered following completion of dialysis.
        </p>
        <p>
         As with plasmapheresis, the goal of high-cutoff hemodialysis is to obtain the best possible (50 to 60 percent or greater) reduction in the pathogenic SFLC level. If the SFLC level is not reduced to this degree after eight high-cutoff hemodialysis treatments, it is likely that the concomitantly administered chemotherapy is not effectively controlling light chain production, and alternative therapies may be warranted. In the MYRE trial, achievement of a pathogenic SFLC level less than 500 mg/L after the first cycle of chemotherapy was an independent predictor of hemodialysis independence [

The patients were randomly assigned to plasmapheresis (for five consecutive days) together with glucocorticoids, cytotoxic drugs, and hemodialysis (if required) or to glucocorticoids, cytotoxic drugs, and peritoneal dialysis (if required). Among the 15 patients assigned to receive plasmapheresis, 13 (87 percent) recovered kidney function (most to a plasma creatinine concentration of &lt;2.5 mg/dL [&lt;220 micromol/L]), whereas improvement occurred in only 2 of 14 controls (14 percent), with most patients requiring chronic dialysis.

Only 78 percent of the patients had increased free light chains in the plasma, and only 61 percent had light chains in the urine; relatively few patients had a tissue diagnosis of cast nephropathy by biopsy. The potential benefits of plasmapheresis may also have been obscured since more patients in the control group received a dexamethasone-containing regimen, which leads to faster reduction in light chain production than

All patients received bortezomib-dexamethasone and were randomly assigned to receive intensive hemodialysis (eight five-hour sessions over 10 days) with either a high-cutoff dialyzer (46 patients) or a conventional high-flux dialyzer (48 patients). Although high-cutoff hemodialysis produced a greater reduction in SFLCs (68 versus 31 percent) after the first hemodialysis session, there was no significant difference in the primary endpoint of hemodialysis independence at three months between the two groups (41 versus 33 percent for high-cutoff and conventional hemodialysis, respectively). At 6 and 12 months, however, rates of hemodialysis independence were higher among patients in the high-cutoff group compared with those in the conventional hemodialysis group (57 versus 35 percent at 6 months and 61 versus 38 percent at 12 months). There was no difference in mortality at 12 months between the two groups, and both groups had similar rates of hemodialysis-related and chemotherapy-related adverse effects.

         Results from a second trial of high-cutoff dialysis (European Trial of Free Light Chain Removal by Extended Hemodialysis [EuLITE]) of 90 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and light chain cast nephropathy requiring acute dialysis have found no short- or long-term benefits with high-cutoff dialysis [

At three months, there was no difference in kidney function recovery between the two groups (56 versus 51 percent for high-cutoff and conventional hemodialysis, respectively), and patients in the high-cutoff group had a higher rate of lung infections and mortality. Among patients who recovered kidney function, estimated GFR at two years was comparable between the two groups.

         These trials are small in size and have produced conflicting results. It is also important to note that there were significant differences in the methodology, dialysis procedure, and treatment of the patients, with more intensive chemotherapy used in EuLITE. Thus, additional studies are needed to clarify the role of extracorporeal removal of free light chains in patients with light chain cast nephropathy. Since the overall risks are low and potential benefits in terms of reversing kidney dysfunction are high, the results of the MYRE trial support our suggestion to perform extracorporeal light chain removal, using either plasmapheresis or high-cutoff dialysis, in patients with light chain cast nephropathy.

         High intake of fluids to prevent volume depletion and maintain a high urine output (approximately 3 L/day), unless contraindicated. The goals of fluid therapy are to decrease the light chain concentration within the tubular lumen and to produce a high urine flow rate to minimize light chain precipitation. Alkaline fluids may be considered in patients with acidic urine. (See

         With directed and supportive therapies, reported rates of improvement in kidney function in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma treated with bortezomib-based chemotherapy range between 50 and 80 percent [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-8,20

         Recovery of kidney function with therapy appears to have prognostic value. In one study of patients with multiple myeloma and AKI, patients with recovery of kidney function had a longer median survival compared with patients who did not recover kidney function (28 versus 4 months) [

         A cyclized peptide designed to interfere with the binding of immunoglobulin light chain to Tamm-Horsfall protein was successfully tested in animals [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. This cyclic peptide mimics the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) on the immunoglobulin light chain and competitively inhibits the binding of Tamm-Horsfall protein to the immunoglobulin light chain. In animal models, coadministration of the cyclized peptide with monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains capable of causing light chain cast nephropathy prevented the development of AKI, which occurred in the vehicle-treated animals. In the rescue experiment, injection of the cyclized peptide four hours after the immunoglobulin light chains provided protection from AKI. Experiments with longer duration between immunoglobulin light chains and cyclized peptide are needed to confirm its efficacy in the treatment of light chain cast nephropathy. However, the concept represents a new paradigm in the treatment of immunoglobulin light chain-related kidney diseases.

         Optimal therapy is uncertain in slowly progressive disease that appears to be due to light chain cast nephropathy. Plasmapheresis plus chemotherapy has been used in uncontrolled studies, with some patients who have preserved urine output showing improvement in kidney function [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,21

         Patients who develop irreversible CKD from multiple myeloma-related kidney disease should be managed similarly to patients with CKD from other causes. Patients with CKD resulting from light chain cast nephropathy should undergo routine monitoring of serum free light chain (SFLC) concentrations since recurrent cast nephropathy may occur in the setting of rising SFLC levels. Issues related to the general management of complications of CKD are discussed elsewhere. (See

         Albuminuria or nephrotic syndrome in patients with multiple myeloma or other monoclonal gammopathies can be caused by a number of different mechanisms, including amyloidosis, monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease (MIDD), and, less commonly, monoclonal cryoglobulinemia, proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits (PGNMID), C3 glomerulopathy, and immunotactoid glomerulopathy. A kidney biopsy is required to establish a diagnosis.

         The treatment of patients with albuminuria or nephrotic syndrome from immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis targets the underlying plasma cell clone, aiming to prevent further production and renal deposition of amyloid protein. We avoid the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), particularly in patients who have hypotension due to cardiac involvement or autonomic dysregulation. Diuretics should be used with caution in patients with volume overload due to the risk of precipitating hypotension. The specific treatment of immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis is discussed elsewhere. (See

         Monoclonal (type I) cryoglobulinemia is a rare cause of glomerular disease among patients with multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies. The treatment of these patients is directed at eradicating the clonal population of plasma cells or B cells that is responsible for monoclonal cryoglobulin production. (See

         Given the rarity of these disorders, there have been no randomized trials to determine the optimal approach to therapy, and most treatment recommendations are based upon clinical opinion and experience. In general, treatment of these disorders should be primarily directed at eliminating the clonal proliferation of plasma cells or B cells that is responsible for producing the pathogenic monoclonal protein.

         – Kidney disease is a common complication in patients with multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies. A wide range of kidney manifestations and pathologies involving different mechanisms have been described with these disorders. Kidney injury most often occurs in patients with a high tumor burden and can evolve as either an acute or chronic disorder.

         Dialysis should be initiated for the usual indications (eg, fluid overload, hyperkalemia, and uremia) and not for the removal of free light chains. Among patients with AKI who require dialysis, hemodialysis is the preferred modality. Peritoneal dialysis is an option for patients who develop end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and require chronic dialysis. (See
         <a class="local">

         We suggest the use of extracorporeal light chain removal using plasmapheresis or, where available, high-cutoff hemodialysis (

         <strong>
          possible
         </strong>
         reduction in dialysis dependency among survivors. However, the use of extracorporeal methods in the treatment of light chain cast nephropathy remains controversial, and some clinicians do not use these therapies in this setting. The suggested plasmapheresis and high-cutoff-dialysis regimens and therapeutic goals are presented in detail above. Plasmapheresis and high-cutoff hemodialysis must always be used with early institution of regimens designed to reduce light chain production, most commonly bortezomib-based regimens. (See

         For patients at high risk for light chain cast nephropathy, we usually treat with intravenous fluids, unless contraindicated, to prevent volume depletion and maintain a high urine output (approximately 3 L/day). We also treat with bortezomib- and dexamethasone-based chemotherapy (eg,

          Albuminuria or nephrotic syndrome
         </strong>
         – Proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome in patients with multiple myeloma or other monoclonal gammopathies can be caused by a number of different mechanisms, including amyloidosis, monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease (MIDD), and, less commonly, monoclonal cryoglobulinemia, proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits (PGNMID), C3 glomerulopathy with monoclonal gammopathy, and immunotactoid glomerulopathy. A kidney biopsy is required to establish a diagnosis. Treatment of these disorders should be directed at eliminating the clonal proliferation of plasma cells or B cells that is responsible for producing the pathogenic monoclonal protein. In general, this involves the administration of chemotherapeutic agents. (See
         <a class="local">

          Electrolyte abnormalities
         </strong>
         – Electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia) in patients with light chain proximal tubulopathy should be managed with oral or intravenous supplementation depending upon the severity of the deficiency. Patients with evidence of a renal tubular acidosis should receive alkali therapy (eg,
