Its euphorigenic, sedative, and analgesic properties are primarily due to one cannabinoid: delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC concentration is commonly used as a measure of cannabis potency [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Cannabis withdrawal is manifested by a constellation of signs and symptoms occurring within one week after abrupt reduction or cessation of heavy and prolonged cannabis use. The symptoms are nonspecific and may include sleeplessness, irritability, anxiety, and depressed mood. Symptoms can be disabling and can inhibit attempts to cut down or abstain from cannabis use.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of cannabis withdrawal are reviewed here. Other aspects of cannabis use are discussed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7796.html" rel="external">"Cannabis use disorder: Clinical features, screening, diagnosis, and treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7797.html" rel="external">"Cannabis use and disorder: Epidemiology, pharmacology, comorbidities, and adverse effects"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97099.html" rel="external">"Cannabis (marijuana): Acute intoxication"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97100.html" rel="external">"Synthetic cannabinoids: Acute intoxication"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4014703002"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are limited data on the prevalence of cannabis withdrawal, in part because of the lack of large-scale studies that attempt to correlate participants’ intensity of cannabis use with their withdrawal experience. Additionally, most published studies include data collected from recreational users a decade or more ago, when cannabis was consumed primarily by smoking and the potency (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] concentration) was approximately one-third that of currently available cannabis [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4048613799"><span class="h2">Prevalence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A meta-analysis of population-based and clinical (inpatient and outpatient) studies found a past-year prevalence of cannabis withdrawal syndrome (variously defined) of 31 percent (95% CI 27-36) among individuals with “regular” cannabis use or cannabis use disorder [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. As expected, lifetime prevalence was found to be substantially higher (76 percent; 95% CI 70-82) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>] and also varied broadly due to heterogeneity across studies [<a href="#rid3">3-7</a>].</p><p>Low-quality, cross-sectional data from samples of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="134930" href="/z/d/drug information/134930.html" rel="external">medical cannabis</a> users suggest that they experience cannabis withdrawal at roughly comparable rates as recreational users [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2136292129"><span class="h2">Risk factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>THC is the cannabinoid most strongly associated with cannabis withdrawal [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In contrast, abrupt cessation of oral cannabidiol (750 mg twice daily) is not associated with withdrawal symptoms [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>The primary risk factors for cannabis withdrawal are intensity (usually measured as frequency) and recency of cannabis use [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. For example, a meta-analysis found the past-year prevalence of cannabis withdrawal syndrome (variously defined in different studies) was significantly greater among daily cannabis users than among less-than-daily users (47 versus 23 percent) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. An observational study of 73 adults with moderate-severe cannabis use disorder who were admitted for 24 days of inpatient detoxification found a somewhat weak but statistically significant positive correlation between withdrawal severity (assessed with the Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist) and urine concentration of the major THC metabolite 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC (THC-COOH; r = 0.248, 95% CI 0.152-0.339) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of cannabis withdrawal syndrome does not vary significantly by age (adolescent to older adult), sex, or race/ethnicity [<a href="#rid3">3,13</a>]. In regard to gender, limited evidence from cross-sectional studies suggests that men and women may experience cannabis withdrawal differently, with women experiencing more mood and gastrointestinal symptoms and men experiencing more sleep disturbance [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>].</p><p>Twin studies suggest that genetics also play a role in susceptibility to cannabis withdrawal [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. There is inconsistent evidence as to whether individuals with mood, anxiety, or substance use disorders are at increased risk of cannabis withdrawal syndrome [<a href="#rid3">3,13</a>]. We are not aware of any studies evaluating the influence of cannabis route of administration on cannabis withdrawal syndrome in humans.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1133529617"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Phytocannabinoids are partial agonists at cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors, part of the body’s endogenous cannabinoid (endocannabinoid system). Studies in humans and animals have shown that down regulation of CB1 receptors occurs as the receptors adjust to the increased activation from heavy exposure to both endogenous and exogenous agonist [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Cessation of cannabis use results in a loss of exogenous agonist activation, leaving CB1 receptors in a hypoactive state that presumably mediates withdrawal symptoms. Over time, the receptors return to their normal precannabis exposure state (up-regulation). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97099.html" rel="external">"Cannabis (marijuana): Acute intoxication", section on 'Pharmacokinetics'</a>.)</p><p>Positron emission tomography studies find that chronic daily or almost daily cannabis smokers have 10 to 15 percent CB1 receptor down-regulation (reduced receptor density or reduced receptor binding potential) in many brain regions, especially the cingulate and temporal cortex, during the first 24 hours after last cannabis use [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. This down-regulation is normalized after four weeks of monitored abstinence. However, the temporal course of receptor normalization and its association with cannabis withdrawal symptoms remain unclear. Studies attempting to correlate receptor normalization with the time course of cannabis withdrawal symptoms have been heterogeneous and shown mixed results [<a href="#rid17">17-19</a>].</p><p>Synthetic cannabinoids have a variety of chemical structures that differ from those of plant-derived cannabinoids (phytocannabinoids). Additionally, they are more potent agonists at CB1 receptors than phytocannabinoids [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97100.html" rel="external">"Synthetic cannabinoids: Acute intoxication", section on 'Toxicity and pharmacology'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3171819295"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Symptoms of withdrawal from cannabis or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol are generally less severe and shorter lasting than those of withdrawal from synthetic cannabinoids.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3509840323"><span class="h2">Cannabis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cannabis withdrawal is manifested by a constellation of signs and symptoms occurring within one week after abrupt reduction or cessation of heavy and prolonged cannabis use. The symptoms of cannabis withdrawal range from very mild to more severe. Cannabis withdrawal has clinical significance when the symptoms are severe enough to be distressing, interfere with activities of daily living, or serve as negative reinforcement for continued abstinence [<a href="#rid4">4,21</a>].</p><p>In a national survey of 1527 cannabis users who reported at least three times per week use, the most common symptoms of withdrawal were sleep difficulty (14 percent), irritability or anger (14 percent), anxiety (13 percent), headache (12 percent), and depressed mood (11 percent) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Other symptoms such as restlessness, decreased appetite or weight loss, abdominal pain, shaking or tremors, sweating, and fever or chills have been described.</p><p>Disturbed sleep is one of the most common symptoms of cannabis withdrawal [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Most polysomnography studies during the first week of cannabis withdrawal find increased sleep onset latency and decreases in total sleep time, slow wave sleep, sleep efficiency, and rapid eye movement latency [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>].</p><p>Withdrawal from cannabis, unlike withdrawal from synthetic cannabinoids, is not generally associated with clinically significant cardiovascular changes or symptoms such as sympathetic autonomic hyperactivity. Two small (13 and 39 participants) prospective longitudinal inpatient studies of adult daily cannabis users had inconsistent findings [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. Both studies found no change in heart rate during early cannabis withdrawal, but one of the two studies found modest increases in blood pressure in 6 of the 13 participants [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3676593428"><span class="h2">Synthetic cannabinoids</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Abrupt cessation of synthetic cannabinoid use can give rise to clinically significant physiological withdrawal symptoms, such as sympathetic autonomic hyperactivity resulting in tachycardia, hypertension, and diaphoresis, seizures, and altered mental status (eg, psychosis, delirium) [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>].</p><p>While there are no systematic studies of synthetic cannabinoid withdrawal, a growing number of case series and case reports suggest that serious, often life-threatening, phenomena such as seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, kidney failure, delirium, and prolonged psychosis are not rare [<a href="#rid26">26,28,29</a>]. However, it is often difficult to distinguish which of these phenomena are due to the persisting effects of synthetic cannabis intoxication, in particular high-dose cannabis [<a href="#rid30">30</a>] and/or intravenous cannabis administration [<a href="#rid31">31</a>], or whether they arise as withdrawal symptoms with onset only after initiation of abstinence. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97100.html" rel="external">"Synthetic cannabinoids: Acute intoxication"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3203262529"><span class="h1">COURSE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most cannabis withdrawal symptoms appear 24 to 72 hours after cessation of use, reach peak intensity over the first week, and largely resolve after one to two weeks [<a href="#rid32">32,33</a>]. Sleep disturbances may last several weeks, although there appears to be substantial interindividual variation. Patients with moderate to severe withdrawal have a higher likelihood of relapse due to negative effects on sleep or daily functioning. </p><p>Withdrawal from synthetic cannabinoids may have a longer course, with severe psychiatric and medical disturbances persisting for weeks [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p>A prospective, 16-day longitudinal study of 39 adult, treatment-seeking, chronic, heavy cannabis users (daily use for six months to 30 years) admitted for inpatient detoxification found that all participants experienced cannabis withdrawal, assessed with a 12-item modified Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Cannabis withdrawal was:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Present on day 1</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reached peak intensity on day 4 (range day 1 to 8)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Declined substantially by day 16, resolving completely in many</p><p></p><p>Peak withdrawal intensity ranged from moderate (18 percent) to severe (41 percent).</p><p>A current or lifetime history of mood or anxiety disorder may affect the duration of cannabis withdrawal symptoms. In a prospective study of 50 young adults who achieved abstinence in outpatient treatment, a longer duration of severe cannabis withdrawal was experienced in those subjects with a current or lifetime mood or anxiety diagnosis than in those subjects without a current or lifetime diagnosis (significant reduction in symptom intensity over two weeks versus one week.) [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H120277589"><span class="h1">ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H140156782"><span class="h2">Observation/interview</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Otherwise unexplained mood changes, restlessness, sleep disturbance, decreased appetite or weight loss, or physical symptoms such as abdominal pain, muscle twitching, aches, or tremors should arouse suspicion of possible cannabis withdrawal in an individual who was recently a heavy cannabis user.</p><p>The patient should be asked about past and recent cannabis intake, in particular whether they have recently decreased or stopped use and the time of their last use in relation to symptom onset.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4031740429"><span class="h2">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision, (DSM-5-TR) diagnostic criteria for cannabis withdrawal are as follows [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A. Cessation of cannabis use that has been heavy and prolonged (ie, usually daily or almost daily use over a period of at least a few months).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>B.

The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2614854162"><span class="h2">Differential diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cannabis withdrawal symptoms are largely nonspecific, so they must be carefully distinguished from other withdrawal syndromes, especially tobacco [<a href="#rid36">36</a>], and from other psychiatric disorders (eg, generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder) that may produce similar symptoms. In all cases, the major distinguishing feature is the temporal association with abrupt cessation of chronic or heavy cannabis use and the gradual resolution of symptoms with increasing duration of abstinence.</p><p>Tobacco withdrawal may be particularly difficult to distinguish from cannabis withdrawal, as the symptoms overlap, and many cannabis users also use tobacco [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Small, open-label retrospective and prospective outpatient studies in adult, nontreatment-seeking daily cannabis and daily tobacco smokers find that the two withdrawal syndromes have comparable symptom profiles, intensities, and time courses [<a href="#rid36">36,38</a>]. These findings are confirmed by an outpatient, open-label study of 12 adult, nontreatment-seeking chronic daily or almost-daily users of cannabis and tobacco [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. This study reported similar withdrawal severity between the two substances; concurrent withdrawal from both was more severe than from either alone. (See <a class="local">'Cannabis and tobacco co-use'</a> below.)</p><p>Among adolescent girls, the triad of poor appetite, weight loss, and gastrointestinal symptoms associated with cannabis withdrawal may be misdiagnosed as an eating disorder [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3949635939"><span class="h2">Withdrawal severity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We consider mild cannabis withdrawal as consisting of symptoms that minimally interfere with the patient’s functioning and do not contribute to a high risk of relapse. In our experience, patients with mild cannabis withdrawal, absent comorbid psychiatric illness, do not typically present clinically for treatment of withdrawal.</p><p>Moderate and severe syndromes constitute the middle and high end of this spectrum.</p><p>Cannabis withdrawal severity is based upon clinical judgment. The DSM-5-TR does not define the categories by the number of withdrawal symptoms present (as they do in criteria for other substance use withdrawal syndromes).</p><p>Cannabis withdrawal intensity can be more formally assessed using the 15-item Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef114025" href="/z/d/graphic/114025.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. This checklist was originally devised as a 22-item questionnaire for research purposes [<a href="#rid41">41</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2929294931"><span class="h1">TREATMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1246227579"><span class="h2">Indications for treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The majority of acute cannabis withdrawal episodes are mild and resolve without the need for formal treatment. However, patients with moderate to severe withdrawal have a higher likelihood of relapse due to negative effects of sleep or daily functioning. These individuals may benefit from treatment of withdrawal. (See <a class="local">'Withdrawal severity'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1946802378"><span class="h2">Treatment options</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A number of medication options are available. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9394" href="/z/d/drug information/9394.html" rel="external">Dronabinol</a> (synthetic delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]), <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9457" href="/z/d/drug information/9457.html" rel="external">nabiximols</a> (a plant-derived 1:1 ratio of THC:cannabidiol [CBD]), and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8483" href="/z/d/drug information/8483.html" rel="external">gabapentin</a> have shown efficacy for reducing cannabis withdrawal in at least one randomized clinical trial [<a href="#rid42">42-44</a>]. Several other medications have shown efficacy in small trials or case series.</p><p>Individuals with mild cannabis withdrawal often self-treat with physical exercise [<a href="#rid45">45</a>], meditation or prayer, relaxation techniques, herbal preparations, over-the-counter analgesics, sedatives, hypnotics, and alcohol use [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>There are no head-to-head clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of medication treatments or with other treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). No medication is approved for the treatment of cannabis withdrawal by any national regulatory authority, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Thus, treatment choices may reasonably be informed by treatment availability and patient preference.

(See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a class="local">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical manifestations</strong> – Cannabis withdrawal symptoms typically appear 24 to 72 hours after abrupt reduction of heavy and prolonged cannabis use, reach peak intensity over the first week, and largely resolve after one to two weeks without treatment. Withdrawal symptoms include irritability, anger, anxiety, depression, and disturbed sleep. Withdrawal symptoms can interfere with attempts to cut down or abstain from cannabis use. There appears to be substantial interindividual variation.
