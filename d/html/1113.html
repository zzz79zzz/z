This is distinguished from intracranial carotid atherosclerosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/131456.html" rel="external">"Intracranial large artery atherosclerosis: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1101.html" rel="external">"Intracranial large artery atherosclerosis: Treatment and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1078099658"><span class="h2">Asymptomatic disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Asymptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease, as discussed in this topic, refers to the presence of atherosclerosis in individuals with <strong>no</strong> history of ipsilateral carotid territory ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the preceding six months. Symptoms associated with carotid atherosclerotic disease are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1088.html" rel="external">"Definition, etiology, and clinical manifestations of transient ischemic attack"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1134.html" rel="external">"Clinical diagnosis of stroke subtypes", section on 'Brain ischemia'</a>.)</p><p>Note that isolated unilateral carotid stenosis does <strong>not</strong> cause vertigo, diplopia, lightheadedness, or syncope. Therefore, in patients with these symptoms, but no other focal neurologic symptoms, the carotid lesion should be considered asymptomatic.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1306124406"><span class="h2">Prevalence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prevalence of asymptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease varies by population studied and demographics, with age and sex as the most important factors. The prevalence is low in the general population. In a meta-analysis of four population-based studies with individual data from over 23,000 participants, the prevalence estimates of asymptomatic carotid stenosis (≥50 percent of the lumen diameter) for males and females aged &lt;50 years were 0.2 and 0 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The prevalence estimates for males and females aged ≥80 years were 7.5 and 5 percent, respectively. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7571.html" rel="external">"Screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis", section on 'Prevalence'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1715234785"><span class="h2">Detection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>General population screening for carotid stenosis in asymptomatic individuals is not warranted, as reviewed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7571.html" rel="external">"Screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis"</a>.)</p><p>However, asymptomatic carotid stenosis due to atherosclerosis may be identified incidentally when a carotid bruit is detected on physical examination or when patients undergo carotid imaging during evaluation of atherosclerotic disease, or for the evaluation of an unrelated condition, including a stroke or TIA involving an unrelated vascular territory. Some patients will come to attention following private health screening studies.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H483820531"><span class="h2">Counseling</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once extracranial carotid atherosclerosis has been identified, patients should be screened for signs or symptoms of prior stroke or TIA to ensure that they are asymptomatic. They should also be counseled on the symptoms and signs of stroke and instructed to seek emergency care if a stroke is suspected (eg, by calling 911 in the United States or other phone number appropriate to their location). In addition, patients should be screened for treatable cardiovascular risk factors [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H756955786"><span class="h2">Degree of stenosis and clinical significance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once asymptomatic carotid stenosis is identified, it is important to determine the severity of carotid stenosis both to identify individuals who may be candidates for revascularization and, if revascularization is not performed, to monitor for disease progression over time.</p><p>The severity of carotid stenosis can be determined by a variety of imaging modalities (ultrasound, computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, and catheter-based angiography). In addition, interpretation of ultrasound-derived physiological parameters (eg, velocity and turbulence) and plaque may be used to further characterize carotid stenosis. For angiographic imaging studies, the severity of stenosis is recorded as the percent diameter reduction by comparing the residual lumen at the site of stenosis with the diameter of the normal distal internal carotid artery. Stenosis greater than 50 percent is generally regarded as potentially significant, though lesser degrees of stenosis may serve as embolic sources. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1118.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of carotid artery stenosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1424721844"><span class="h1">RISK OF STROKE AND CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Progression of atherosclerotic plaque at the carotid bifurcation results in luminal narrowing, often accompanied by plaque ulceration. This process can lead to ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack from embolization, thrombosis, or reduced brain perfusion (more likely in the setting of bilateral disease). Asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis also serves as a marker of increased risk for myocardial infarction and vascular death [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>]. Thus, asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis is considered a risk equivalent for cardiovascular disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1506.html" rel="external">"Overview of established risk factors for cardiovascular disease", section on 'Noncoronary atherosclerotic disease'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4084157769"><span class="h2">Ipsilateral stroke risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ischemic stroke is the most feared outcome of carotid atherosclerosis, although the risk is low in asymptomatic patients. The annual risk of ipsilateral stroke in patients with asymptomatic extracranial carotid atherosclerosis with stenosis ≥50 percent is estimated to be 0.5 to 1.0 percent annually [<a href="#rid4">4,7,8</a>]. In a retrospective cohort study of over 3700 participants diagnosed between 2008 and 2012 with severe (70 to 99 percent) asymptomatic carotid stenosis who did not undergo carotid revascularization, the estimated annual rate of ipsilateral ischemic stroke was 0.9 percent (95% CI 0.7-1.2 percent) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. This finding is consistent with other studies suggesting that the risk of ipsilateral stroke in patients with medically treated asymptomatic carotid stenosis is lower than the risk in surgically treated patients who participated in the landmark endarterectomy trials from the late 1980s through the early 2000s. (See <a class="local">'Is revascularization beneficial?'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H332650166"><span class="h2">Factors potentially associated with stroke risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Potential factors that might identify patients with asymptomatic extracranial carotid disease who have a high risk of ischemic stroke include the following [<a href="#rid10">10-12</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Initial degree of carotid stenosis (see <a class="local">'Initial degree of carotid stenosis'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Progression in the severity of asymptomatic carotid stenosis (see <a class="local">'Progressive stenosis despite optimal medical therapy'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Asymptomatic embolism detected on transcranial Doppler ultrasound (see <a class="local">'Asymptomatic embolism'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ipsilateral silent embolic infarcts on neuroimaging (see <a class="local">'Silent embolic infarcts'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>High-risk morphologic features of the carotid plaque (see <a class="local">'Carotid plaque morphology'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduced cerebral blood flow reserve (see <a class="local">'Reduced cerebrovascular reserve'</a> below)</p><p></p><p>The utility of using these factors to select patients with asymptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis for revascularization remains to be proven; treatment of those who exhibit one or more of these features should be individualized [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2023270415"><span class="h3">Initial degree of carotid stenosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The relationship between the degree of <strong>asymptomatic</strong> extracranial carotid stenosis at baseline and the risk of stroke is uncertain, as the data are inconsistent.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Randomized controlled trials comparing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with medical therapy in patients with 60 to 99 percent carotid stenosis (the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study [ACAS] and the Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial [ACST]) found that stroke rates for patients assigned to medical therapy were not clearly related to the severity of carotid stenosis, and that the benefit of carotid revascularization was not increased with more severe degrees of stenosis (see <a class="local">'Endarterectomy trials'</a> below). This is in contrast to <strong>symptomatic</strong> carotid stenosis, in which CEA trials have consistently found an increased risk of stroke and a greater benefit with revascularization with higher degrees of stenosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1106.html" rel="external">"Management of symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease", section on 'Patients appropriate for CEA'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>By contrast, observational data suggest that ipsilateral stroke risk increases with the degree of asymptomatic carotid stenosis, as shown in a population-based cohort study of 207 patients with asymptomatic 50 to 99 percent carotid stenosis [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The five-year ipsilateral stroke risk was greater among 53 patients with 70 to 99 percent carotid stenosis (14.6 percent, 95% CI 3.5-25.7) compared with 154 patients with 50 to 69 percent stenosis, none of whom had a stroke. Similarly, the five-year ipsilateral stroke risk was greater among 34 patients with 80 to 99 percent stenosis (18.3 percent, 95% CI 7.7-29.9) compared with 173 patients with 50 to 79 percent stenosis (1 percent, 95% CI 0.0-2.9).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The investigators also performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies done from 1980 to 2020 and identified 23 studies with data for ipsilateral stroke risk among 8419 medically treated patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Stroke risk during follow-up (generally three to five years) increased linearly with the degree of ipsilateral stenosis, being greater for 70 to 99 percent stenosis compared with 50 to 69 percent stenosis (10.2 versus 4.8 percent, odds ratio [OR] 2.1, 95% CI 1.7-2.5), and greater for 80 to 99 percent stenosis compared with 50 to 79 percent stenosis (10.6 percent versus 5.1 percent, OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.8-3.5).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1506096919"><span class="h3">Progressive stenosis despite optimal medical therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Natural history studies of asymptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis found that progression of stenosis over time was associated with an increased stroke risk [<a href="#rid14">14-22</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>As an example, one study analyzed the natural history of asymptomatic carotid disease in 714 patients who had serial carotid ultrasound examinations biannually for a mean follow-up of 3.2 years [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].

However, the utility of this approach has not been tested in a randomized trial, and TCD is not widely available.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3598733677"><span class="h3">Silent embolic infarcts</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The presence of silent embolic infarcts ipsilateral to asymptomatic carotid stenosis on neuroimaging may predict the risk of ipsilateral stroke [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. In the prospective ACSRS study, 462 patients with asymptomatic 60 to 99 percent carotid artery stenosis by duplex ultrasound had a baseline head computed tomography (CT) scan and were monitored every six months for up to eight years [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. At a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, the rate of ipsilateral stroke was significantly higher for patients with silent embolic infarcts on baseline CT (n = 86) compared with patients without embolic infarcts (annual event rate 3.6 versus 1.0 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 3.0, 95% CI 1.46-6.29). Previous studies have found that the presence of silent brain infarcts on CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke in the general population (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1134.html" rel="external">"Clinical diagnosis of stroke subtypes", section on 'Silent brain infarcts'</a>), but these studies did not consider the status of the carotid arteries [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3422824785"><span class="h3">Carotid plaque morphology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Limited data suggest that ultrasound or MRI determination of carotid plaque morphology (eg, ulceration, plaque area, intraplaque hemorrhage, plaque echogenicity) may be useful to identify patients with asymptomatic carotid occlusive disease who are at higher risk of stroke and therefore likely to benefit from carotid revascularization. However, this approach requires additional study.</p><p>In patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, several imaging features on ultrasonography or MRI have been associated with elevated stroke risk [<a href="#rid11">11,31,33</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Carotid ulceration</strong> – In a report of 253 patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, the carotid arteries were scanned with three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound, and the risk of stroke or death at three years was significantly higher for patients with three or more carotid plaque ulcers (the sum of both carotid arteries) compared with those who had less than three ulcers (18 versus 2 percent) [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Large plaque area</strong> – In the ACSRS study, increased plaque area was independently associated with an increased risk of ipsilateral cerebrovascular or retinal ischemic events [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Plaque echolucency on ultrasonography </strong>– Echogenicity refers to the appearance of plaque based on whether ultrasound waves pass through or are reflected, ranging from purely hypoechoic (ie, echolucent; no echoes, black) to hyperechoic (white).

The most feared outcome of carotid atherosclerosis is ischemic stroke. The estimated risk of ipsilateral stroke in patients with asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis (stenosis ≥50 percent) is approximately 0.5 to 1.0 percent annually. Asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis is also a marker of increased risk for myocardial infarction and vascular death.
