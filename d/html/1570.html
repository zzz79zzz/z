         Historically, restenosis has been one of the principal limitations to the long-term success of percutaneous coronary revascularization. The rate of angiographic restenosis following balloon angioplasty alone (defined as 50 percent or greater reduction in luminal diameter at follow-up angiography) is 40 to 50 percent [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. About half of the patients with angiographic restenosis manifest clinical restenosis with recurrent ischemia that leads to repeat revascularization of the targeted vessel [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Intracoronary stents, by virtue of their ability to prevent elastic recoil and constrictive remodeling, initially reduced the frequency of angiographic restenosis to approximately 20 percent and the need for repeat revascularization to approximately 10 to 12 percent  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71236" href="/z/d/graphic/71236.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. Even better results have been obtained with drug-eluting stents, which are the stents of choice for most coronary interventions currently  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53472" href="/z/d/graphic/53472.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1569.html" rel="external">
          "Percutaneous coronary intervention with intracoronary stents: Overview"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to the availability of drug-eluting stents, one major focus of investigation to treat restenosis was the use of intracoronary radiation. Based upon the data presented below, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved both gamma and beta intracoronary radiation for use in the treatment of in-stent restenosis [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. This technique is applied immediately after mechanical treatment (usually balloon dilatation) of the stent restenosis. However, the increased efficacy of drug-eluting stents for in-stent restenosis has markedly limited the role of intracoronary radiation for this indication.
        </p>
        <p>
         Data do not support the use of intracoronary radiation for the prevention of restenosis after treating de novo lesions with balloon angioplasty alone, and the FDA has not approved this technique for this indication. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Comparison to drug-eluting stents'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Another radiation approach, insertion of radioactive stents, has been demonstrated to cause an increase in restenosis at the edges of the stent and may delay rather than prevent restenosis within the stent itself. The development of these stents has been discontinued.

          GENERAL PRINCIPLES

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The rationale of using ionizing radiation to prevent restenosis is derived from the observed benefit of radiation in reducing exuberant wound healing following surgery. In porcine models, application of endovascular radiation inhibited neointimal formation after balloon injury [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. These benefits may be mediated by apoptosis (programmed cell death), inhibition of the first wave of cellular proliferation, and prevention of adventitial fibrosis [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Radiation can be delivered over the course of 3 to 30 minutes (depending upon the isotope and its activity) via percutaneously inserted catheters containing radioactive wires, balloons, ribbons, or seeds. Most studies have used gamma radiation from an Ir-192 source, which is highly penetrating in human tissue and falls off according to the inverse square law. Other studies have used shorter range beta particles from a Sr-90, P-32, or I-125 source, which have a range of only a few millimeters in tissue and yield lower whole-body dose exposure for a corresponding dose to the arterial wall. Because of this intense local absorption, beta brachytherapy can be delivered in much shorter dwell times and with much less shielding of the laboratory staff.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Long-term results after radiotherapy may be influenced by the radiation dose, the homogeneity of dose distribution, the complexity of the stenotic lesion, and vessel injury at the time of radiation delivery [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8-11
         </a>
         ]. In early studies, the effect of increasing the beta-emitter dose was evaluated in a report of 130 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)

          without

         stenting who were randomly assigned to receive 9, 12, 15, or 18 Gy of radiation [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. At six months, the restenosis rate was 28, 17, 16, and 4 percent, respectively. The rate of repeat revascularization with a dose of 9 and 18 Gy was 18 and 6 percent, respectively and there was a dose-dependent enlargement of the vessel lumen.
        </p>
        <p>
         Intracoronary radiation using a fixed dose of 15 Gy is less effective in longer in-stent restenotic lesions, due to greater eccentricity and variability in lesion geometry and longer source-to-target distances [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. However, efficacy is improved with the use of higher doses (18 Gy at 2 mm from the source) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>

          —
         </span>
         A concern with the use of radiotherapy after stenting is the potential for absorption and scattering, especially of short-range beta particles, by stent struts that may cause significant variations in the uniformity and magnitude of the radiation dose. Thinner strut stents result in less radiation dose perturbation than previously popular thicker strut stents [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. However, the clinical significance of these differences is uncertain. As described below, trials using beta-emitters for in-stent restenosis have shown benefit that appears roughly similar to that seen in trials of more penetrating gamma radiation. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1587.html" rel="external">

         Brachytherapy is effective in treating restenosis occurring after either balloon angioplasty or stenting. Some long-term data from clinical trials suggest that radiation may delay, rather than prevent, restenosis [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>

         </span>
         Low dose brachytherapy has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as adjunctive treatment for in-stent restenosis; it appears to act by inhibiting recurrent exuberant neointimal formation within the stent, without any effect at the stent edge [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The benefit and clinical outcomes with intracoronary radiation are independent of the primary method used to treat in-stent restenosis (balloon angioplasty, excimer laser angioplasty, rotational atherectomy, or additional stent implantation) [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17
         </a>
         ]. In addition, intracoronary radiation is effective in all vessel sizes, with benefit greatest in small vessel (&lt;2.5 mm) and all lesion lengths, especially in diffuse lesions [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1587.html" rel="external">
          "Intracoronary stent restenosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although both beta and gamma radiation have similar benefit in preventing recurrence of in-stent restenosis, most laboratories prefer the beta systems because of their shorter treatment times (typically 3 versus 30 minutes) and the lack of requirement for significant lead shielding to protect the operator and staff.
        </p>
        <p>
         A significant clinical benefit has been noted with intracoronary radiation in a number of published trials using a gamma emitter (Gamma-One, WRIST, Long WRIST) [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19-22
         </a>
         ] or a beta emitter (INHIBIT, Beta WRIST, and START) [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23-25
         </a>
         ]. The following observations illustrate the range of findings.

         The Gamma-One trial evaluated 252 patients undergoing percutaneous therapy for in-stent stenosis in native coronary arteries; the patients were randomly assigned to a gamma emitting or nonradioactive intracoronary ribbon [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. At nine months, the primary end point (death, myocardial infarction, or need for target lesion revascularization) was significantly lower with intracoronary gamma radiation (28 versus 44 percent for placebo), due entirely to a reduction in target lesion revascularization.
        </p>
        <p>

         The WRIST trial included 130 patients with in-stent restenosis who underwent a successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and were then randomly assigned to either intracoronary radiation with a gamma emitter or placebo [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. At six months, radiation was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of angiographic restenosis (19 versus 58 percent for placebo), target lesion revascularization (14 versus 63 percent), and freedom from major cardiac events (29 versus 68 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         At five years, the major cardiac event rate continued to be significantly lower with intracoronary radiation (46 versus 69 percent with placebo) [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. However, in the interval between six months and five years, radiation was associated with significantly more target lesion revascularization (22 versus 5 percent), suggesting that radiation may have delayed, but not prevented, the development of restenosis.

         <span class="glyph">

         The Long WRIST trial demonstrated the benefit of intracoronary radiation in 240 patients with long in-stent lesions (36 to 80 mm) [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. The first 120 patients were randomly assigned to either gamma irradiation at a dose of 15 Gy or placebo; subsequently, an additional 120 patients were treated with 18 Gy. At six months, patients assigned to high dose radiation (18 Gy), low dose radiation (15 Gy), or placebo had target lesion revascularization rates of 20, 39, and 62 percent, respectively.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The benefit of radiotherapy was more pronounced in diabetic patients in the WRIST trial and in a retrospective review of 749 patients at a single center, 43 percent of whom were diabetic [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Although the outcomes were similar in nondiabetics and diabetics treated with radiation, higher rates of restenosis occurred in the diabetics in the placebo group [

          21

At nine months, radiotherapy significantly reduced the incidence of in-lesion restenosis (16 versus 48 percent for placebo), in-vessel restenosis (26 versus 52 percent), and major adverse cardiac effects (death, Q wave MI, and target lesion revascularization; 15 versus 31 percent). These relative benefits were maintained during a two-year follow-up.

         Typically, restenosis after drug-eluting stent implantation is treated with either percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or debulking (eg, laser or rotational atherectomy), followed by
         <strong>

         (so-called "sandwich stenting"). This approach is believed to diminish the risk of recurrent restenosis. Should restenosis recur following "sandwich stenting," additional stent implantation may have limited efficacy. At some centers, intracoronary brachytherapy is utilized to treat the stenosis in the sandwich stents. Although no randomized clinical trials have been conducted supporting this technique, a recent meta-analysis of six observational studies reported favorable long-term outcomes using intracoronary brachytherapy for this condition, with an overall incidence of target lesion revascularization of 14.1 percent at one year and 22.7 percent at two years [

At 12 months, intracoronary radiation was associated with a lower rate of target lesion revascularization (17 versus 57 percent) and a lower rate of major cardiac events (32 versus 63 percent). Similar benefits were noted in another study in which intracoronary gamma radiation was as effective in saphenous vein grafts as in native artery lesions [

At six months, minimal lumen diameter was significantly greater and volume loss was significantly less with brachytherapy. However, despite efforts to optimize procedural performance, edge restenosis and late occlusions resulted in a higher rate of target vessel revascularization with radiation (20 versus 12 percent).

         Intracoronary radiotherapy also appears to be effective treatment for restenosis occurring after PCI without stent placement [

         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. The patients were treated with PCI (balloon angioplasty and stent placement as needed) and then randomly assigned to intracoronary Ir-192 (a gamma-emitter) or placebo; angiographic restenosis at six months was much lower in the radiation group (17 versus 54 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         The benefit of radiation persisted at three and five years [

          13,35

         ]. Target lesion revascularization was significantly less common among patients receiving intracoronary radiotherapy compared to placebo (15 versus 48 percent at three years and 23 versus 48 percent at five years). The composite end point of death, myocardial infarction, or target lesion revascularization was also significantly lower in the radiation group (23 versus 55 percent at three years and 38 versus 65 percent at five years)  (

         However, intracoronary brachytherapy is rarely used for restenosis after PTCA in the current era, particularly with the availability of small diameter drug-eluting stents.

         Data are limited on the routine use of intracoronary radiation after balloon angioplasty alone, as a prophylactic measure to prevent restenosis. This issue has become less important, since the majority of percutaneous coronary interventions currently performed include stent placement.

         The frequency with which late thrombosis occurs was assessed in a report of 473 patients who presented with in-stent restenosis and were enrolled in various radiation protocols, whether randomized to placebo versus radiation or entered into registries [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>

         As noted in the trials above, intracoronary radiotherapy for in-stent restenosis lowers the rate of subsequent restenosis compared to no radiotherapy. However, recurrent restenosis still occurs in 15 to 29 percent at nine months [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,20,26,46
         </a>
         ]. Delayed restenosis is also possible. In a five-year follow-up from the original SCRIPPS trial, there were two occurrences of very late restenosis in the treated segment [
         <a href="#rid35">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical features of late failure after intracoronary radiation were evaluated in a series of 961 patients from the WRIST trials, 282 of whom (29 percent) failed at a mean follow-up of 494 days; the failure rate was the same for beta and gamma radiation [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. The main risk factor for late failure was repeat stenting. The lesions were primarily focal with a mean length of 11.9 mm. Most patients were treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PTCA in 61 percent, restenting in 26 percent, and atherectomy in 11 percent) or, less often, bypass surgery. Although the patients responded well to revascularization, 17 percent required repeat target vessel revascularization at six months.
        </p>
        <p>
         A limitation to these observations is that they were made before the need for prolonged combined antiplatelet therapy, as described above, was appreciated. In addition, approximately 10 to 15 percent of failures were determined by angiography, not by symptoms or stress testing, which may have overestimated the true failure rate.

         Similar findings were noted in a smaller study of 45 patients with restenosis after intracoronary irradiation in the Gamma-One and Gamma-Two trials [

          Background
         </strong>
         – Brachytherapy using either gamma or beta radiation sources became a common treatment for in-stent restenosis prior to the availability of drug-eluting coronary stents, since it substantially reduced recurrent restenosis. It can be particularly helpful in treating long lesions, which are more subject to recurrent restenosis. The procedure has a favorable safety profile, especially if dual antiplatelet therapy is continued for an extended period (up to one year) to reduce occurrences of late thrombosis [
         <a href="#rid54">

         <strong>
          Possible indication
         </strong>
         – Brachytherapy may be considered in certain instances of in-stent restenosis. Typically, it may be considered after recurrent in-stent restenosis after initial treatment with a drug-eluting stent has failed.
