Patients with ankle sprains (stretching, partial rupture, or complete rupture of at least one ligament) constitute a large percentage of these injuries.

Initial management goals are to limit pain and swelling and to maintain range of motion before gradually introducing exercise  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef143182" href="/z/d/graphic/143182.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Protection, rest, ice, compression, and elevation (PRICE) is a common-sense approach for the first two to three days, although formal study of its effectiveness is lacking.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Protection is provided by applying an elastic bandage and, depending on the extent of injury, a splint, walking boot, or possibly a cast.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rest is achieved by limiting weightbearing; if needed, patients use crutches until they are able to walk with a normal gait.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cryotherapy applied as ice or cold water immersion is recommended for 15 to 20 minutes every two to three hours while awake for the first 48 hours or until swelling is improved, whichever comes first [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Compression with an elastic bandage to provide support and minimize swelling should be applied early.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The injured ankle should be kept elevated to further alleviate swelling. Ideally, the ankle should be kept above the level of the heart, but this may be difficult to achieve.</p><p></p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">Acetaminophen</a> and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used for analgesia; no particular NSAID has been shown to be superior. Both oral and topical NSAIDs are more effective than placebo [<a href="#rid6">6-9</a>]. Of the topical NSAIDs, gel formulations of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9348" href="/z/d/drug information/9348.html" rel="external">diclofenac</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8547" href="/z/d/drug information/8547.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8590" href="/z/d/drug information/8590.html" rel="external">ketoprofen</a>, and some diclofenac patches provided the best effect, according to a systematic review of 61 studies [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. There are no studies comparing topical NSAIDs and oral NSAIDs in the acute treatment of ankle sprain, nor are there studies comparing NSAIDs with non-NSAID analgesics (eg, acetaminophen), so it is not clear that an antiinflammatory effect is important. Care should be taken to avoid unnecessary or prolonged use as NSAIDs may be associated with complications and suppress the healing process. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7991.html" rel="external">"Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects", section on 'Possible effect on tendon injury'</a>.)</p><p>Physical therapy is the mainstay of recovery from an ankle sprain. Range of motion exercises, including plantarflexion, dorsiflexion, and foot circles  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91843" href="/z/d/graphic/91843.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>), should be started early, once acute pain and swelling subside, to maintain range of motion. The intensity of rehabilitation is increased gradually with the addition of strength and balance exercises. Ankle splints or braces can limit extremes of joint motion and allow early weightbearing while protecting against reinjury. (See <a class="local">'Rehabilitation'</a> below and <a class="local">'Splints and braces'</a> below.)</p><p>For isolated medial (deltoid) ankle sprains, which are uncommon, a brief period of immobilization and non-weightbearing (from three to seven days) should be followed by weightbearing in a stabilizing brace and initiation of range of motion exercises, as described above [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>The treatment of severe (grade III) ankle sprains is controversial. A brief period of immobilization may be helpful in some instances. Grading of ankle sprains is reviewed separately; grade III injuries are discussed below. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/189.html" rel="external">"Ankle sprain in adults: Evaluation and diagnosis", section on 'Classification of ankle sprains'</a> and <a class="local">'Immobilization and bracing'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3334463954"><span class="h2">Immobilization and bracing</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1889614826"><span class="h3">Mild (grade I) and moderate (grade II) sprains</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with mild (grade I) lateral or medial ankle sprains do not require immobilization [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Treatment with an elastic wrap (eg, ACE bandage) or compression sleeve  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93689" href="/z/d/graphic/93689.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) for a few days following the injury is sufficient.</p><p>Patients with moderate (grade II) lateral sprains may need sustained support following their injury. The combination of an elastic wrap and an Aircast or similar splint  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78043" href="/z/d/graphic/78043.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>), or application of a functional splint (such as a figure-eight brace), for up to a few weeks is generally sufficient. Ankle support in patients with mild or moderate sprains should not interfere with early rehabilitation.</p><p>Patients with grade II medial (deltoid) ankle sprains (an uncommon injury) are treated with a brief period of immobilization and non-weightbearing, after which they can begin weightbearing in a solid, stand-alone brace (eg, controlled ankle movement [CAM] boot  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86895" href="/z/d/graphic/86895.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>)), external brace that fits over the shoe (eg, TayCo brace  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef132628" href="/z/d/graphic/132628.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>)), or a soft functional brace (eg, Aircast  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78043" href="/z/d/graphic/78043.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>); figure-eight brace  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87055" href="/z/d/graphic/87055.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>)). Selection may be based on several factors including the patient's sense of comfort and stability [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>Three systematic reviews have reported that functional rehabilitation (ie, early activity and minimization of brace use) for <strong>lateral</strong> ankle sprains yields superior results for a number of clinically important outcomes compared with immobilization [<a href="#rid12">12-14</a>]. However, the studies included in these reviews are limited by their low quality (problems include small numbers, incomplete descriptions of interventions, inconsistent outcome measures, and heterogeneity of functional treatments and immobilization techniques). The Cochrane systematic review on this subject has since been withdrawn [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In a separate analysis of higher-quality trials, the only statistically significant result was that patients treated with functional rehabilitation returned to work sooner than those treated with immobilization alone (average 12.9 days sooner, 95% CI 7.1-18.7). Although these systematic reviews must be interpreted cautiously, the results suggest improved outcomes using functional rehabilitation. It is notable that immobilization was not significantly favored in any of the analyses.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H349148732"><span class="h3">Severe (grade III) sprain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Given the inconclusive results of available evidence, it is difficult to determine the appropriate role and timing for immobilization and early functional rehabilitation in patients with severe lateral ankle sprains. It appears reasonable, particularly if mobilization is painful and compliance likely to be difficult, to offer a short period (10 days) of immobilization in a non-weightbearing cast. Alternatively, a comparable period of strict non-weightbearing and immobilization using a combination of an Aircast splint and an elastic wrap may be used. Early functional rehabilitation can be started once immobilization is discontinued. For patients treated without casting, the importance of compliance with the treatment plan (eg, maintaining non-weightbearing status and immobilization for the designated period) should be emphasized.</p><p>Patients who sustain a severe medial ankle sprain involving a full rupture of both the superficial and deep deltoid ligament (an uncommon injury) should be immobilized in a cast or CAM boot, avoid weightbearing by using crutches, and be referred to an orthopedic surgeon for shared decision-making about surgical versus conservative management [<a href="#rid11">11,15</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Indications for referral'</a> below.)</p><p>Data from the systematic reviews discussed above suggest that early mobilization and support using a stabilizing orthosis may result in earlier resumption of work and sports, compared with immobilization. However, a well-designed, multicenter, randomized trial of severe ankle sprains performed after the systematic reviews cited above reported a different conclusion [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. In this study, 584 patients with severe ankle sprains were assigned to treatment using a below-knee cast for 10 days, Aircast brace, Bledsoe immobilization boot, or tubular compression bandage. Assessment at three months using a validated score for ankle function found the greatest improvements in the cast group. Few, if any, patients received functional rehabilitation. The authors noted that compliance with treatments other than casting could not be monitored. Follow-up at nine months revealed no significant differences in outcome or complications among the treatment groups. Of note, the most common reason for refusing to participate in the study was an unwillingness to be treated with a cast.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2493061010"><span class="h2">Rehabilitation</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2458671683"><span class="h3">Approach and exercises</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Functional rehabilitation is important in aiding the return to activity and preventing chronic instability and recurrent injury [<a href="#rid17">17-19</a>]. This should be started in the first few days for grade I and II lateral ankle sprains and between days 7 and 14 for grade I and II isolated medial ankle sprains (depending on the degree of pain with weightbearing) [<a href="#rid11">11,15</a>]. A sample rehabilitation program for uncomplicated, low-grade injuries is provided  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef134631" href="/z/d/graphic/134631.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p>Early functional rehabilitation begins with exercises for mobility (foot circles  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91843" href="/z/d/graphic/91843.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>), alphabet exercises [have the patient trace letters in the air with his big toe], Achilles tendon stretch  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65646" href="/z/d/graphic/65646.html" rel="external">picture 7</a>)) and strength (isometric and isotonic plantarflexion, dorsiflexion, inversion, eversion, toe curls  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55497" href="/z/d/graphic/55497.html" rel="external">picture 8</a>) and marble pickups, heel walks and toe walks) and proceeds to exercises for proprioception (circular wobble board  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111991" href="/z/d/graphic/111991.html" rel="external">picture 9</a>) and walking on different and unstable surfaces) and activity-specific training (progressing from walk-jog, to jog-run, to run, to run with change of direction) [<a href="#rid20">20-23</a>].</p><p>In most patients with mild or moderate lateral ankle sprains, functional rehabilitation should begin as soon as the initial pain and swelling have subsided sufficiently to allow the patient to perform simple exercises. A randomized controlled study of patients with acute grade I and II ankle sprains showed that patients who started therapeutic exercises within the first week of injury were engaging in weightbearing activities earlier without differences in pain, swelling, or rate of reinjury compared with those who did not [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. For isolated medial ankle sprains, we recommend starting functional rehabilitation after 7 to 14 days of ankle rest and protection. Patients may begin rehabilitation once they can ambulate without pain. Rehabilitation continues until the patient has returned to pain-free, full activity.</p><p>The rehabilitation program should take several weeks in order for the ankle to strengthen and to limit the chance of reinjury. In a study of active-duty marines with grade II ankle sprains, those undergoing a structured rehabilitation program returned to duty up to several months earlier than those without rehabilitation [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>Whether regular, supervised physical therapy is beneficial for all patients is unclear. A systematic review of four studies comparing home exercise programs with supervised physical therapy found that supervised rehabilitation resulted in less pain and subjective instability at intermediate follow-up (eight weeks after injury) but no difference at longer follow-up [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. A subsequent large and well-conducted randomized trial involving 503 participants with grade I and II acute ankle sprains compared usual care (written instructions about PRICE and graduated weightbearing activities) with usual care plus supervised physical therapy [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. This study found no improved outcome, functional or subjective, with the addition of supervised physical therapy in the short term (one and three months) as well as at six months. Although the equivocal long-term benefits of supervised physical therapy reported in these studies raise questions about whether such treatment is needed for all patients, supervised rehabilitation may be advantageous for patients for whom a faster return to work or sport is especially important. If supervised rehabilitation is not feasible for a patient, a home exercise program is highly recommended.</p><p>According to a systematic overview of available systematic reviews and meta-analyses, there is strong evidence that exercise therapy (defined as supervised strengthening and mobility exercises) following an acute ankle sprain reduces the risk of recurrence [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. All three systematic reviews assessed in the overview study that examined the relationship between rehabilitation using exercise therapy and ankle sprain recurrence as a primary outcome reported that exercise therapy reduced the rate of repeat ankle injury.</p><p>Manual joint therapy for ankle sprains involves distraction or mobilization of the talocrural joint in the anteroposterior (sagittal) plane. Such therapy is not appropriate for the early treatment of grade III sprains, for which a short period of immobilization is preferred, but may be useful during the rehabilitation of less severe sprains.

Surgery may be reasonable in select patients with severe (grade III) sprains who are engaged in professional sports or other activities that impose repeated large stresses on the ankle joint. Referral to an orthopedic surgeon is appropriate for such patients.

At follow-up, patients treated surgically were less likely to have a positive anterior drawer test (30 versus 54 percent); however, this was assessed by clinicians who knew how the patients had been treated. There was no difference in the percentage of patients with radiographic evidence of joint degeneration. Thus, there were no blinded, objective assessments in this trial that demonstrated superiority of surgery.</p><p>Although many experts conclude that delayed operative reconstruction of injured ligaments achieves results similar to that with acute repair [<a href="#rid30">30</a>], we are not aware of any head-to-head trials that examine this issue.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3410106112"><span class="h2">Ultrasound and other unproven therapies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>According to a systematic review of six trials including 606 patients, ultrasound therapy is <strong>not</strong> an effective treatment for acute ankle sprain [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].

The patient may need to work primarily while sitting and avoid heavy lifting. Most are able to return to full work and activities by three to four weeks.</p><p>For more severe injuries involving total disruption of ligaments and for manual laborers, return to full work duties may not be possible for six to eight weeks. Reasonable precautions in this setting include working primarily while seated, avoiding any heavy lifting, and limiting standing or walking on uneven surfaces.

Before returning to sport, the athlete recovering from a sprain should have sufficient ankle stability and function to compete safely and avoid reinjury (which can worsen underlying pathology). Multiple systematic reviews describe the lack of high-quality evidence to inform criteria for return, and thus, available guidelines are necessarily based on clinical experience and expert opinion [<a href="#rid38">38-41</a>].</p><p>Criteria for return to sport typically include a static balance test and assessment of sport-specific movement.

Interventions that appear to lead to a quicker return to play include functional rehabilitation, compression (eg, support with an elastic bandage during activity), and joint mobilization during early care when appropriate [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. Most experts recommend using a functional brace during all sporting activity while recovering from a moderate or severe ankle sprain. In most cases, the brace is worn for the season (in seasonal sports).

Several terms are used for such assessments, including functional testing, functional performance testing, and physical performance testing. Functional testing uses specific, measurable assessments to determine if an individual can safely withstand the demands specific to their sport.</p><p>Functional tests include assessments of both agility and balance. Commonly used tests include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Static balance test </strong>– The patient stands on the rehabilitated leg only for a minimum of ten seconds to determine whether they can maintain a stable position.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Star excursion balance test</strong> (SEBT)<strong> </strong>– Standing on the rehabilitated leg, the patient extends the non-injured lower limb as far as possible to eight different points along an octagonal grid  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef132610" href="/z/d/graphic/132610.html" rel="external">picture 14</a>), with measurement taken of the "reach distance" of the extended (non-weightbearing) limb at each point. A modified version, the "Y-balance test" (YBT), assesses anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral reach distance [<a href="#rid44">44,45</a>]. The YBT requires a proprietary balance platform and measurement markers along the tested planes; the SEBT requires an eight-line grid drawn on the testing surface.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Side-hop test </strong>– Standing on the rehabilitated leg, the patient performs 10 side-to-side (coronal plane) hops, medial then lateral (total of 20 hops), between markers 30 cm apart. The time needed to complete the hops is compared to a standardized norm or to the non-affected side. The mean time to completion for control subjects is nine seconds; an increase of 1.2 to 2 seconds or more for the limb with the injured ankle is considered diagnostic of functional instability. This test is easy to perform (especially when using the uninjured limb as the standard) and accurately detects ankle instability [<a href="#rid46">46,47</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Single-limb hop test </strong>– Standing on the rehabilitated leg, the patient performs a series of hops on a 120 cm by 60 cm (approximately) board that incorporates 15-degree slopes in four orientations relative to the ankle: upward, downward, lateral, and medial. Time to completion is compared with standardized norms or the time when performed on the patient's uninjured lower extremity [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. This assessment requires construction or purchase of the assessment board.</p><p></p><p>Most research on functional testing of ankle injury involves patients with chronic lateral instability rather than acute ankle sprain. A systematic review of 169 studies of functional testing of the lower extremity found little evidence to support functional assessments for pre-season screening, injury prediction, or outcome following injury [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. A subsequent systematic review found that certain functional tests do reliably distinguish between patients with and without chronic ankle instability [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. These tests are commonly used by sports medicine clinicians and athletic training staff to assess patients recovering from an acute ankle sprain in addition to chronic instability. Although these assessments are based on research about and clinical observation of lateral ankle sprains, they are appropriate for medial or multi-ligamentous ankle injury.</p><p>Several studies of functional assessment indicate that a patient's subjective sense of instability is as predictive of low functional testing scores, if not more predictive, than a history of sprain or findings of laxity [<a href="#rid48">48,50</a>]. As part of the functional assessment, it is important to ask the athlete if their ankle feels stable and whether they feel ready to resume playing at full intensity. A simple way to learn a patient's sense of instability is to use a 0 to 100 visual analogue scale rating the instability of their injured ankle compared with their unaffected ankle; their injured ankle should score 80 or higher (assuming the unaffected side is 100) for the clinician to recommend return to sport (or the clinician can determine their own cutoff based on the specific demands of the sport/activity).</p><p>For overall return to sport decisions, an athlete's self-assessment of their readiness to return, emotionally, mentally, and physically, is an important factor.

According to a questionnaire study of 132 patients, risk factors for chronic ankle dysfunction at five years included ankle sprain sustained in dominant leg, pain present at 6 to 12 months after injury, and recurrent sprain [<a href="#rid56">56</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3042075625"><span class="h1">CHRONIC ANKLE INSTABILITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most ankle sprains recover fully with nonoperative treatment, but a substantial minority of patients develop some chronic ankle instability, which can present as recurrent ankle sprain, giving way of the ankle without a new sprain, sensation that the ankle is unstable, avoiding or modifying usual daily or sporting activities, and recurrent ankle pain or swelling after six months [<a href="#rid57">57,58</a>]. Predicting which patients who sustain an ankle sprain will develop instability is difficult.

We think it is reasonable to recommend such training as part of the treatment for these patients. A systematic review of seven trials involving 3726 participants reported that proprioceptive training is effective at reducing the rate of ankle sprains in sporting participants, particularly those with a history of ankle sprain [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. Other small randomized trials and observational evidence suggest that strength and balance exercises can improve ankle strength, range of motion, and perceived ankle stability compared with a "wait-and-see" approach or usual care [<a href="#rid62">62-64</a>].

Risk is reduced by approximately 70 percent in this patient group (relative risk [RR] ranged from 0.15 to 0.5 among trials). Subsequently, two randomized, non-blinded trials reported that use of a lace-up ankle brace reduced the frequency, but not the severity, of ankle injuries in high school football and basketball players regardless of whether the athlete had sustained an ankle sprain previously [<a href="#rid68">68,69</a>].</p><p>Athletes may have concerns about decreased performance with external ankle supports.

High friction at this edge-sole interface may account for the higher rate of non-contact, lateral ankle sprains among athletes who play court sports. A pilot randomized trial involving 510 indoor-sport athletes with a history of lateral ankle sprain reported lower recurrence rates and shorter time lost to injury in the group wearing the shoe patch [<a href="#rid71">71</a>].

Range-of-motion exercises, including plantarflexion, dorsiflexion, and foot circles  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91843" href="/z/d/graphic/91843.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>), should be started early, once acute pain and swelling subside. (See <a class="local">'Immediate therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Immobilization and ankle support</strong> – Mild (grade I) sprains do not require immobilization; support with an elastic bandage is sufficient. Moderate (grade II) sprains may need support with an elastic wrap and an Aircast or similar splint  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78043" href="/z/d/graphic/78043.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>), a stabilizing soft splint  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87055" href="/z/d/graphic/87055.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>), or figure-eight brace for up to several weeks. Athletes or heavy laborers with grade I or II sprains typically continue to wear ankle support for several months (through the end of the sports season). We use a soft lace-up or hook-and-loop-closure brace  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87055" href="/z/d/graphic/87055.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>). (See <a class="local">'Mild (grade I) and moderate (grade II) sprains'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Management of severe (grade III) ankle sprains is controversial. Some may warrant surgery; others are managed with functional rehabilitation. We suggest a brief period (about 10 days) of non-weightbearing and immobilization, rather than early weightbearing, for patients with severe ankle sprains not being treated surgically (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Particularly if mobilization is painful and compliance likely to be difficult, we feel it is reasonable to initiate treatment with a brief period of non-weightbearing and immobilization in a cast or combination of rigid splint and elastic bandage. Afterwards, semi-rigid ankle supports are typically used for several weeks to months, followed by transition to a figure-eight brace. (See <a class="local">'Severe (grade III) sprain'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rehabilitation</strong> – Once symptoms and swelling subside, functional rehabilitation is introduced. Exercises to regain and improve balance, mobility, and strength are the focus. Intensity is increased gradually as function improves and the program continues over weeks to months depending primarily on the severity of injury. A sample program is provided  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef134631" href="/z/d/graphic/134631.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Rehabilitation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Return to activity </strong>– Most patients recovering from a lateral ankle sprain that does not involve complete ligament disruption return to sedentary work within a few days. More severe injuries require three to six weeks. Up to eight weeks or longer may be needed before sports and heavy labor can be resumed safely, depending on the extent of injury and compliance with physical therapy. (See <a class="local">'Return to activity'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chronic instability</strong> – In patients with symptoms that persist for more than six to eight weeks, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be obtained to rule out conditions such as talar dome fractures or syndesmosis injury. Rehabilitation programs with a focus on balance, proprioception, and strength exercises often help those with chronic ankle instability. Referral to an orthopedic surgeon may be useful for patients with chronic ankle instability, particularly those who fail to improve with appropriate rehabilitation. (See <a class="local">'Chronic ankle instability'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevention</strong> – Lace-up supports can help prevent ankle reinjury during high-risk activities. Proprioception and strength training, possibly under the guidance of a physical therapist, can help reduce the risk of reinjury. (See <a class="local">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Gribble PA, Bleakley CM, Caulfield BM, et al. 2016 consensus statement of the International Ankle Consortium: prevalence, impact and long-term consequences of lateral ankle sprains.
