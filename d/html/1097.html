Patients with concomitant cerebrovascular and coronary heart disease represent a subset with advanced atherosclerosis in whom other areas of the arterial system are also involved. In addition to a higher risk of perioperative stroke (see <a class="local">'Risk factors'</a> below), these patients also have a higher incidence of left main coronary disease and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction compared with patients who have isolated coronary heart disease [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>This topic will focus mainly on coexistent coronary and extracranial carotid atherosclerosis. Issues that will be discussed include the management of the patient with an asymptomatic carotid stenosis undergoing CABG, the role of combined or staged CABG and carotid revascularization in these patients, and which strategies will result in the lowest operative morbidity and mortality.</p><p>The indications for CABG are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1579.html" rel="external">"Revascularization in patients with stable coronary artery disease: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery versus percutaneous coronary intervention"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/47.html" rel="external">"Coronary artery bypass graft surgery in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction", section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">STROKE ASSOCIATED WITH CABG</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neurologic complications are among the most feared complications of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Information from large databases published before 2002 suggested that a new clinical stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurred in approximately 3 percent of patients [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. While data from large retrospective reports published in 2008 and 2011 suggested that the overall incidence of perioperative stroke had declined to 1.6 percent [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>], a 2014 prospective study found a clinically apparent perioperative stroke rate of 3.1 percent [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Radiographically evident but clinically silent strokes occur much more frequently [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>].</p><p>Approximately 40 percent of strokes occur intraoperatively and most of the remaining strokes occur during the first 48 hours postoperatively [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Perioperative strokes have significant impact on length of hospital stay and mortality outcome, with 10-fold higher hospital mortality rates in patients who suffered a perioperative stroke [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Other well-recognized neurologic complications of CABG include delirium, seizures, and neurocognitive dysfunction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1660.html" rel="external">"Neurologic complications of cardiac surgery", section on 'Encephalopathy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Etiology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The mechanisms of stroke in patients undergoing CABG are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1660.html" rel="external">"Neurologic complications of cardiac surgery"</a>.)</p><p>Summarized briefly, the most common mechanism is embolism, as changes in hemodynamics and aortic manipulation such as cross-clamping, cannulation, and/or proximal graft anastomosis can cause embolization of thrombotic or atheromatous debris from complex plaques in the ascending aorta [<a href="#rid5">5,10,11</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8197.html" rel="external">"Thromboembolism from aortic plaque", section on 'Cardiovascular procedures'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8184.html" rel="external">"Embolism from atherosclerotic plaque: Atheroembolism (cholesterol crystal embolism)"</a>.)</p><p>Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia following CABG, occurring in 25 to 30 percent of patients, and is a frequent cause of postoperative embolic stroke as well.</p><p>Other causes of perioperative stroke include large and small vessel occlusive disease and hypoperfusion. As an example, a stenotic large artery can lead to focal cerebral hypoperfusion, resulting in a watershed or borderzone infarct between two cerebrovascular territories. Perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) and arterial dissection are also potential mechanisms of ischemic stroke. The development of postsurgical systemic inflammatory response and the withholding of antithrombotic therapy in the perioperative period may also contribute to perioperative stroke risk.</p><p>In one series of 76 patients with stroke post-CABG, 75 percent were attributed to a cardioembolic source (aortic arch atherosclerosis or atrial fibrillation), 13 percent to small-vessel disease, and 5 to percent large artery stenosis, including carotid artery disease [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Risk factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are multiple risk factors for perioperative stroke with CABG.

In a study of over 900 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, the risk of perioperative stroke among patients with and without significant atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta was 9 versus 2 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>However, aortic stenosis may be a marker for high atherosclerotic burden and stroke risk and not a direct perioperative stroke mechanism in most patients. Predictors of aortic atherosclerosis are similar to predictors of generalized atherosclerosis and include older age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, kidney disease, peripheral artery disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease. Aortic atheromas that are large (≥5 mm thick) or mobile carry a higher risk of stroke [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Carotid stenosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The rate of stroke is elevated in patients with carotid stenosis who have CABG. However, similar to the presence of significant aortic atherosclerosis, carotid stenosis likely is a marker for high atherosclerotic burden and not often a direct perioperative stroke mechanism. The available data, summarized below, suggest that unilateral asymptomatic carotid stenosis of 50 to 99 percent is not an independent risk factor for ipsilateral ischemic stroke with CABG. By contrast, certain groups of patients with carotid artery disease appear to have an increased risk of stroke with CABG, including the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptomatic carotid stenosis of 50 to 99 percent in men and 70 to 99 percent in women</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bilateral asymptomatic stenosis of 80 to 99 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unilateral asymptomatic stenosis of 70 to 99 percent and contralateral carotid occlusion</p><p></p><p>However, the quality of the data is generally poor, since most studies are single-center, nonrandomized, and retrospective:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 2011 meta-analysis demonstrated that the risk of perioperative stroke after cardiac surgery was approximately 7 percent in those with ≥50 percent carotid stenosis and 9 percent in those with ≥80 percent stenosis, higher than the reported rate of 1.6 to 3 percent in the general population undergoing surgery [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The main stroke predictors were symptomatic carotid stenosis and bilateral carotid stenosis/occlusion. Exclusion of patients with prior stroke/TIA or those with complete occlusion of the carotid decreased the stroke risk to approximately 4 percent in the setting of 50 to 99 percent stenosis and 3 percent with 70 to 99 percent stenosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The presence of a recently symptomatic carotid artery stenosis probably increases the risk of a postoperative stroke in patients undergoing CABG, but there are few data directly addressing this question. In one study, 28 patients with prior symptomatic unilateral carotid disease did not undergo prophylactic carotid endarterectomy, and ischemic stroke occurred in 4 (14 percent) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. However, only one of the four strokes was attributed to ipsilateral carotid stenosis and was therefore potentially preventable by prophylactic carotid revascularization.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Asymptomatic carotid stenosis is not a proven independent risk factor for ipsilateral carotid territory ischemic stroke in patients having CABG [<a href="#rid12">12,21</a>]. The following represents a summary of the range of findings that have been noted in individual reports:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>One retrospective study of patients with preoperative carotid duplex ultrasound having CABG compared 117 patients who had severe asymptomatic carotid stenosis (≥75 percent) with 761 patients who did not have severe carotid stenosis [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Both groups had similar rates of in-hospital stroke (3.4 versus 3.6) and mortality (3.4 versus 4.2 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In another retrospective report, there were 18 patients with ≥50 percent carotid stenosis who had a perioperative ischemic stroke, but only 4 occurred in the territory of the stenotic or occluded carotid artery, and in 3 of these, the carotid was totally occluded on preoperative evaluation and not amenable to treatment [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Thus, only 1 of the 18 carotid territory strokes was potentially preventable by carotid intervention.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Since 2005, four studies have reported patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis of 70 to 99 percent (n = 156) or 50 to 99 percent (n = 42) who did not have prophylactic carotid revascularization; the rate of perioperative stroke with CABG in these patients was 0 percent [<a href="#rid12">12,23-26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">While not high-quality data, these studies suggest that patients with asymptomatic unilateral carotid artery stenoses are at little or no increased risk of perioperative stroke during CABG. As such, while it remains unresolved whether patients with asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis would benefit from revascularization, it appears more likely that carotid stenosis is merely a surrogate stroke risk marker associated with multiple other potential stroke risk factors and mechanisms, in which case carotid revascularization would be expected to have little or no benefit.</p><p></p><p>Although there is little direct evidence, it is plausible that characteristics of the carotid lesion, such as plaque morphology and the presence of downstream microemboli on transcranial Doppler, may impact the risk of perioperative stroke with CABG and therefore inform the need for revascularization [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10677841"><span class="h3">Prevalence and predictors of carotid stenosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The reported prevalence of carotid artery disease in patients undergoing CABG has varied from 2 to 22 percent, with an average of approximately 8 percent [<a href="#rid1">1,16,28-33</a>]. This wide variation in the reported incidence of carotid artery disease is related to the populations studied, the methods used for screening of carotid disease, how frequently screening was performed, and the definition of a significant carotid stenosis.</p><p>The prevalence of carotid artery disease in patients having CABG increases with age. One series found that the prevalence of high-grade (≥75 percent) carotid artery stenosis was three times higher in patients 60 years of age or older compared with younger patients (11.3 versus 3.8 percent) [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Clinical predictors other than age for significant carotid artery stenosis in patients considered for CABG include the following [<a href="#rid13">13,30</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diabetes</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Peripheral vascular disease</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Left main coronary artery stenosis ≥60 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Carotid bruit</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prior stroke or TIA</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prior vascular operation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Smoking</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Female sex</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H231789524"><span class="h1">PREVENTION OF PERIOPERATIVE STROKE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Strategies for prevention of stroke with coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Preoperative evaluation for identification and potential treatment of pre-existing stroke risk factors, including aortic atherosclerosis and carotid stenosis potentially associated with increased surgical risk (ie, symptomatic 50 to 99 percent stenosis, or bilateral asymptomatic stenosis of 80 to 99 percent, or unilateral asymptomatic stenosis of 70 to 99 percent and contralateral carotid occlusion) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1660.html" rel="external">"Neurologic complications of cardiac surgery"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Medical therapy, including the use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>, antiarrhythmic drugs, and statins (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1556.html" rel="external">"Coronary artery bypass surgery: Perioperative medical management"</a>)</p><p></p><p>Identification of aortic atherosclerosis is recommended to reduce the risk of perioperative stroke. Current guidelines endorse evaluation of the aorta by routine intraoperative epiaortic ultrasound to determine the severity of ascending aortic plaque in an effort to reduce perioperative emboli [<a href="#rid35">35-37</a>]. Although there have been no randomized controlled trials, lower perioperative stroke rates (0 to 1.4 percent) were reported when epiaortic ultrasound was utilized to guide surgical decisions, such as determination of sites for aortic cross-clamping and cannula placement [<a href="#rid38">38,39</a>]. Surgical methods that reduce aortic manipulation may decrease the incidence of cerebral embolization with CABG. When performing on-pump CABG surgery, performing the distal and proximal anastomoses under one crossclamp period may decrease the incidence of perioperative strokes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1558.html" rel="external">"Off-pump and minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Clinical use"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1585.html" rel="external">"Early noncardiac complications of coronary artery bypass graft surgery", section on 'Improvements in surgical technique'</a>.)</p><p>The evaluation for carotid disease and carotid revascularization is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Screening for carotid disease'</a> below and <a class="local">'Prophylactic carotid intervention'</a> below.)</p><p>A separate issue is that intracranial atherosclerosis leading to stenosis of the distal intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) or proximal large vessels of the circle of Willis is a common cause of stroke, particularly in people of Asian and African-American descent (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/131456.html" rel="external">"Intracranial large artery atherosclerosis: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Racial and ethnic differences'</a>). In patients with a recent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, aggressive medical management has been shown to be superior to endovascular stenting in patients with symptomatic intracranial 70 to 99 percent stenosis, due to the early risk of stroke following the procedure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1101.html" rel="external">"Intracranial large artery atherosclerosis: Treatment and prognosis", section on 'Secondary prevention'</a>.)</p><p>For long-term stroke risk reduction, all patients with significant cerebrovascular and cardiac disease, regardless of surgical intervention, warrant aggressive medical management for control of vascular risk factors, including use of a statin (with a goal LDL &lt;70 mg/dL) and assiduous blood pressure control. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1120.html" rel="external">"Overview of secondary prevention of ischemic stroke"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4378615"><span class="h2">Screening for carotid disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We agree with current guidelines from the American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, which recommend selective pre-CABG screening for carotid artery disease by carotid duplex ultrasound in patients who are ≥65 years old, have left main coronary disease, peripheral vascular disease, history of tobacco use, history of prior stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), or a carotid bruit [<a href="#rid35">35-37,40</a>]. The data supporting this recommendation is summarized above.

The major considerations include the following issues:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with asymptomatic unilateral carotid artery stenoses, who account for the majority of patients with carotid disease undergoing cardiac surgery, appear to be at little or no increase in risk of perioperative stroke during CABG (see <a class="local">'Carotid stenosis'</a> above). Thus, any potential benefit of carotid intervention is likely to be offset by the procedural risks [<a href="#rid21">21,43-45</a>]. A systematic review suggested that at least one-half of perioperative strokes are not preventable by carotid intervention, as 50 percent of patients with stroke did not have significant carotid stenosis, and 60 percent of strokes identified radiographically or by autopsy could not be attributed to carotid disease [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. A controlled trial randomly assigned 129 patients with asymptomatic high-grade internal carotid artery stenosis who required CABG surgery to synchronous (ie, combined) carotid endarterectomy (CEA) plus CABG or to CABG alone [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. The study was stopped early due to slow recruitment and withdrawal of funding. At 30 days, the rate of any stroke or death was higher for the group assigned to combined CEA plus CABG group compared with the group assigned to CABG alone (18.5 versus 9.7 percent, 95% CI -3.2 to 20.8 percent) but the difference was not statistically significant. This difference persisted throughout follow-up, with a nonsignificant higher rate of stroke or death at five years for the CEA plus CABG group (40.6 versus 35.0 percent) [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. All patients were examined by a neurologist, which may explain in part the relatively high overall event rates compared with historical data. Although not definitive, these results suggest that combined CEA plus CABG is not beneficial and may be harmful for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>As noted above, the benefit of carotid revascularization with CEA or carotid stenting in patients requiring CABG has not been systematically addressed. In the general population (ie, patients who do not require concomitant cardiac surgery), large randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the benefit of CEA for patients who have asymptomatic carotid stenosis of 60 to 99 percent, provided that their perioperative risk is less than 3 percent and their life expectancy is at least five years. Similarly, major clinical trials have established clear benefit of CEA compared with medical treatment for patients who have symptomatic carotid disease, provided that their perioperative risk is less than 6 percent. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1113.html" rel="external">"Management of asymptomatic extracranial carotid atherosclerotic disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1106.html" rel="external">"Management of symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">One major caveat regarding these data is that optimal medical management of stroke risk factors has evolved since the major trials of CEA were conducted (generally the late 1980s through early 2000s), particularly with regard to use of statin therapy for management of hypercholesterolemia, more aggressive lipid and blood pressure goals, and the availability of newer antiplatelet agents. In reports published since the mid-2000s, rates of stroke in patients with significant carotid stenosis who are managed on medical therapy have declined when compared with those who were enrolled in the earlier surgical trials. Accumulating data suggest that aggressive medical therapy alone may be appropriate treatment for patients with asymptomatic carotid disease (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1113.html" rel="external">"Management of asymptomatic extracranial carotid atherosclerotic disease", section on 'Intensive medical therapy and follow-up'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1106.html" rel="external">"Management of symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease", section on 'Intensive medical management'</a>). Moreover, the trials that established the benefit of CEA excluded patients who had a recent (within six months) history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina. As a result, the applicability of these data to patients undergoing CABG is uncertain. Ongoing randomized trials comparing contemporary revascularization techniques with advanced medical therapy may better inform these issues.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Existing data are conflicting with regard to the benefit of carotid revascularization in patients with a severe (ie, 80 to 99 percent) carotid stenosis who also require cardiac surgery:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a nonrandomized study of patients with 80 to 99 percent carotid stenosis, there were no neurologic events in 53 patients undergoing CEA and CABG, compared with the development of a permanent neurologic defect in 3 of 15 patients undergoing CABG alone [<a href="#rid47">47</a>].

As a result, the strategy of CAS immediately prior to CABG is not recommended, since the incidence of perioperative bleeding would be significantly increased. This risk is illustrated by results from the nonrandomized SHARP study of 101 patients who had same-day CAS and CABG [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. All patients received aspirin beginning at least three days before carotid stenting, and clopidogrel was started within 6 to 10 hours after the end of CABG. At 30 days, major bleeding occurred in four patients (4 percent), a rate we consider four times higher than acceptable or expected for CABG. Furthermore, this major bleeding risk could exceed the risk of stroke and thus outweigh any potential benefit from the carotid procedure.</p><p>Thus, patients who need immediate CABG and who require a carotid intervention should have an open CEA rather than a stenting procedure. For patients with significant coronary heart disease, CAS can be considered only if the CABG is not urgent. Such patients could receive a carotid stent with dual antiplatelet therapy for a circumscribed amount of time, followed by CABG surgery.</p><p>A systematic review published in 2009 identified 11 studies with 760 patients who had staged CAS followed by CABG, which was done at different time intervals in individual studies, ranging from immediately after stenting to a mean of 70 days after stenting [<a href="#rid50">50</a>].

Most of the cardiac procedures (92 percent) involved CABG, either alone or combined with other cardiac interventions such as valve surgery.

As noted previously (see <a class="local">'Comparative studies'</a> above), retrospective data suggest that perioperative complication rates are probably similar with combined CEA and CABG compared with CEA before CABG. In addition, performing CEA during cardiopulmonary bypass does not appear to increase the incidence of bleeding or prolong hospital stay [<a href="#rid59">59-61</a>].</p><p>Our preference is to perform the CEA before cardiopulmonary bypass. After general anesthesia is induced and the patient is prepared for operation and draped, the CEA team proceeds to expose the carotid artery. Simultaneously, the cardiac team is harvesting the saphenous vein or the radial artery, if such grafts are necessary. The CEA is performed using systemic heparinization and a shunt. Once the CEA is completed, the heparin is not reversed, and the neck wound is packed but not closed. The chest is opened, the internal mammary artery is harvested, and the patient is placed on cardiopulmonary bypass, and the revascularization is completed. After the heparin is reversed, the neck excision is carefully checked for bleeding and the wound is closed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H48343353"><span class="h1">TIMING OF CABG AFTER STROKE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with a prior history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) have an increased risk of perioperative stroke with coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) (see <a class="local">'Risk factors'</a> above), which may be as high as 8.5 percent [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. The optimal timing of CABG surgery following a stroke has not been systematically addressed and depends upon multiple factors, including how recently the stroke occurred, the size of the stroke, the risk of stroke recurrence (which is in turn dependent on the stroke mechanism), and the urgency of cardiac intervention. A study of 14,030 patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement in Denmark, including 616 with prior stroke, reported a high risk of adverse events if the surgery was performed early after stroke, but the risk declined over time and stabilized after three months [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]. Unless urgent cardiac revascularization is necessary, surgery should be delayed pending a thorough work-up for the stroke mechanism, including evaluation for large artery stenosis and any cardioembolic source, to clarify the risk of subsequent stroke and ensure appropriate stroke prevention therapies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1119.html" rel="external">"Overview of secondary prevention for specific causes of ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack"</a>.)</p><p>Optimal timing of cardiac surgery should also include a sufficient delay to allow for poststroke recovery of autoregulatory capabilities of the cerebral vasculature prior to exposure to periprocedural hypotension, and for sufficient remodeling of the damaged parenchyma to decrease the risk of hemorrhagic transformation of the infarct. Deferral of cardiac surgery for several weeks is suggested, although patients with large strokes (ie, those with damage involving the majority of a vascular territory or a sizeable portion of multiple territories) would likely benefit from additional delay.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2212694396"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
