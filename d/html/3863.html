In the United States, for example, hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure ≥130 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥80 mmHg was observed in 76 percent of adults aged 65 to 74 years and 82 percent of adults aged 75 years or older who were participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Hypertension control rates are lower among older patients. In the same study mentioned above, control of blood pressure to &lt;130/&lt;80 mmHg among those taking antihypertensive drug therapy was achieved by 54, 50, 46, and 33 percent of individuals aged 20 to 54 years, 55 to 64 years, 65 to 74 years, and 75 or more years, respectively [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>A related issue is the risk of developing hypertension over time in an older adult who is normotensive. This issue was addressed in two reports from the Framingham Heart Study that defined hypertension as a systolic pressure ≥140 and/or a diastolic pressure ≥90 mmHg:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One study examined the incidence of hypertension (defined as blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg or use of antihypertensive drug) over a four-year period among individuals who initially had optimal (less than 120/80 mmHg), normal (120 to 129/80 to 84 mmHg), or high-normal (130 to 139/85 to 89 mmHg) blood pressure [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. There was a progressive increase in the frequency of development of hypertension in patients over age 65 years (16, 26, and 50 percent in the optimal, normal, and high-normal groups, respectively). Similar findings were noted in younger individuals, but the rates of progression were lower.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The second report estimated that individuals aged 55 to 65 years who do not have hypertension have a <strong>90 percent</strong> lifetime risk of developing mild hypertension (blood pressure 140 to 159/90 to 99 mmHg) and a <strong>40 percent</strong> lifetime risk of developing more severe hypertension (blood pressure ≥160/≥100 mmHg) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p>Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) and the efficacy of antihypertensive drug therapy in older adults are presented in this topic. The diagnosis and evaluation of hypertension and our recommendations about goal blood pressure are discussed elsewhere:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3852.html" rel="external">"Overview of hypertension in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3849.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation of adults with hypertension"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3861.html" rel="external">"Goal blood pressure in adults with hypertension"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ISOLATED SYSTOLIC HYPERTENSION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ISH has often been defined as a systolic blood pressure above 160 mmHg, with a diastolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]. However, using definitions from the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guideline [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], a systolic pressure of 130 mmHg is the upper limit of normal at all ages.</p><p>ISH mostly occurs in older patients. Data from the Framingham Heart Study and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) have shown that the systolic pressure rises and the diastolic pressure falls after age 60 years in both normotensive and untreated hypertensive subjects [<a href="#rid9">9</a>] and that ISH accounts for 60 to 80 percent of cases of hypertension in older adults [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. Furthermore, the systolic and pulse pressures appear to be the major predictors of coronary disease in older adults; in contrast, diastolic pressure is the major predictor under age 50 years, and all three indices were equal predictors between the ages of 50 and 59 years [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>The elevation in pulse pressure in patients with ISH is primarily due to diminished arterial compliance. ISH may also result from an increase in cardiac output due to anemia, hyperthyroidism, aortic insufficiency, arteriovenous fistula, or Paget disease of bone [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>ISH (when defined as a systolic pressure ≥140 mmHg and diastolic pressure &lt;90 mmHg) is associated with a two- to fourfold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, left ventricular hypertrophy, kidney dysfunction, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. Even in patients who also have diastolic hypertension, the cardiovascular risk correlates more closely with the systolic than the diastolic blood pressure [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Importance of diastolic pressure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among older adults, coronary heart disease risk varies directly with the systolic and pulse pressures and inversely with the diastolic pressure (ie, lower diastolic pressures are associated with increased risk) [<a href="#rid6">6,12,17,18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3861.html" rel="external">"Goal blood pressure in adults with hypertension"</a>.)</p><p>The relative importance of the systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures is different in younger patients [<a href="#rid12">12,17</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3858.html" rel="external">"Increased pulse pressure"</a>.)</p><p>However, the observations concerning worse outcomes in older adult patients with lower diastolic pressures primarily came from population studies or from baseline blood pressures in clinical trials, not after treatment in clinical trials. In the SHEP trial, for example, the mean baseline blood pressure was 170/77 mmHg and the attained blood pressure was 143/68 mmHg in the treated group and 155/72 in the placebo group; the mean age was 72 years [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Despite the low attained diastolic pressure, the treated group had significantly better outcomes, including fewer coronary heart disease events. A similar mean systolic blood pressure and higher diastolic blood pressure (143/78 mmHg) were attained in the treated group in the HYVET trial of the very old (mean age 84 years) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. (See <a class="local">'SHEP trial'</a> below and <a class="local">'HYVET trial'</a> below.)</p><p>When treating older adult patients with ISH, there are no clear data that provide guidance related to the minimum diastolic blood pressure that can be tolerated. An analysis from the SHEP trial found significant increases in cardiovascular events in the active treatment group when the diastolic blood pressure was ≤60 mmHg [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. A J-curve was also noted in other studies. In the observational Rotterdam study, for example, an increased stroke risk began at diastolic pressures below 65 mmHg [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. In the INVEST trial of hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease, an increased risk of myocardial infarction began at diastolic pressures between 61 and 70 mmHg and increased approximately 2.5-fold at diastolic pressures ≤60 mmHg; however, this association was blunted among those who had undergone coronary revascularization [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p>These observations do not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between lower diastolic pressures and adverse outcomes. In a meta-analysis that included two trials of ISH, a J-shaped curve for mortality was noted with both systolic pressure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80901" href="/d/graphic/80901.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) and diastolic pressure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73430" href="/d/graphic/73430.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. However, a J-curve was seen in treated and untreated patients and was not specific for cardiovascular mortality. The authors concluded that the J-curve is probably explained by poor health associated with lower blood pressures, not an adverse effect of antihypertensive therapy  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef122149" href="/d/graphic/122149.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>).</p><p>In summary, although adverse outcomes that can be ascribed only to excessive blood pressure lowering with antihypertensive drugs are probably not common in patients with ISH, cardiovascular events can occur if the diastolic pressure is reduced below the level needed to maintain perfusion to vital organs, particularly the heart. We suggest a minimum posttreatment diastolic pressure, when using typical office-based measurements, of 60 mmHg overall. (See <a class="local">'Goal blood pressure'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">EVIDENCE FOR EFFICACY OF BLOOD PRESSURE LOWERING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment of hypertension in all patients, independent of age, consists of lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive therapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Lifestyle modifications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As in younger patients, lifestyle modifications (eg, dietary salt restriction, weight loss in patients with obesity) can lower the blood pressure in older adult patients with hypertension. Weight loss should be approached more cautiously in patients &gt;80 years old due to the potential for malnutrition, especially in frail patients with limited functionality [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3852.html" rel="external">"Overview of hypertension in adults", section on 'Nonpharmacologic therapy'</a>.)</p><p>In particular, dietary sodium intake should be moderately restricted to 100 to 120 mEq/day (2300 to 2800 mg/day) since the pressor effect of sodium excess and the antihypertensive efficacy of sodium restriction progressively increase with age [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3878.html" rel="external">"Diet in the treatment and prevention of hypertension"</a>.)</p><p>The efficacy of salt restriction and weight loss in older adult patients with hypertension was demonstrated in the Trial of Nonpharmacologic Interventions in the Elderly (TONE) including 975 older persons (aged 60 to 80) who had a blood pressure &lt;145/&lt;85 mmHg on one antihypertensive drug; of these, 585 had obesity [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Patients were randomly assigned to usual care or salt restriction, and for subjects with obesity, weight loss or a combination intervention of salt restriction and weight loss. Those assigned to salt restriction had a 40 mEq/day decrease in sodium excretion; in those with obesity, a regimen of diminished caloric intake and increased physical activity was associated with a persistent weight loss of 4.7 kg. These parameters remained unchanged in the usual care group. After three months of intervention, withdrawal of the antihypertensive drug was attempted.</p><p>Older adults in TONE were relatively healthy and did not include individuals &gt;80 years old [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Significant reductions in muscle mass, strength, and bone mineral density can occur with weight loss in older adults; though, these effects are minimized with concomitant aerobic and resistance exercise. Given the evidence, the 2023 European Society of Hypertension guideline does not recommend weight loss for adults 80 years and older unless obesity is severe and there are no concerns for frailty or malnutrition [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. In these individuals, weight loss together with physical activity, including resistance exercise, is advised to minimize adverse effects.</p><p>The primary endpoint was a diagnosis of high blood pressure, treatment with antihypertensive drugs, or a cardiovascular event at 30 months. Compared with usual care, blood pressure reduction was 2.6/1.1 mmHg greater with salt restriction alone, 3.2/0.3 mmHg greater with weight loss alone, and 4.5/2.6 mmHg greater with both interventions. The primary endpoint occurred less often in patients receiving active interventions compared with those receiving usual care; specifically, rates were lower with salt restriction alone (62 versus 76 percent) and, in those with obesity, weight reduction alone (61 versus 74 percent), and the combination of salt restriction and weight reduction (56 versus 84 percent).</p><p>Older patients may have difficulty complying with dietary salt restriction for two reasons:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>They may ingest more salt to compensate for a decrease in taste sensitivity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>They may depend more upon processed, prepackaged foods that are high in sodium rather than fresh foods that are low in sodium.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Antihypertensive therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Randomized trials have provided clear evidence of benefit from treating hypertension in older adult patients, including those over the age of 80 years  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef83927" href="/d/graphic/83927.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6,19,20,29-32</a>]. Most of these trials involved patients with ISH, but some had diastolic hypertension. In addition, trials of patients with diastolic hypertension included some older adult patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Meta-analysis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A 2000 meta-analysis included eight outcome trials of 15,693 patients ≥60 years of age with ISH (including SHEP, Syst-Eur, and MRC described below) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. At a median follow-up of 3.8 years, the number of patients who needed to be treated for five years to prevent one major cardiovascular event was 26. The number needed to be treated was lower in males (18 versus 38 in females [percent of patients benefitting 5.6 and 2.6 percent, respectively]), patients aged 70 or more years (19 versus 39 in patients under age 70 years [percent of patients benefitting 5.3 and 2.6 percent, respectively]), and those with previous cardiovascular events (16 versus 37 without such a history [percent of patients benefitting 6.3 and 2.6 percent, respectively]).</p><p>Total mortality correlated directly with systolic blood pressure at study entry, but inversely with diastolic blood pressure. However, the diastolic blood pressure was not significantly associated with outcome for combined fatal and nonfatal events.</p><p>These results underestimate the true benefit of effectively treating versus not treating ISH, as illustrated by findings in the SHEP trial described in the next section [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Only approximately 70 percent of treated patients reached goal blood pressure during the study, yet the outcomes of the nonresponders were included in the analysis. In addition, increases in blood pressure necessitated the institution of antihypertensive medications in 13 percent of placebo-treated patients at one year and 44 percent at five years.</p><p>The trials in the meta-analysis all had baseline mean systolic pressures of 160 mmHg or more [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In addition, these trials failed to achieve a systolic pressure less than 140 mmHg, although two trials with favorable outcomes attained a mean systolic pressure between 140 and 145 mmHg. No trials have been performed in patients with ISH with baseline systolic pressures of 140 to 159 mmHg [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">SHEP trial</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) trial included 4376 older adult patients (mean age 72 years) with a mean blood pressure of 170/77 mmHg at baseline [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. The patients were randomly assigned to antihypertensive therapy or placebo; the aim of therapy was at least a 20 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure to a level below 160 mmHg. Treatment began with 12.5 mg/day of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9255" href="/d/drug information/9255.html" rel="external">chlorthalidone</a>, which was then increased to 25 mg/day if necessary. Almost one-half of patients reached goal pressure solely with low-dose chlorthalidone. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8940" href="/d/drug information/8940.html" rel="external">Atenolol</a> or reserpine was added if a further antihypertensive response was required.</p><p>The attained blood pressures were 143/68 mmHg with active therapy and 155/72 mmHg with placebo. Despite the potential risk of the relatively low diastolic pressures, the incidence of stroke at four to five years was significantly lower in treated patients (5.5 versus 8.2 percent with placebo)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58205" href="/d/graphic/58205.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). A similar one-third to one-quarter reduction was noted in the incidence of cardiac events, although this trend was not quite statistically significant [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. These benefits were noted in both males and females and in all age groups, including patients over the age of 80 years, who were the focus of the HYVET trial. (See <a class="local">'HYVET trial'</a> below.)</p><p>Further analyses demonstrated that active therapy was associated with a reduction in left ventricular mass index (-13 versus +6 percent with placebo) [<a href="#rid35">35</a>] and that the reduction in cardiovascular events was not seen in the 7.2 percent of patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium less than 3.5 mEq/L) [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Syst-Eur trial</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Syst-Eur trial randomly assigned 4695 patients over age 59 years (mean age 70 years) with ISH (mean initial sitting blood pressure of 174/86 mmHg) to therapy with placebo or nitrendipine plus, if necessary, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9405" href="/d/drug information/9405.html" rel="external">enalapril</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8529" href="/d/drug information/8529.html" rel="external">hydrochlorothiazide</a> [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. The fall in blood pressure was greater with active therapy (23/7 versus 13/2 mmHg).</p><p>At four years, significant reductions were noted in stroke (7.9 versus 13.7 total endpoints per 1000 patient-years), and fatal and nonfatal cardiac endpoints. It was estimated that treatment of 1000 patients for five years would prevent 53 cardiovascular endpoints and 29 strokes.

Goal blood pressure, and specifically our recommended goal blood pressure for different patient populations, is discussed in detail elsewhere. In general, however, our recommendation for most hypertensive older adults is to attain a systolic pressure of 125 to 135 mmHg if standard manual blood pressure measurements are used or a systolic pressure of 120 to 125 mmHg if unattended, automated office measurements are used. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3879.html" rel="external">"Blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3861.html" rel="external">"Goal blood pressure in adults with hypertension"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3829.html" rel="external">"Treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7169.html" rel="external">"Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3823.html" rel="external">"Antihypertensive therapy for secondary stroke prevention"</a>.)</p><p>Goal blood pressure in older adults was examined in the Systolic Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) [<a href="#rid74">74</a>]. SPRINT enrolled a subgroup of more than 2600 ambulatory adults aged 75 years or older with a baseline blood pressure of 142/71 mmHg (consistent with ISH), including 349 categorized as being fit, 1456 as less fit, and 815 as frail according to a validated frailty index. At 3.1 years, rates of both the primary cardiovascular endpoint and all-cause mortality were significantly lower among those assigned more intensive (mean achieved unattended, automated systolic blood pressure 123) versus less intensive (mean achieved automated, unattended systolic blood pressure 135) blood pressure lowering (2.6 versus 3.8 percent and 1.8 versus 2.6 percent, respectively). The benefit from more intensive blood pressure control was present in both fit and frail older adults. Serious adverse events were similar in the two treatment groups and did not depend upon frailty.</p><p>A meta-analysis of 10,857 hypertensive adults aged 65 years or older combined these results from SPRINT with three other large randomized goal blood pressure trials [<a href="#rid75">75</a>]. After a mean follow-up of 3.1 years, more intensive, versus less intensive, blood pressure lowering reduced the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (3.7 versus 5.2 percent), cardiovascular mortality (1.1 versus 1.7 percent), and heart failure (1.3 versus 2.0 percent). Rates of stroke and myocardial infarction were also lower, but the results were not statistically significant.</p><p>In a subsequent trial, 8511 older Chinese adults were randomly assigned to an intensive blood pressure goal (systolic pressure 110 to 129 mmHg) or a standard goal (systolic pressure 130 to 159 mmHg); mean age was 66 years and mean baseline blood pressure was 146/82 mmHg [<a href="#rid76">76</a>]. Achieved systolic pressure was 127 mmHg in the intensive group and 135 mmHg in the standard group. At 3.3 years, intensive blood pressure control reduced the rates of stroke (1.1 versus 1.7 percent), acute coronary syndrome (1.3 versus 1.9 percent), and acute heart failure (0.1 versus 0.3 percent); all-cause mortality did not differ between the groups.</p><p>Blood pressure goals may not be easy to achieve, particularly in older patients with a baseline systolic pressure greater than 160 mmHg. If attaining goal blood pressure proves difficult or overly burdensome for the patient, the systolic pressure that is reached with two or three antihypertensive agents (even if above target) may be a reasonable interim goal. Once maximally tolerated therapy is reached and blood pressure control remains suboptimal, then additional efforts to engage older adults in healthful lifestyle change can facilitate better blood pressure control.</p><p>One potential limitation to achieving goal blood pressure is that lowering the blood pressure may impair mental function, leading to manifestations such as confusion or sleepiness. In such patients, antihypertensive therapy should be reduced, and the systolic pressure should be allowed to rise to a level at which these symptoms resolve.</p><p>Another concern when treating older adult patients with ISH is that the low diastolic pressure after therapy may impair tissue perfusion (particularly coronary perfusion) and possibly increase cardiovascular risk [<a href="#rid6">6,12,17,18</a>]. However, as noted above, lower diastolic blood pressures are associated with worse outcomes (both cardiovascular and noncardiovascular) in both treated and untreated patients  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73430" href="/d/graphic/73430.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. These findings suggest that the worse outcomes are probably explained by poor health associated with lower blood pressures, not an adverse effect of antihypertensive therapy. (See <a class="local">'Importance of diastolic pressure'</a> above.)</p><p>Despite these observations, there may be a threshold diastolic blood pressure below which adverse cardiovascular outcomes might increase in older adult patients, particularly coronary heart disease outcomes. When treating patients with ISH, some suggest a minimum posttreatment diastolic pressure of 55 to 60 mmHg (using office-based blood pressure) [<a href="#rid21">21,23</a>]. However, lowering the systolic pressure to goal, even if the diastolic pressure falls below this threshold, may reduce the risk of stroke (while potentially increasing coronary events) [<a href="#rid77">77</a>], and therefore shared decision-making is appropriate.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3019491480"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Isolated systolic hypertension</strong> – Isolated systolic hypertension, which is common in older adults, has been defined as a systolic blood pressure equal to or above 160 mmHg, with a diastolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg. Some expert panels, however, have defined 130 mmHg as the upper limit of normal at all ages. (See <a class="local">'Isolated systolic hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lifestyle modifications</strong> – Nonpharmacologic measures, particularly dietary salt restriction and weight loss in patients with obesity, are an essential component of therapy. If goal blood pressure is not attained with lifestyle modification, antihypertensive therapy should be initiated. (See <a class="local">'Lifestyle modifications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>General principles of drug therapy</strong> – In the absence of a hypertensive emergency or urgency, blood pressure reduction should always be gradual in older adults, aiming for control within two to four months. Lower initial doses (approximately one-half that in younger patients) should be used to minimize the risk of side effects; though, older adults may ultimately require additional dose titration and more antihypertensive medications to achieve adequate control than younger individuals. When starting with lower doses, monthly follow-up visits for medication titration may be necessary to control the blood pressure in an appropriate time frame. (See <a class="local">'Drug therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A potential limiting factor to the use of antihypertensive drugs is that orthostatic (postural) and/or postprandial hypotension is common among older hypertensive patients, increasing fall risk. (See <a class="local">'Problem of orthostatic hypotension'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Choice of antihypertensive drugs</strong> – Among older hypertensive patients who require antihypertensive medication and who do not have an indication for a specific drug, initial monotherapy consists of a low-dose thiazide-type diuretic, a long-acting calcium channel blocker, or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker. Choice of antihypertensive therapy is presented in detail separately.
