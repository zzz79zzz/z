Congenital cystic kidney diseases may become clinically apparent in the fetus, child, or adult. These disorders have a wide spectrum of outcomes depending on whether there is unilateral or bilateral involvement, contralateral disease or compensatory hypertrophy in unilateral cases, other organ involvement, and the extent of kidney damage determined by characteristics of the syndrome complex, if any.</p><p>In children, a larger proportion of kidney cysts are due to genetic diseases as compared with adults. A monogenic disease is identified in 50 to 70 percent of cases with two or more kidney cysts and/or increased cortical echogenicity. In cases with extrarenal anomalies, the risk of a chromosomal anomaly is increased. Genetic pathology is less common for solitary cysts with normal kidney parenchyma and in isolated unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) or cystic dysplasia [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>Ultrasound is the most common imaging method for diagnosis of fetal kidney cystic diseases. Congenital cystic kidney diseases that can be diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound examination will be reviewed here. The diagnosis, clinical manifestations, and prognosis of kidney cysts and cystic disorders in children are discussed separately, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6110.html" rel="external">"Overview of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT)"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6144.html" rel="external">"Kidney cystic diseases in children"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15319.html" rel="external">"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in children"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6138.html" rel="external">"Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2284604749"><span class="h1">PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS OF CYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Fetal cystic kidney disease is characterized by small or large cysts and kidney hyperechogenicity on ultrasound examination; however, many times, the cysts are not visible and the main finding is hyperechogenic kidneys. Kidney cystic structures can be localized to the cortex, medulla, or both, and may represent dilated tubules, glomerular cystic dilation, or real cysts. Kidney hyperechogenicity is secondary to the numerous interfaces created by microscopic cysts and dilated tubules and to interstitial fibrosis and inflammation [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p>To assess hyperechogenicity, cortical echogenicity is compared with the liver and spleen and medullar echogenicity is compared with cortical echogenicity. In one study of normal fetuses serially examined after 20 weeks, cortical echogenicity evolved from a hyperechoic pattern as compared with liver and spleen during the early second trimester to a hypoechogenic pattern in the third trimester, with no fetus displaying cortical hyperechogenicity after 32 weeks [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. At 21 to 25 weeks, the most frequent pattern (present in 92 percent) was hyperechogenicity of the kidney cortex, whereas hypoechogenicity was the most common pattern at 34 to 37 weeks (present in 70 percent). A hypoechoic medulla compared with the renal cortex was present in all cases. </p><p>Ultrasound examination of fetuses with cystic kidney changes or hyperechogenic kidneys also includes assessment of [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Kidney size</strong> – Maximal midsagittal length, width, and depth at the level of the hilum should be measured, and kidney volume should be calculated using 2D or 3D imaging [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. These measurements are compared with population standards. Echogenic kidneys less than four standard deviation above the mean without cysts and with normal amniotic fluid volume may represent a variant of normal [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Corticomedullary differentiation (CMD)</strong> – The absence of CMD and increased or reversed CMD are concerning for a fetal kidney pathology [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Normal CMD is defined as a relatively hyperechoic cortex compared with the medulla. CMD can be visualized starting at 15 to 16 weeks and becomes more prominent at 20 weeks [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Amniotic fluid volume</strong> – In the second half of pregnancy, amniotic fluid volume is produced by fetal kidneys and lungs [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Therefore, normal amniotic fluid volume is the best predictor of normal fetal kidney function. Oligohydramnios is a marker of impaired fetal kidney function, but has several other etiologies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6777.html" rel="external">"Oligohydramnios: Etiology, diagnosis, and management in singleton gestations"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H29937740"><span class="h1">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several classification systems for congenital cystic kidney disease have been proposed, considering the pathologic, clinical, and genetic features of these disorders [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].

Other appropriate genetic testing, including molecular genetic investigation for monogenic disease, are discussed depending on the nature of the kidney abnormality, extrarenal abnormalities, and family history.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H565539937"><span class="h1">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Uniformly echogenic fetal kidneys without visible macrocysts are a common incidental finding on obstetric ultrasound examination. It is essential to differentiate significant kidney disease from normal variants, which are characterized by normal kidney size, moderately bright cortex, visible corticomedullary differentiation (after 20 weeks of gestation), normal bladder size, and normal amniotic fluid volume [<a href="#rid9">9,12</a>]. Since nephrogenesis is not completed until the third trimester until 32 to 36 weeks, an early diagnosis may be a false-positive result [<a href="#rid10">10,13</a>]. Serial scans can be helpful to assess the amniotic fluid volume and the appearance of the kidneys over time in such cases. In general, isolated normal or slightly increased kidney size and normal amniotic fluid volume predict a good outcome [<a href="#rid8">8,14</a>]. However, prenatal ultrasound alone cannot predict etiology or long-term outcome in the absence of family history, postmortem, or postnatal data. Diagnosis of an associated malformation may be more helpful than the cystic characteristics and pinpoint a syndromic etiology [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>The ultrasonographic differential diagnosis of enlarged hyperechogenic kidneys, with or without cysts, includes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD; significantly enlarged kidneys with reniform shape, loss of corticomedullary differentiation, subcortical hypoechoic rim, cysts [if visible] predominantly in the medulla, reduced amniotic fluid volume).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD; kidneys moderately enlarged, amniotic fluid volume usually normal, increased corticomedullary differentiation, cysts [if present] usually in cortical location, but rarely presents in the prenatal period).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Obstructive dysplasia (hyperechogenic kidneys, cortical cysts with or without dilated upper or lower urinary tract).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Multicystic dysplasia (usually unilateral, reniform shape not preserved, kidney enlarged by randomly distributed large size cysts that do not connect, without normal renal parenchyma). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Syndromes that present with hyperechogenic kidneys and/or kidney cysts are differentiated by the associated anomalies. In one study, the final diagnosis in 93 fetuses presenting with hyperechogenic kidneys who went on to develop nephropathy was ARPKD (33 percent), ADPKD (30 percent), Bardet-Biedl syndrome (12 percent), Meckel-Gruber syndrome (10 percent), Ivemark II syndrome (6 percent), trisomy 18 (5 percent), Jarcho-Levin syndrome (spondylothoracic dysplasia; 1/93), Beemer syndrome (narrow ribs, micromelia, with or without polydactyly; 1/93), and Meckel-like syndrome (1/93) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Another case series of 98 fetuses with bilateral polycystic kidneys reported the three most common diagnoses were ARPKD (53.1 percent), Meckel-Gruber syndrome (17.3 percent), and ADPKD (2 percent); other diagnoses included Joubert, Jeune, McKusick-Kaufman, and Bardet-Biedl syndromes, overgrowth syndromes, Mainzer-Saldino syndrome, and renal tubular dysgenesis [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p></p><p>Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be helpful for identifying extrarenal anomalies in cases with oligohydramnios and to rule out sacrococcygeal teratoma in cases of a pelvic ectopic multicystic dysplastic kidney. Fetal MRI can also help in differentiating ARPKD from congenital kidney cystic diseases without medullary involvement. For example, in one study, MRI of two fetuses with enlarged hyperechoic kidneys showed localized medullary hyperintense lesions suggesting ARPKD in one fetus and medullary cystic dysplasia in the other fetus with Jeune's syndrome [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12017265"><span class="h1">HEREDITARY DISORDERS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most of the hereditary cystic kidney diseases are due to primary ciliopathies. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common ciliopathy in this group of disorders. The prevalence of these inherited disorders is approximately 1:2000 [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p>Primary ciliopathies are secondary to single gene variants that lead to defective proteins and abnormal ciliary formation or function. The cumulative prevalence of primary ciliopathies is 1:2000. The primary cilium or "immobile" cilium is a microtubule base organelle that extends from the cell surface and is present in almost all vertebrate cells. The cilia transduce molecular signals from the extracellular environment, acting as "antennae" for the cell. Primary cilia can be found in the nephron tubule and in the collecting ducts where they contribute to the flow of the urine and, indirectly, to its composition and osmolality.</p><p>Ciliopathies share clinical features with a considerable genetic and phenotypic overlap. Primary cilia are found on the surface of almost every mammalian cell type. As such, ciliopathies often involve multiple organ systems. They commonly present with cystic changes in the kidneys, hepatobiliary disease, pancreatic cysts or dysplasia, cerebellar abnormalities, retinal degeneration, colobomas of the retina and iris, polydactyly, abnormal bone growth, and obesity [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. ADPKD, ARPKD, and nephronophthisis are the most common causes and mainly present with hepatorenal system findings. Other ciliopathies involve multiorgan systems.</p><p>As such, differential diagnosis depends on the location of kidney involvement typical of the disease, family history, and associated anomalies [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3115620038"><span class="h3">Overview</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Epidemiology </strong>– ADPKD is the most common inherited kidney cystic disease. The estimated incidence at birth is 1:400 to 1000 deliveries [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. ADPKD rarely presents in utero (&lt;1 percent of cases) or in the neonatal period with ultrasound changes. The typical age of clinical onset is in the third to fifth decade of life. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Natural history</strong> – ADPKD is characterized by the slow development (over decades) of large spherical cystic dilation in all parts of the nephron, although the initial differentiation to nephrons and the collecting system is normal. The kidney pathology is focal with areas of abnormal nephrons scattered among areas of normal nephrons. The tubule wall, which is lined by a single layer of epithelial cells, expands, and then rapidly closes off from the tubule of origin as true cysts. This is different from ARPKD in which cysts are derived from collecting tubules and remain connected to the nephron of origin [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Initially, cysts may be localized to the distal nephron and the collecting duct; in later stages, they are spread to both the cortex and medulla. As the cysts enlarge, they severely compromise the functional integrity of the remaining normal parenchyma. Approximately 50 percent of ADPKD patients will progress to end-stage kidney disease, requiring transplant or dialysis by late middle age. The kidney manifestations, ex utero diagnosis, course of this disorder in children, and treatment are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15319.html" rel="external">"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1677.html" rel="external">"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD): Treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Extrarenal abnormalities</strong> – Extrarenal abnormalities include cysts in other organs, such as the liver, seminal vesicles (in males), pancreas, and arachnoid membrane. There also may be noncystic abnormalities, such as intracranial and coronary artery aneurysms and dolichoectasia, aortic root dilation and aneurysms, mitral valve prolapse, and abdominal wall hernias [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1679.html" rel="external">"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD): Extrarenal manifestations"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Fetal findings</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Kidneys</strong> – Typically, the kidneys appear normal prenatally. The rare prenatal presentation of ADPKD is characterized by moderately enlarged kidneys (1 to 2 standard deviations above the mean size for gestational age) with a hyperechogenic cortex (25 of 27 cases [93 percent] in one series [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]). The medulla can be hypoechogenic or hyperechogenic. A hypoechogenic medulla resulting in increased corticomedullary differentiation was reported in 20 of 26 (77 percent) prenatally diagnosed cases; absent or decreased corticomedullary differentiation with hyperechoic medulla was less frequent [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Cysts are seen in approximately 15 percent of prenatal cases and are usually in the cortex. Very rarely, one kidney may be larger than the other, suggesting unilateral disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The ultrasonographic appearance of the kidneys may not allow certain differentiation of autosomal recessive from autosomal dominant disease [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. ARPKD kidneys in utero are markedly enlarged (4 to 15 standard deviations above the mean), hyperechoic, and display "decreased" corticomedullary differentiation because of the hyperechoic medulla. By comparison, ADPKD kidneys in utero tend to be moderately enlarged with a hyperechoic cortex and relatively hypoechoic medulla causing "increased" corticomedullary differentiation [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. However, ADPKD can mimic ARPKD and can present with increased cortical echogenicity, decreased corticomedullary differentiation, multiple medullary cysts, and decreased amniotic fluid [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Ultrasound evaluation of the parents' kidneys may be useful for differential diagnosis. If either parent has ADPKD, the finding of enlarged echogenic kidneys with or without cysts in the fetus strongly supports the diagnosis. Absence of cysts in the parents (particularly if they are &gt;30 years of age) suggests ARPKD rather than ADPKD.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, it is important to note that in 5 to 10 percent of patients, ADPKD result from de novo variants (see <a class="local">'Genetics'</a> below). In addition, a normal ultrasound in a fetus at risk provides no reassurance of absence of ADPKD because of the variability in ultrasound findings and late presentation of this disorder.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Amniotic fluid volume</strong> – Amniotic fluid volume is usually normal since normal nephrons are present; this is an important distinction from ARPKD. In a report of 27 prenatally diagnosed cases, amniotic fluid volume was normal in 89 percent, slightly diminished in 7 percent, and increased initially, but with secondary normalization in one case (4 percent) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Associated abnormalities</strong> – Associated structural abnormalities, such as cysts in the liver and pancreas (see <a class="local">'Overview'</a> above), have not been identified prenatally.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1288938076"><span class="h3">Genetics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most cases (approximately 90 to 95 percent) are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with complete penetrance. The disease is genetically heterogeneous, with two major genes encoding plasma membrane-spanning polycystin 1 and polycystin 2, <em>PKD1</em> (16.p13.3; approximately 78 percent families) and <em>PKD2</em> (4p21; approximately 15 percent), and a rare third locus, <em>GANAB</em> (11q12.3; approximately 0.3 percent) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].

It is characterized by structural disorganization of the kidney tissue, poorly branched/differentiated nephrons and collecting ducts, increased stroma, and, occasionally, cysts and metaplastic tissues, such as cartilage. Kidney dysplasia originates from abnormal interaction between the ureteral bud and metanephric blastema.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Etiology/genetics</strong> – Dysplastic kidneys may occur randomly or secondary to genetic defects, lower urinary tract obstruction (obstructive dysplasia [ORD]), or teratogen exposure [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]. Approximately 10 percent of affected fetuses have a family history of significant kidney/urinary tract malformation. Monogenic causes include variants in individual genes, such as <em>TCF2</em>/hepatocyte nuclear factor-1-beta (<em>HNF1B</em>), <em>PAX2</em>, and uroplakins. Compound heterozygote variants in several kidney/urinary tract developmental genes have also been reported [<a href="#rid62">62-64</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The <em>TCF2</em> gene encodes the protein <em>HNF1B</em>, which is involved in early kidney and pancreas development. <em>HNF1B</em> is an essential transcription factor that regulates the development and function of epithelia in the kidney, liver, pancreas, and genitourinary tract. In the embryonic kidney, <em>HNF1B</em> is required for ureteric bud branching, initiation of nephrogenesis, and nephron segmentation. In the adult kidney, <em>HNF1B</em> controls the expression of genes required for intrarenal metabolism and solute transport by tubular epithelial cells. Tubular abnormalities observed in <em>HNF1B</em> nephropathy include hyperuricemia with or without gout, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and polyuria [<a href="#rid65">65</a>], as well as maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5, genital tract abnormalities, and liver and intestinal abnormalities [<a href="#rid66">66</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><em>PAX2</em> is a central nephrogenic molecule involved in the outgrowth and branching of the ureteric bud and is also expressed during the development of the eye, ear, and nervous system, as well as the urogenital tract. <em>PAX2</em> is involved in approximately half of the patients with autosomal-dominant renal-coloboma syndrome characterized by ocular and kidney malformations. Uroplakins are cell membrane proteins distributed in the apical surface of the urothelium.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><em>NEK8</em> variants are associated with severe kidney cystic dysplasia [<a href="#rid67">67</a>]. <em>NEK8</em> is a major gene for kidney dysplasia and belongs to a protein complex defining the inversin compartment of the cilium. It is a negative regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway, which controls organ growth by controlling the balance between cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest through the phosphorylation state and nuclear shuttling of transcriptional cofactors YAP/TAZ. <em>NEK8</em> missense and loss-of-function variants have different effects on nuclear YAP imbalance in the Hippo pathway.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Multicystic dysplastic kidney</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1228725577"><span class="h3">Overview</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>MCDK is a severe form of kidney dysplasia in which the kidney consists of multiple noncommunicating cysts of various sizes separated by dysplastic parenchyma  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79332 graphicRef80361" href="/z/d/graphic/79332.html" rel="external">image 2A-B</a>). Primitive nephrons filled with urine are the basis of the multiple cysts, which are seen initially at the periphery of the kidney. The kidney is enlarged, and the overall shape is abnormal. The affected kidney is nonfunctional and may undergo involution, mostly after birth, when the cysts shrink from absence of urine production. Prenatal involution may be difficult to differentiate from renal agenesis.

No normal kidney tissue is apparent on ultrasound. The appearance of multiple large cysts in the paravertebral area has been likened to a cluster of grapes. The kidney is usually enlarged with an irregular, non-reniform outline and no visible kidney pelvis in early pregnancy, but may further enlarge or, less commonly, may shrink as pregnancy progresses. Shrinkage in severe bilateral cases may mimic renal agenesis. The ureter is atretic or absent. The renal artery is small or absent in MCDK, and the Doppler waveform, when present, is markedly abnormal with reduced systolic peak and absent diastolic flow.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Rare cases of Wilms tumor, multilocular cyst, or cystic mesoblastic nephroma can present in a similar manner to MCDK.
