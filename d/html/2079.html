         A systematic approach to the evaluation of patients with suspected drug allergy, particularly those receiving multiple medications simultaneously, will be presented here. Evaluation of patients with specific symptoms or laboratory findings that may represent drug hypersensitivity is discussed separately:

         "Drug hypersensitivity" is a general term that includes both allergic and pseudoallergic drug reactions, which are a subset of idiosyncratic drug reactions.
        </p>
        <p>
         A drug allergy is an adverse drug reaction that is caused by an immunologic reaction elicited by a drug. Some immune reactions occur when drugs act as antigens. Alternatively, drugs may cause reactions by interacting with receptors on immune cells, stimulating the cells directly. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2072.html" rel="external">

         There are different classification systems for drug allergy, which are briefly reviewed here and discussed in detail elsewhere. Briefly, drug hypersensitivity reactions can be classified based upon timing of appearance of symptoms, action of drugs, or immunologic mechanism. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2086.html" rel="external">

         The World Allergy Organization (WAO) has recommended dividing immunologic drug reactions into two types:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         <strong>
          Immediate
         </strong>
         reactions, occurring within one hour of the first administered dose
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         <strong>
          Nonimmediate
         </strong>
         (also called delayed reactions), occurring after one hour, but usually more than six hours and occasionally weeks to months after the start of administration
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The WAO distinction between immediate and delayed drug reactions is helpful in distinguishing type I, immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated reactions from the other types. Type I reactions carry the risk of immediate life-threatening anaphylaxis if the drug is readministered. These reactions most commonly appear within minutes after exposure but may begin after one hour following oral administration, especially if the drug is taken with food, which further slows absorption.
        </p>
        <p>
         Delayed reactions are usually not IgE mediated and result instead from types II, III, and mainly type IV hypersensitivity or from multiple or unknown pathophysiologic mechanisms. Some of these reactions can also be life threatening, and, as a group, delayed reactions probably account for more deaths than anaphylaxis.

         </span>
         A novel classification of drug hypersensitivity reactions is based on the action of drugs [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. This system delineates three types of reactions: immunologic/allergic reactions, p-I reactions, and pseudoallergic reactions. This approach explains the relationships between the clinical manifestations, dose of the drug, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) linkage, and crossreactivity.

         <strong>
          Immune/allergic reactions
         </strong>
         – Immune/allergic reactions arise with proteins that are used as drugs, as well as small molecules (drug or drug metabolites) that bind covalently as haptens to a carrier protein (hapten-carrier complex). Both a humoral and cellular immune response might develop and can result in allergic symptoms as outlined in the Gell and Coombs classification. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Immunologic mechanisms'

         <strong>
          p-i reactions (pharmacologic interaction with immune receptors)
         </strong>
         – In p-i reactions, the drug binds noncovalently to immune receptors (eg, certain HLA molecules or certain T cell receptors), which are not the intended target of the drug. This binding leads to exclusive stimulation of those T cells, with clinical features of alloimmune and possibly autoimmune reactions [

         <strong>
          Pseudoallergic reactions
         </strong>
         – Pseudoallergic reactions are due to noncovalent drug binding to certain enzymes or receptors on effector inflammatory cells (ie, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils). Clinically, pseudoallergic drug reactions are similar or identical to immunologic reactions, but they are
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         mediated by the immune system  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79967" href="/z/d/graphic/79967.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Pseudoallergic reactions, such as those to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can be as severe as IgE-mediated anaphylaxis and are managed acutely in the same manner (ie, with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/z/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">
          epinephrine
         </a>
         ). However, the evaluation and future prevention of these reactions is different from that of immunologic reactions. Other drugs, such as

         To correlate this system to the action of the drug, type I through IV reactions involve drugs that act as antigens (allergic/immune, hapten reactions). Type IV reactions can be due to hapten or the p-i mechanism. Some drugs like beta-lactams are notorious for eliciting all four types of reactions; but many drugs do not give rise to antigens and stimulate only via p-i (eg, various antiseizure medications). Some beta-lactams stimulate by both hapten and/or p-i mechanism (eg, flucloxacillin [

          Female sex
         </strong>
         – Females are at greater risk than males for allergic reactions to some drugs for reasons that are not well defined. Females can experience higher rates of both immediate and delayed reactions. As an example of the latter, females of childbearing age developed delayed-onset rashes to

         </a>
         ]. Intraoperative reactions to neuromuscular-blocking agents are also much more frequent in females. In contrast, neither immediate nor delayed allergic reactions to penicillins differ by sex.

          Prior history of allergic drug reactions
         </strong>
         – A prior history of allergic reactions to one or more drugs increases the risk of developing additional drug allergies. This is obviously true in patients with past drug reactions who are subsequently given the same or a related medication. It is also true with pseudoallergic reactions due to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), since structurally different NSAIDs may cause similar reactions. Pseudoallergic reactions are reviewed separately. (See

         </a>
         ]. Data on a variety of drugs and severe drug allergies demonstrated that certain HLA alleles (often HLA-B) represent highly significant risk factors for severe side effects to a particular drug and are also involved in presenting the drug to the immune system [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10-12
         </a>
         ]. As many of the HLA alleles implicated in drug allergy differ in different ethnic groups, associations are often defined only within certain ethnic groups [

         <em>
         </em>
         Predictive HLA typing is recommended for only a few drugs (

         A common problem is exanthematous skin reactions in small children treated with antibiotics, in particular penicillins. These mostly mild and transient skin reactions appear to be due to a combined effect of the drug use and various viral infections causing immune stimulation [

          Drug metabolism
         </strong>
         – The role of drug metabolism in drug hypersensitivity was previously centered on an assumed role of generating reactive intermediates. However, such a role for creating immunogenic drugs could rarely be shown, probably because reactive intermediates were rapidly bound by glutathione or were immunologically not active due to intrahepatic tolerance mechanism [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. On the other hand, a reduced drug metabolism may result in an enhanced availability of elevated drug concentrations. An example may be certain cytochrome p450 related genes, which reduce metabolism: This was shown for CYP2C9*3 and phenytoin-related drug hypersensitivity reactions [
         <a href="#rid33">

Patients with atopic/allergic disorders, such as allergic asthma or food allergy, are not at increased risk for the development of drug allergy. However, atopic conditions may aggravate the clinical manifestations of IgE-mediated drug allergies. As an example, positive penicillin skin tests do not occur more frequently in atopic individuals [

         The term "multiple drug allergy syndrome" is correctly used to describe a small subgroup of patients with immunologic reactions to at least two (usually more)
         <strong>
          unrelated
         </strong>
         drugs, in which the culprit drugs can be demonstrated by skin tests or in vitro tests [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. This appears to arise because of an enhanced responsiveness of the patient's T cells to pharmaceutical substances [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37,38
         </a>
         ]. The implicated drugs are often antibiotics, although hypnotics, antidepressants, and other drug classes were also reported. In a typical clinical scenario, a patient might initially develop DIHS/DRESS (eg, a type IV reaction) to an antiseizure medication. Weeks to months after this event, the patient develops additional "flare-up reactions" (mostly exanthema, liver enzyme elevations) shortly after receiving a new drug [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. This flare-up reaction might be transient, particularly if the second drug is stopped immediately. However, the second drug is often tolerated if given again later on [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40

        </p>
        <p>
         A subgroup of patients do, however, develop a true second drug allergy with a second immune reaction with positive skin tests and/or in vitro tests to the second drug as well. The clinical manifestations might be similar to the first reaction but can also be more severe (fulminant hepatitis, necrotizing eosinophilic carditis, agranulocytosis). It appears that the nature of subsequent reactions depends upon the structure/type of allergy normally associated with the drug in question. For example, if the same patient is later given
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8673" href="/z/d/drug information/8673.html" rel="external">
          amoxicillin

          phenytoin

         Some patients claim or actually do react to multiple different drugs: This could be simple crossreactivity against structurally related drugs (eg,

         An important differential diagnosis and a rather common cause for wrongly labelled drug hypersensitivity is the appearance of urticarial lesions just after drug intake, which may be just the manifestation of a chronic spontaneous urticaria. A detailed history may reveal urticaria even without prior drug intake, and dermatographism on physical examination often reveals increased skin reactivity. The strategy of empirically taking an antihistamine when starting a new medication can help prevent additional reactions.

         Some patients experience unintentional anticipatory reactions (classic Pavlovian conditioning), particularly following a true allergic reaction or a frightening experience in association with drug treatment. The possibility of a conditioned response should be considered when multiple unrelated drugs elicit very similar symptoms with immediate or slightly delayed onset. Another clue that the reactions may be conditioned responses is a history of allergic-like symptoms to many drugs, including some that uncommonly cause true immunologic drug reactions (eg, macrolide antibiotics, glucocorticoids, and local anesthetics).

         The onset of hives within a few hours of taking a new medication is easily recognized as possible drug hypersensitivity. However, many clinical presentations of drug hypersensitivity are more complex or take place in the setting of illness and/or polypharmacy. The patient in intensive care who develops a rash while receiving multiple medications or the ambulatory patient with complex chronic diseases who develops a new and unexplained symptom while taking many medications illustrates two common presentations of drug allergy.
        </p>
        <p>
         A systematic approach to the evaluation of putative drug allergy in patients receiving multiple medications begins with the following questions:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         How severe is the reaction, and what organ systems are involved? This can be assessed with a meticulous skin examination, followed by further evaluation of any other organ system that appears to be affected. A complete blood count and differential and tests of liver and kidney function should be obtained. This evaluation is indicated if the exanthema is substantial, bullous or pustular, confluent, involves a substantial portion of the body surface area, or if general symptoms (malaise, skin pain, lymphadenopathy) are present.

         <strong>
          Step 4
         </strong>
         – For reactions that are suspected to be IgE mediated, consider skin testing (see
         <a class="local">
          'Skin testing for drug-specific IgE'

          table 2
         </a>
         ). Both skin and in vitro tests (if available) to identify the eliciting drug are normally done after the reaction has resolved completely [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>

         – If there is ambiguity surrounding which drug induced an immunologic reaction and multiple drugs were stopped, plans should be made to continue the evaluation after the patient's convalescence, particularly for drugs that the individual may need in the future. Entering multiple "possible" drug allergies in the medical record will lead to confusion and is not in the patient's best interest.

         The suspect drug is identified using the patient's clinical history of present and past drug reactions and review of the medical record for temporal associations between administration and symptoms, combined with an understanding of what types of drugs cause various reactions.

         History alone is often not sufficient for establishing current drug sensitivity. Studies performed on large series of patients with histories of drug allergy have shown that less than 20 percent actually react to the offending drug(s) upon direct challenge [

         Biologic states required for reactivity may wane over time and render the patient less vulnerable.

         Conversely, even for IgE-mediated immediate reactions, which usually require previous exposure to the causative drug in order to become sensitized, there are reasons that they patient may react on the first administration:

         IgE-mediated, immediate-type allergic reactions can appear with the first known encounter with a drug, even though these types of reactions require preexisting sensitization (ie, formation of IgE antibodies) to the drug. This most often occurs with drugs that are administered intravenously. The explanation for this phenomenon is that sensitization has occurred as a result of exposure to a different but cross-reacting compound, typically a different medication or a cosmetic. The best-studied example is that of muscle relaxants (ie, neuromuscular-blocking agents), which can trigger anaphylaxis upon first exposure because patients can become sensitized to over-the-counter cough remedies (pholcodine in Europe) or cosmetics (in the United States) [
         <a href="#rid45">

This oligosaccharide is also found in beef, pork, and lamb, and a subset of patients had experienced allergic reactions when eating these meats. Because most of the affected patients lived in the Southeastern United States, it has been postulated that patients become sensitized to the oligosaccharide as a result of bites from ticks or other ectoparasites [

         The medical record should be reviewed, if possible. In critically ill patients who cannot communicate, it may be the only available source of information. One approach is the creation of a timeline of medication starts and stops on which the appearance and resolution of symptoms is also charted.

         Objective testing may be appropriate for some types of allergic drug reactions. Skin testing for type I reactions is supported by extensive clinical experience but is not standardized or validated for most drugs.

         Elevations in tryptase (serum or plasma) may be detectable in blood samples collected within several hours of an acute allergic event because this mediator is released by mast cells and basophils  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72041" href="/z/d/graphic/72041.html" rel="external">
          table 4

         ). Histamine may also be detectable, but assays are less reliable, and elevations are seen only during a very short time interval after the reaction.
        </p>
        <p>
         Any elevation of tryptase is consistent with anaphylaxis, although normal levels do not exclude the diagnosis. Tryptase levels should be tested again after the reaction has resolved to detect a relative increase as well as to exclude indolent mastocytosis, an important risk factor for severe anaphylaxis. Elevations are most likely to be detectable following anaphylaxis with hemodynamic changes and if blood is collected one to three hours from the onset of symptoms [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. The interpretation of tryptase in the diagnosis of anaphylaxis is not always straightforward. As an example, a tryptase level of 9 ng/mL during anaphylaxis and 3 ng/mL the following day is suggestive of anaphylaxis, even though both levels are below the upper limit of normal (ie, 11.4 ng/mL) [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49
         </a>
         ]. In this example, the serum level tripled, which may be meaningful, since personal tryptase levels are usually quite constant. The interpretation of tryptase levels is discussed in greater detail separately. (See

         A variety of medications can be used to perform prick and/or intradermal skin testing for the purpose of determining if the drug interacts with drug-specific IgE bound to cutaneous mast cells. This type of testing is only used to evaluate suspected type I allergic reactions. A positive wheal-and-flare response appearing within 15 to 20 minutes indicates the presence of drug-specific IgE on the patient's mast cells and supports the diagnosis of a type I reaction  (

         The clinician must first ascertain that the medication does not cause direct mast cell degranulation, as described with opioids, quinolones, and

         For most drugs, the full range of metabolites and intermediate forms of the drug to which patients may become allergic has not been defined, and testing reagents are not available. Thus, just the native (unmetabolized) form of the drug is used in testing, and this may only detect a fraction of allergic patients. Penicillin is the one exception to this, and the important metabolites and metabolite/protein complexes that are required to detect allergic patients have been characterized. Penicillin skin testing is discussed in detail separately. (See

         Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, even if fully humanized, can still elicit immune reactions. The majority of reactions involve IgG antibodies, some neutralizing the efficacy of the therapeutic antibody. IgE-mediated reactions do occur but are rather rare [

         Skin testing may be falsely negative if performed too soon after an anaphylactic reaction. For this reason, a period of one to four weeks should be allowed between a severe reaction and skin testing to the suspect drug. However, if skin testing is performed in this period, positive results are still valid. False-negative results can also occur in patients taking medications that blunt immediate skin responses, such as H1 and H2 antihistamines and tricyclic antidepressants. (See

         The majority of drug reactions involve dermatitis and/or hepatitis, occasionally with systemic involvement (eg, drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome/drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [DIHS/DRESS]).

         ). However, it has been argued that these severe reactions (DIHS/DRESS) as well as Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) are immune reactions elicited by p-i mechanism (drug binding to immune receptors and not due to hapten-carrier antigen formation) [

Some patients with DRESS/DIHS may show a slight reappearance of symptoms, even if the dose was minimal.

         Only a few preparations of drugs for skin testing are commercially available, so preparations are often made by individual clinicians or centers. This makes it difficult to standardize the procedure or compare results. Overall, patch and intradermal testing with delayed readout appear to have good drug-related specificity, although they can be positive even when recent drug treatment did not cause a reaction. In addition, more work is needed to increase their sensitivity [

If available, such tests may help in diagnosis because they can be positive when skin tests are negative or when skin tests are not available. Their specificity for most drug classes seems to be very good (mostly &gt;95 percent), but the sensitivity needs to be improved [

         Graded challenge and drug provocation testing (DPT) both involve administration of a medication to a patient in a gradual manner under close observation. These procedures are based on the principle that a certain amount of the medication is needed to elicit symptoms. The main difference between graded challenge and DPT is the likelihood of a reaction and the purpose of the procedure.

         DPT is a diagnostic procedure performed when the patient is in a good state of health with no sign of active disease. The purpose of DPT is proving/disproving a diagnosis and the involvement of certain drug. DPT may result in symptoms, although these are of milder severity than the initial reaction, because the drug is given gradually in incrementally increasing doses. In Europe, DPT is used to prove that a drug is indeed tolerated when skin and in vitro tests are negative. Frequently, DPT is used to find a well-tolerated alternative drug potentially useful for the patient in the future or to exclude crossreactivity [

         Graded challenge is a similar procedure but is usually performed when the patient requires immediate treatment with the drug in question. The purpose of a graded challenge is to provide a drug that is anticipated to be tolerated as quickly and as safely as possible [

         Although simple in theory, graded challenges can require experience to interpret. Some patients develop nonspecific and subjective symptoms during the procedure, which can mimic symptoms of true allergy. These may be anxiety related, and spending time with the patient explaining the safety of challenge procedures in advance may help to reduce the incidence of these nonspecific reactions.

         If the patient develops convincing signs and symptoms consistent with an immediate reaction during or shortly after the graded challenge (within a few hours of receiving the full dose), no further drug should be given, and symptoms should be treated appropriately. These patients should be diagnosed with immediate allergy.

         Challenge schemes for simple delayed exanthema to drugs are usually performed either in the context of research (to document sensitivity) or at a time that the patient actively needs the drug. In the latter situation, the drug may be slowly increased and the patient instructed to contact the clinician immediately if any adverse events are noted.
        </p>
        <p>
         For delayed or nonimmediate types of reactions, challenge procedures are less standardized and are based upon the time course of the patient's reaction and the pharmacology of the drug involved [
         <a href="#rid77">
          77
         </a>
         ]. The optimal approach is not known, and experts have differences in practice. In general, the time between doses should be long enough that delayed symptoms have time to develop before the next higher dose is administered. Some protocols may take days or even weeks.

         If a patient tolerates a drug challenge, it is highly unlikely, but not impossible, that that drug will cause symptoms if taken again in the future. If the reaction was not life threatening, the drug can be given in the normal manner in the future. However, for patients with a recent and severe anaphylactic drug reaction, even if the skin testing and challenge are negative, it is prudent to give the causative drug again only under medical surveillance. The author is aware of rare fatalities caused by penicillin in which the patient had demonstrated negative testing and had a negative challenge but then suffered fatal anaphylaxis when given the drug again. It is possible that skin testing and challenge were falsely negative due to the absence of important cofactors or that the exposure involved in testing and challenge reactivated the sensitization, although this is also believed to be very rare.

All were labeled as "not allergic to the drug" based on 175 negative drug challenges, consisting of one full dose of the drug. Reevaluation after at least a three-month interval showed that 91 (52 percent) of the 175 tested drugs were reported to have been used again: 65 children took the same antibiotic, 20 took the same nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), and 6 took other drugs. An immediate reaction was reported in five (5.5 percent) of these (four antibiotics, one NSAID). One patient developed an anaphylactic reaction and was skin test positive upon repeat testing, suggesting either resensitization from the challenge or an error in original skin testing. The other patients who reacted had delayed reactions.

         Penicillin allergy illustrates the issues involved. Patients labeled "penicillin allergic" often receive non-beta-lactam antibiotics, which can be more expensive, associated with side effects, and, in some cases, less efficacious [
         <a href="#rid83">
          83-85
         </a>
         ]. Specifically, patients carrying the diagnosis of penicillin allergy are more likely to be treated with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10037" href="/z/d/drug information/10037.html" rel="external">
          vancomycin
         </a>
         or quinolones [
         <a href="#rid83">
          83,86
         </a>
         ]. The use of these broad-spectrum antibiotics contributes to the development and spread of drug-resistant bacteria [
         <a href="#rid87">
          87
         </a>
         ]. One study assessed various risk factors for the development of vancomycin-resistant
         <em>
          Enterococcus
         </em>
         (VRE) in a medical intensive care unit (MICU) [
         <a href="#rid88">
          88
         </a>
         ]. Among pre-MICU treatment with various classes of antibiotics, quinolones had the strongest association with subsequent development of VRE (odds ratio 8.6), whereas treatment with penicillins/beta-lactamase inhibitors was not associated with developing VRE [
         <a href="#rid89">
          89
         </a>
         ]. Some broad-spectrum antibiotics are also associated with
         <em>
          Clostridioides
         </em>
         <em>
          difficile

         The second alternative for drug-allergic patients is to receive a medication similar, but not identical to the offending drug.
        </p>
        <p>
         The likelihood of crossreactivity among similar drugs is partly dependent on the type of allergic reaction in question. As an example, a patient with a T cell-mediated exanthema to
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8673" href="/z/d/drug information/8673.html" rel="external">
          amoxicillin
         </a>
         is at low risk for reacting to a cephalosporin, whereas a patient with IgE-mediated anaphylaxis to amoxicillin is at some increased risk if given a cephalosporin. The related medication may be one for which skin testing is informative, or it can be initially given via graded challenge. Crossreactivity within classes of medications is discussed in specific topic reviews. (See

         The third option is desensitization to the culprit drug. Classical desensitization is predictably successful for type I, IgE-mediated allergy, although gradual dose escalation may be attempted with variable success to several other types of immunologic and nonimmunologic drug reactions. Drug desensitization is reviewed in detail separately. (See

         Once a drug allergy has been identified, the affected patient should be educated about avoidance and provided with a written list of the generic and brand names of the culprit drug, as well as possibly cross-reactive drugs. Patients with potentially severe reactions should carry wallet cards, wear identification jewelry, or register with a drug allergy information service [

        <p>
         As discussed previously, some individuals are vulnerable to allergic drug reactions as a result of genetic or metabolic abnormalities (eg, multiple drug allergy syndrome), frequent and recurrent drug exposure (eg, antibiotics in cystic fibrosis), or certain disease states related to immune dysfunction (eg, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection). In a drug allergy-prone population, pharmacotherapy requires special management to avoid adverse events and to prevent (to the degree possible) sensitization or resensitization.

         Efforts should be made to limit unnecessary exposure to antibiotics. These include the diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions that predispose to infections. As examples, rhinitis and asthma should be aggressively treated with glucocorticoid nasal sprays and inhalers to minimize sinopulmonary infections, and diabetes mellitus should be tightly controlled. Less commonly, undiagnosed immunodeficiency is present. In addition, it is advisable to use the lowest effective doses of drugs whenever possible [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Age-appropriate vaccinations should be administered and repeated at the recommended intervals. Avoidance of unnecessary exposures to contagious diseases may be helpful, especially in children and patients with immunodeficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
         Proactive efforts to obtain culture data before initiating antibiotics can help to limit cumulative antibiotic exposure by avoiding treatment of viral infections and minimizing mid-treatment changes in antibiotic regimens. Enlisting the cooperation of the patient's other providers is important.
        </p>
        <p>
         Consideration should be given to treating through mild cutaneous reactions, such as itching or mild rashes, especially early in therapy when an alternative antibiotic will usually be required. Treating through is possible in delayed-onset exanthema. This is typically considered when alternative treatments are problematic and an allergy specialist considers continued exposure to the drug to be low risk. Ongoing vigilance for clinical and laboratory danger signs is necessary, and concomitant use of glucocorticoids (
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">

         In drug allergy-prone patients, new drugs should be started at lower-than-normal doses when feasible. Administration under medical observation is sometimes necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with past Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome/drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DIHS/DRESS) should be taught about the earliest symptoms of these reactions, such as fever or mucosal irritation, and know to stop medications immediately should these appear. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2091.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Many patients with prior DIHS/DRESS experience a period of drug intolerance during the weeks after the initial reaction, meaning that any new drug may exacerbate symptoms (exanthems, hepatitis), often without proof of a new sensitization [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. The symptoms may lead to the suspicion of a new drug allergy and further limit treatment. However, when the immune system is less activated (documented by circulating activated lymphocytes) the new drugs are again tolerated. This phenomenon has been termed a "flare-up" reaction [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. However, some patients with prior DIHS/DRESS do develop genuine sensitizations to new compounds, and some develop multiple drug hypersensitivity [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37,40
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with past IgE-mediated reactions to drugs should not be given premedications before gradual dose escalation of new drugs. Neither antihistamines nor glucocorticoids can prevent IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, and premedications may mask early symptoms and allow dosing to proceed more rapidly than advisable.
        </p>
        <p>
         In contrast to the above scenarios, patients who have reacted with uncomplicated exanthemas, including mild urticaria, to a variety of different drugs may benefit from administration of an antihistamine when new drugs are initiated.

         Patients who develop signs/symptoms of drug allergy while receiving multiple medications simultaneously are best approached in a systematic manner. Evaluation involves a meticulous history of past and present drug reactions, additional information gathering from the medical record, and analysis of temporal patterns between drug administration and onset of symptoms. Once this information has been assembled, it is combined with knowledge about the types of allergic reactions most often caused by various classes of drugs to identify potential culprit agents. (See

         Overall, objective testing for the diagnosis of drug allergy is limited. Skin testing is helpful for some medications that cause type I, immediate hypersensitivity reactions, although skin testing has been fully validated only for penicillin. In some cases, types II, III, and IV reactions can be evaluated with in vitro studies, although the majority of these tests are still investigational. (See
