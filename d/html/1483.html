         </span>
         Ischemic heart disease, also referred to as coronary heart disease, is the term associated with an inadequate supply of blood to the myocardium due to obstruction of the epicardial coronary arteries, usually from atherosclerosis (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13603.html" rel="external">
          "Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis"
         </a>
         ). Patients may have chronic (stable) or acute (unstable) disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most patients can be given the diagnosis of chronic coronary syndrome (CCS), also referred to as stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD), based on a classic history of angina pectoris in the presence of either risk factors for or known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Angina pectoris, or angina for short, refers to chest discomfort that occurs when myocardial oxygen demand exceeds oxygen supply. Stable angina refers to chest discomfort that occurs predictably and reproducibly at a certain level of exertion and is relieved with rest or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9706" href="/z/d/drug information/9706.html" rel="external">
          nitroglycerin
         </a>
         . The prevalence of anginal symptoms varies and is thought to be lower among community-dwelling patients than trial participants [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1472.html" rel="external">
          "Approach to the patient with suspected angina pectoris", section on 'Evaluation of suspected stable angina'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Other patients may have stable disease but not experience classic anginal symptoms. They may have atypical chest pain, non-anginal symptoms related to reduced cardiac blood flow such as dyspnea on exertion, or silent ischemia (particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus). In such patients, the diagnosis of CCS can be confirmed by stress testing or, if that is ambivalent, an anatomic assessment of the coronary arteries, either with coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) or an invasive coronary angiogram. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6832.html" rel="external">
          "Outpatient evaluation of the adult with chest pain", section on 'Evaluation for stable myocardial ischemia'

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms may cause CCS. The most common is atherosclerotic epicardial coronary artery obstruction. However, as many as one-third of patients may have no significant epicardial disease and often have microvascular disease as the underlying pathophysiology.
        </p>

         This topic will provide an overview of the key components of care in patients with atherosclerotic epicardial coronary artery obstruction. Patients with microvascular disease are discussed separately. (See

         A determination of disease severity is important for guiding treatment and establishing prognosis. This includes assessment of the extent of coronary disease for all patients and assessment of left ventricular function for selected patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         The combination of results of tests to determine severity and individual patient characteristics influences the therapeutic approach. Low- and intermediate-risk patients whose symptoms are controlled on medical therapy can be managed without intervention, while high-risk patients or those with angina refractory to medical therapy undergo coronary angiography and revascularization with either percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). (See

         The extent and severity of coronary disease can be assessed by stress testing, cardiac imaging, and angiography. Stress testing is the most common method.
        </p>
        <p>
         We recommend that patients with known or suspected chronic coronary syndrome (CCS), also referred to as stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD), undergo stress testing, if not already performed, to secure the diagnosis, determine disease severity, and gain prognostic information [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Testing should be performed soon after the diagnosis and when there has been a significant change in symptom status.
        </p>
        <p>
         Evaluation for coronary disease usually begins with a functional study such as stress testing with exercise electrocardiogram (ECG), exercise with imaging, or pharmacologic stress testing with imaging. The choice of test may be influenced by the patient's resting ECG, the patient's physical ability to perform exercise, local clinician expertise, and available technologies. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1502.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         An initial noninvasive anatomic assessment of coronary disease with coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) is becoming more common, especially in patients who are not candidates for exercise or pharmacologic stress testing, but CTA is associated with increased costs and no change in mortality when compared with stress testing [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The choice of this modality is discussed elsewhere. (See

          "Selecting the optimal cardiac stress test"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In certain situations, invasive coronary angiography may also be used to determine disease severity, for example in patients with atypical symptoms and equivocal findings on stress testing in whom a diagnosis needs to be established.

         </span>
         Measurement of left ventricular systolic function is useful in most patients to determine optimal medical therapy, the role of interventional or surgical therapy, or recommendations about activity level, rehabilitation, and work status. Echocardiography can also identify patients who have had a silent infarction in the past and evaluate valvular function.
        </p>

         We suggest that the following patients with CCS merit an assessment of left ventricular systolic function (generally with the use of transthoracic echocardiography):

         Beta blockers reduce anginal symptoms by decreasing both heart rate and contractility. Since beta blockers reduce the heart rate-blood pressure product during exercise, the onset of angina or the ischemic threshold during exercise is delayed or avoided. All types of beta blockers appear to be equally effective in exertional angina.

          Goals of care
         </strong>
         – The principal goals in the care of patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS), also referred to as stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD), are to secure the diagnosis, assess the extent of disease, relieve symptoms, and prevent future cardiac events such as acute coronary syndromes, revascularization, or death. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Determining disease severity
         </strong>
         – Most patients with CCS should undergo some form of stress testing or cardiac imaging (eg, coronary computed tomography [CT] angiography) to either secure the diagnosis or evaluate disease severity. (See
         <a class="local">

          Identifying patients for angiography and revascularization
         </strong>
         – Patients with significant anginal symptoms despite maximal medical therapy or those with a high likelihood of severe ischemic heart disease based on stress testing should undergo coronary angiography with potential revascularization. (See

         Calcium channel blockers and long-acting nitrates are alternatives if beta blockers are contraindicated or cause side effects; they can also be added as combination therapy if monotherapy is not successful. (See

         <strong>
          Preventing disease progression
         </strong>
         – Therapies known to reduce the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events such as death and myocardial infarction should be started. These include
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">
          aspirin
         </a>
         , lipid-lowering therapy, smoking cessation, control of blood pressure and excess weight, and optimal management of diabetes mellitus. Regular exercise and stress reduction are also recommended. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Preventing disease progression'

         <strong>
          Follow-up
         </strong>
         – The optimal management of these patients also requires periodic evaluation (every 6 to 12 months) of the patient's clinical status, using the history, physical examination, and on occasion the electrocardiogram (ECG). (See
