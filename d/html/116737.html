By definition, nonsuicidal self-injury is distinguished from suicidal behavior; socially accepted practices such as tattoos, piercings, and religious rituals; accidental self-harm; and indirect self-injury through behaviors such as disordered eating or substance use disorders. Self-injurious behavior that is accompanied by <strong>any</strong> intent to die is classified as a suicide attempt, which is consistent with the practice of most clinicians and researchers [<a href="#rid2">2,10,11</a>]. This approach deliberately errs on the side of safety by categorizing ambivalent behaviors, which include any intention to die, as suicidal [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Additional information about the terminology of nonsuicidal self-injury is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116734.html" rel="external">"Nonsuicidal self-injury in children and adolescents: Clinical features and proposed diagnostic criteria", section on 'Terminology'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4278567989"><span class="h1">ASSESSMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Despite the high prevalence of nonsuicidal self-injury in adolescents, clinicians frequently do not assess patients for the behavior. In a survey of primary care clinicians (n = 262), less than 30 percent routinely asked about the behavior and nearly 50 percent felt unprepared to address nonsuicidal self-injury if it was reported [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2196964478"><span class="h2">General approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Assessment of nonsuicidal and suicidal self-injury should occur as part of the initial clinical evaluation, which includes a history of psychiatric and other medical problems, mental status and physical examination, and focused laboratory tests. The unstructured clinical interview may be augmented with self-report tools or structured clinical interviews specific to nonsuicidal self-injury. The initial assessment may need to occur over multiple sessions; between sessions, the intake assessment may be supplemented with self-monitoring of nonsuicidal self-injurious thoughts and behaviors.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2788386165"><span class="h2">When to suspect nonsuicidal self-injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Nonsuicidal self-injury among youth may go undetected. As an example, one community study found that among adolescents with a lifetime history of nonsuicidal self-injury (n = 170), 42 percent never reported the behavior to someone else [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>Suspicion of nonsuicidal self-injury is warranted in youth who present with [<a href="#rid14">14-16</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unexplained frequent injuries or “accidents” to the forearms, wrists, and hands (or other body parts), particularly injuries that lead to scarring on the nondominant arm</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unusual or inappropriate dress:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Multiple bracelets, wristbands, or other jewelry that covers large areas of the forearm</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Long sleeves in warmer temperatures</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Not participating in activities that require less clothing, such as gym class or swimming</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prior history of nonsuicidal self-injury</p><p></p><p>In addition, risk factors for nonsuicidal self-injury are discussed separately.

Although the injuries that occur in the context of nonsuicidal self-injury are typically superficial and do not require medical treatment, clinicians should nevertheless assess the wounds for signs of infection [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. In addition, a tetanus vaccination may be indicated, depending upon the method of nonsuicidal self-injury. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7661.html" rel="external">"Infectious complications of puncture wounds", section on 'Tetanus immunization'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3495203149"><span class="h2">Psychological assessment</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2125735943"><span class="h3">Clinical interview</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When assessing the presence of nonsuicidal self-injury, we suggest interviewing patients and caregivers both separately and together. Patients may be more likely to be forthcoming if their parents or guardians are not present during this part of the interview.</p><p>Clinicians should directly ask both the patient and parents/guardians about nonsuicidal self-injury, rather than waiting for them to spontaneously report it [<a href="#rid10">10,18</a>]. In addition, clinicians should distinguish between suicidal and nonsuicidal self-injury by asking about the intent to die from the self-injurious behavior. Self-injurious behavior that is accompanied by <strong>any</strong> intent to die is classified as a suicide attempt. (See <a class="local">'Terminology'</a> above and <a class="local">'Classifying self-injurious thoughts and behaviors'</a> below.)</p><p>Clinicians can initially ask about nonsuicidal self-injury in the part of the interview that follows questions about the patient’s overall level of distress (eg, depression and anxiety) and the use of adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies [<a href="#rid2">2,19</a>]. As an example, “Have you ever done anything to purposely hurt yourself, without wanting to die, such as cutting or burning yourself?” If patients acknowledge any self-injurious thoughts or behaviors, further questions should attempt to clarify whether the thoughts/behaviors are suicidal, nonsuicidal, or both. Additional information about evaluating youth with suicidal thoughts/behavior is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1230.html" rel="external">"Suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents: Evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p>Clinicians should monitor their tone while discussing nonsuicidal self-injury to convey openness, empathy, and concern, and to avoid judgmental, critical, and angry reactions. Negative responses may exacerbate stigma and make adolescents reticent to report their nonsuicidal self-injury in the future and less likely to participate in treatment [<a href="#rid15">15,19,20</a>].</p><p>If patients endorse nonsuicidal self-injury, clinicians should ask about the age of onset of the behavior, past history (frequency of behavior and methods used), circumstances that lead to nonsuicidal self-injury, and the overall function(s) of the behavior. A detailed functional assessment, or chain analysis (ie, identifying the antecedents and consequences), of the behavior is recommended to inform treatment. Assessment should include [<a href="#rid17">17,19-22</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Onset – When did the behavior start?

Has the frequency increased, decreased, or remained roughly the same over the past month or past year?

Antecedents include thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that directly precede or lead an individual to engage in the behavior.

These negative feelings and thoughts can be precipitated by several stressors or negative life events, such as interpersonal conflicts (peers, friends, and/or family), academic stressors, or traumatic memories.

Given that this behavior is performed in the absence of any intent to die, it is considered nonsuicidal self-injury (social positive reinforcement). Although these behaviors are sometimes referred to as “suicidal threats” or “suicidal gestures,” these terms are increasingly viewed as pejorative and thus used less often. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116734.html" rel="external">"Nonsuicidal self-injury in children and adolescents: Clinical features and proposed diagnostic criteria", section on 'Terminology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Correct classification of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors is essential for effective treatment. Misinterpreting the intent of self-injurious behavior may lead to an inappropriate level of psychiatric care. As an example, suicidal behavior (suicide attempts) nearly always requires inpatient hospitalization, whereas nonsuicidal self-injury typically does not. In one sample of adolescent psychiatric inpatients with a history of nonsuicidal self-injury (n = 50), nearly 90 percent reported that their nonsuicidal self-injury behavior had sometimes been misinterpreted as a suicide attempt [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p>As clinical severity increases, suicidal thoughts and behaviors are more likely to co-occur with nonsuicidal self-injury. All self-injurious thoughts and behaviors – both suicidal and nonsuicidal – should be assessed.</p><p>Adolescents and parents may provide conflicting information about the nature of the self-injury and function of the behavior. As an example, the same behavior may be reported as a suicide attempt by an adolescent but as nonsuicidal self-injury (ie, “suicide gesture”) by the parent [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Clinicians should explore potential reasons for the conflicting information and assess the parent-adolescent relationship before deciding which individual is providing the most reliable information.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1802190141"><span class="h2">Assessment instruments</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several validated measurement tools are available to assess lifetime and recent nonsuicidal self-injury, identify the factors that are involved in maintaining the behavior, and monitor the behavior during treatment [<a href="#rid2">2,21</a>]. These instruments are typically not part of standard clinical practice [<a href="#rid17">17</a>] but can help inform treatment.</p><p>The first measure described below is a self-report instrument and the second is an interviewer-administered tool; both have good psychometric properties and have demonstrated the greatest utility for assessing the frequency and function of nonsuicidal self-injury in clinical and research settings [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Other available measures are also listed.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Functional Assessment of Self-Mutilation</strong> – The Functional Assessment of Self-Mutilation (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116313" href="/z/d/graphic/116313.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) is a self-report measure of past-year nonsuicidal self-injury that assesses the use of 11 different methods for self-injury, the frequency of each method, and the overall function(s) of nonsuicidal self-injury [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>].

This instrument distinguishes between behaviors that are performed for suicidal and nonsuicidal reasons. Although interviewer-administered instruments are used less frequently in routine clinical practice because they are more labor intensive than self-report questionnaires, interviewer-administered instruments allow for clarification of ambiguous or contradictory responses, help differentiate nonsuicidal behavior from suicidal behavior, and can identify episodes of nonsuicidal self-injury that are not identified through other assessment methods [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview takes approximately 10 to 45 minutes to complete, depending upon the patient’s history of self-injury. The instrument has demonstrated excellent interrater reliability and adequate six-month test-retest reliability, as well as good concurrent validity with other measures of self-injurious behaviors [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Others</strong> – Other available self-report instruments include the Inventory of Statements about Self-Injury (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116871" href="/z/d/graphic/116871.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid32">32-34</a>], Alexian Brothers Assessment of Self-Injury [<a href="#rid34">34</a>], and Non-Suicidal Self-Injury – Assessment Tool [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].</p><p></p><p>In addition to using assessment instruments as part of an initial evaluation, these tools can be used to monitor patients during treatment to track their urges to engage in nonsuicidal self-injury, their actual episodes of nonsuicidal self-injury, and other coping skills they try when the urge to self-injure arises. Monitoring patients during treatment is discussed separately.

In addition, clinicians should distinguish between suicidal and nonsuicidal self-injury by asking about the intent to die from the self-injurious behavior. Self-injurious behavior that is accompanied by <strong>any</strong> intent to die is classified as a suicide attempt.
