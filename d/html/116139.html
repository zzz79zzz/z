Household members should not share toothbrushes or razors, which may become contaminated with blood. Although HBV DNA has been detected in various bodily secretions of hepatitis B carriers, there is no firm evidence of HBV transmission via body fluids, so no special measures are called for to avoid inadvertent sharing of eating utensils.

Frequent monitoring is important for children in the immune-active phase, as outlined below. Monitoring usually can be performed less frequently during the other phases of infection, as long as disease activity is mild.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3036137480"><span class="h2">Disease activity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The frequency and type of laboratory monitoring depends upon the phase of HBV:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Immune-tolerant phase</strong> – Patients who are in the immune-tolerant phase of HBV infection (ie, hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]-positive, hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg]-positive, serum HBV DNA &gt;20,000 copies/mL) should undergo monitoring of liver biochemical tests (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) every 6 to 12 months, and HBeAg and hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb) every 12 months  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64996" href="/d/graphic/64996.html" rel="external">figure 1A</a>). It is not necessary to monitor HBV DNA for these patients, because the result is likely to remain elevated and this finding will not change patient management.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Immune-active,</strong> <strong>HBeAg-positive phase</strong> – If the ALT becomes elevated (&gt;40 international units/L), biochemical tests and serologies should be measured more frequently (eg, every three to six months). In this case, the patient is probably entering an immune-active phase and may undergo spontaneous seroconversion, or become eligible for treatment. If there is clinical suspicion for hepatic decompensation (jaundice or systemic symptoms), the evaluation also should include testing for markers of hepatic synthetic function (prothrombin time and international normalized ratio), with close follow-up.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inactive chronic HBV</strong> – Patients who are in the inactive chronic HBV phase of hepatitis B infection (ie, HBsAg-positive, HBeAg-negative, HBeAb-positive, persistently normal ALT/aspartate aminotransferase [AST] levels, serum HBV DNA &lt;10<sup>5</sup> copies/mL) should undergo monitoring of liver biochemical tests (serum ALT) every 6 to 12 months, and HBeAg and HBeAb every 12 months  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64996" href="/d/graphic/64996.html" rel="external">figure 1A</a>) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. If the ALT becomes elevated, HBV serologies and HBV DNA should be measured. The disease may reactivate even after years of quiescence; 4 to 20 percent of inactive carriers have one or more conversions to the HBeAg-negative or HBeAg-positive state [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2502995759"><span class="h2">Hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We suggest surveillance for HCC in all HBsAg-positive children. Surveillance consists of ultrasonography approximately every six months, with serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) if practical. Because the risk for HCC increases with age, we monitor somewhat less frequently (eg, every two to three years) for young patients in the immune-tolerant phase, provided that the baseline AFP and ultrasound are normal.</p><p>This suggestion for HCC surveillance in all HBsAg-positive children, regardless of other risk factors, is based primarily on two case series with a total of 21 patients in whom HBV-associated HCC presented between 6 and 17 years, some of whom had no cirrhosis [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. Because some children with HBV-associated HCC had normal liver enzymes and AFP, these reports also underscore the need to include imaging (ultrasound) as part of surveillance. A more selective approach was taken by an expert panel, which proposed monitoring for HCC only in children with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis or those with a first-degree relative with HCC, while acknowledging that there are insufficient data to identify high-risk groups for HCC in children [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. HCC surveillance in adults is summarized in a separate topic review. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3583.html" rel="external">"Surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in adults"</a>.)</p><p>HCC is rare in children with HBV [<a href="#rid13">13</a>] but has been reported [<a href="#rid11">11,12,14</a>]. It can develop in patients with HBV infection, regardless of whether the virus is actively replicating. Therefore, we maintain surveillance for HCC in individuals in all phases of HBV infection, including those who have undergone seroconversion (converted to HBeAg-negative), either spontaneously or after successful treatment. The benefit of surveillance for HCC has not been well established, but it is likely to be greatest in those children and adolescents with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis or a first-degree relative with HCC; the latter information is not always available.</p><p>Monitoring for HCC is recommended for adults with cirrhosis and chronic HBV infection, using right upper quadrant ultrasound imaging every six months and/or AFP levels [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. These recommendations are based upon observational data and expert opinion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3583.html" rel="external">"Surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2067521298"><span class="h1">SELECTION OF PATIENTS FOR ANTIVIRAL TREATMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ultimate goal of treatment is to reduce the risks of progression to cirrhosis and of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To date, the efficacy of treatment has only been measured through intermediate outcomes such as changes in short-term virologic, biochemical, and histologic parameters. Long-term outcomes are inferred from the intermediate virologic and biochemical outcomes of treatment trials, but are not clinically proven [<a href="#rid3">3,15</a>]. Because progression to cirrhosis appears to be associated with the intensity and duration of chronic inflammatory activity and hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) positivity, it is reasonable to infer that successful treatment of HBV probably reduces the risk of cirrhosis [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. It is not clear whether treatment reduces the risk for HCC.

In this phase, treatment with any of the currently available drugs does not result in higher rates of HBeAg seroconversion compared with no treatment [<a href="#rid3">3,15-19</a>]. Moreover, treatment of patients in this phase is associated with development of drug resistance, which could diminish responsiveness to the same or related medications at a later date, when hepatic injury is active. For these reasons, treatment of children in this phase should only be considered as part of a comprehensive clinical trial.
