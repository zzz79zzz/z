        <p>
         Leukostasis (ie, symptomatic hyperleukocytosis) is a medical emergency. Leukostasis is a clinical diagnosis in which respiratory distress, central nervous system abnormalities, or other organ dysfunction is attributable to hyperleukocytosis. Leukostasis occurs most often in AML and is uncommon with other hematologic malignancies. Pathologically, leukostasis is associated with WBC plugs in the microvasculature and decreased tissue perfusion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Untreated leukostasis is associated with high mortality rates. Prompt recognition and management is required to improve outcomes of patients with leukostasis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis in hematologic malignancies are reviewed here.

         Leukostasis refers to symptoms or clinical findings associated with hyperleukocytosis. Leukostasis most often affects the central nervous system and lungs, but other organ systems (eg, heart, kidneys) may also be affected.
        </p>
        <p>
         The nature and severity of leukostatic symptoms are influenced by the type of leukemia, level of WBC count, and comorbid conditions. In general, symptoms of leukostasis are more common in leukemias with large, poorly deformable blasts, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML); leukostasis is much less common with leukemias of lymphoid origin.
        </p>
        <p>
         Management of hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis (ie, symptomatic hyperleukocytosis) varies with the underlying hematologic malignancy.

          Acute myeloid leukemia

         – Up to one-fifth of patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have hyperleukocytosis, but only a subset of these patients (eg, one-quarter of patients with hyperleukocytosis) have symptoms of leukostasis. Both hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis are associated with increased mortality in patients with AML, but the risk is greater in those with leukostatic symptoms.

         Hyperleukocytosis in AML has been associated with certain cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities. Hyperleukocytosis is more common in AML with monocytic features, mutated

         </span>
         The level of white blood cell count, type, and percentage of circulating blasts, increased blood viscosity, and endothelial damage contribute to the pathophysiology of leukostasis [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Leukostasis is thought to be due to increased blood viscosity caused by a large population of leukemic blasts that are less deformable than mature leukocytes [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Plugs of these more rigid cells can develop in the microcirculation as blast counts increase, thereby impeding blood flow [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. Red blood cell transfusions and dehydration (eg, from use of diuretics) can further increase whole blood viscosity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Local hypoxemia may be exacerbated by the high metabolic activity of blasts, excessive cytokine production, and adhesion molecules that mediate blast-endothelial cell interactions [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. Endothelial damage and subsequent hemorrhage add to the hypoxic damage from reduced blood flow. Leukemic blasts can migrate into the surrounding tissues, causing additional damage [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Leukostasis is most often seen in patients with acute myeloid leukemia; by contrast, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia are infrequently associated with leukostasis despite frequent hyperleukocytosis. The lower incidence of leukostasis and vascular injury in lymphoid leukemias may be related to the lack of catabolic enzymes and cytokines and/or lower metabolic activity in the malignant cells.

         The main clinical symptoms of leukostasis are related to the involvement of the central nervous system (approximately 40 percent) and lungs (approximately 30 percent) [

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In addition, patients with hyperleukocytosis have an increased risk for intracranial hemorrhage that persists for at least a week after the reduction of white cell count, perhaps due to reperfusion injury as previously ischemic areas of the brain regain blood flow.

         Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging should be performed in patients with new neurologic findings. Importantly, intravenous contrast dye should be avoided at a time when renal function may be compromised by leukostasis, tumor lysis syndrome, and dehydration.

         Leukostasis is an empiric clinical diagnosis that is made when a patient with leukemia and hyperleukocytosis presents with symptoms attributable to tissue hypoxia. The most common symptoms are respiratory or neurologic abnormalities, but cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and other organ systems may be affected. A pathologic diagnosis of leukostasis is not required and is rarely obtained because of the risks associated with biopsy of affected tissues.
        </p>
        <p>
         There should be a high degree of suspicion for diagnosing leukostasis, since some patients with acute myeloid leukemia and a lower WBC count can also manifest leukostatic symptoms (and pathologically proven leukostasis); such patients generally have a high percentage of circulating myeloblasts.

         For patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and hyperleukocytosis, with or without leukostatic symptoms, we suggest prompt initiation of cytoreductive chemotherapy rather than chemotherapy plus leukapheresis. Chemotherapy effectively reduces the extreme leukocytosis and associated symptoms; by contrast, effects of leukapheresis on hyperleukocytosis and symptom relief are transient and unproven.
        </p>
        <p>
         We generally reserve leukapheresis for symptomatic patients who cannot promptly receive intensive induction chemotherapy; this approach avoids adverse effects of the leukapheresis procedure for most patients with hyperleukocytosis. Some clinicians add leukapheresis to chemotherapy in patients with asymptomatic hyperleukocytosis. (See

          Procedure

          Outcomes

          30

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Anecdotal reports describe improvement in pulmonary and central nervous system symptoms with leukapheresis. However, even with highly efficient cell separators it is difficult to reduce a rapidly rising WBC count, and it is in such patients where the technical limitations and AEs are most relevant. Symptomatic leukostasis can still develop and/or persist after the WBC count has been lowered by leukapheresis, and it is unclear whether leukapheresis can reverse vascular damage already sustained from leukostasis.

         – Coagulation abnormalities, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), increase the risk of hemorrhage from interventions, such as the placement of large bore catheters for leukapheresis. Bleeding may be exacerbated in the setting of hyperleukocytosis because of high blast counts, hyperviscosity, and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Measures that can limit effects of DIC are discussed separately. (See

          Epidemiology

         – Hyperleukocytosis can occur with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other hematologic malignancies, but leukostasis rarely occurs except with AML. (See

          'Epidemiology'

          Presentation

         – Hyperleukocytosis may be associated with symptoms of leukostasis, tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and other complications of AML. (See

         – Leukostatic symptoms primarily relate to the CNS (eg, visual changes, headache, dizziness, tinnitus, confusion, somnolence, coma) and lungs (eg, dyspnea); less often, the gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, or other organs are affected. (See
