         While the same standards of obstetric care apply whether patients are living in correctional facilities or the community, the risk factors associated with incarceration and the operating systems of correctional facilities create specific challenges to the provision of routine obstetric care for residents of these facilities. These challenges include difficulties with communication and transportation, implementation of care plans, follow-up of abnormal tests, and guardianship for newborns. In a systematic review, key patient-reported concerns included mental health challenges, dehumanization of prenatal care and birthing, lack of privacy, stigma, psychological trauma, lack of emotional support, use of shackles, lack of access to female correctional officers, lack of timely medical care and support for breastfeeding, and the devastation of separation from their newborn [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will discuss issues encountered in caring for incarcerated pregnant people. Our recommendations are generally consistent with guidance provided by the American College Of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2

         ] and American College of Physicians [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. While much of the discussion is based on data and experience from the United States, the general care principles may be applicable to other locations. Topics on general medical care in correctional facilities, routine prenatal care, and the impact of parental incarceration on children are presented separately.

         In the United States, approximately 3 to 4 percent of females in state prisons and jails were pregnant between 2016 and 2017 [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5

         ]. Data on pregnancy and incarceration are limited because of variable reporting requirements and inconsistent pregnancy testing upon entry to correctional facilities.
        </p>
        <p>
         The female incarcerated population has increased at a rate double that of males in many countries [
         <a href="#rid6">

         To ensure that pregnant patients receive the care they need, good communication is essential among the on- and off-site medical staff and the security staff, as well as with the patient. Two major areas that need to be addressed are:

         <strong>
          Establishing a treatment schedule
         </strong>
         – On-site medical staff tend to establish treatment schedules and ensure feasibility of treatment plans (for both on- and off-site visits). The individual is then given permission per facility protocol (a written document or entry in the incarceration facility's computerized system) that allows them to leave their unit or other duties in the correctional facility to visit the medical unit at specified times for on-site care.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Most facilities request that future off-site appointments are communicated to the on-site health care providers so future transport can be arranged. Incarcerated individuals are typically not told of their future off-site appointment dates for security reasons.

          Advising on-site staff of pregnancy issues

         – Officers and on-site clinicians who do not regularly provide prenatal care for incarcerated people may need to be advised about pregnancy-related activity restrictions (eg, types of work assignments), safety issues (eg, use of the bottom bunk bed, restrictions on shackling such as no leg restraints), and nutritional requirements and interventions (eg, prenatal vitamin supplementation, continuous access to hydration, small frequent meals, special diets such as for gestational diabetes).

         While the resources of correctional systems vary, we have found the following approach enables expedient care for the pregnant person and successful communication among health care providers and correctional staff:

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         Upon entry into a correctional facility, the health provider enters routine pregnancy restrictions into the incarceration facility's computerized system that can be viewed by correctional officers and other on-site medical staff. The restrictions are active for the duration of pregnancy and for six weeks after the estimated date of delivery. This process occurs within 24 to 72 hours of arrival.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         If on-site prenatal providers are not present when a new patient arrives, orders for routine prenatal care and medications (eg, prenatal vitamins,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen
         </a>
         , anti-emetics) are reviewed by the admissions nurse with the on-call medical provider so patients can receive necessary treatments in a timely fashion. Appropriate pregnant patients may have certain medication orders approved for "keep on person" status, which allows the patient to take a supply of medication with them rather than returning to the medication line every time those drugs are needed.

         Electronic health records allow correctional staff and medical providers to communicate. The correctional staff can view the dates, times, and locations of all of the incarcerated individual's appointments (eg, court dates, medical appointments, mental health appointments or group sessions, childbirth classes [where available], or work assignments).
        </p>

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         For appointments at off-site facilities, the off-site providers place their notes and any follow-up appointment information in a sealed medical documents folder that the correctional officer carries back to the facility. The medical documents folder is then given to the nursing staff or a medical provider who ensures information about future appointments is entered into the incarceration facility's computerized system. If questions arise regarding the ability of the correctional facility to meet the requirements of the treatment plan, the correctional staff contacts the on-site nurse practitioner.
        </p>

         At times, incarcerated patients will ask the off-site obstetrics provider to authorize or request special privileges such as extra blankets, pillows, or food. We have found that if the off-site providers communicate these requests with on-site medical staff, the latter will review such requests with the correctional staff to make sure those special privileges are considered in the correctional setting to be medically necessary.

         Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), an incarcerated individual's medical information is deemed protected health information (PHI) [

          12

During prenatal visits, labor, and birth, the clinician may have to request that the correctional officer leave the room for examinations and procedures to ensure the patient's privacy. However, a correctional officer's presence may be necessary in some situations, such as security or escape issues.

         The process of obtaining patient consent for medical treatment or procedures is the same in correctional settings as in community settings.

         Specific to the correctional setting, incarcerated individuals may be banned from consenting to postpartum sterilization (permanent contraception) because of historic concerns around coercive sterilization. (See

         While incarcerated, individuals may retain a legal right to abortion services, but individual experience varies by the state, region, and facility [

          13,14
         </a>
         ]. Full access to services, including appointments, transportation, and payment, is not always available. For example, state and federal prisons may be prohibitively distant from an abortion clinic (75 to 383 miles) [

        </p>
        <p>
         Most correctional facilities do not pay for abortion-related services. Therefore, incarcerated pregnant people, who have limited opportunities to save or borrow money while in custody, must rely on private savings or must seek a donor through nonprofit sources [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,16
         </a>
         ]. Pregnancy termination procedures are considered an outpatient service, and in certain locations the costs are covered either by the health care vendor contracted by the Department of Corrections (DOC) or the DOC itself if there is no vendor. Hospital admissions of greater than 24 hours can be billed to Medicaid. The Hyde Amendment prohibits the use of federal dollars to fund abortions, which affects individuals in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.
        </p>
        <p>
         In our practice setting, abortion care is provided through our safety net hospital, and every attempt is made to provide same-day services (eg, counseling and, if desired, an abortion procedure at the same visit) to minimize patient discomfort and potential transportation challenges.

         </span>
         Prenatal care of incarcerated individuals is generally shared between on-site and community-based clinicians. Thus, transport to nearby medical facilities is typically needed for portions of routine care (eg, ultrasound for fetal anatomic survey) or to manage high-risk or complicated pregnancies. Transportation to and from an outside medical facility can be stressful, and some individuals decline outside medical care for this reason. Potential stressors include long wait times to pass through security systems, embarrassment about being seen in public in correctional facility uniforms and restraints, and the need to be strip searched on return to the correctional facility. Transportation to appointments can also be complicated by unanticipated lockdowns that halt movement of incarcerated individuals through and out of the facility.
        </p>
        <p>
         When caring for incarcerated patients with high-risk pregnancies, the amount of time required for the entire transport process needs to be factored into management plans. With the onset of a medical problem or emergency, the patient generally needs to contact a correctional officer, who will then contact a nurse, who will contact a clinician or other health care professional with obstetric experience before the decision is made to evaluate or transfer the patient. Additional time is required for passage through the security systems. These events occur before the patient is on their way to the outside medical facility, which could be a significant distance from the correctional facility where they are housed.

         Encourage correctional facilities to provide incarcerated individuals with medication in hand to bridge the individual to their next appointment. If medication cannot be released, the on-site medical staff can fax or call in prescriptions to outside pharmacies to be filled. In our experience, prescriptions are best written by the on-site medical staff as they have the most accurate information as to when the individual may be released from the facility (the individual often does not have this information). Institutional policies vary regarding provision of medication upon release [

         However, abnormal test results create additional challenges for incarcerated individuals because they have decreased or no contact with family and friends, and therefore limited psychosocial support. The father of the fetus may not be available for genetic testing, which is sometimes important when the maternal result is abnormal. In addition, incarcerated individuals have reduced access to information on the test/disease as correctional facilities typically have limited library resources and no internet access for them. For these reasons, clinicians are advised to discuss abnormal test results, provide counseling services, and offer diagnostic testing during the same visit, if possible, or as expediently as possible.

          Childbirth education and support

         We advise appointing a medical liaison to oversee medical/obstetric conditions that are primarily managed by off-site practitioner(s) to facilitate the communication of critical or complex care plans for high-risk pregnancies and help overcome obstacles to care. The medical liaison can communicate changes in the care plan with the facility clinicians, answer questions for the incarcerated individual or correctional staff, and help resolve system challenges or failures. In our practice, our liaison is a team composed of a nurse practitioner who is based entirely in the correctional facility, as well as an obstetrician-gynecologist who primarily works at the off-site hospital where incarcerated patients will deliver and comes to the correctional facility on a weekly basis to provide care.
        </p>
        <p>
         Incarcerated individuals tend to have complicated and/or high-risk pregnancies. Contributing factors include low socioeconomic status, late or no previous prenatal care, current or prior trauma (physical, sexual, psychological), illicit drug and/or excessive alcohol use, smoking, mental health disorders, chronic illness, and acute or chronic infectious diseases [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26-31
         </a>
         ]. As in any pregnancy, each patient is assessed for risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcome and monitored and treated as appropriate for the clinical situation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Medical complications of pregnancy that require special treatment plans are particularly challenging for incarcerated individuals because they have limited access to medical facilities and difficulties with transportation. As an example, incarcerated individuals are typically required to go to a medical unit every time a glucose level needs to be checked because medical equipment such as lancets can pose a security risk. The timing and frequency of access to the medical unit for procedures, such as glucose or blood pressure monitoring, can be restricted by the need for a nurse or correctional officer to call and escort the individual to the medical unit.

          Treatment
         </strong>
         – Those with a known diagnosis or who screen positive should be evaluated by a mental health specialist. Referral for mental health evaluation can be initiated by both medical and correctional staff. The request for evaluation is then triaged based on urgency. In the facility in which we provide health care, incarcerated individuals who do not require urgent care are seen within two weeks of the request. Drug treatment of mental health disorders must balance the risks and benefits of medication compared with no treatment for both the mother and the fetus (or breastfeeding infant). (See

         – Incarcerated individuals may have more problems with pregnancy-associated nausea and vomiting because they cannot control the timing of their meals, type of food that is available, and access to fluid. High-protein snacks and bland diets have been reported to be helpful, but incarcerated individuals may only be able to purchase less healthy snacks with commissary (canteen) funds, if available. Therefore, correctional facilities are advised to provide snacks outside of scheduled mealtimes and dietary flexibility (bland diets, high-protein snacks) for individuals experiencing pregnancy-associated nausea. Access to fluid should be available at all times. Ideally, incarcerated individuals should also have access to scheduled antiemetic drugs. (See

          3,6,51,55
         </a>
         ], the actual experience of pregnant incarcerated individuals may differ. In addition, existing anti-shackling laws often have grey areas with regards to use of restraints on pregnant individuals in transit or while in an off-site facility (including admission to a hospital, visit to an outside clinic, or court appearance) during the antepartum and postpartum periods [
         <a href="#rid56">

        <p>
         Concerns about shackles and handcuffs include that they can increase the risk of a fall, can prevent an individual from breaking a fall with their hands, and generally discourage ambulation. Abdominal trauma incurred during a fall can potentially cause placental abruption, which can lead to preterm labor and other adverse effects. To promote patient health and safety in regions where restraints are used, clinicians should discuss the risks to the mother and fetus with corrections facility administration and advocate for total adherence to existing anti-shackling laws and recommendations.

         </a>
         ], when compared with similarly disadvantaged obstetric populations, maternal and fetal outcomes actually improve with increasing lengths of incarceration (eg, less preterm birth and growth restriction, higher birth weight). The improved outcomes may reflect the effects of regular prenatal care, stable housing, provision of meals, better physical security, and a reduction in drug and alcohol use. However, access to and quality of prenatal care from prison to prison are variable, and individual prison systems and pre-incarceration conditions may play a role in pregnancy outcome [

          58

         <a href="#rid57">
          57

The gestational age at prison entry was not available, which could bias the findings since gestational age at study entry could be expected to affect the prospective risk of some outcomes.

For individuals likely to give birth while in custody, parenting and child custody services should be available in the correctional institution to facilitate guardianship planning prior to the birth [
         <a href="#rid63">
          63
         </a>
         ]. When advanced planning is not possible, the patient may have to wait until they have access to hospital social workers at the time of giving birth.

         Mothers who are eligible for contact with their infant may elect to breastfeed while in the hospital. This may require collaboration among correctional officers, obstetrics staff, newborn nursery/neonatal intensive care unit staff, and social workers to support her efforts. Upon discharge, medical providers in the correctional facility should be prepared to help the individual anticipate and treat engorgement, prevent mastitis using a tight-fitting bra, and identify signs of mastitis if they do occur.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prolonged breastfeeding is rarely an option given the lack of widespread on-site nurseries that would allow for newborns to remain with their mothers while still in custody. If separation between the mother and infant will be only temporary due to imminent release, a correctional facility may be able to make special arrangements for the mother to pump and discard the milk in order to preserve their milk supply.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some facilities have successful programs that allow incarcerated mothers to pump breast milk and have it stored until it can be picked up by the infant's guardian [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. However, most facilities do not have the infrastructure to support prolonged pumping due to: (1) lack of privacy when pumping, given shared cells and the need for correctional officers to maintain visual contact with incarcerated individuals; (2) concern for potential self-harm or creation of weapons with parts of electric breast pumps (but hand pumps are an alternative); and (3) lack of storage protocols for breast milk, considered a potential hazardous bodily fluid.

         Contraceptive options, including immediate postpartum placement of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), are discussed as part of routine prenatal care. For incarcerated individuals, contraceptive counseling also addresses the planned duration of imprisonment and any state laws that may ban permanent contraception (sterilization) procedures because of historic concerns around coercive sterilization [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64,65
         </a>
         ]. When contraception is offered at no cost while the individual is still incarcerated, they are 15 times more likely to start a method than if it is offered at no cost in the community [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to release to the community, incarcerated individuals can be given referral information for their ongoing contraceptive needs. One option is community-based Title X services (United States federally funded services for reproductive health targeting poor and underserved populations). Provision of emergency contraception is another option. In one study, 71 percent of female incarcerated individuals said they would accept an advance supply of emergency contraception upon release from the correctional facility [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67
         </a>
         ]. Another option is creating an infrastructure within the prison for prerelease female health visits that include sending a prescription for the first few months of the pill/patch/ring to a pharmacy close to where the individual will release, administering a depot

         injection to cover the first three months after discharge, or provision of LARC prior to release, as patient's medical history and contraceptive preferences dictate. (See

         Incarcerated individuals who are not offered a contraceptive are at increased risk of an unintended pregnancy. In one study, approximately half of a group of previously incarcerated individuals conceived within 90 days of leaving the correctional facility [

         In United States prisons, 62 percent of female incarcerated individuals are mothers of children under age 18 [
         <a href="#rid70">
          70

         <a href="#rid26">
          26,57,70
         </a>
         ]. After the mother was incarcerated, 45 percent of children lived with grandparents, 37 percent lived with the other parent, 30 percent lived with other family or friends, and 11 percent were in foster care [
         <a href="#rid70">
          70
         </a>
         ]. Foster care placement can be particularly stressful for mothers and their children because incarcerated mothers risk losing their parental rights if they are unable to meet court-mandated family reunification requirements for contact and visitation with their children [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Arrest and incarceration of a parent is a unique stress for affected children. In addition to this stress, poverty, parental substance use and mental illness, domestic violence, and inconsistent or unavailable caregivers put these children at risk for behavioral and developmental problems. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/620.html" rel="external">
          "Developmental and behavioral implications for children of incarcerated parents"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The familial disruption and risk to child welfare posed by incarceration has led several advocacy groups to call for alternatives to custodial terms and reduction of unnecessary imprisonment. Until such changes can be achieved, guidelines such as the United Nations Bangkok Rules promote the creation of maximum opportunities for incarcerated mothers to meet with their children as long as "public safety is not compromised" [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Family-centered services in correctional facilities can help parents use their sentence to strengthen their parenting skills, foster continued bonds with their children, and access community supports to assist them upon release.

         <strong>
          HIPAA
         </strong>
         – Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), an incarcerated individual's medical information is deemed protected health information (PHI). An off-site clinician can share medical information with the correctional facility if the PHI is necessary for the provision of health care or to protect the health and safety of the individual or other incarcerated individuals. Correctional officers should
         <strong>
          never
         </strong>
         be used to communicate between off-site and on-site providers as they are not health care providers nor are they held to HIPAA standards. (See

         – Obstetric standards for prenatal care, including genetic counseling, genetic screening, diagnostic testing, mental health screening, and ultrasound surveillance, are the same for incarcerated patients and those in the community. Incarcerated individuals are considered high risk for many infectious diseases where retesting in the third trimester is recommended. (See

          Transportation to and from the facility
         </strong>
         – Transport to nearby medical facilities is typically needed for portions of prenatal care and the amount of time required for the entire transport process needs to be factored into management plans. Some incarcerated individuals may decline transport because of associated stress. (See

          High-risk pregnancies

         – High-risk pregnancies are common. Contributing factors include low socioeconomic status, no or inadequate prenatal care, current or prior trauma (physical, sexual, and psychological), illicit drug and/or alcohol abuse, mental health disorders, chronic illness, and acute or chronic infectious diseases. As in any pregnancy, each patient is assessed for complicating risk factors and monitored and treated as appropriate for the clinical situation. (See

          Labor and birth
         </strong>
         – Although multiple legal and medical bodies advise that restraints should only be used on pregnant incarcerated individuals in extreme circumstances and that restraints should never be used during labor and delivery, the actual experience of these individuals may differ. In addition, existing anti-shackling laws often have grey areas with regards to use of restraints on pregnant incarcerated individuals in transit or while in an off-site facility (including admission to a hospital, visit to an outside clinic, or court appearance) during the antepartum and postpartum periods. (See

          Postpartum
         </strong>
         – Education about postpartum issues, including newborn placement, breastfeeding, and contraception, is begun during the prenatal care process. Most newborns will be separated from their mothers upon discharge from the hospital, and prolonged breastfeeding through pumping and storage is rarely an option. Screening for postpartum depression should be performed, as in all postpartum patients. (See

         </strong>
         – Most incarcerated pregnant individuals will be released prior to giving birth. On leaving a correctional setting, obstacles to continuous care include lack of stable housing and financial challenges. Steps that help ensure continuity of care after release include reestablishing medical insurance, scheduling follow-up appointments, transferring health care records to the outside providers, and providing bridge medication or prescriptions to cover the individual's needs until their next scheduled appointment.
