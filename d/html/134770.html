         Pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) is a term used to describe the clinical scenario in which a patient with a positive pregnancy test has a transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) that shows neither an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) nor an ectopic pregnancy. Importantly, this term is not a final diagnosis, but rather an entity that requires continued evaluation until a final diagnosis (ie, live intrauterine pregnancy, early pregnancy loss, ectopic pregnancy) is obtained [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the natural history of most PULs is an eventual IUP (either a live pregnancy or pregnancy loss), some pregnancies will be ectopic and can result in organ rupture and massive hemorrhage [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-7
         </a>
         ]. Thus, distinguishing between these entities is paramount as inappropriately early intervention could result in interruption of a desired ongoing IUP and delay in diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy can result in severe maternal morbidity and even mortality.

         </span>
         The natural history of a PUL is difficult to ascertain due to global differences in the diagnostic approach and management of such patients. Historically, final diagnoses among patients with PUL are as follows [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]: ectopic pregnancy (6 to 20 percent) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-7
         </a>
         ], intrauterine pregnancy (IUP; live or nonviable; 30 to 47 percent) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-9
         </a>
         ], and pregnancies where the location is never confirmed (50 to 70 percent) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-7,10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients in whom the location is never confirmed will either have a
         <strong>
          spontaneously
         </strong>
         resolving PUL (where human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] concentrations normalize without surgical or medical intervention) or a
         <strong>
          persisting
         </strong>
         PUL (where hCG concentrations do not normalize). Like the term PUL, persisting PUL is not a final diagnosis and possible final outcomes include [

         </span>
         Patients with a PUL may present with symptoms of early pregnancy (eg, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, breast tenderness) or those more consistent with ectopic pregnancy (eg, irregular vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/440.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, some patients may be asymptomatic and a diagnosis of PUL is made incidentally during evaluation of another medical problem or during routine laboratory testing after embryo transfer or other assisted reproductive technology treatment.

         A menstrual history is taken to estimate the gestational age (

         ). Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy are elicited, including prior ectopic pregnancy, prior tubal pathology (eg, pelvic inflammatory disease) or surgery (eg, tubal ligation), current use of an intrauterine device, and in vitro fertilization (IVF)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82282" href="/z/d/graphic/82282.html" rel="external">

         Abdominal and pelvic examinations are performed. Although there are no distinct findings that are specific to PUL, findings suggestive of a possible ectopic pregnancy (eg, adnexal mass) or impending intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) loss (eg, bleeding from the cervix and an open cervical os), may prompt more expedited evaluation and management.

         Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is the mainstay of both the initial and subsequent evaluations in patients in whom PUL is suspected and its use in the assessment of a PUL cannot be overstated. A detailed review of ultrasound findings in PUL (including nonspecific findings such as a pseudosac or decidual cyst) is provided separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5410.html" rel="external">
          "Ultrasonography of pregnancy of unknown location"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Interpretation of TVUS findings should always consider the gestational age (if known with reasonable certainty) and the serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level. A gestational sac is not expected to be visualized in pregnancies less than five weeks [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) suggests that practices maintain a PUL detection rate of &lt;15 percent [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. However, rates of detection vary widely, and diagnostic performance is highly dependent on operator experience and the population evaluated. For example, studies have shown that 5 to 42 percent of patients undergoing TVUS during early pregnancy will be classified as having a PUL [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5,12,13
         </a>
         ]; this range is narrowed to 8 to 10 percent in practices with specialized training [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,14
         </a>
         ]. Rates are typically lower in early pregnancy units (also referred to as early pregnancy assessment clinics) and low-risk populations (eg, no risk factors for ectopic pregnancy  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82282" href="/z/d/graphic/82282.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         ), regular menses with known last menstrual period [LMP]), and higher in patients in whom the gestational age is unknown or in emergency department evaluations where early pregnancy ultrasound experience may be more limited.

For patients in whom an initial hCG level is &lt;10,000 mIU/mL, the expected rate of rise is dependent on initial hCG level and should be at least 49 percent for an initial hCG level of &lt;1500 mIU/mL, 40 percent for an initial hCG level of 1500 to 3000 mIU/mL, and 33 percent for an initial hCG level of &gt;3000 mIU/mL, respectively [

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The M4 model uses the hCG ratio and log of the average hCG level to predict PUL outcome by estimating the risk of an ectopic pregnancy. In a multicenter external validation study including over 1900 patients, patients with a PUL were classified into low- (risk of ectopic pregnancy &lt;5 percent) and high-risk (risk of ectopic pregnancy ≥5 percent) groups [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Low-risk patients were further categorized as those most likely to have spontaneously resolving PULs or IUPs; such patients were followed with a urine hCG in two weeks (spontaneously resolving PUL) or a TVUS in one week (IUP). By contrast, high-risk patients were followed with serial serum hCG and TVUS performed every 48 hours until a final diagnosis was made. Overall, approximately 70 percent of patients were classified as low risk and this classification was correct in approximately 97 percent of patients. Approximately 85 percent of ectopic pregnancies were correctly classified as high risk. Subsequent applications of this model in other populations have not demonstrated the same high rates of accuracy [

         The M6-P model is another logistic regression model that was developed as an extension of the M4 model and utilizes a serum progesterone level prior to the application of the hCG ratio. If the serum progesterone level is ≤2 nmol/L, patients are classified as low risk for ectopic pregnancy and managed with a urine hCG test in two weeks. All other patients receive hCG serum draws at 0 and 48 hours and are managed similarly to the M4 model. In a study of 2753 patients with PUL, the first step (ie, obtaining a serum progesterone alone) classified 16.6 percent of cases as low risk, but 2.9 percent of ectopic pregnancies were also classified as low risk [

         Hemodynamically unstable patients are those experiencing large volumes of blood loss most likely from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, or, less commonly, a hemorrhage from an early IUP loss. Such patients require immediate fluid resuscitation and surgical intervention (ie, abdominal exploration [typically with laparoscopy] and/or uterine evacuation).

        <p>
         Both procedures may be necessary: laparoscopy to allow removal of the ectopic pregnancy and hemoperitoneum, and uterine evacuation to inform further management and counseling regarding recurrence risks. In this way, surgery will be both diagnostic and therapeutic. However, the use of uterine curettage as a diagnostic tool is limited by the potential for disruption of a live pregnancy.

          Desired pregnancy
         </strong>
         – For patients with a desired pregnancy, expectant management is with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) assessment every 48 hours and periodic transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) assessment provided the patient remains stable and until a final pregnancy outcome (ie, ectopic pregnancy, IUP, treated PUL, resolved PUL) is confirmed  (

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For patients in whom hCG concentration is rising at expected rates of a viable pregnancy (see
         <a class="local">
          'hCG testing'

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For patients in whom hCG concentration is declining, TVUS should be repeated only as clinically necessary and is not needed to confirm pregnancy resolution. A fall in serum hCG of 21 to 35 percent (depending on initial hCG level) over 48 hours suggests that the PUL is not viable and may support continued expectant management [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. For such patients, the provider should again discuss the advantages and disadvantages of further expectant management versus surgical or medical treatment. Randomized trials including patients with PUL and falling hCG levels have shown that up to 40 percent of expectedly managed patients will ultimately undergo medical or surgical management [

          Undesired pregnancy
         </strong>
         – For those with an undesired pregnancy, choices for management include both proactive (ie, expedited or active) and expectant management  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef140925" href="/z/d/graphic/140925.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 2
         </a>
         ). Proactive management may reduce the number of follow-up tests (eg, ultrasound and serum hCG levels) and decrease the risks associated with a progressing ectopic pregnancy (eg, tubal rupture).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For patients choosing proactive management, a diagnostic uterine evacuation (with or without a laparoscopy in patients with an adnexal mass [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]) is typically performed. If chorionic villi are present, an IUP is confirmed, and no further management is necessary. The absence of chorionic villi on pathology, however, does not confirm the presence of an ectopic pregnancy. The sensitivity of curettage in finding chorionic villi is only 70 percent [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. Pipelle endometrial biopsy is even less sensitive than curettage for detection of villi; sensitivities reported in two small series were 30 and 60 percent [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34,35

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Thus, serial hCG concentrations are followed after uterine evacuation to assess for further decline, plateau, or rise, but can be discontinued if chorionic villi are present on final pathology. A fall in serum hCG of at least 15 to 20 percent suggests the pregnancy was intrauterine and serial hCG levels can then be followed until undetectable [

         The term persistent PUL is used to describe gestations that begin as a PUL but are never visualized and do not resolve spontaneously. Approximately 2 percent of patients with an initial asymptomatic persistent PUL will ultimately experience tubal rupture [

        <p>
         For such patients, active management rather than expectant management may result in more successful resolution of the pregnancy. In a randomized trial including 255 patients with a persisting PUL, more patients receiving uterine aspiration and/or

         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ]. Success rates were similar for patients receiving either uterine evacuation (with or without methotrexate) or methotrexate alone but time to resolution was six days shorter in the group who received uterine evacuation. Ectopic pregnancy rupture requiring laparoscopy for definitive treatment occurred in a total of five patients (2 percent). The study had a high cross-over rate with patients preferentially crossing over to the expectant management group. The success of active management was higher in this trial than other trials [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30,31,38

         </span>
         The distinction between patients with a persistent PUL and those with a nonpregnancy-related cause of persistently elevated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) concentrations can be difficult. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Differential diagnosis'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsequent workup for rare entities responsible for elevations in hCG should be considered when patients do not fit the typical picture for having a gestational source of hCG or when other specific characteristics are present. For example, patients who are menopausal, perimenopausal, or who have recently undergone chemotherapy may have pituitary production of hCG, especially when levels are between 7 and 15 mIU/mL. In these cases, measurements of luteinizing hormone in the menopausal range and/or decline of hCG with estradiol supplementation confirms the pituitary as the source of hCG production. Additionally, patients with low hCG levels and a history of animal exposure (eg, farmers, veterinarians) may have heterophilic antibodies causing a false-positive elevation. These patients are easily triaged with the use of contemporary assays (that routinely include animal immunoglobin) or assessing urine hCG (as heterophilic antibodies are too large to be filtered by glomeruli).

          Definition
         </strong>
         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) is a term used to describe the clinical scenario in which a patient with a positive pregnancy test has a transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) that shows neither an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) nor an ectopic pregnancy. This term is not a final diagnosis, but rather an entity that requires continued evaluation until a final diagnosis (ie, live IUP, early pregnancy loss, ectopic pregnancy) is obtained. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction and defintion'

         <strong>
          Natural history
         </strong>
         – Final diagnoses among patients with PUL include ectopic pregnancy (6 to 20 percent), IUP (live or nonviable; 30 to 47 percent), and pregnancies where the location is never confirmed (50 to 70 percent). Patients in whom the location is never confirmed will either have a spontaneously resolving PUL (where human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] concentrations normalize without surgical or medical intervention) or a persisting PUL (where hCG concentrations do not normalize).

         TVUS is the mainstay of both the initial and subsequent evaluations in patients in whom PUL is suspected. Interpretation of TVUS findings should always consider the gestational age (if known with reasonable certainty) and the serum hCG level. (See

         – Subsequent testing with both serial serum hCG and TVUS assessment is used for selected patients (eg, hemodynamically stable patients with a desired pregnancy). For patients with hemodynamic instability or in whom the pregnancy is undesired, management can be expedited, and subsequent testing may not be needed. (See

         – Hemodynamically stable patients with a desired pregnancy can be expectantly managed. Expectant management consists of hCG assessment every 48 hours and periodic TVUS assessment until a final pregnancy outcome (ie, ectopic pregnancy, IUP, treated PUL, resolved PUL) is confirmed  (
