Intact phrenic nerve function is required for effective pacing. The typical approach has been to pace the diaphragm via stimulation of the phrenic nerve at the level of the neck or thorax. However, pacing of the phrenic nerve at the level of the diaphragm may also be used in some patients.</p><p>Patient selection, evaluation for pacemaker candidacy, implantation technique, postoperative recovery, and complications of pacemaker placement will be reviewed here. The etiology, diagnosis, and management of patients with bilateral and unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5115.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic evaluation of adults with bilateral diaphragm paralysis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16185.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and management of nontraumatic unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis (complete or partial) in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5122.html" rel="external">"Treatment of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4990.html" rel="external">"Diaphragmatic paralysis in the newborn"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">SELECTION OF POTENTIAL CANDIDATES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Diaphragmatic pacing is typically a second line therapy for patients with ventilatory failure due to bilateral paralysis or severe paresis of the diaphragm [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. This population of patients has traditionally been ventilated invasively with a mechanical ventilator, or noninvasively with positive pressure support. However, diaphragmatic pacing can be used in a select group of patients who cannot tolerate, have a desire to be liberated from, or have a desire to delay the need for noninvasive or invasive ventilatory support, the details of which are discussed in the sections below. (See <a class="local">'Upper cervical spinal cord injury (above C3)'</a> below and <a class="local">'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis'</a> below and <a class="local">'Other patient populations'</a> below.)</p><p>Importantly, paralysis/paresis of the diaphragm can be due to muscle, nerve, or central nervous system disease, and only patients with intact phrenic nerve function are amenable to pacing. Notably, diaphragmatic pacing should be avoided in patients with evidence of a denervated diaphragm. (See <a class="local">'Upper cervical spinal cord injury (above C3)'</a> below and <a class="local">'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis'</a> below and <a class="local">'Other patient populations'</a> below.)</p><p>It should be recognized by physicians and patients that only small case series have demonstrated benefits from diaphragmatic pacing including a reduction or a delay in the need for ventilatory support. Randomized trials are needed to validate these and other clinically important outcomes, including the effect of pacing on lung function and overall survival, compared with standard forms of ventilatory support (invasive or noninvasive ventilation) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5116.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilatory support and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation for patients with respiratory muscle dysfunction"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5118.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Practical aspects of initiation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5114.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Patient selection and alternative modes of ventilatory support"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4389.html" rel="external">"Tracheostomy: Rationale, indications, and contraindications"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1638.html" rel="external">"Management and prognosis of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation"</a> and <a class="local">'Making the decision to pace'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H277252"><span class="h2">Upper cervical spinal cord injury (above C3)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with apnea due to bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis from complete upper cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) above the third cervical level (C3; quadriplegia) are the most suitable candidates for diaphragmatic pacing. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5120.html" rel="external">"Respiratory complications in the adult patient with chronic spinal cord injury"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5119.html" rel="external">"Respiratory physiologic changes following spinal cord injury"</a>.)</p><p>The biologic rationale for pacing in this population is that phrenic nerve function is usually intact and can be stimulated at the level of the neck, thorax, and diaphragm. The nerve cell bodies of the phrenic nerve are located in the anterior horns of C3 to C5. Thus, ideal candidates are those with injury above C3 (ie, a central cause for bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis). In contrast, patients with trauma to the mid-cervical spine (C3 through C5) or with concurrent direct trauma to the phrenic nerve (eg, ischemia or crush injury) are less suitable as candidates for phrenic nerve pacing because phrenic nerve function at the lower motor neuron level is disrupted. Importantly, the diaphragm <strong>cannot</strong> be paced if it is completely denervated. The assessment of phrenic nerve function is discussed separately. (See <a class="local">'Intact phrenic nerve function'</a> below.)</p><p>Traditionally, the diaphragm was paced in this population using phrenic nerve stimulation at the level of the neck (cervical approach) or thorax (thoracic approach). A more advanced technique of stimulating the phrenic nerve at the level of the diaphragm (direct diaphragmatic pacing stimulation; DPS) has since been reported in this population. Data that supports each of these approaches include the following (see <a class="local">'Technique'</a> below): </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cervical or thoracic approach</strong> – The efficacy of bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation at the cervical or thoracic level is derived from case reports and retrospective series [<a href="#rid3">3-11</a>]. As examples:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>One center reviewed their experience with phrenic nerve stimulation in 22 children and young adults, most of whom had ventilatory failure secondary to high level SCI [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Successful pacing of the diaphragm was reported for 11 years in one patient, 10 years in four patients, and five years or less for 17 patients. Only two patients failed all efforts at diaphragmatic pacing. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Another single center study of 20 patients with posttraumatic quadriplegia reported that 18 patients were successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation with phrenic nerve stimulation performed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A 15-year retrospective analysis of 12 quadriplegic patients who underwent cervical or thoracic phrenic nerve pacemaker placement reported that, despite prior concerns, chronic pacing was <strong>not</strong> associated with progressive phrenic nerve damage or loss of diaphragmatic function over time [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Half of the patients were paced for 15 years with the remainder undergoing pacing for two years or more. Pacing was well tolerated, and reasons for discontinuation included intercurrent medical illness and lack of social support. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diaphragmatic approach</strong> – Preliminary studies report successful phrenic nerve stimulation at the diaphragmatic level (ie, DPS) in patients with upper level SCI [<a href="#rid12">12-16</a>]. Stimulation at this level is directed to phrenic nerve branches at their points of insertion into the diaphragm; the muscle is not stimulated directly. As examples:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>One multicenter prospective evaluation of a laparoscopic DPS system was conducted in 50 adults with upper level SCI [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Time from SCI to implantation ranged from three months to 27 years. There were no perioperative deaths or infections. DPS resulted in adequate diaphragmatic contraction in all patients and reduced the time spent on mechanical ventilation (decrease by four or more hours). Almost half of the group was weaned off ventilatory support completely. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A retrospective multicenter study of 22 patients with upper level SCI treated with DPS within 40 days of the original injury reported that most patients (76 percent) were ventilator-free after ten days [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. One-third of patients had resumption of spontaneous breathing over a similar time period such that pacing was no longer required. These data should be interpreted with caution as most patients were paced within the first three months following injury, a period during which spontaneous recovery of phrenic nerve function may have occurred.   </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A retrospective review of 92 patients with upper level SCI who were treated with DPS within an average of 47.5 months (6 days to 25 years) of their injury found that 60.8 percent used diaphragm pacing 24 hours a day [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. In that cohort five patients had full recovery of breathing. Subgroup analysis revealed that earlier initiation of diaphragm pacing led to a greater likelihood of 24 hour use of diaphragm pacing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A retrospective review of 101 patients with acute cervical SCI was done at a single level I trauma center [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Forty patients who had laparoscopic DPS were matched to 61 patients who did not. Hospital length of stay and mortality were significantly lower in the DPS patients, though this may in part be related to improved critical care during that time the patients were treated. </p><p></p><p>Phrenic nerve stimulation has been combined with intercostal nerve stimulation as a means to augment inspiratory effort in quadriplegic patients with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis who have only one functionally intact phrenic nerve (ie, only one diaphragm can be paced). One case series studied unilateral phrenic nerve stimulation (using the thoracic approach) <strong>combined</strong> with bilateral intercostal nerve stimulation in four quadriplegic patients who only had one functionally intact phrenic nerve [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. The combination resulted in increased maximum inspired volume such that all patients could be maintained off mechanical ventilation for 16 to 24 hours a day. Intercostal muscle pacing requires intact intercostal nerve function and a hemilaminectomy to access the thoracic spinal cord where the nerve roots are located. Intercostal muscle pacing with or without concurrent phrenic nerve stimulation remains investigational. </p><p>Others have combined phrenic nerve reconstruction with diaphragm pacemakers in cases where neither phrenic nerve is functionally intact. In one study of 14 male patients with bilateral diaphragmatic dysfunction, phrenic nerve reconstruction combined with diaphragm pacing was significantly more effective in improving respiratory physiology and diaphragm contractions than pacing alone [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15134.html" rel="external">"Surgical treatment of phrenic nerve injury", section on 'Phrenic nerve reconstruction'</a>.)</p><p>Pacing devices for each approach are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in patients with upper level SCI who have ventilatory failure due to bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. </p><p>The surgical implantation of cervical, thoracic, and diaphragmatic pacemakers are described separately.

We do not recommend direct diaphragmatic pacing stimulation (DPS) in patients with ALS since randomized trials have reported no benefit and potential harm in this population.

With disease progression, the lower motor neurons that innervate the diaphragm via the phrenic nerve degenerate, resulting in muscle denervation and diaphragmatic paresis and paralysis. Thus, this population is not suitable for diaphragmatic pacing via the thoracic or cervical approach since the phrenic nerve conduction is not fully intact. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5136.html" rel="external">"Clinical features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other forms of motor neuron disease"</a>.)</p><p>Use of direct diaphragmatic pacing stimulation (DPS) in patients with ALS is controversial. We believe that patients with ALS are <strong>not</strong> suitable candidates for DPS. This belief is based upon the rationale that not only is it not a viable strategy if the number of innervated muscle fibers is insufficient to drive contraction of the diaphragm, data derived from two randomized trials have reported potential harm in association with its use. Data that describe the use of DPS in patients with ALS include the following [<a href="#rid12">12,29,32-34</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Three uncontrolled randomized trials showed no benefit or harm associated with DPS:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>One multicenter randomized trial of 74 patients with respiratory failure from ALS reported reduced survival when DPS was used in combination with NIV compared with patients treated with NIV alone (11 versus 23 months) [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].

The diaphragm is then formally ‘mapped’ to identify rapid motor points of maximal contraction for optimal placement of the stimulating electrodes. Mapping involves both qualitative (ie, direct visualization) and quantitative (changes in abdominal pressure) assessment of diaphragm contraction. In addition, identifying motor points for posterior leaflet contraction is important for the avoidance of postoperative lobar collapse and atelectasis. Once the sites are identified, two electrodes are placed on each diaphragmatic leaflet (anterior and posterior)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77888" href="/d/graphic/77888.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). Connecting wires are brought out through the epigastric port and tunneled to a receiver that is created in a subcutaneous pocket located in the chest or abdomen. The connections are made, the pacemaker is tested to ensure good diaphragmatic contraction, and wounds are closed. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H182312382"><span class="h2">Intraoperative anesthesia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because visualization or imaging of diaphragmatic contraction is required intraoperatively, neuromuscular blocking agents (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9952" href="/d/drug information/9952.html" rel="external">succinylcholine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10041" href="/d/drug information/10041.html" rel="external">vecuronium</a>) and long acting muscle relaxants (eg, valium) should be avoided in most patients during diaphragmatic pacemaker surgery [<a href="#rid59">59-62</a>].

We suggest an initial amplitude setting of 25 mA, a frequency below 20 Hertz, and pulse width below 200 microseconds.  </p><p>Settings can be altered to optimize ventilation and gas exchange while simultaneously avoiding patients discomfort during the diaphragmatic conditioning period, the details of which are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Conditioning of the diaphragm'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1312603"><span class="h2">Conditioning regimen</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Conditioning may begin immediately after surgery but we typically wait for a period of healing around the nerve to occur for one to two weeks prior to starting a conditioning regimen. Conditioning takes weeks to months but may be prolonged (six months to one year) in those in whom diaphragmatic paralysis was present for two years or more prior to pacing [<a href="#rid4">4,63,64</a>]. Pacemaker settings are adjusted according to parameters that indicate adequate minute ventilation (tidal volume x respiratory rate), adequate gas exchange, and comfort level. Conditioning can occur at home or as an inpatient in a rehabilitation facility depending upon the comfort level of staff and caregivers with the equipment. </p><p>The regimen for diaphragm conditioning should be individualized as it varies from patient to patient and with the population studied. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with spinal cord injury, we use the following regimen:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pacing should commence slowly with a set duration of pacing time allocated to each hour during waking hours (eg, five minutes per hour while awake followed by 10 to 12 hours of nocturnal rest on mechanical ventilation). The pacing duration is extended on a daily or weekly basis (eg, 10 minutes per hour, 15 minutes per hour, etc) during waking hours until the patient is ventilator-free for the maximum amount of time that it is tolerated. The goal is to be ventilator-free for at least the awake period of the day and preferably for 24 hours a day.  </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The patient should be monitored during pacing for respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, as well as for comfort level and pain. The tidal volume of a paced breath should also be followed intermittently to ensure that the minimum target goal of 15 percent above the basal tidal volume is reached (basal tidal volume is usually 5 to 7 mL/kg).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pulse oximetry and arterial blood gases are monitored frequently (eg, initially daily and eventually weekly). In our experience, hypercapnia is one of the more common problems encountered during the conditioning period and may be responsible for the feeling of dyspnea during the transition period. It can usually be avoided by adjusting the ventilatory rate on the pacemaker. Alternatively, some experts will reduce the respiratory rate and tidal volume on the mechanical ventilator for several days prior to the initiation of pacing. This allows mild permissive hypercapnia and bicarbonate buffering, which resets central chemoreceptors, thereby avoiding acute hypercapnic acidosis during pacing hours and reducing the sensation of dyspnea. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although many patients may be weaned off ventilatory support for 24 hours a day, some only partially meet this goal and still require a tracheostomy for supplementary ventilation. For those who successfully wean off completely, many need a tracheostomy as a backup in the event of equipment failure. For those who choose to remove their tracheostomy, an Ambu bag should be available for the same reason.
