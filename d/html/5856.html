Deficient mineralization can result in rickets and/or osteomalacia. Rickets refers to deficient mineralization at the growth plate, as well as architectural disruption of this structure. Osteomalacia refers to impaired mineralization of the bone matrix. Rickets and osteomalacia usually occur together as long as the growth plates are open; only osteomalacia occurs after the growth plates have fused [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2045.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and etiology of osteomalacia"</a>.)</p><p>An overview of the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and the differential diagnosis of rickets is presented here. The etiology and treatment of calcipenic and phosphopenic rickets are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5804.html" rel="external">"Etiology and treatment of calcipenic rickets in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5802.html" rel="external">"Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets and tumor-induced osteomalacia"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2808886247"><span class="h1">TYPES OF RICKETS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mineralization defects are classified according to the predominant mineral deficiency:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Calcipenic rickets</strong> is caused by calcium deficiency, which usually is due to insufficient intake of vitamin D or failure to metabolize dietary vitamin D into its active form. In some cases, it is caused by insufficient intake or absorption of calcium in the setting of normal vitamin D levels. Calcipenic rickets may be associated with low serum calcium levels but also occurs in the setting of normocalcemia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Phosphopenic rickets</strong> is characterized by low serum levels of phosphorus, usually caused by renal phosphate wasting and, less commonly, by nutritional phosphorus deficiency.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Growth plate thickness is determined by two opposing processes [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Calcification of growth plate cartilage with subsequent vascular invasion of the growth plate and conversion to primary bone spongiosa</p><p></p><p>Vascular invasion requires mineralization of the growth plate cartilage, which is delayed or prevented by deficiency of calcium or phosphorus [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. In these circumstances, growth plate cartilage accumulates and the growth plate expands. In addition, the chondrocytes of the growth plate become disorganized, losing their columnar orientation [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>] with characteristic expansion of the hypertrophic zone and impaired mineralization [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In the bone tissue below the growth plate (metaphysis), the mineralization defect leads to the accumulation of osteoid [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>These abnormalities alter the overall geometry of the involved skeletal sites, leading to secondary increases in the diameters of the growth plate and metaphysis. These changes may be regarded as an attempt to compensate for decreased bone strength by increased bone diameter. Nonetheless, bone stability is compromised. If the underlying condition does not improve, a structural deformity, such as bowing, ensues.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Calcipenic and phosphopenic rickets initially manifest at the distal forearm, knee, and costochondral junctions.

The typical findings of advanced rickets include [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Delayed closure of the fontanelles</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Parietal and frontal bossing</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Craniotabes (soft skull bones)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Enlargement of the costochondral junction visible as beading along the anterolateral aspects of the chest (the "rachitic rosary")  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81446" href="/z/d/graphic/81446.html" rel="external">image 1</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Formation of Harrison sulcus (or groove) at the lower margin of the thorax caused by the inward pull by diaphragmatic attachments of the softened lower ribs</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Widening of the wrist and bowing of the distal radius and ulna</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Progressive lateral bowing of the femur and tibia  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66400" href="/z/d/graphic/66400.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>)</p><p></p><p>The site and type of deformity of the extremities depend upon the age of the child and the weight-bearing patterns in the limbs. Thus, deformities of the forearms and posterior bowing of the distal tibia are more common in infants, whereas an exaggeration of the normal physiologic bowing of the legs (genu varum) is a characteristic finding in the toddler who has started to walk  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66400" href="/z/d/graphic/66400.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53635" href="/z/d/graphic/53635.html" rel="external">image 2</a>). In the older child, valgus deformities of the legs ("knock-knees") or a windswept deformity (valgus deformity of one leg and varus deformity of the other) may be apparent. The type of deformity depends upon the biomechanical forces acting on the lower extremities at the time when the structural weakness develops. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6285.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with bow-legs", section on 'Rickets'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6290.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with knock-knees", section on 'Other causes'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2256742"><span class="h2">Radiographic findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The changes of rickets are best visualized at the growth plates of rapidly growing bones, where mineral demand is greatest. Thus, in the upper limbs, the distal ulna is the site that best demonstrates the early signs of impaired mineralization  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80989" href="/z/d/graphic/80989.html" rel="external">image 3</a>). In the lower extremities, the metaphyses above and below the knees are the most useful sites.</p><p>Radiographic signs include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Epiphyseal/metaphyseal interface</strong> – Early signs of rickets are widening of the epiphyseal plate and loss of definition of the zone of provisional calcification at the epiphyseal/metaphyseal interface  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80989" href="/z/d/graphic/80989.html" rel="external">image 3</a>). As the disease progresses, this region becomes more disorganized, with cupping, splaying, formation of cortical spurs, and stippling. The appearance of the epiphyseal bone centers may be delayed or they may be small, osteopenic, and ill defined [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Long bones</strong> – The shafts of the long bones are osteopenic, and the cortices may become thin. The trabecular pattern is reduced and becomes coarse. Deformities of the shafts of the long bones are often present.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Looser zones and fractures</strong> – In severe rickets, pathologic fractures and Looser zones (also known as Milkman pseudofractures or insufficiency fractures) may be noted [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Looser zones represent partial-thickness cortical fractures and are radiographically apparent as narrow radiolucent lines 2 to 5 mm in width, often with sclerotic borders, usually perpendicular to the cortical margin. They are characteristic of severe osteomalacia  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52768" href="/z/d/graphic/52768.html" rel="external">image 4</a>) and are often observed in the femur (at the femoral neck or under the lesser trochanter) or at pubic and ischial rami. The ulna, scapula, clavicle, rib, and metatarsal bones also may develop these lesions and show increased radionuclide uptake ("hot spots") on bone scans [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Extraskeletal findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The extraskeletal manifestations of rickets vary depending upon the primary mineral deficiency. Hypoplasia of the dental enamel is a typical finding of calcipenic rickets, whereas dental abscesses occur more often in heritable forms of phosphopenic rickets. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6276.html" rel="external">"Developmental defects of the teeth", section on 'Enamel defects'</a>.)</p><p>Calcipenic rickets can affect the musculoskeletal system with decreased muscle tone, leading to delayed achievement of motor milestones [<a href="#rid13">13-15</a>]. Presentation with hypocalcemic seizures occurs most frequently in the first year of life [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Transient cardiomyopathy may be evident [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. Children with calcipenic rickets also are particularly prone to acquiring infectious diseases [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>].

In contrast, PTH concentrations are usually normal or only modestly elevated in phosphopenic rickets. If phosphorus deficiency is nutritional or not mediated by fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), PTH levels may be in the low-normal range.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Alkaline phosphatase</strong> – Serum alkaline phosphatase activity usually is increased markedly over the age-specific reference range in nutritional rickets (often up to 2000 international units/L), whereas the level is elevated to a lesser extent (400 to 800 international units/L) in the common form of heritable phosphopenic rickets (X-linked hypophosphatemia [XLH]). Alkaline phosphatase participates in the mineralization of bone and growth plate cartilage and is an excellent marker of disease activity [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vitamin D</strong> – Serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) reflect the amount of vitamin D stored in the body and, consequently, are low in vitamin D deficiency.

However, in some forms of phosphopenic rickets (those mediated by excess FGF23, such as XLH and tumor-induced osteomalacia [TIO]), serum concentrations of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D may be low or inappropriately normal (in view of the ambient hypophosphatemia, which would normally increase production of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D). In other forms of phosphopenic rickets (those not mediated by excess FGF23, such as hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria [HHRH]), the serum concentration of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D may be elevated.

Rickets is an unlikely diagnosis if all of these values are normal. Serum creatinine and liver enzymes should be measured to screen for renal and liver disease, respectively.
