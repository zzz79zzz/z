         Hyperkalemia is defined as a serum or plasma potassium that is higher than the upper limit of normal potassium, which typically is considered to be 5.5 mEq/L (mmol/L)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86501" href="/z/d/graphic/86501.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Although children are less likely to develop hyperkalemia than adults, pediatric hyperkalemia is not an uncommon occurrence. Severe hyperkalemia (potassium level greater than 7 mEq/L [mmol/L]) is a serious medical problem that needs immediate attention.
        </p>
        <p>
         The etiology, clinical findings, diagnosis, and evaluation of pediatric hyperkalemia are reviewed here. The management of hyperkalemia in children is presented separately. (See

         Homeostatic mechanisms regulate potassium balance to maintain high intracellular levels required for cellular functions (eg, metabolism and growth) and low extracellular concentration to preserve the steep concentration gradient across the cell membrane needed for nerve excitation and muscle contraction. After a bolus of potassium intake, these normal physiologic processes preserve the intra- and extracellular balance via transcellular potassium movement regulated by cell membrane Na-K-ATPase (mediated by insulin and alpha and beta-2 adrenergic agonists) and urinary potassium excretion (mostly mediated by aldosterone). In children, positive potassium balance is needed for growth, whereas in adults, homeostasis is directed towards a zero potassium balance.
        </p>
        <p>
         Normal serum and plasma potassium concentrations in children and adolescents are similar to levels in adults. However, infants have a higher normal range of potassium because of their reduced urinary potassium excretion, caused by their relatively increased aldosterone insensitivity and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR)  (

         Hyperkalemia in children is caused by derangements of the homeostatic mechanisms that normally regulate potassium balance, which are the same as those that occur in adults. Understanding the underlying physiology is helpful in the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of children with hyperkalemia. (See

         </span>
         In normal children, large increases in usual dietary sources of potassium are unlikely to lead to sustained hyperkalemia as normally intact homeostatic mechanisms protect against elevated extracellular potassium. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Normal potassium balance and levels'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Rarely, normal homeostatic mechanisms can be overwhelmed by excessively large loads of potassium that may be delivered in intravenous (IV) fluids, parenteral nutrition, IV medications with a high potassium content (eg, potassium penicillin), or massive transfusions of blood [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. However, this is unlikely to occur with correct prescription and administration of these substances in a child with normal cardiovascular and kidney function. Infants and small children are more likely to develop clinically significant hyperkalemia because, for a given intake, the rise in potassium concentration is greater as these patients have a smaller volume of distribution.

         </span>
         In children, metabolic acidosis is the most common cause of intracellular potassium movement to the extracellular space without cellular injury. In this setting, the intracellular movement of hydrogen ions causes the potassium to shift into the extracellular space to maintain electroneutrality. Metabolic acidosis is often caused by or is associated with a decreased effective arterial blood volume, which may impact urinary potassium excretion. The reestablishment of adequate perfusion generally results in the restoration of both normal acid-base status and urinary potassium excretion. (See

         Children with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis can present with hyperkalemia caused by transcellular relocation of potassium. Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis is an autosomal dominant condition that encodes for a protein of the sodium channel of skeletal muscles. In these patients, the sodium channel closes too slowly, leading to intracellular potassium movement into the extracellular space, which results in hyperkalemia and muscle weakness. Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis can present in infancy and needs to be considered in any young child with hyperkalemia and concomitant muscle weakness. (See

         Hypoaldosteronism (type 4 renal tubular acidosis) – Hyperkalemia may be caused by either aldosterone deficiency or resistance even when the GFR is well preserved. Aldosterone resistance is a common finding in children with obstructive uropathy or reflux nephropathy and is often referred to as type 4 renal tubular acidosis. (See

         Infants – Infants have a relatively lower rate of urinary potassium excretion because of a normally decreased response to aldosterone and lower GFR. As a result, infants generally have higher baseline serum/plasma potassium levels than older children  (

         A common cause of pediatric hyperkalemia is decreased effective arterial blood volume that leads to poor tissue perfusion and metabolic acidosis (which results in transcellular potassium movement) and a reduction in urinary potassium excretion. In these patients, sodium and water reabsorption is increased in the proximal portion of the nephron, resulting in a reduction in sodium delivery to the collecting tubule. This leads to functional impairment of urinary potassium excretion as there is a limited amount of sodium available for potassium exchange in the collecting tubule. Although this phenomenon is often referred to as a functional renal tubular acidosis, or impaired aldosterone mediated urinary potassium and acid excretion, there is no abnormality in the ion channels or mineralocorticoid receptors of the distal nephron. Such patients are at risk for developing hyperkalemia with potassium administration in IV fluids or medications. (See

         Infants and young children are at risk of developing clinically significant dehydration and hemodynamic instability with acute illness as they have a higher surface area-to-volume ratio with proportionally greater insensible losses than older patients. In addition, they have an increased resistance to aldosterone. As a result, it is not uncommon to see hyperkalemia as an associated finding of impaired effective circulation in critically ill infants and young children [

         In some children with chronic marginal hydration and a diet low in sodium content, high potassium levels may be seen as a result of reduced distal delivery of sodium. This is most often seen in infants who have ongoing feeding problems and a dietary intake of breast milk or infant formula, both of which have low sodium content.

         Pseudohypoaldosteronism, which is even rarer than disorders of primary adrenal insufficiency, is caused by abnormal mineralocorticoid receptor activity resulting in salt wasting, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and high levels of serum aldosterone. In its autosomal dominant form, only the renal tubular function is affected and its clinical impact may wane as the child grows with further maturation of tubular sodium transport. In its autosomal recessive form (pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1), severe mutations in the epithelial sodium channel in the distal tubule have been described and affected patients generally present early in life, have salt wasting from aldosterone targeted organs (kidney, colon, and sweat glands), and require aggressive sodium supplementation to maintain electrolyte balance [

         In pseudohyperkalemia, the elevated potassium level measured in the laboratory sample is not representative of the child's true potassium. In children, it is most commonly caused by hemolyzed blood samples due to difficulties in obtaining or handling blood samples [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. This is especially true in young children, in whom a hemolyzed specimen is more likely to occur because a small needle (20 to 24 gauge) and syringe are often needed to obtain blood samples as vacuum devices are difficult to use in these patients with small vessels. In some settings, an indwelling small-gauged IV catheter and syringe are used for blood sampling, which also requires significant suction to obtain sufficient sample volumes. Hemolysis is six times more likely to occur when a syringe is used compared with a vacuum device [

        <p>
         Children are also much more likely to resist phlebotomy attempts and to cry and struggle throughout the procedure. In a child whose arm is being restrained, repetitive limb movement and contraction can lead to release of muscle cell potassium that may significantly raise the potassium content of the blood sample.

        <p>
         In children with marked leukocytosis (white cell count &gt;50,000/microL) or thrombocytosis (platelet counts &gt;500,000/microL), there may also be potassium loss from these cells after clotting of the blood sample. However, this is unlikely to cause significant hyperkalemia, with the possible exception of patients with leukemia or myeloproliferative disorders. In these patients, a plasma potassium assay decreases the chances of a falsely elevated result.

         Most children are asymptomatic as they have mild (&lt;6 mEq/L [6 mmol/L]) or moderate elevations of potassium (between 6 to 7 mEq/L [6 to 7 mmol/L]). In these patients, hyperkalemia is typically detected when plasma or serum electrolytes are obtained for monitoring or because electrolyte abnormalities are suspected. This usually occurs in children with signs or symptoms of kidney disease (eg, hypertension, urinary abnormalities [hematuria and proteinuria], edema, and oliguria/anuria), significantly decreased effective arterial blood flow (eg, shock, severe gastroenteritis, or heart failure), and considerable cellular injury (eg, trauma or tumor lysis syndrome).

         Hyperkalemia is associated with significant and potentially life-threatening disturbances in cardiac conduction. ECG changes reflect the impact of increasing levels of serum and plasma potassium on the electrical activity of the heart, including aberrant atrial (P wave) and ventricular (QRS complex) depolarization and abnormal repolarization (T wave). These findings are based not only on the level of extracellular potassium but also on how quickly the change in potassium level has occurred over time. ECG changes that generally occur at a concentration &gt;7 mEq/L (7 mmol/L) in children with chronic hyperkalemia may be seen at lower levels in children with an acute rapid rise in potassium, resulting in a swift decrease in the transmembrane potassium gradient. This may be seen in patients with tumor lysis or significant crush injury. In infants, ECG changes are usually seen at greater levels of potassium as the normal range is higher in this group of patients  (

          —
         </span>
         The diagnosis of hyperkalemia is made by the detection of an elevated plasma or serum potassium level. In infants, the normal range of potassium is greater than in older children and adults because of their reduced urinary potassium excretion  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86501" href="/z/d/graphic/86501.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important to note that potassium levels may vary by measurement technique. Normal values are typically based on measurements from the central hospital automated blood biochemistry autoanalyzers. In intensive care unit and emergency department settings, there is increasing utilization of point-of-care-testing blood chemistry analyzers that allow rapid and accurate assessment of potassium levels from whole blood samples, with results that are similar to those found with blood gas analyzers. However, one study in children reported that potassium levels were lower by a mean difference of 0.4 mEq/L when measured by blood gas analyzers compared with values obtained from the central laboratory [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. As a result, clinicians should be aware of any differences in potassium measurements in their own institutions between the central laboratory and point-of-care analyzers while interpreting potassium levels.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because a common cause of high serum potassium values is due to hemolyzed specimens, which are due to difficulties in obtaining blood samples in children (ie, pseudohyperkalemia), an elevated potassium level should be confirmed in any child in whom the clinical setting makes hyperkalemia unlikely [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Repeat testing should be done with a nonhemolyzed specimen (free-flowing venous blood sample). If it is not possible to obtain a free-flowing venous blood sample, an arterial blood sample should be acquired prior to instituting any diagnostic evaluation or potassium lowering therapies in an asymptomatic child with a low clinical suspicion of true hyperkalemia.

In children with palpitations and syncope, rapid assessment is imperative as these symptoms may be associated with a life-threatening condition such as cardiac conduction abnormalities. Initial evaluation is focused on determining whether the patient appears ill or not, if there is an underlying life-threatening cause, and if there is a risk of imminent shock  (

         Because hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening condition, initial management of elevated potassium takes precedence over any diagnostic evaluation. The urgency and type of intervention are based on the degree of potassium elevation, presence or absence of symptoms, and electrocardiographic (ECG) findings. These measures include stabilizing the cardiac membrane, decreasing extracellular potassium level, and reducing bodily potassium stores [

         Urine potassium levels – In most children, hyperkalemia should result in a random urinary potassium level that exceeds 20 mEq/L and often exceeds 40 mEq/L.

         Urine sodium levels – Low random urinary sodium values (&lt;20 mEq/L) demonstrate that there is avid renal sodium absorption, which may limit the amount of sodium available for potassium exchange at the distal renal tubule. Optimizing the effective volume and providing more sodium to the child will increase distal tubular sodium delivery thereby improving potassium excretion.

         Large increase in potassium intake is an uncommon cause of sustained hyperkalemia in healthy children. This may occur infrequently due to a large infusion of potassium through intravenous (IV) solutions (including parenteral nutrition), potassium-containing medications, or massive transfusion. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Increased potassium intake'

         Transcellular movement of intracellular potassium into the extracellular space can cause pediatric hyperkalemia due to either cellular injury (eg, rhabdomyolysis, tumor lysis syndrome, or severe hemolysis) or significant shift of potassium seen in patients with metabolic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, or hyperkalemic periodic paralysis.

         Decreased renal excretion of potassium is the most common cause of persistent hyperkalemia. Etiologies include kidney disease, decreased effective arterial circulation, or decreased activity or sensitivity to the renin-aldosterone system. (See

         Pseudohyperkalemia is common in children because hemolyzed specimens are often observed due to difficulties in obtaining blood samples, especially in infants and small children. As a result, an elevated potassium level should be confirmed in any child in whom the clinical setting makes hyperkalemia unlikely. (See

         Most children with hyperkalemia are asymptomatic as they have mild (serum or plasma potassium &lt;6 mEq/L [6 mmol/L]) or moderate elevations of serum or plasma potassium (potassium between 6 to 7 mEq/L [6 to 7 mmol/L]). In these patients, hyperkalemia is typically detected when plasma or serum electrolytes are obtained because electrolyte abnormalities are suspected (eg, kidney disease).

         Hyperkalemia is associated with significant and potentially life-threatening disturbances in cardiac conduction. Electrocardiographic changes (ECG) reflect the impact of increasing levels of serum and plasma potassium on the electrical activity of the heart including aberrant atrial (P wave) and ventricular (QRS complex) depolarization and abnormal repolarization (T wave)  (

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of hyperkalemia is made by the detection of an elevated plasma or serum potassium level. In infants, the normal range of potassium is greater than that of older children and adults because of their relatively lower urinary potassium excretion  (

         In asymptomatic patients, the primary differential diagnosis is pseudohyperkalemia, which is differentiated from true hyperkalemia by a normal repeat potassium level that should be obtained from a free-flowing venous blood sample to reduce the risk of hemolysis. (See
