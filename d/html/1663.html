         Organ transplantation is a treatment of choice for selected individuals with end-stage organ failure, transforming the outlook and quality of life of selected recipients. Organ transplantation procedures were first performed in adults in the 1950s and in children in the 1960s. Since then, advances in surgical techniques, immunosuppressive therapies, and treatments for diseases that previously limited organ recovery for transplantation have led to a marked increase in successful transplantation of organs and patient survival. Although organization of an organ donation program is well developed in advanced economies, in resource-limited countries, the unmet need is vast and thousands of children die due to the unavailability of either medical treatment or transplantation program [

         The assessment of the pediatric patient for potential organ donation is discussed in this topic review. The determination of death by neurologic criteria and management of the potential organ donor are discussed separately. (See

         Persistent vegetative state was first described in 1972 and refers to a condition where the brainstem remains intact and functions to maintain autonomic activity. The patient's cortical function has been significantly impaired or lost. In this state, the patient may or may not be aware of self or environment. These patients cannot be declared legally dead, because brainstem function remains intact.

         The fundamental definition of neurologic death is similar in most countries, although the process and procedures required to establish the determination of death may vary [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Countries such as the United States and Canada require specific physical examination criteria to determine the death of the entire brain, including the brainstem. This practice differs in the United Kingdom, where only testing of brainstem reflexes is required to determine death. If examination criteria cannot be met, ancillary studies are required to determine death by neurologic criteria. Additionally, in the United States and many other countries, two examinations separated by an observation period are required for children. The observation period depends on the age of the child [

         Donation after neurologic determination of death (DNDD) refers to a donor who is declared dead by neurologic criteria with intact circulatory function, also known as a "brain-dead donor." In the United States, they are also known as "deceased donors" or "standard criteria donors" because this is the most common type of donor.

         Donation after circulatory death (DCD) refers to a donor that does not meet criteria for brain death and has no hope of meaningful neurologic recovery and in whom the family chooses to withdraw life-sustaining treatment. After death is determined using circulatory criteria (permanent absence of respiration, circulation, and responsiveness), organs may be recovered for transplantation. This type of donation has previously been referred to as donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD), non-heart-beating organ donation, or donation after cardiac death.

         Education about organ donation and transplantation is essential to enhance knowledge and awareness for the health care provider, families, and children. Unlike with adults, decisions regarding medical procedures and treatment, including organ donation, requires parental consent or authorization. Most families never think about organ donation or the need for organ transplantation for their child. Unfortunately, critical illness and injury can result in the need for an organ transplant or the death of a child that could result in the opportunity to recover their organs for transplantation.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the United States, the updated American Academy of Pediatrics Policy Statement on Organ Donation and Transplantation continues to emphasize the importance of collaboration with the organ procurement organization (OPO) and the medical team, while focusing on providing information to all health care providers about organ donation and transplantation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Members of the child's health care team should have a general understanding of organ donation and transplantation including the indications, process, follow-up care, and ethical issues and recognize that organ donation is more than just a procedure to transplant an organ. Understanding the complexities of organ donors and transplant recipients and the medical, social, legal, and ethical aspects can help guide families facing end-of-life decisions or assisting a child needing a life-saving organ transplant. The key points are discussed in this topic review and in a policy statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics [

         A significant number of critically ill pediatric patients have chronic or life-limiting conditions. The mortality rate for children in most pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) is low (approximately 3 to 5 percent), and parental expectations of survival are high. Therefore, intensivists should actively identify patients at high risk of death and embark on timely conversations with parents to prepare them for this event. The timing and content of the discussion with the parents depends on the patient's clinical status. In critically unstable PICU patients, it might become necessary to have the initial discussion at the bedside, with ongoing brief updates as the patient's condition evolves. Communicating the risk of death allows the family and the medical team a sound basis for future discussions related to end-of-life care.
        </p>
        <p>
         At this point, referral to an OPO is a crucial part of the donation process. Early referral to the OPO is considered a best practice to maximize chances of receiving authorization and organ recovery for successful donation and is supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. This referral should generally occur before neurologic or circulatory death has formally been declared. No assumptions about donor suitability should be made until discussions with the OPO have occurred [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. The OPO and its medical director make decisions regarding donor suitability and organ recovery, not the medical team managing the potential donor. Consultation with the OPO should be considered for a critically ill child as soon as specific clinical triggers are met [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>

        <p>
         Donation should be viewed as a process. The discussion between the clinician and the OPO can help determine whether the patient may be a suitable donor. Palliative care clinicians are another valuable resource to assist medical teams with discussions about donation while providing additional family support [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Early involvement of the OPO can optimize the chance of organ recovery and spare the family the discouraging news that their child cannot be a donor because of an underlying disease process, unsuitable organs, or lack of recipients to receive a transplanted organ. Most OPOs have personnel that can facilitate communication with the family in collaboration with the critical care team. Authorization rates are higher when an organ procurement coordinator is involved in the donation discussion [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. The OPO also provides experience and support and yet remains independent of the decision to donate during the time period of donation and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments. Even if solid organs are not suitable for recovery, tissue donation, including eyes, skin, bone, and heart valves, may be considered [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In an audit of a regional PICU in the United Kingdom, referral to an OPO was low despite introduction of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. Possible ways to improve organ donation rates include better education about the process for doctors and nurses, especially during their induction. There is a need for active discussions about the possibility of organ donation during handover for any patient who may be facing end-of-life issues. Organ donation simulation courses are available for medical and nursing staff and may enhance their comfort with end-of-life care and donation.

         It is imperative to discuss each potential donor with the OPO. Historical experience with donor suitability is insufficient because there has been a progressive expansion in the types of donors and organs recovered for transplantation over the last two decades [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. The decision regarding donor suitability and organ donation is made by the OPO and its medical director, not by the medical team managing the potential donor. Preconceptions about donor eligibility by the health care team and a protective stance with parents or guardians of children because of fear that the family may have endured "too much" with the child's injury and death may have the unintended consequence of denying families the opportunity to help or save the life of another person [

          Donor characteristics
         </strong>
         – Donation after neurologic determination of death (DNDD) remains the most common source of organs for transplantation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75152" href="/z/d/graphic/75152.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), while donation after circulatory death (DCD) has increased, contributing more organs for transplantation [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Patients who are candidates for DNDD are cared for in an intensive care unit, where vital functions are artificially maintained following irreversible brain damage, using assisted ventilation and, in some cases, inotropic support and hormonal replacement therapy. Following determination of neurologic death and identifying the decedent as a potential donor, aggressive intensive medical care must be continued to ensure that donor organs remain viable for transplantation. Good donor management provides a better graft to the transplant recipient, can markedly enhance long-term organ survival in the recipient, and can increase the chance of recovering suitable organs from potential donors. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1664.html" rel="external">
          "Management of the potential pediatric organ donor following neurologic death"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The ideal donor for DNDD has an isolated head injury, with limited or no other organ system dysfunction or preexisting comorbid diseases such as diabetes or hypertension. These donors are common in pediatrics, where many children who are declared dead by neurologic criteria have no preexisting neurologic dysfunction [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Patients with multisystem organ failure due to trauma, toxic drug ingestion [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ], meningitis [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ], sepsis, and even some primary brain tumors without metastasis [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19
         </a>
         ], who may not be ideal candidates for donation initially, can be aggressively managed following declaration of neurologic death and potentially provide additional organs for transplantation. Early notification to the OPO should be encouraged.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The organ donor should ideally meet all of the following general criteria. Not all of these criteria are absolute, and input from the OPO is essential:

          Contraindications
         </strong>
         – Contraindications to organ donation include active cytomegalovirus infections and active or uncontrolled malignancies. Other disease processes, such as infectious illnesses or risk factors for these diseases, may also be strong contraindications (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/114280.html" rel="external">
          "Evaluation of the potential deceased organ donor (adult)", section on 'Immediate contraindications to donation'
         </a>
         ). Risk factors for HIV infection, such as intravenous drug use, make the donor a high-risk candidate and may exclude a patient from becoming a donor; however, this is not commonly encountered in children.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Collaboration with the OPO is essential to ensure that opportunities for potential organ donation are not missed. Assessing organ eligibility is best determined by the OPO and may change depending on the time of evaluation and comfort level of the transplant team [

         Organ donation from a person with an active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can be challenging. Recommendations are that every potential organ donor be tested for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although there is no known transmission of COVID-19 through organ donation, transplant patients are immunosuppressed, with a higher risk for infection that must be considered and minimized. Organs from patients with the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been successfully transplanted, although reports in children are limited [

         Isolated liver disease or end-stage heart disease in the donor precludes transplantation of these damaged organs. However, a disease affecting one organ should not prevent recovery of other organs, unless the disease process causes or would predispose to widespread organ failure. Organs that might have reduced function such as heart and lungs are being recovered and supported with ex situ (ex vivo) machine perfusion to condition organs for potential transplantation. Machine perfusion for heart, lung, and liver can improve organ performance for previously marginal organs that could not be transplanted. In 2021, a DCD heart maintained on machine perfusion was transplanted into the first pediatric recipient [

         Normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) is a postmortem technique to improve organ viability from a DCD donor using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). NRP provides in situ support for organs and requires arterial and venous cannulation before or immediately following death. Abdominal NRP restores organ perfusion only to abdominal organs, and thoracoabdominal NRP restores organ perfusion to abdominal and thoracic organs. NRP is being used to successfully recover and transplant organs using this technology [

          30,31

Specific ethical concerns of restoring cardiac perfusion and negating death in the DCD donor using thoracoabdominal NRP have resulted in variable use of NRP in some countries.

         When a child is dying or has died, the health care team should explain this clearly to the family in a caring, compassionate, and sympathetic manner. Palliative care clinicians can be a valuable resource [
         <a href="#rid8">

        </p>
        <p>
         Early and continued involvement of the organ procurement organization (OPO) is essential in organ donation discussions with families [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,33
         </a>
         ]. In the United States, hospitals participating in government-funded programs are mandated to refer all potential organ donors to their local OPO and to inform families of their option to donate [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,34
         </a>
         ]. Each hospital should have a policy that outlines a strategy for communication and support with families of potential donors. Such policies are ideally developed by a multidisciplinary team consisting of medical staff, nursing personnel, psychologists, child life specialists, chaplain services, OPO personnel, and family service coordinators [
         <a href="#rid10">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Parents and family members should be allowed adequate time to grieve and accept the reality of the child's death or impending death. Ideally, the discussion of organ donation should not be raised during the same discussions about death, unless the family raises the issue. The separation of the two discussions, described as "decoupling," has been shown to increase the chance of a positive decision by the family regarding donation for adult patients [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,35
         </a>
         ]; however, this may not always be the case with children [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. Importantly, families respond positively if they are exposed to organ donation information prior to the child's death and have time to discuss donation among themselves before death occurs [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         When entering the discussion of organ donation, the clinician's main role is to communicate that the child has died and to ensure that the family understands the finality of neurologic death [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35,37,38
         </a>
         ]. A common reason for parents or legal guardians to deny authorization for donation is lack of acceptance of the child's death. Ensuring that the parents understand that their child is dying or has died is an imperative message that the health care team must consistently convey. Team members must use consistent, uncomplicated terminology. The medical and legal definition of neurologic death is complex and can be confusing even for clinicians [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39-41

         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, it is recommended to use general terms such as "death," rather than the terms "brain death" or "neurologic death," which refer to the death of an organ instead of the person. Education of health care providers can assist with accurate transfer of information to families and is encouraged by medical organizations [

         Once the family has authorized donation (either donation after neurologic determination of death [DNDD] or donation after circulatory death [DCD]), laboratory evaluation of the potential donor continues with both general and organ-specific testing. These screening tests differ from center to center. The goals are to determine tissue type and basic donor immunology, assess organ function, and identify any underlying infection or contraindication to donation  (

          table 2
         </a>
         ). Laboratory testing generally includes ABO blood type, complete blood count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis C antibody, HIV antibody, serologic tests for syphilis (venereal disease research laboratory test or rapid plasma reagin), and cytomegalovirus antibody and testing for SARS-CoV-2. The organ procurement organization (OPO) coordinator thoroughly reviews the patient's medical record and completes an extensive donor checklist that includes medical history and laboratory and other studies required to determine donor suitability to proceed with the donation process.

         The evaluation and decision about whether to recover an organ from a potential donor will be directed by an organ procurement organization (OPO) and transplant surgeons, based upon organ function, disease process, and underlying circumstances that resulted in the donor's death.

         Assessment of the potential donor for liver recovery frequently includes the following studies: Serum albumin, PT, and PTT provide an index of liver synthetic function but may be affected by administration of blood products or disseminated intravascular coagulation. Additionally, anoxia or the cause of donor death may compromise liver function. If the AST, ALT, and GGT normalize after resuscitation, the liver may be suitable for transplantation.

         Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine – Ideal donors generally have relatively normal serum creatinine levels and reasonable urine output. Elevated creatinine levels may be a predictor of poor graft function and require further evaluation to determine renal function. However, kidneys with impaired renal function from acute tubular necrosis have been transplanted successfully, with recovery of renal function following transplantation. The recipient may require temporary support with dialysis following transplantation until renal function recovers.

         Urinalysis and urine culture – A urinalysis is also important to assess for casts and protein excretion and presence of infection. A urine culture is also sent prior to organ recovery.

          43

         The echocardiogram should be performed after stabilization of the donor. Echocardiograms performed immediately following neurologic death will likely have evidence of dysfunction and ischemic changes related to the catecholamine storm and hypertension that ensues prior to brainstem herniation. Cardiac performance evaluated by serial echocardiograms often improves over time and with optimal donor management following neurologic determination of death. In some cases, a pulmonary artery catheter may be requested in the older child to further define cardiac function.

        <p>
         Cardiac size may limit transplantation for the potential recipient to accept the donated organ. It might be reasonable to transplant a smaller heart into a bigger person in some cases. Occasionally, the converse (transplanting a bigger heart into a smaller person) is also possible, when the recipient has a longstanding cardiomyopathy with a relatively large heart size. Specific measurements will be conducted to determine if the heart is the appropriate size for the recipient. The ultimate decision to recover and transplant a heart will be made by the surgeon's assessment during the organ recovery procedure.

         Donor lungs are the organ most likely to be compromised for transplantation. Donor lung injury occurs after brainstem death due to hemodynamic instability, neurogenic edema, and hormonal changes that can impair graft function in the recipient.

Criteria defining the ideal characteristics of a lung donor include age less than 60 years; a normal chest radiograph; good gas exchange; and no history of either primary pulmonary disease, aspiration, or cardiopulmonary surgery. Ex situ machine perfusion and NRP of lungs has potential to significantly increase lung recovery for transplantation following DNDD and DCD (see

         A cuffed endotracheal tube (ETT) should be used for all pediatric donors regardless of age. Because the pharynx and larynx are largely functionless in deceased donors, uncuffed ETTs can result in silent aspiration. A cuffed ETT with cuff pressure inflated to above 20 cm H

         Oxygen challenge test and serial arterial blood gas analysis – An oxygen challenge is performed to determine whether the patient's lungs may be suitable for transplantation. The potential donor is preoxygenated with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         ) of 1.0, and arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         ) is measured. If the PaO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         is &gt;300 mmHg, the lungs are considered suitable for donation in many centers. Values lower than this threshold suggest lung injury, infection, and/or atelectasis. Because low values may be caused by atelectasis, alveolar recruitment may be achieved by strategies to improve oxygenation. Serial analysis of arterial blood gas between oxygen challenge tests provides further information about respiratory function and response to interventions. (See

         Lung transplantation typically requires size matching of the donor and recipient. This is commonly based on donor and recipient height, although some centers also use estimates of lung volume made from chest radiographs. Lobar transplantation or reduction of the lung size by surgical stapling has been reported for pediatric recipients when donor lung size is excessive [

         ]. This is particularly true for children, and especially those under one year of age, who have the highest death rate waiting for a needed organ transplant.

         Challenges to recovery of organs from pediatric donors include size and weight constraints and technical challenges of transplantation in smaller children. In addition, a family's decision about organ donation can be influenced by individual factors, cultural beliefs, resistance to organ donation, and issues related to authorization or consent including inappropriate timing of donation conversations and confusion regarding death of their child. When approached in a sensitive manner, most families report that organ donation is a "positive experience" [

         </a>

         <a href="#rid61">
          61,67
         </a>
         ]. The donor pool of DNDD has remained stable and has not grown sufficiently to supply the needed number of organs to transplant all patients on the waiting list. This supply and demand issue exists for several reasons. The absolute number of pediatric deceased organ donors has declined in some jurisdictions, reflecting reduced pediatric mortality rates [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68

Pediatric morbidity and mortality has been reduced from improved medical therapies; eradication of life-threatening diseases, including use of antibiotic therapies and more effective immunizations; and use and refinement of passenger safety-restraint systems, helmets, and other safety measures. Additionally, care provided by specialists trained in pediatric intensive care has significantly improved chances for survival of children with life-threatening disease [
         <a href="#rid69">
          69

This policy statement provides guidance for pediatricians and other pediatric health care professionals regarding donation and transplantation and emphasizes an understanding of the medical, social, legal, and ethics aspects of organ donation and transplantation.

         Additional important components to enhance education and organizational awareness about organ donation include placing hospital-based organ procurement coordinators within active donor hospitals, encouragement of early involvement of the organ procurement organization (OPO) in the donation process, and collaboration with intensive care specialists. Collaboration between the OPO and pediatric intensivists is particularly crucial for successful pediatric donation to occur [

         In the United States, donor registries have been established, which allow individuals to express their intent to donate their organs after death. Authorization for donation in children must be obtained from parents or legal guardian.

         DCD requires close collaboration with the OPO to determine donor suitability, which includes estimated time to circulatory arrest and recovery of organs (warm ischemic time). Often, withdrawal of life-sustaining medical therapies is performed in the operating room or in the perioperative area to minimize organ ischemic time. It is important to recognize that the timing of circulatory death following withdrawal of medical therapies for DCD can be very unpredictable [

          Importance of soliciting organ donation
         </strong>
         – Organ transplantation is the treatment of choice for end-stage organ failure in carefully selected individuals, but many candidates die while waiting for a needed organ because of the increasing gap between the numbers of donors and recipients. This is particularly true for children, for whom size and weight constraints place additional burdens on finding suitable organs for transplantation. (See

          Terminology and types of organ donors
         </strong>
         – Most organs used for transplantation continue to be recovered from donors after neurologic determination of death (DNDD), also known as "standard criteria donors." However, more organs are being recovered from donors who have died after meeting criteria for donation after circulatory death (DCD). Neonatal donation is another area of growth that is gradually providing more needed organs for children. (See

         <strong>
          Timing and initial outreach
         </strong>
         – Early identification and management of the potential donor increases the likelihood of successful recovery of organs for transplantation. Ideally, the process requires a specialized team led by pediatric intensivists, in close consultation with the local organ procurement organization (OPO) and transplant clinicians and surgeons. The option of organ donation should be preserved for all children facing end-of-life issues. (See

         Organ donation is an important part of end-of-life care. Families of all potential donors should be given the opportunity of organ donation. Donation is a decision made by the family, not by the medical team. The critical care team should provide support for the grieving family and communicate clear messages about the finality of neurologic death, using sensitivity and simple terms. Assistance from palliative care clinicians can provide another valuable resource during end-of-life care.

         The opportunity of organ donation should ideally be addressed in a separate discussion from withdrawal of life-sustaining medical therapies, unless the parents or family members initiate a conversation regarding donation prior to determination of death. Early involvement of the OPO and transplant coordinators can facilitate effective communication and family support. (See

          Educational initiatives
         </strong>
         – Organ donation and transplantation require a multidisciplinary team approach to care for the donor and donor family and transplant recipient and family and to help shape public policy. General pediatricians and other health care providers can promote education about organ donation and transplantation before a catastrophic event occurs. Health care providers should become familiar with ethical issues related to donation and transplantation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Role of the primary care provider'
         </a>
         above and

         <strong>
          Screening tests for donor suitability
         </strong>
         – Laboratory evaluation of the potential donor is performed to determine tissue type and basic donor serology, assess organ function, and identify any underlying infection or contraindications to donation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54890" href="/z/d/graphic/54890.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). No assumptions about donor suitability should be made until discussions with the OPO have occurred. Pediatric donors are subject to additional organ-specific size considerations. (See

          'Screening donors'
