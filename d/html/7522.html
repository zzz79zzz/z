(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7516.html" rel="external">"General principles and overview of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7491.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7490.html" rel="external">"Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults resistant to initial conventional synthetic (nonbiologic) DMARD therapy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/103866.html" rel="external">"Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults resistant to initial biologic DMARD therapy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7478.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of end-stage rheumatoid arthritis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3669121376"><span class="h1">DEFINITION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>End-stage rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an advanced stage of disease in which there is severe joint damage and destruction that is accompanied by an absence of ongoing inflammation, for example, as demonstrated by a lack of evidence of synovitis or significant joint effusions, and the presence of normal laboratory markers for inflammation, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and the C-reactive protein (CRP). Other laboratory and imaging studies may also fail to demonstrate changes suggesting active inflammatory synovitis. However, some patients with end-stage RA do exhibit residual inflammatory activity in selected joints, while other joints exhibit only end-stage changes.</p><p>Acute phase reactants, such as the ESR and CRP, are most useful as measures of disease activity when the values associated with active disease in an individual patient are known from prior assessments, as these values can vary between patients with similar degrees of clinical activity, and one or both are sometimes not elevated with active disease as measured by joint counts and global assessments [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Thus, apparently normal values of these laboratory parameters may be observed not only in the context of burnt-out RA but in patients with RA at all stages of the disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7483.html" rel="external">"Acute phase reactants", section on 'Discrepancies between acute phase reactant levels'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H95779434"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGIC FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The progression of disease which culminates in end-stage rheumatoid arthritis (RA) usually occurs over years to decades. The causes of joint destruction include any combination of the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prolonged delay in the initiation of traditional nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy or of biologic DMARDs (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7516.html" rel="external">"General principles and overview of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults", section on 'General principles'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intolerance or development of toxicity to one or more antirheumatic therapies, thereby requiring the discontinuation of agents which may have been beneficial</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Refractory disease, which has failed to respond to multiple therapies</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Poor adherence to the therapeutic regimen</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3878251541"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prevalence of end-stage disease with available therapies era is unknown but, due to effective therapy, appears to be progressively decreasing. In our experience, such patients represent only a small proportion of patients seen in clinical practice, being approximately 5 percent or less of those patients referred since the 1990s to secondary and tertiary centers who have been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Such patients have usually been suboptimally treated according to guidelines developed since that time.</p><p>A 2016 systematic review of studies of the incidence, prevalence, and severity of RA described evidence for a decrease in severity of RA over the last several decades, with lower activity, fewer extraarticular manifestations, a diminished need for surgery to treat joint destruction, and less severe radiological changes. By contrast, the excess mortality associated with RA remains substantial, despite a trend toward a decrease over time [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7505.html" rel="external">"Disease outcome and functional capacity in rheumatoid arthritis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The major characteristics of end-stage rheumatoid arthritis (RA) include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptoms of joint pain with activity and often at rest or at night (see <a class="local">'Symptoms'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Findings of destructive joint and tendon disease with fibrosis that has resulted in significant loss of joint function or the need for joint arthroplasty or fusion; poor mobility and a significant decline in functional status, resulting in disability; and periarticular muscle atrophy and weakness (see <a class="local">'Physical findings'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Usually a lack of laboratory evidence for ongoing systemic inflammation, although abnormalities may be observed in some patients (see <a class="local">'Laboratory findings'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Radiographic evidence of marked articular damage (eg, erosions and severe loss of joint space that can lead to bone-on-bone changes) (see <a class="local">'Imaging abnormalities'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3397681056"><span class="h2">Symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>End-stage joint disease is characterized by pain and loss of function. Patients typically report pain in multiple joints with physical activity, although pain can be present at rest and may be bothersome during the night.</p><p>Stiffness in the joints, including morning stiffness, is sometimes described due to the presence of contractures, joint injury, and deformities, rather than being due to synovitis. Weakness may also be reported. Patients can have difficulties with activities of daily living, including use of the upper extremities and ambulation. Fine motor activities may also be impaired due to prior hand and wrist disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2546626130"><span class="h2">Physical findings</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The joint examination demonstrates generalized loss of motion in many joints, and deformities are often present. To minimize the level of stress on a destroyed joint, most patients decrease their activities, and immobilization can reduce the degree of synovitis [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. However, over time, the lack of activity and the reduced ranges of motion in affected joints results in joint contractures, foreshortened tendons, muscle atrophy, and weakness. The following findings can be seen:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In the upper extremities, multiple findings that impair range of motion and function are typically present. The hands show ulnar drift and may show subluxation at the metacarpophalangeal joints. Boutonniere and swan neck deformities can be seen. The thumb joint may show a zigzag deformity resulting in hyperextension at the thumb interphalangeal joint and little functional capacity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The wrists may lack mobility and be partially fused. Contractures can often be observed in the joints in the upper extremities. The elbows lack full extension and elbow flexion may be significantly reduced, resulting in a very limited arc of motion. There can be reduced abduction and external rotation of the shoulders caused by chronic tearing of the rotator cuff mechanism, resulting in superior migration of the humeral head within the glenohumeral joint.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In the lower extremities, the damage can adversely impact gait and mobility. The hips show limited mobility, especially with flexion maneuvers, resulting in hip contractures. These can be confirmed by noting a positive Thomas test  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89742" href="/z/d/graphic/89742.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>), whereby hip flexion causes the contralateral hip to rise off the exam table (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13805.html" rel="external">"Musculoskeletal examination of the hip and groin", section on 'Tests of hip flexors'</a>). The knee joints may show limited range of motion with flexion and extension. There can be loss of cartilage space and bone-on-bone changes are evident on imaging studies. (See <a class="local">'Imaging abnormalities'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">In contrast to osteoarthritis in patients without RA, there is valgus angulation at the knees which may result in ineffective transfer of forces across the knees, causing further decline in ambulatory abilities. Preexisting osteoarthritic changes may coexist, especially with onset of RA in older adult patients, or occur following remission of inflammatory features.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The ankles and feet show pes planus, and valgus angulation at the ankles is often severe and may require surgical fusion. There may be cock-up toe changes in the toes. Callus formation overlying the metatarsal phalangeal joints can be extensive, and in rare cases there may be skin ulceration over these areas.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rheumatoid nodules may be present, especially over the olecranon surfaces, the Achilles tendons, and sometimes the fingers. Other findings due to extraarticular disease may include pleural or parenchymal lung disease, cardiac involvement, or the development of a neuropathy. Rarely, there may be scleral inflammation affecting the eye. Involvement of the cricoarytenoid joint can result in dysphagia or respiratory stridor [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4380.html" rel="external">"Overview of pleuropulmonary diseases associated with rheumatoid arthritis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7511.html" rel="external">"Overview of the systemic and nonarticular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis", section on 'Cardiac disease'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The neurologic exam may demonstrate hyperreflexia and impaired balance, which can occur in patients with cervical myelopathy, and changes due to peripheral neuropathy can be present. Periarticular muscle atrophy and resultant weakness are often present.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Laboratory findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The complete blood count, platelet count, and acute phase reactants should be normal in patients with end-stage RA. Patients with longstanding RA often demonstrate a normochromic normocytic anemia, but in the complete absence of disease activity this anemia of chronic disease (anemia of chronic inflammation) should be absent.</p><p>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients with end-stage disease are generally in the normal range or only marginally elevated. The serum albumin may be reduced in patients with residual disease activity but is normal in patients who have no active inflammatory process.</p><p>The rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies are often positive in patients with end-stage disease, given their prevalence in the majority of patients with RA and association with poor prognosis RA.</p><p>Joint effusions, are small if present, typically demonstrate few white blood cells with a relative lymphocytosis.</p><p>In patients who have undergone joint surgery, scant synovial tissue or advanced fibrosis is observed in those with end-stage disease, unlike the synovium in the patient with ongoing inflammation, which may show the characteristic histopathology of rheumatoid synovitis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7500.html" rel="external">"Synovial pathology in rheumatoid arthritis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H372591742"><span class="h2">Imaging abnormalities</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Imaging in patients with end-stage RA shows joint destruction without evidence of ongoing inflammation. Plain radiographs in patients with end-stage disease show marked articular damage, including cartilage loss with severe loss of joint space that can lead to bone-on-bone changes, subluxations, and erosions, including some that have healed over time. There may be periarticular osteopenia around severely affected joints. Changes consistent with osteoarthritis may develop in joints previously damaged by an inflammatory synovitis, with bony hypertrophy and osteophyte formation.</p><p>A trace synovial effusion is sometimes evident, as in osteoarthritis, but in end-stage disease neither a power Doppler signal on ultrasound indicating joint hyperemia nor bone edema suggesting synovitis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are generally observed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4049463652"><span class="h2">Neuropathology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several abnormalities have been described in a postmortem study of the spinal cord and brainstem in nine patients with end-stage RA [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Cranial nerve and brainstem pathology was rare, but in addition to craniocervical compression, there were widespread subaxial changes in the spinal cord. Pathology was localized primarily to the dorsal white matter, despite a history of ventral compression. There was no evidence of vasculitis or ischemic changes in the blood vessels.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H59297334"><span class="h1">EVALUATION OF PATIENTS WITH END-STAGE DISEASE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Recognition of patients with end-stage rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can usually be achieved without much difficulty based upon the presence of characteristic symptoms and physical findings (see <a class="local">'Definition'</a> above and <a class="local">'Symptoms'</a> above and <a class="local">'Physical findings'</a> above); however, the evaluation of patients with apparent end-stage disease also requires:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identification of patients who would potentially benefit from treatment with antiinflammatory and/or antirheumatic drug therapy for residual synovitis that may be present despite widespread end-stage changes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Detection of factors other than articular inflammation that may be contributing to the clinical state and may require interventions distinct from antirheumatic drug therapy, such as extraarticular complications, comorbid disorders, and end-stage joint destruction. The presence or absence of extraarticular disease (eg, pulmonary, cardiovascular, or neurologic involvement) may be independent of the degree of joint damage, but extraarticular disease is more often seen in patients with more aggressive forms of RA.</p><p></p><p>Attention to a number of particular features as part of the detailed evaluation of these patients facilitates the assessment. (See <a class="local">'History and physical examination'</a> below and <a class="local">'Laboratory, imaging, and other studies'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H400494699"><span class="h2">History and physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The patient should undergo a thorough history and physical examination, with a detailed musculoskeletal examination of the upper and lower extremity joints and the spine, including the observation of the patient walking, to identify characteristic features of end-stage RA, such as multiple structural deformities, and to exclude the ongoing presence of active inflammatory synovitis, such as warm joints with soft tissue swelling and evidence of joint effusions. (See <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>Other conditions that may be present in patients with advanced RA and cause joint pain and disability (eg, bursitis, tendinopathy, neuropathy) should be excluded as alternative causes of musculoskeletal pain. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7757.html" rel="external">"Overview of soft tissue musculoskeletal disorders"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7480.html" rel="external">"Neurologic manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis"</a>.)</p><p>Examples of questions that may be especially useful to identify whether the patient who is suspected of having end-stage RA lacks evidence for ongoing disease activity include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is there worsening or a change in the degree of morning stiffness that might suggest increased systemic inflammatory activity? It should be noted that while morning stiffness is a symptom suggesting active joint inflammation that its presence may also reflect the effects of severe joint contractures and ankylosis resulting from end-stage disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7502.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Has the patient's pain changed in any way? Does the degree of pain in a particular joint correlate with the physical exam findings and the imaging studies? For example, pain around the hips or above the knee may be caused by advanced arthritis damage in the hips, but it may also be due to a lumbar radiculopathy or spinal stenosis that is not related to having RA. (See <a class="local">'Laboratory, imaging, and other studies'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Another cause of pain occurs in frail patients who may be predisposed to sustaining bone fractures following incidental trauma.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is there new nighttime pain? If so, consideration should be given to an underlying bursitis such as:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Shoulder – Subacromial bursa</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Elbow – Medial or lateral epicondyle</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hip – Trochanteric bursa</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Knee – Anserine bursa</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is the pain suspicious for nerve irritation? Consider carpal tunnel syndrome, tarsal tunnel syndrome, peripheral neuropathy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Has there been a progressive decline in their functional status that cannot be readily explained by their structural joint disease? One should consider the diagnoses of cervical myelopathy or lumbar spinal stenosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is one particular joint most affected by pain? The combination of joint damage, poor functional status, and possibly the continued use of glucocorticoids may heighten the risk that patients with end-stage RA have for developing septic arthritis.</p><p></p><p>Additional issues of note in patients with suspected end-stage disease include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Changes consistent with osteoarthritis may develop in joints previously damaged by an inflammatory synovitis. Bony hypertrophy and osteophyte formation can, therefore, be observed. These features should not be mistaken for the synovial thickening observed in active RA. Plain radiography and/or ultrasonography may be required to identify and distinguish these possibilities. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/105723.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of osteoarthritis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Examination of more superficial joints, such as the elbows, wrists, knees, and metacarpophalangeal joints may provide a better assessment for the presence of synovial thickening, which is considered a hallmark feature of active, inflammatory synovitis. In patients with end-stage RA, the structural deformities and secondary bony overgrowth may contribute to a false appearance of synovitis. The development of joint contractures implies that there has been significant joint injury.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Although pain at rest is highly suggestive of end-stage joint damage, an adjacent bursitis, tendonitis, or nerve entrapment syndrome may produce similar pain.

Their continued use needs to be weighed carefully against the hazards associated with their long-term use, and the discontinuation of unneeded agents reduces the risk of drug-related harms.</p><p>This determination can be highly subjective, although most patients are able to gauge whether they feel better when taking these drugs. Patients can often report whether their disease became more symptomatic or if joint swelling occurred when they missed one or more of their medications for some period of time. If attempted, a slow withdrawal of the medication should be initiated, and careful follow-up can determine whether the drug can be tapered to a lower dose or discontinued altogether. The frequency of follow-up for clinical assessment and frequency and nature of laboratory testing are determined by the expected duration of the clinical effect of the agent being withdrawn.</p><p>Only one drug should be withdrawn at a time.
