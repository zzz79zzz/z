         Lipids, such as cholesterol and triglyceride, are insoluble in plasma. They are made soluble by attachment to circulating lipoproteins that transport lipids to various tissues for energy utilization, lipid deposition, steroid hormone production, and bile acid formation. The lipoprotein consists of esterified and unesterified cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids, and protein.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are five major lipoproteins in blood: chylomicrons, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Each of these classes of lipoproteins carries cholesterol and triglyceride to a varying degree, with LDL carrying the majority of cholesterol and VLDL carrying the majority of triglyceride.
        </p>
        <p>
         In general, patient care issues related to screening, diagnosis, and treatment are based on the results of the measurement of serum lipids, which is generally accomplished by obtaining a lipid profile. On occasion, measurement of serum lipoproteins is necessary for one or more of these purposes. This topic will discuss the issues relevant to the measurement of serum lipids and lipoproteins. Other issues related to lipids and lipoproteins, such as their role in atherosclerosis, are discussed separately. (See

         For patients who have had documentation (first test) of a full lipid profile and the triglyceride level was not elevated, subsequent measurement of a total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol is sufficient. These measurements can be used to calculate non-HDL cholesterol (total cholesterol – HDL cholesterol). (See

          "HDL cholesterol: Clinical aspects of abnormal values"

        </p>
        <p>
         However, it is important to recognize that LDL cholesterol remains the primary lipid measure for cardiovascular disease risk assessment and guide to therapy. (See

         Measuring LDL cholesterol periodically can be helpful in determining whether a patient has met an LDL cholesterol target or whether patients are adherent to treatment. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         There are no reliable data on the optimal method of monitoring the effects of lipid-lowering therapy. We suggest that the LDL cholesterol be monitored every six weeks after the initiation of treatment until the LDL cholesterol target is achieved [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Thereafter, measurement every 6 to 12 months is reasonable in patients adherent to lifestyle modifications.

         Non-HDL cholesterol is defined as the difference between the total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. Non-HDL cholesterol includes all cholesterol present in lipoprotein particles that is considered atherogenic, including LDL, lipoprotein(a), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). It has been suggested that the non-HDL cholesterol fraction may be a better tool for risk assessment than LDL cholesterol [

         The ratios of total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol concentration have been evaluated in many epidemiological studies to categorize populations into high- and low-risk subgroups.

          FASTING VERSUS NON-FASTING TESTS

         </span>
         With the exceptions of the first time a lipid profile is obtained or when the test is obtained for the purpose of following known hypertriglyceridemia, the lipid profile (or its components) do not usually require fasting [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-6
         </a>
         ]. However, many experts routinely ask their patients to fast for a follow-up lipid profile so that there is no need to repeat the test due to a concern for an inaccurate low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol due to high triglycerides.
        </p>
        <p>
         The decision whether to have the patient fast for a subsequent lipid profile is in part dependent on patient convenience and the likelihood that the calculated LDL cholesterol value might be inaccurate due to elevated triglycerides. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Measurement'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients at increased risk for triglycerides high enough to make the calculated LDL cholesterol significantly different from a measured (direct) LDL cholesterol include those with type 2 diabetes, very obese individuals, those taking medications known to increase triglycerides, and patients with significant alcohol intake. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4570.html" rel="external">
          "Hypertriglyceridemia in adults: Management"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         If the non-fasting plasma triglyceride component of the lipid profile returns at &gt;400 mg/dL (&gt;4.516 mmol/L), we obtain a fasting lipid profile.
        </p>
        <p>
         We ask the patient to fast (8 to 12 hours without food) when we are attempting to diagnose or follow a patient with a triglyceride disorder. From a practical point of view, this means that the test will need to be obtained early in the morning (before breakfast). While mean population levels of triglycerides and calculated LDL cholesterol do not appear to vary substantially with different lengths of time since eating [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ], clinically important variability in triglyceride levels in
         <strong>
          individual
         </strong>
         patients after consumption of fatty foods and drinks is likely and consistent with clinical experience. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4570.html" rel="external">
          "Hypertriglyceridemia in adults: Management"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The following serves to give a more detailed explanation of the potential impact of the results of a non-fasting test. If a patient has a lipid profile soon after eating a very fatty meal, chylomicrons are made to absorb the fat. The ratio of triglyceride to cholesterol in a chylomicron is about 20:1. In the fasting state, if there are no chylomicrons, then most of the triglyceride in the blood is being carried by very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and the triglyceride to cholesterol ratio in those particles is 5 to 1. That ratio is what most clinical laboratories use to calculate the cholesterol contribution of VLDL particles. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Indirect measurement'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         If a patient has a fasting triglyceride of 100 mg/dL and their postprandial, fatty meal triglyceride was 300 mg/dL, then the VLDL cholesterol calculation would be performed and the VLDL cholesterol would be estimated at 300/5 or 60 mg/dL. But if all the increased triglyceride (ie, the increase from 100 to 300 mg/dL) is due to chylomicrons, the actual VLDL plus chylomicron cholesterol is the 100/5 (from the VLDL that are present) plus 200/20 which is the cholesterol in the chylomicrons. This amounts to a total of 30 mg/dL, not 60 mg/dL. The difference between the 60 mg/dL the laboratory would calculate and the 30 mg/dL which is the correct number to be using is 30 mg/dL, and that higher value would be wrongly subtracted to give an LDL cholesterol that is 30 mg/dL lower than it actually is. If a patient comes in and their fasting triglyceride is 100 mg/dL and their non-fasting triglyceride is 120 mg/dL, then the error in using the calculated LDL cholesterol is so small as not to matter. So, the key thing is that if there is a good record of fasting triglycerides in a patient and then a non-fasting one return with a much higher value, a very significant error could be introduced into the LDL cholesterol calculation if they use that non-fasting value.
        </p>
        <p>
         Total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol are minimally affected by fasting [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. LDL cholesterol is typically calculated from total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides using the Friedewald equation (LDL cholesterol  =  total cholesterol  -  HDL cholesterol  -  triglycerides  x  0.2) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. This equation is modified for those with particularly elevated levels of triglycerides (&gt;400 mg/dL), but even with modification it is only accurate for patients who are fasting. In patients who have consumed fats prior to testing, various lipid components (eg, chylomicrons) will be elevated, which will result in a calculated LDL cholesterol that is falsely low compared with what would have been calculated in the fasting state.
        </p>
        <p>
         The largest observational study comparing fasting and non-fasting lipid values evaluated results in over 90,000 individuals [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5

         The maximal mean changes at one to six hours after habitual meals were thought to be clinically insignificant at +0.3 mmol/L (26 mg/dL) for triglycerides, -0.2 mmol/L (8 mg/dL) for total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, and -0.2 mmol/L for calculated non-HDL cholesterol.

         Nonfasting lipid profiles may be used to calculate "remnant" cholesterol. Remnant cholesterol is either measured directly or calculated as: non-HDL cholesterol  -  directly measured LDL cholesterol.

         A standard serum lipid profile measures the concentration of total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol as well as the triglycerides. With these values, the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration can be estimated. (See

         Serum total and HDL cholesterol are measured directly and can be obtained in fasting or nonfasting individuals; there are only small, clinically insignificant differences in these values between measurements in the fasting or non-fasting state [

        </p>
        <p>
         The total cholesterol can vary by 4 to 11 percent within an individual due to multiple factors including stress, minor illness, and posture [

         Measurement of LDL cholesterol does not require fasting in most cases. However, in patients who have had prior significant elevation(s) of nonfasting triglyceride, a fasting LDL cholesterol (calculated from the lipid profile) should be obtained. (See

         This will help to avoid miscalculation of the LDL cholesterol. An alternative approach is to obtain a direct measurement of LDL cholesterol. (See

In clinical practice, the value is usually estimated using the Friedewald equation.

         ]. Stated another way, and understanding that this is an approximation, the total cholesterol in plasma or serum is the sum of cholesterol found in each of the VLDL, HDL, and LDL lipoprotein particle types. The Friedewald formula is applied to lipid values measured in the fasted state. In a non-fasting patient, the contribution of post-prandial chylomicrons to the total lipoprotein pool makes the formula much less accurate.

In such patients, this information may provide guidance as to treatment decisions, such as an increased dose of statins or combination lipid-altering therapy with statin plus either

         – Lipoprotein particle sizes can be measured by special laboratories that use three different analytical techniques. These laboratory methods include nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, gradient gel electrophoresis, analytical ultracentrifugation, and ion mobility (IM). Lipoprotein particle size is most often reported as an average size that takes into account the contribution of the small, intermediate, and large particles. Unlike the other methods, NMR spectroscopy reports the total concentration or blood levels of the individual LDL subclasses and then derives the average LDL particle size [

          Rationale for measurement
         </strong>
         – Strong associations between total LDL particle concentration and cardiovascular disease provide a rationale for advanced lipoprotein testing for total LDL particle numbers in cardiovascular risk assessment and treatment [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. In high cardiometabolic risk patients, such as those with diabetes, where the disconnect between LDL cholesterol and LDL particle size is greatest, the measurement of LDL particle size may be of benefit for improving risk stratification and as a guide to titration/adjustment of lipoprotein-modifying therapy [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         As an example, among patients with insulin resistance disorders (metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes), there is discordance between LDL cholesterol and LDL particle concentration/apolipoprotein B [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. This discordance results from LDL remodeling in insulin resistance, which leads to a smaller, cholesterol-depleted LDL particle. Thus, although LDL cholesterol levels do not change with insulin resistance or with the number of metabolic risk factors, whereas the concentration of small LDL particles and total LDL particles increases progressively as the severity of insulin resistance increases and the number of metabolic risk factors increases. On statin therapy, nearly two-thirds of type 2 diabetes patients with LDL cholesterol levels less than 100 mg/dL have excess LDL particles. In patients with type 2 diabetes and LDL cholesterol levels less than 70 mg/dL on statin therapy, 41 percent have excess numbers of LDL particles.
        </p>
        <p>
         A 2009 systematic review (of 24 studies) evaluated the association between cardiovascular outcomes and LDL subfractions or distribution (particle size; density) as well as total LDL particle number [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. Higher LDL particle number was consistently associated with increased cardiovascular risk, independent of lipid markers. LDL subfractions/size did not add incremental risk prediction beyond that achieved with traditional risk factors.

         Based upon the changes in lipid profile, it has been thought to be most accurate in patients with an ACS when obtained within hours of hospitalization or in the outpatient setting after at least one month has elapsed  (

         However, the 2008 LUNAR trial that included patients with unstable angina and NSTEMI had twice as many patients as all of the earlier studies combined and found that serum lipids remain relatively stable for the first 96 hours after an ACS (unstable angina, NSTEMI) [

The direct LDL cholesterol levels fell slightly in the 24 hours after admission from 136.2 to 133.5 mg/dL (3.52 to 3.45 mmol/L) and then rose somewhat to 141.8 mg/dL (3.67 mmol/L) over the next two days. Similar changes were noted for total cholesterol, while HDL cholesterol changes were smaller and triglyceride levels remained unchanged.

          Background
         </strong>
         – The serum lipid profile measures total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol as well as the triglyceride level. With these values, the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration can be estimated. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Measurement'

         <strong>
          Measurements requiring fasting
         </strong>
         – Serum total and HDL cholesterol are measured directly, and there are only small, clinically insignificant differences in these values when measured in the fasting or non-fasting state. Triglyceride levels may vary after a recent meal. Thus, we generally advise that the lipid profile be measured in the fasting state. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          LDL cholesterol measurement
         </strong>
         – The LDL cholesterol reported in the lipid profile is generally calculated from values for triglycerides, total cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         A directly measured LDL cholesterol concentration should be considered in patients with a total triglyceride concentration &gt;400 mg/dL (4.516 mmol/L). (See

          Lipid measurements we do not routinely advise

         – We do not advise the routine measurement of LDL particle size or concentration (number), lipoprotein levels, or the use of “ratios.” (See

          Causes of inaccurate results
         </strong>
         – These include the presence of a circulating monoclonal protein (falsely low HDL cholesterol and/or LDL cholesterol) and triglyceride levels above 400 mg/dL (calculated LDL cholesterol). LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol levels are thought to be relatively accurate when measured in the first 24 to 48 hours after hospitalization for an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and up to 96 hours after a non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS). Non-fasting values are acceptable. (See
