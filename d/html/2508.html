Age is a major risk factor for colorectal cancer  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76495" href="/z/d/graphic/76495.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The median age at diagnosis is 67 [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Approximately 57 percent of cases develop over the age of 65; 32 percent are 75 years or older. The United States Census Bureau projects that by the year 2035, there will be 78 million Americans aged 65 or older, and older people are expected to outnumber children for the first time in United States history [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. As a result, the number of patients over the age of 70 presenting for colorectal cancer care is expected to rise.</p><p>Surgical resection is the only curative treatment for locoregional colon cancer, and outcome is most closely related to the extent of disease at presentation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438" href="/z/d/graphic/111438.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81414" href="/z/d/graphic/81414.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. For patients who have undergone potentially curative resection, disease recurrence is thought to arise from clinically occult micrometastases that are present at the time of surgery. Postoperative (adjuvant) systemic chemotherapy is recommended for high-risk patients to eradicate these micrometastases, thereby increasing the cure rate.</p><p>This topic review will cover the benefits, risks, and choice of adjuvant chemotherapy for older adult patients with resected colon cancer. A general discussion of the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy for resected colon and rectal cancer, surgical management and prognosis of colon cancer, benefits of adjunctive therapy with diet, exercise, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), vitamin D, and coffee consumption in patients with early stage colorectal cancer, chemotherapy considerations in older individuals with advanced colorectal cancer, a compilation of chemotherapy protocols for colorectal cancer, and recommendations for post-treatment follow-up are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2471.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant therapy for resected stage III (node-positive) colon cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2529.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma in patients not receiving neoadjuvant therapy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2507.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of primary colon cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116457.html" rel="external">"Adjunctive therapy for patients with resected early stage colorectal cancer: Diet, exercise, NSAIDs, and vitamin D"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2512.html" rel="external">"Therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer in older adult patients and those with a poor performance status"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/85679.html" rel="external">"Treatment protocols for small and large bowel cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2493.html" rel="external">"Post-treatment surveillance after colorectal cancer treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CHALLENGES SPECIFIC TO OLDER ADULTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The essential principles of treating colon cancer in older adults are the same as in younger patients. However, for older patients, who may have age-related organ function decline and comorbid conditions that may limit life expectancy, special attention must be paid to the risks of chemotherapy, including both treatment-related toxicity and quality of life issues.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Age-related organ function decline</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Aging is commonly accompanied by a decline in the function of critical organ system [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2823.html" rel="external">"Systemic chemotherapy for cancer in older adults", section on 'Challenges specific to older-adult patients'</a>.)</p><p>This has several implications for older adult patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57349" href="/z/d/graphic/57349.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Liver/renal function</strong> – Declining liver and kidney function with age can alter cancer drug metabolism and elimination. Of the drugs commonly used in the adjuvant setting to treat colon cancer, only <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8839" href="/z/d/drug information/8839.html" rel="external">capecitabine</a> is predominately cleared by the kidney. A 25 percent dose reduction is recommended for patients who have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30 to 50 mL/min, and the drug should be avoided if the estimated GFR is &lt;30 mL/min.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In addition, liver and/or kidney disease places patients at an increased risk for a non-colon cancer-related death [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Comorbid conditions'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cardiovascular</strong> – Normal aging is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease. Among patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer, the possibility of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/z/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a> or capecitabine-induced vasospasm should be considered in patients who develop chest pain or otherwise unexplained decompensated heart failure during treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2812.html" rel="external">"Cardiotoxicity of cancer chemotherapy agents other than anthracyclines, HER2-targeted agents, and fluoropyrimidines", section on 'Antimetabolites'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bone marrow reserve</strong> – Bone marrow reserve diminishes as a part of normal aging, placing older patients at greater risk for severe and prolonged chemotherapy-related cytopenias. Chemotherapy dose reduction and/or delay may be necessary.</p><p></p><p>Another alternative is the use of hematopoietic growth factor support during treatment. However, there is no role for primary prophylaxis with myeloid growth factors. Guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) support primary prophylaxis with myeloid growth factors only for chemotherapy regimens that have a risk of febrile neutropenia ≥20 percent [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. None of the commonly used chemotherapy regimens used for adjuvant treatment of colon cancer meet this criterion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16889.html" rel="external">"Use of granulocyte colony stimulating factors in adult patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and conditions other than acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and hematopoietic cell transplantation", section on 'Primary prophylaxis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16889.html" rel="external">"Use of granulocyte colony stimulating factors in adult patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and conditions other than acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Comorbid conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients over the age of 75 have an average of five other medical conditions at the time of diagnosis of colorectal cancer [<a href="#rid7">7,9</a>]. The most common are anemia (often from occult blood loss related to a primary colon cancer), hypertension, other gastrointestinal diagnoses, and heart disease [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Of these, liver and kidney disease place patients at greatest risk of non-cancer-related death [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Among patients undergoing surgery for colon cancer, severe comorbidity increases the complexity of cancer management, and it decreases both overall and cancer-specific survival  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79620" href="/z/d/graphic/79620.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>For seriously ill patients with severe comorbid illness that diminishes life expectancy (particularly to one year or less), the risks of adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer may outweigh its benefits. On the other hand, for patients who have multiple but not life-threatening comorbid conditions, the benefits of adjuvant therapy appear to be preserved without an increased risk of severe chemotherapy toxicity or hospitalization during adjuvant therapy [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>Several comorbidity indices are available, and all appear useful for predicting which patients are likely to have lower levels of overall and cancer-specific survival after colon cancer surgery [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. One such tool, the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), is outlined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72047" href="/z/d/graphic/72047.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). In one series, patients with a CCI of ≥3 had a significant twofold higher risk of colon cancer-specific mortality, and a CCI of 2 or higher was associated with a significant 1.49-fold higher rate of overall mortality [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2808.html" rel="external">"Comprehensive geriatric assessment for patients with cancer", section on 'Comorbidity'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Quality of life issues</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Quality of life is a crucial component of decision-making when treating older cancer patients. The available data suggest that older patients are just as willing to try chemotherapy as their younger counterparts, but less willing to endure severe treatment-related side effects. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2823.html" rel="external">"Systemic chemotherapy for cancer in older adults", section on 'Quality of life issues'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Measures of physical function and reserve</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chronological age is a poor marker of a patient's functional status. Several methods of functional assessment are available, but there is no single valid measure that is both feasible in routine clinical practice, and can reliably predict and/or improve outcomes of older patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2823.html" rel="external">"Systemic chemotherapy for cancer in older adults", section on 'Assessments of physical function and reserve'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Performance status</strong> – The most common method to measure physiologic reserve and functional status in cancer patients is the clinician estimated performance status (PS). There are two widely used scales, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901" href="/z/d/graphic/72901.html" rel="external">table 5</a>) and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785" href="/z/d/graphic/58785.html" rel="external">table 6</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">PS tends to underestimate the degree of functional impairment in the older patient. However, both the ECOG PS and KPS are useful to assess a patient's ability to tolerate chemotherapy. Regardless of age, patients with a poor PS (eg, ECOG PS &gt;2, KPS &lt;60) usually tolerate chemotherapy poorly.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ADL and IADL scales</strong> – A more comprehensive understanding of an older patient's functional state can be obtained by use of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scales. ADL refers to the skills that are necessary for basic living, and include feeding, grooming, transferring, and toileting. IADL refers to the skills required to live independently in the community, including shopping, managing finances, housekeeping, preparing meals, and the ability to take medications.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Comprehensive geriatric assessment</strong> – Assessment of functional status with the ADL and IADL scales is a component of the comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) that is used by geriatricians to identify frail older patients at high risk of adverse outcomes such as falls, hospitalization, and death. Incorporating a more thorough geriatric assessment of function using the CGA can aid treatment decision making in older cancer patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2808.html" rel="external">"Comprehensive geriatric assessment for patients with cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">ASCO guidelines recommend that a geriatric assessment be undertaken in all patients age 65 and older who are receiving chemotherapy [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. There is no uniform CGA measurement tool. The ASCO guidelines provide a minimum dataset for practical assessment of vulnerabilities in older patients with cancer  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118720" href="/z/d/graphic/118720.html" rel="external">table 7</a>) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The guidelines also include recommendations for specific interventions guided by the geriatric assessment  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118298" href="/z/d/graphic/118298.html" rel="external">table 8</a>). This subject is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2808.html" rel="external">"Comprehensive geriatric assessment for patients with cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Use of physical function to guide treatment decisions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is general agreement that frail older adults, those with significant functional impairment or an ECOG PS of 3 to 4  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901" href="/z/d/graphic/72901.html" rel="external">table 5</a>), are not appropriate candidates for chemotherapy. There is also general agreement that adjuvant chemotherapy should be offered to active, fit, older patients without comorbidity although which regimen should be used is unclear  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71132" href="/z/d/graphic/71132.html" rel="external">table 9</a>). (See <a class="local">'Choice of regimen'</a> below.)</p><p>It is the patients who are neither frail nor fit for whom treatment decision making is most complex.</p><p>Validated models have been developed that can be useful in predicting which patients are at increased risk of developing severe or fatal toxicity from chemotherapy [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Parameters included within this model include age, type of cancer, the proposed chemotherapy regimen, renal and hematologic function, hearing, and activity levels from the comprehensive geriatric assessment (ability to take medications, physical activity, social activity). These parameters have been combined into a model that can be useful in predicting which patients are at increased risk of developing severe or fatal toxicity from chemotherapy  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78775" href="/z/d/graphic/78775.html" rel="external">table 10</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60649" href="/z/d/graphic/60649.html" rel="external">table 11</a>) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2823.html" rel="external">"Systemic chemotherapy for cancer in older adults", section on 'Models predicting chemotherapy toxicity and early death'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF STANDARD ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY FOR COLON CANCER</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy have been most clearly demonstrated in stage III (node-positive) disease, where there is an approximately 30 percent reduction in the risk of disease recurrence and a 22 to 32 percent reduction in death compared with observation alone.</p><p>The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II disease is more controversial. Data from randomized trials and meta-analyses indicate that if there is benefit for adjuvant <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/z/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a> (FU)-based chemotherapy in patients with resected stage II disease, it does not exceed an absolute improvement in five-year survival of 5 percent. Because of the higher risk of recurrence, adjuvant chemotherapy is often offered to patients with higher risk stage II disease (a T4 primary  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438" href="/z/d/graphic/111438.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), or two or more of the following high-risk features: fewer than 13 nodes in the surgical specimen, perforation, obstruction, lymphovascular or perineural invasion, poorly differentiated histology, high tumor budding score), although there are no data that support the view that these features identify those patients with stage II disease who might derive relatively greater benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. In fact, at least some data from the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)/Medicare database indicate that adjuvant chemotherapy does not substantially improve overall survival in patients over the age of 65 with stage II colon cancer, with or without any of these poor prognostic features [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Nevertheless, guidelines for use of adjuvant therapy in the setting of resected stage II disease are similar for younger and older individuals who are deemed able to tolerate it. These and other data addressing the benefit of chemotherapy for stage II disease are addressed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15256.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant therapy for resected stage II colon cancer", section on 'Is there benefit for fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy?'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Choice of regimen</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Regimen choice is influenced by disease stage.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25794326"><span class="h3">Stage III</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The randomized MOSAIC trial established the superiority of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10180" href="/z/d/drug information/10180.html" rel="external">oxaliplatin</a> plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9548" href="/z/d/drug information/9548.html" rel="external">leucovorin</a> (LV) and short-term infusional FU (FOLFOX  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64504" href="/z/d/graphic/64504.html" rel="external">table 12</a>)) as compared with FU and LV alone for adjuvant therapy of patients with stage III resected colon cancer.
