         As for all patients with ARDS, patients with COVID-19-related ARDS who require mechanical ventilation should receive low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) targeting ≤6 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW; range 4 to 8 mL/kg PBW  (

         We typically apply positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) according to the strategy outlined in the table  (

          table 4

         ). Since the COVID-19 ARDS phenotype is typically one of severe hypoxemia, we and other clinicians have a low threshold to start with a higher level of PEEP (eg, 10 to 15 cm H
         <sub>

         ), although this strategy is of unproven efficacy [

         This approach is supported by several randomized trials and meta-analyses that have reported improved mortality from LTVV in patients with non-COVID-19-related ARDS. Expert experience thus far is that this approach is also beneficial in the COVID-19 ARDS population. A multicenter study of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 in the Netherlands demonstrated widespread use of lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volumes, low driving pressure, and high PEEP [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11

         The response to LTVV should be assessed within the first four hours of ventilation. We typically reexamine the patient and the ventilator, so compliance can be calculated and synchrony assessed, and we also obtain an arterial blood gas so that the PaO

         For patients with COVID-19 who fail to achieve adequate oxygenation with LTVV, we agree with other experts that providing LTVV in the prone position is the preferred next step to improve oxygenation. Institutions that are not proficient in pronation should educate staff in advance of applying the procedure. The process is similar to that in patients with non-COVID-19-related ARDS. (See

         – There is no agreed upon time after initial application of LTVV that prone positioning should be optimally implemented. In general, similar to non-COVID-19 patients, it is thought that implementation of pronation is more likely to be beneficial in the earlier phases of ARDS (eg, first 4 to 12 hours). Should deterioration in oxygenation occur in the later phases of ARDS, the benefits are less clear. (See

          Duration of each prone session, application, and contraindications

         – Similar to non-COVID-19 patients, we typically promote ventilating patients prone for as long as is feasible within a 24 hour period (ie, 12 to 16 hours prone per day). Pronation is repeated daily until it is no longer needed or there is no response, as detailed below (discontinuing pronation). When a patient who is in the prone position shows improvement, FiO

         Use of rescue strategies has varied among centers. Among 66 mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 in Boston, Massachusetts, 31 (47 percent) underwent prone positioning, 18 (27 percent) were treated with inhaled vasodilator, and 3 (5 percent) received ECMO [

         We believe that oxygenation goals in critically ill patients with COVID-19 should be similar to those recommended by ARDSNet (ie, peripheral oxygen saturation between 88 and 96 percent). Special attention should be paid to using peripheral arterial oxygen saturation (SpO

         Avoid unnecessary disconnection with the ETT or tracheostomy. For example, in-line suction devices and in-line adapters for bronchoscopy are preferred, if resources allow. If disconnection is necessary (eg, during transfer when portable ventilators are used or manual bagging), the ETT or tracheostomy should be temporarily clamped during disconnection and unclamped after reconnection, provided the patient is not spontaneously breathing. This is considered an aerosolizing procedure in which case an airborne infection isolation room is preferable.

One study reported a reduction in the number of room entries by nursing from an average of 15 to 8 entries per 12 hour shift following IV pump relocation to outside the room without an increase in the rate of IV extravasation or central line-relation bacteremia, hyperglycemia, or hypotension [

         Nonbronchoscopic alveolar lavage ("mini-BAL") may also be performed as an alternative to bronchoscopy, although experience in this procedure is not universal among ICUs.

         Bronchoscopy is an aerosol-generating procedure and should only be performed when necessary and likely to change management. For example, bronchoscopy is reasonable in immunosuppressed patients with respiratory failure of unclear etiology, suspected
         <em>
          Pneumocystis jirovecii
         </em>
         , suspected foreign body, severe hypoxemia from mucus-plugging-induced lobar collapse, or life-threatening hemoptysis. Bronchoscopy should have a limited role for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and should only be performed for this indication when upper respiratory samples are negative (ie, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, or tracheal aspirates) and the suspicion remains high. If bronchoscopy is needed for the diagnosis of COVID-19, we suggest the instillation of only small aliquots (eg, one to two 10 mL aliquots) to obtain a total of 2 to 3 mL of lavage fluid.
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with COVID-19, bronchoscopy should be performed in an airborne infection isolation room, although bronchoscopy through an established airway (eg, endotracheal tube [ETT]) likely carries less risk than bronchoscopy in a spontaneously breathing patient. Full airborne precautions and personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used. Clamping suction tubing or turning off suction after the sample has been obtained before disconnecting the sample from the device is also prudent. Specimens should be in a double zip-locked sealed plastic bag, handled with the usual precautions, and labelled clearly as "COVID-19." (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127501.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         We prefer the use of disposable bronchoscopes, although these are not universally available. For nondisposable equipment, we recommend cleaning the suction channels with standard cleaning solutions typically used for highly infectious material. We also suggest covering or sealing any vessel containing the bronchoscope during transport after use and wiping down the transport cart and bronchoscope display tower before leaving the room. Wipe down solution should be hydrogen peroxide or equivalent and should be left wet on all surfaces for at least one minute.
        </p>
        <p>
         Data to support this practice are limited. One single-center series from Barcelona, Spain, described their experience in performing bronchoscopy on mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42

         <em>

          Klebsiella

         , and occasionally fungal species, similar to typical micro-organisms identified in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. No significant complications were reported. However, one bronchoscopist out of a total of three became infected with SARS-CoV-2. In another series, similar results were found except no bronchoscopists became infected, and a protocol that favored use of neuromuscular blockade was used [

          43
         </a>
         ]. Older age, paralytics, need for high positive end-expiratory pressure prior to extubation, need for greater respiratory support following extubation, and nonpulmonary organ failure predicted reintubation.

          SBTs
         </strong>
         – To reduce the risk of reintubation following extubation, we prefer a higher degree of readiness for extubation in patients with COVID-19. Practice varies and may include higher criteria for passing an SBT. For example, some experts use lower pressure support ventilation (PSV) parameters (eg, 0 to 5 cm H
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         O) rather than the typical higher PEEP to overcome endotracheal tube resistance during the trial, while others promote SBT for longer periods (eg, two to four hours rather than the typical two hours). The rationale for altered criteria is based upon the observation that patients with COVID-19 are intubated for longer periods than non-COVID-19 patients [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12

          Cuff leak test (CLT)
         </strong>
         – Whether the CLT should be performed routinely prior to extubation is unclear. Performing CLT may be warranted if there is suspicion for upper airway edema (eg, fluid overload) or the patient is at risk for post extubation stridor (eg, prolonged intubation ≥6 days, age &gt;80 years, large endotracheal tube, traumatic intubation). However, it should be weighed against the potential risk of aerosolization, and similar to extubation, it should be preferentially done in an airborne isolation room. Some institutions routinely administer glucocorticoids (eg,

         For patients who remain on infection control precautions for COVID-19, we prefer to perform extubation in an airborne isolation room. Respiratory therapists and others in the room during extubation should adhere to airborne precautions including N95 masks with eye protection or equivalent. In general, only two people are needed, and extra staff outside the room should be available to help with additional equipment. We advocate close communication with a clinician who is experienced in intubation when a patient with COVID-19 is being extubated, particularly for patients predesignated as having a difficult airway, in case rapid reintubation is needed.

         While we do not premedicate patients prior to extubation with antitussives, some experts promote their use (eg,

        </p>
        <p>
         We typically drape the patient’s chest and face with a plastic cover to provide barrier protection between the patient and the operator (eg, a plastic poncho). Immediately prior to extubation, we set the ventilator in standby mode (or switch off). After balloon deflation, extra care should be taken during ETT removal to keep the inline suction catheter engaged during cuff deflation and to have another handheld suction catheter available for the removal of pharyngeal and oral sections. The ETT should be removed as smoothly as is feasible during inspiration, and immediately disposed of into a biohazard plastic bag bundled together with the ventilator tubing, the plastic drape, tape/ETT holders, and inline suction catheter. The bag is sealed and disposed of immediately.

         Selection of a sedation and analgesia strategy for COVID-19 patients is similar to that for non-COVID-19 intubated patients with a preference for bolus-dose opioids; for patients who need more sedation we typically administer continuous infusion opioids and then add

         For patients at risk of harm, such as self-extubation, who remain under infectious precautions, deeper sedation may be necessary because response time to the bedside may be slower, but it should still be minimized.

         We typically perform daily laboratory studies including complete blood count with differential and routine chemistries. Other laboratory studies are done when clinically indicated including arterial blood gases, liver function studies, and coagulation studies. If cardiac injury is suspected, we measure cardiac troponins and have a low threshold to perform transthoracic echocardiogram. While some experts perform "COVID-19" laboratory studies such as ferritin, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and occasionally interleukin-6, there is no guidance on when to perform these studies and how to make decisions based upon them, which has led to variable practice. Each institution should develop their own protocols regarding the acquisition and interpretation of "COVID-19" laboratory studies. (See

         perform daily chest radiographs in mechanically ventilated patients with or without COVID-19.

Chest computed tomography and other imaging including echocardiography and bedside ultrasonography should be limited to those in whom testing would change management.

         Many patients require vasopressors for hypotension which is often sedation-related but may be due to other conditions including sepsis, either due to primary SARS-CoV-2 infection or a concomitant bacterial infection. The management of patients who present with septic shock due to COVID-19 is similar to that in patients with septic shock from other causes. (See

         Nebulization is considered an aerosol-generating procedure. For patients with COVID-19 who are intubated and require bronchodilators for an evidence-based indication (eg, acute bronchospasm from asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease exacerbation), we prefer the use of in-line metered dose inhalers (MDIs; ie, pressurized inhalers) rather than administration via a standard jet or vibrating mesh nebulizer due to the lower risk of aerosolization associated with MDIs. Data to support this practice are provided separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/131226.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For medications that can only be administered via the inhaled route, consideration should be given to stopping the medication, if it is not essential for acute care, or using an MDI alternative, if available on formulary. Consideration should be given to the patient using their own supply if MDIs are not on formulary.
        </p>
        <p>
         Placement of a filter at the expiratory port of the ventilation circuit during nebulization, if not already present, is prudent to minimize aerosolization into the room. Ideally, patients who require nebulizers, should be in an airborne infection isolation room. Only the healthcare staff necessary for nebulizer administration (eg, respiratory therapists or nurse) should be in the room for the initiation of the procedure and airborne precautions should be taken.

         Like any critical illness, severe illness due to COVID-19 carries the potential of significant psychosocial distress to patients, families, and surrogates. In addition, unique aspects of COVID-19 and its management portend greater trauma including anxiety and stigma surrounding a novel pathogen and high-level isolation precautions including visitation limitation or prohibition including at the end of life. High levels of patient, family, and surrogate psychosocial distress should be anticipated and combatted with clear communication strategies and early palliative care involvement  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef128386" href="/z/d/graphic/128386.html" rel="external">
          table 10
         </a>
         ). Even if in-person visitation is not allowed due to public health care concerns, hospitals should promote internet-based visual communication such as video communication between clinicians, families, and isolated patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         Discussing end-of-life wishes with patients and their family should occur early in the course of management, including before or at hospital admission, especially in light of the poor outcomes for elderly patients with comorbidities who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and require mechanical ventilation [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. Consultation with the palliative care teams should also be done to assist families in decision-making and assist clinicians with contentious issues or disagreement that may arise.
        </p>
        <p>
         Due to the unique aspects of addressing needs of the patient and their caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic, several online resources are available for clinicians to use when having COVID-19 specific discussions. They provide helpful language and strategies for conversations about a range of issues including, but not limited to, triage decisions, goals of care, resource allocation, and grieving including.

         COVID-19 is a global pandemic and has placed significant increases in demand for acute and critical care services on hospitals in many regions. This has necessitated operations maneuvers to increase capacity to be able to provide care for more patients, for higher acuity patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation, and for patients with special isolation requirements. It is essential that all hospitals and health systems develop task forces to manage patients admitted with this disorder. This involves, but is not limited to, designating COVID-19 ICU bed capacity and care teams, creating back up and expanded staffing schedules, utilizing detailed protocols for infection prevention and medical management, accessing research trials for patients with COVID-19, ensuring adequate personal protection equipment (PPE) supplies and training, forecasting demand, and prioritizing diagnostic lab testing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Surge capacity may be achieved by maximizing resources across three domains:

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In the COVID-19 pandemic, this has included expanding ICU care into non-ICU spaces, utilizing non-critical care trained staff to participate in delivering critical care, and innovative approaches to obtain, conserve, and increase the efficiency of physical equipment including PPE (eg, extended and reuse of N95 masks) and mechanical ventilators (eg, repurposing operating room ventilators).

         In some instances, such as in Italy, despite mobilizing to surge capacity, demand for care still outpaced supply such that overt rationing occurred [

          Ventilator management strategy

         – COVID-19 can progress in a subset of patients to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which often requires intubation and mechanical ventilation  (

         We use lung-protective, low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) targeting ≤6 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW; range 4 to 8 mL/kg PBW  (

          table 4

         ). We assess the response within the first four hours of ventilation using clinical evaluation and arterial blood gas analysis. For those who respond well (eg, fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO

         Oxygenation goals should be similar to those recommended by ARDSNet (ie, peripheral oxygen saturation between 88 and 96 percent). Pulse oximetry may be more likely to overestimate arterial oxygenation in patients with darkly pigmented skin and should be interpreted accordingly. Oxygenation targets in ARDS are discussed separately. (See

          Interventions and precautions
         </strong>
         – Several procedures, including the collection of respiratory specimens, bronchoscopy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation are aerosol-generating and should be used only when indicated. All procedures should be grouped, if feasible, and performed in an airborne isolation room with full precautions. Maintenance of tight seals, avoiding unnecessary disconnection, use of dual limb circuitry, appropriate filters (especially on the exhalation circuit), and scheduled "wipe-down" of the ventilator are additional infection control approaches.

          Extubation, weaning, tracheostomy
         </strong>
         – Extubation and tracheostomy are potentially aerosol-generating. We encourage the COVID-19-specific protocols and checklists at each institution. For example, for patients who remain on infection control precautions  (
