Abnormal uterine bleeding, the most common symptom associated with fibroids, is most frequent in patients with tumors that abut the endometrium (lining of the uterine cavity), including submucosal and some intramural fibroids [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>]. This is likely due to distortion of the uterine cavity and an increase in the bleeding surface of the endometrium [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Submucosal leiomyomas, which derive from myometrial cells just below the endometrium, account for approximately 15 to 20 percent of fibroids.</p><p>Historically, hysterotomy or hysterectomy was performed to remove submucosal leiomyomas. This has been largely replaced by hysteroscopic myomectomy, a minimally invasive surgical procedure that effectively and safely removes these lesions [<a href="#rid4">4,7</a>].</p><p>Hysteroscopic myomectomy is reviewed here. General principles of hysteroscopy and abdominal approaches to myomectomy are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3278.html" rel="external">"Overview of hysteroscopy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3295.html" rel="external">"Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas): Prolapsed fibroids"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14195.html" rel="external">"Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas): Open abdominal myomectomy procedure"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hysteroscopic myomectomy is performed to remove intracavitary fibroids, a term that refers to (1) submucosal leiomyomas and (2) some intramural leiomyomas for which most of the fibroid protrudes into the uterine cavity. It is a minimally invasive procedure that is the procedure of choice for appropriate candidates. The ability to remove intracavitary fibroids depends on the surgeon's experience and skill, surgical device used, and size and depth of the leiomyoma.</p><p>Appropriate candidates for hysteroscopic myomectomy are patients with the following characteristics:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptomatic uterine fibroid(s).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>It is feasible to remove the fibroid(s) hysteroscopically. This is particularly the case if the fibroids can be removed by hysteroscopy alone, so an open abdominal or laparoscopic approach is not required to remove additional fibroids in other locations (eg, intramural or subserosal) or treat other pathology.</p><p></p><p>For patients who are candidates for hysteroscopic myomectomy, this procedure is preferred to an abdominal approach (ie, laparotomy, minimally invasive laparoscopic, robotic) for the following reasons:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Outpatient procedure</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Minimal recovery time</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Minimal need for opioids or prolonged pain medication</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Minimal postoperative restrictions with ability to quickly return to activities (eg, work, sports, intercourse)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decreased perioperative morbidity</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decreased febrile morbidity</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Minimal or no scarring of myometrium (a scarred myometrium may require the patient to have a cesarean delivery for future childbirth)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common indications for hysteroscopic myomectomy in the setting of intracavitary fibroids are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abnormal uterine bleeding (both in reproductive-age and postmenopausal patients)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recurrent pregnancy loss</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Infertility</p><p></p><p>The effects of leiomyomas on reproductive function are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5478.html" rel="external">"Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas): Treatment overview", section on 'Impact of fibroids on fertility'</a>.)</p><p>Hysteroscopic myomectomy is also performed in selected patients with intracavitary fibroids who have conditions that are more commonly attributed to etiologies other than fibroids. In these patients, hysteroscopic myomectomy is performed when other therapies have failed or it is reasonable to attribute symptoms to an intracavitary fibroid. Such conditions include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dysmenorrhea</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Leukorrhea</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Necrotic leiomyoma following uterine fibroid embolization, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-focused ultrasound, or radiofrequency fibroid ablation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Histologic evaluation of intracavitary lesions with uncertain findings on pelvic imaging</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of preterm delivery</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Postpartum hemorrhage [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Puerperal infection arising in or exacerbated by a submucosal fibroid [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Postmenopausal bleeding</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Residual fibroid stalk or tissue following vaginal myomectomy</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Contraindications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hysteroscopic myomectomy is contraindicated in patients in whom hysteroscopic surgery is contraindicated (eg, active pelvic infection, pyometra, intrauterine pregnancy, known cervical or uterine cancer).</p><p>Medical comorbidities (eg, coronary heart disease, bleeding diathesis) are also potential contraindications to hysteroscopic surgery. However, since this is a minimally invasive procedure, medical comorbidities are rarely a contraindication. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4815.html" rel="external">"Overview of the principles of medical consultation and perioperative medicine"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Leiomyoma characteristics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who are appropriate candidates for hysteroscopic myomectomy must conform to appropriate indications and contraindications, but also must have fibroid characteristics that are amenable to this technique. Hysteroscopic myomectomy removes fibroids that have an intracavitary component  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53241" href="/z/d/graphic/53241.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Removal of fibroids that penetrate into the myometrium, are large, or are sessile takes longer, has the potential for increased perioperative complications, and may result in incomplete fibroid resection. In addition, for patients with additional fibroids that are intramural or subserosal or who have other uterine pathology (eg, adenomyosis), hysteroscopic myomectomy may not provide symptomatic relief.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1343078228"><span class="h3">Classification systems</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most commonly used classification system for the extent of myometrial involvement of a fibroid was described by the European Society of Hysteroscopy (ESH  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59668" href="/z/d/graphic/59668.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>)) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Type 0</strong> – completely within the endometrial cavity</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Type I</strong> – extend less than 50 percent into the myometrium</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Type II</strong> – extend 50 percent or more within the myometrium</p><p></p><p>Observational studies support the ability of the ESH system to predict complete fibroid resection; reported rates of complete resection rates by type were: type 0 (96 to 97 percent), type I (86 to 90 percent), and type II (61 to 83 percent) [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. In addition, depth of myometrial penetration appears to correlate with the volume of distension fluid absorbed. This was illustrated in a series of 339 hysteroscopic myomectomies that reported that the volume of fluid absorbed during the procedure increased significantly with the degree of myometrial penetration (type 0: 450 mL, type I: 957 mL, and type II: 1682 mL) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>However, the ESH system considers only the degree of penetration of the submucous myoma in the myometrium. Another classification system was proposed in 2005, which uses transvaginal ultrasound or MRI to assess the degree of penetration in the myometrium, as well as other fibroid characteristics: size, distance of the base along the uterine wall, and portion of the cavity in which the fibroid is located [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Further studies are needed to validate this classification system.</p><p>Another classification system, the STEP-W submucosal fibroid classification system takes into account additional features of the fibroid utilizing transvaginal ultrasound or MRI to assess five myoma characteristics  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef105588" href="/z/d/graphic/105588.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Two- and three-dimensional <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> infusion sonography (SIS) is widely accepted to improve the visualization of the endometrium and myometrial interface. The STEP-W classification considers size, topography, extension of the fibroid base, depth of fibroid penetration, and the lateral wall involvement. Each factor is assigned a point value. A low score of 0 to 4 (low complexity) is associated with safety and successful removal of the fibroid in one hysteroscopic setting. A score of 5 or 6 is considered high complexity, and may require a two-stage hysteroscopic procedure. A score of 7 to 9 is considered not amenable to treatment hysteroscopically.</p><p>The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics also has a classification system for uterine leiomyomas  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91085" href="/z/d/graphic/91085.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Myometrial penetration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with symptomatic fibroids, we suggest hysteroscopic myomectomy <strong>only</strong> for fibroids that are completely within the endometrial cavity or extend less than 50 percent into the myometrium. Removal of fibroids with deeper myometrial involvement requires advanced hysteroscopic skills or myomectomy using laparotomy or laparoscopy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Leiomyoma size and number</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hysteroscopic resection of large fibroids may involve increased perioperative complications and/or require more than one procedure for symptomatic relief. The definition of large is not well established. Only one prospective study of 122 patients examined the effect of fibroid size; the risk of subsequent fibroid-related surgery within four years was significantly lower in patients with fibroids that were ≤3 cm versus 4 cm or more (10 versus 60 percent) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Increasing size of fibroid requires exquisite hysteroscopic skill, complete understanding of fluid management, ability to quickly remove myoma chip fragments that might preclude surgical visualization, and techniques to decrease risk of uterine perforation when chip fragments are removed.</p><p>Clinician skills ultimately determine the maximal size or number of fibroids that can be removed. For leiomyomas that are multiple or are &gt;3 cm or deep in myometrium, it is prudent to include in the informed consent the possibility of a two-stage procedure (ie, two hysteroscopy procedures).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Presence of other leiomyomas or uterine pathology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many patients have intracavitary fibroids in combination with fibroids in other locations (eg, intramural, subserosal). As the volume of additional fibroids increases, the surgeon must decide whether isolated removal of the intracavitary fibroid(s) will provide adequate treatment or if a laparoscopic or abdominal approach to myomectomy or a hysterectomy is preferable. Other factors that influence the choice of surgical approach include desire for future fertility and presence of other pathology [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>The greater the volume of additional fibroids, the greater the likelihood that symptomatic relief will be provided only by a laparoscopic or abdominal approach to myomectomy and the less likely that isolated removal of intracavitary fibroids will provide symptomatic relief. Patients with fibroids that are both intracavitary and in other locations who have bulk symptoms (abdominal pain, pressure, or distension; urinary urgency, frequency, or retention; or constipation) are not likely to benefit from hysteroscopic resection alone.</p><p>On the other hand, patients without bulk symptoms and normal or slightly enlarged uterine size who have heavy uterine bleeding or conditions that appear to derive specifically from the presence of an intracavitary lesion, such as recurrent pregnancy loss or fibroid-associated leukorrhea, may benefit from the isolated removal of an intracavitary myoma, even if other leiomyomas are present. This approach may be particularly useful in perimenopausal patients by providing symptom relief through the menopause transition.</p><p>Patients with abnormal uterine bleeding or dysmenorrhea may have adenomyosis in addition to intracavitary fibroids. For patients with diffuse adenomyosis, a hysteroscopic myomectomy is unlikely to provide complete symptomatic relief. However, patients with focal adenomyosis and normal uterine size can be offered hysteroscopic myomectomy. Such patients should be counseled preoperatively regarding the limited evidence regarding outcome of this procedure among patients with these two uterine pathologies. These patients can also benefit from medical therapy or insertion of a levonorgestrel-containing intrauterine device in combination with hysteroscopic myomectomy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5489.html" rel="external">"Uterine adenomyosis"</a>.)</p><p>The differential diagnosis for an intrauterine mass also includes adenomyoma, endometrial polyp, calcified retained products of conception, smooth muscle tumor of uncertain malignant potential, leiomyosarcoma, or endometrial stromal tumor. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14203.html" rel="external">"Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas): Differentiating fibroids from uterine sarcomas"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION AND PREPARATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Preoperative evaluation and preparation are generally the same as for other hysteroscopic procedures. Issues specific to hysteroscopic myomectomy are presented here. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3278.html" rel="external">"Overview of hysteroscopy", section on 'Preoperative evaluation and preparation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Informed consent</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with symptomatic intracavitary fibroids should be counseled about other medical, interventional radiologic, and surgical options for treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5476.html" rel="external">"Abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age patients: Management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5478.html" rel="external">"Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas): Treatment overview"</a>.)</p><p>Patients should be counseled about potential complications of the procedure and about the likelihood of recurrence of fibroids or symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Complications'</a> below and <a class="local">'Recurrence of leiomyomas or bleeding symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with intracavitary myomas that are multiple, broad-based, large (&gt;3 cm), and/or penetrate into the myometrium should be advised that a second procedure may be necessary to fully remove all myomas (see <a class="local">'Two-step procedures'</a> below). This discussion should be documented on the surgical consent form and in the medical record.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A thorough history is important to determine whether fibroid-related symptoms are present (eg, heavy uterine bleeding, bulk symptoms) and whether these symptoms affect the patient's quality of life. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5486.html" rel="external">"Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas): Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and natural history", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h2">Evaluation of the uterus</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evaluation of the uterus and cervix for fibroids (both submucosal and at other locations) or other pathology (eg, adenomyosis, endometrial polyp) with pelvic imaging and/or diagnostic hysteroscopy are essential prior to hysteroscopic myomectomy. Knowledge of these fibroid characteristics prior to surgery helps to select appropriate patients as well as to prepare for or prevent blood loss (eg, measurement of preoperative hematocrit, preoperative endometrial preparation) and minimize fluid deficit and to ensure that the appropriate instruments and surgical expertise are available. (See <a class="local">'Leiomyoma characteristics'</a> above and <a class="local">'Perioperative medications'</a> below.)</p><p>We suggest three-dimensional <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> infusion sonography (SIS), where available, since it is a single modality that can evaluate the relationship of a leiomyoma to both the endometrial cavity and the myometrium. An alternative is to use a combination of office-based diagnostic hysteroscopy and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS). Hysteroscopy can define the extent to which a fibroid protrudes into the uterine cavity, and TVUS can define the depth of myometrial penetration. It is useful for the surgeon to view the TVUS images to establish whether a hysteroscopic approach is feasible. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) defines leiomyoma position well, but is prohibitively expensive to use routinely for this indication. Hysterosalpingography and computed tomography have limited use in delineating fibroid location. The use of pelvic imaging for diagnosis of leiomyomas is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5486.html" rel="external">"Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas): Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and natural history", section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with enlarged uterine size (ie, 14 to 16 weeks or larger on pelvic examination), SIS may be impractical. Maintenance of uterine distension is difficult and limits the ability to interpret images of the endometrium and myometrium. MRI may be more useful to evaluate patients for a type 0, I, or II leiomyoma as described in the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics and European Society of Hysteroscopy classification systems. Additionally, MRI is also used in the STEP-W classification system.</p><p>In addition, any patient with abnormal uterine bleeding at risk for endometrial hyperplasia or cancer should undergo evaluation of the endometrium with endometrial sampling prior to hysteroscopic myomectomy  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58600" href="/z/d/graphic/58600.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3232.html" rel="external">"Overview of the evaluation of the endometrium for malignant or premalignant disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1343078564"><span class="h2">Laboratory testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Routine preoperative evaluation should be performed. For hysteroscopic myomectomy, some institutions routinely order a hematocrit. For reproductive-age patients, pregnancy testing is required. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4816.html" rel="external">"Preoperative medical evaluation of the healthy adult patient"</a>.)</p><p>Patients with uterine leiomyomas and abnormal uterine bleeding may be anemic. The blood loss during hysteroscopic myomectomy does not typically exceed 100 mL. However, if anemia is a concern, measure should be taken to treat this prior to surgery and/or to prevent bleeding during surgery.

General principles of fluid control and avoidance of excessive absorption are the same for hysteroscopic myomectomy as for other procedures. Risk factors for increased absorption of fluid includes operating time, depth of myometrial incision, and size of the lesion. Continuous fluid monitoring is necessary throughout the procedure to avoid complications (eg, hyponatremia, pulmonary, cardiac, or laryngeal edema) or the need to abort the procedure. Hypotonic solutions (ie, glycine) are used when a resectoscope with monopolar electrical wire loop technique is employed. Bipolar resectoscopes are used with isotonic fluids. Tissue extraction (morcellation) and vaporization devices are used with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a>.

Hysteroscopic morcellation and vaporization devices have also been introduced.</p><p>Most gynecologists are familiar with the wire loop technique and the equipment is cost-effective and widely available. If a monopolar device is used, a non-electrolytic solution is used (eg, 1.5 percent glycine, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9940" href="/z/d/drug information/9940.html" rel="external">sorbitol</a> 3 percent, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9587" href="/z/d/drug information/9587.html" rel="external">mannitol</a> is used). If a bipolar device is used, the fluid medium is isotonic <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> or Ringer's lactate solution [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. As an adjunct to this technique, hysteroscopic scissors can be used for small pedunculated fibroids or fragments that remain attached to the uterine wall and are not easily removed with the loop. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3300.html" rel="external">"Hysteroscopy: Managing fluid and gas distending media", section on 'Fluid media'</a>.)</p><p>The goals of newer techniques, such as morcellation (also referred to as tissue retrieval) or vaporization, is to make resection of fibroids technically easier [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>], produce fewer tissue fragments, require fewer insertions of the hysteroscope, and use <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> as the distention medium. Fewer insertions of the hysteroscope is helpful for patients with marked cervical stenosis, a retroverted/retroflexed uterus, or a small uterine cavity associated with menopause. Any of these factors may increase the risk of uterine perforation, particularly with repeat insertions of the hysteroscope. The use of saline avoids use of hypotonic solutions (ie, glycine), that may result in hyponatremia. In addition, because resection is performed mechanically or with limited bipolar radiofrequency (Symphion), there is minimal risk of damage to the endometrium. These devices are designed to enter only to a shallow depth and therefore are not likely to cause an incision that penetrates the full thickness of the uterine wall. As with any intrauterine instrument, it is possible for uterine perforation to occur if the entire device is pushed through the wall of the myometrium.</p><p>Visual dilation and curettage can be performed with a hysteroscopic tissue retrieval system. The hysteroscopic morcellator cutting aperture is aligned next to or abutting the endometrium. Under direct hysteroscopic visualization, the endometrium can be sampling with a to and fro maneuver with the hysteroscope, duplicating the same technique used with a curette.</p><p>However, the disposable morcellator or tissue retrieval system is more expensive than a wire loop and may require a propriety fluid management system, which also adds to the expense.</p><p>Comparative studies have reported that myomectomy duration was 8 to 26 minutes shorter with the intrauterine morcellator versus a resectoscope [<a href="#rid29">29-31</a>]. Of note, some of these studies were performed in an office setting. In addition, a review of events reported to the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Device Experience (MAUDE) database from 2005 to 2014 included 119 adverse events, including death (2 cases), bowel damage (12), hysterectomy (6), uterine perforation requiring no other treatment (29), and pelvic infection (4) [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. The limitation of these data is that the total number of procedures performed during this time period is unknown.</p><p>The disadvantage for two of the current hysteroscopic morcellators is that they cannot cauterize bleeding vessels. Only one system, Symphion, utilizes a built-in spot coagulation to control bleeding to maintain continuous visualization. The hysteroscopic morcellator is also not designed to treat deeper myomas, and thus, is limited to use in patients with hysteroscopic type 0 or type I leiomyomas. Since myomas that appear to be type 0 or I upon preoperative evaluation may "sink" deeper into the myometrium during surgery and may not be retrieved with a morcellating device, the optimal situation is for a surgeon to have access and surgical skills to utilize both the wire loop and morcellator if needed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21"><span class="h2">Tissue removal</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Use of the wire loop or tissue extraction (morcellator) techniques yield tissue fragments (referred to as chips) that need to be removed.</p><p>Some operative sheaths aspirate pieces of tissue from the uterine cavity to remove debris or retrieve specimens for pathologic evaluation (eg, Chip E-Vac, hysteroscopic morcellator). This allows removal of large debris while maintaining clear visualization.</p><p>There are several options to remove tissue fragments with conventional resectoscopy. Options include grasping as many myoma fragments under direct visualization with the wire loop and removing tissue fragments, chip by chip. This is safe, but time-consuming. Other techniques include blind insertion of uterine polyp forceps or myoma graspers, suction curettage, or slow removal of the hysteroscope through the dilated cervix allowing the tissue fragments to tumble out. Overall these techniques require multiple insertions of the hysteroscope.</p><p>With hysteroscopic tissue retrieval or morcellation devices, tissue fragments are retrieved throughout the procedure with the device in place, and thus fewer insertions are required.

Close attention to the distension fluid deficit is critical to avoid complications of excessive fluid absorption. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3300.html" rel="external">"Hysteroscopy: Managing fluid and gas distending media"</a>.)</p><p>The most important limiting factor in completing operative hysteroscopic myomectomy is fluid deficit. Guidelines advise in otherwise healthy patients that the procedure be concluded when a deficit of 2500 mL of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> is reached. If monopolar energy is used, the clinician should halt the procedure at 1000 mL of 1.5% glycine and check electrolytes. If normal, then the entire procedure should be halted at 1500 mL 1.5% glycine deficit.</p><p>Informed consent for a two-staged procedure should be discussed with the patient when large fibroids (&gt;3 cm) are anticipated. Additionally, there is greater absorption of fluid when fibroids are type I or type II due to opening myometrial blood vessels, which increase the risk of intravasation. With patient-informed consent, the author discusses two-stage procedures in patients with multiple leiomyomas, especially those who are considering pregnancy and whose fibroids are on opposing walls. Theoretically, this would decrease the risk of postoperative intrauterine adhesions. Additionally, those with &gt;2 fibroids that are 3 cm or greater, and those with type I and type II fibroids, are informed of increased risk of incomplete procedure due to fluid intravasation.</p><p>As surgical acumen increases, the rapidity of hysteroscopic resection often improves, and surgeons can deftly remove increased amount of fibroid tissue. The upper limit size of the leiomyoma resected will depend on the surgeon's expertise and how quickly surgery can be performed before reaching maximal fluid absorption. Removal of fibroids with deeper myometrial involvement and greater than 3 cm in diameter requires advanced hysteroscopic skills. Defining what constitutes a "large" leiomyoma was described by comparing outcomes and need for additional surgery within four years of initial treatment. In one prospective study of 122 subjects, patients with fibroids 3 cm or less were able to avoid additional fibroid surgery 90 percent of the time compared with patients with fibroids 4 cm or greater, who required additional surgery 60 percent of the time [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>In the event of an incomplete procedure, the decision to proceed with additional attempts at hysteroscopic resection should depend upon the resolution of menstrual abnormalities, desire for future pregnancy, or if in vitro fertilization is anticipated. Some patients with an incomplete procedure may spontaneously pass residual leiomyomas and have complete resolution of clinical symptoms. Others will persist with menstrual aberrations or develop chronic leukorrhea. If a second procedure is anticipated, the author recommends reevaluating the size, number, and location of the fibroid with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> infusion sonogram to objectively plan the next surgical procedure.</p><p>Expert hysteroscopic experience is required for removal of type I fibroids greater than 5 to 6 cm and 4 to 5 cm if a type II fibroid is encountered. Several techniques have been described to approach resectoscopic retrieval of type I and type II fibroids. The main objective is to separate the fibroid from the pseudocapsule and then, with intermittent uterine decompression, slice the protruding fibroid and intramural component. It may require a two-step intervention if the maximal fluid deficit is reached. Patients with type II leiomyomas may have a volumetrically significant component of the leiomyoma retained within the myometrium. While protrusion of the leiomyoma may occur with partial resection, it may occur less effectively when there is a large intramural component remaining. Fibroid protrusion may be hindered by resistance of the contralateral wall. Attempts of a second-stage hysteroscopic resection may be incomplete. If a second-stage procedure is considered, then repeat evaluation with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> infusion sonohysterography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended to objectively confirm the size and location of the remaining fibroid.</p><p>Two additional techniques have been described to increase the likelihood of complete removal of the leiomyoma. While it lacks evidence-based trials, the author employs the technique of hydromassage. It involves rapid change in the intrauterine pressure using an automatic fluid management system. Stopping and starting the fluid as well as periodically removing the hysteroscope from the endometrial cavity increases myometrial contractions and facilitates migration of the intramural component into the uterine cavity [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Another technique called "manual massage" is performed by placing a finger into the uterus (similar to obstetric maneuvers such as Crede) and massaging the endocavity to help expel the fibroid into the uterine cavity [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p>The learning curve for operative resectoscopy may be longer than with hysteroscopic tissue retrieval systems. Deeper lesions (type I and type II leiomyomas) may more often benefit from resection technology [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. However, with increased surgical volume, use of simulators, observing skilled hysteroscopists, and increased complexity of removing type I and type II leiomyomas, surgical acumen is improved and facilitates greater retrieval of larger leiomyomas with both devices.</p><p>Some clinicians advocate the release of the fibroid pseudocapsule, with the anticipation that deeply imbedded leiomyomas will become fully intracavitary, thereby facilitating complete hysteroscopic resection at a follow-up procedure. If this is a preferred technique, the author would confirm this with SIS or office hysteroscopy before rescheduling the patient [<a href="#rid11">11,12,36-39</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1406513"><span class="h2">Anesthesia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hysteroscopic myomectomy is performed under general or regional anesthesia or intravenous sedation. </p><p>Preoperatively, a paracervical block, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a>, and/or intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8591" href="/z/d/drug information/8591.html" rel="external">ketorolac</a> may also be utilized to help with postoperative analgesia.

At that point, carefully remove the chips  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53091" href="/z/d/graphic/53091.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). This can be accomplished using the inactivated wire loop or blindly with a polyp/myoma forceps or suction curette; another option is to remove the inner sheath of the resectoscope to facilitate the egress of tissue chips. As noted in a preceding section, some surgical systems evacuate chips (Chip E-Vac, hysteroscopic morcellator). (See <a class="local">'Tissue removal'</a> above.)</p><p>Occasionally, as the fibroid is cut, the previously round myoma becomes more irregularly shaped and can be grasped bluntly and avulsed with polyp/myoma forceps.

Excessive traction should be avoided to decrease the risk of uterine eversion, perforation, or injury to surrounding intraabdominal viscera. To minimize the risk of uterine perforation, the tissue fragments can be removed with the wire loop under direct visualization.</p><p>In the event of heavy perioperative bleeding, the endometrium should be reinspected with the hysteroscope. Small areas of bleeding can be desiccated with the resectoscope using coagulating current. When using a monopolar system, set the coagulating current at 60 to 80 watts.

Adenomyosis is defined as the presence of ectopic stroma and glandular tissue in the myometrium and thickened junctional zone on imaging. The diagnosis is made histologically with biopsy. MRI of the pelvis, two-dimensional and three-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound, and, on occasion, hysteroscopy can be used to identify adenomyosis. During operative hysteroscopy, glandlike openings may be seen and appear as multiple small pits in the endometrium, best identified during the early proliferative phase. The endometrium may appear irregular with superficial gland openings; irregular and spongy texture of the subendometrium is noted, and, unlike a leiomyoma, no pseudocapsule is identified and the tissue appears spongy and soft. Additionally, visually altered vascularity and intramural cystic hemorrhage (appears with a dark blue hue) can be noted. Most adenomyosis occurs on the posterior wall. When a hysteroscopic loop is used, the surgeon can obtain an endomyometrial biopsy by extending the wire loop and obtaining a long strip of myometrium. This tissue would include the endometrium and superficial myometrium, thereby facilitating a histologic diagnosis of superficial adenomyosis.

Initially, the inactive electrode is used to elevate the leiomyoma out of the pseudocapsule, followed by using the activated electrode to incise the myoma and facilitate its retrieval. Another technique is to use the inactive loop to partially enucleate the fibroid with mechanical dissection and then deflate the uterine cavity to cause further protrusion of the myoma (see <a class="local">'Use of uterine contractions'</a> below).

The most common reason for excessive bleeding is uterine perforation when the uterus is sounded and is seen immediately at the beginning of the procedure. Perforation may also occur during resection. Heavy bleeding may also occur if the resection involves deep myometrial blood vessels. Cervical laceration from the cervical tenaculum can also lead to increased bleeding. If this occurs, placement of a figure-of-eight suture may be all that is required.

Evaluation and management of uterine perforation is discussed in detail separately.

A single-tooth tenaculum is placed on the anterior lip of the cervix as the mechanical dilation of the cervix at the beginning of the procedure. If the tenaculum pulled off and/or if the tenaculum had to be replaced multiple times, it is important to look for cervical laceration. Cervical laceration is an uncommon complication; in our experience, this occurs in approximately 1 percent of procedures. Factors that are associated with an increased risk of cervical laceration include difficult cervical dilation (eg, due to cervical stenosis), a cervix that is flush with the vaginal vault, a small loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) was required due to marked cervical stenosis (a mini-shallow LEEP was performed at the time of hysteroscopy to resect the stenotic external os), or postmenopausal or postpartum status. If a cervical laceration is noted, it is repaired with a figure-of-eight or running and locked suture. A very curved suture (eg, a UR-6 needle) is ideal for cervical repairs.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Apply intrauterine pressure</strong> – Intrauterine pressure may be applied using a bladder (Foley) catheter balloon place inside the uterine cavity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Care should be taken to evaluate the uterine size and compliance to estimate the amount of fluid that should be instilled into the balloon. Excessive inflation may result in postoperative pain or uterine rupture. For this reason, the Bakri balloon should <strong>not</strong> be used for intrauterine tamponade in cases of heavy bleeding that occurs during hysteroscopic surgery. The Bakri balloon is too large and may cause uterine rupture if inflated too much; it is intended only for obstetric hemorrhage.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The uterine cavity normally sounds to 8 cm and holds approximately 8 mL of fluid. Preoperative bimanual examination, hysteroscopic visualization of the uterine cavity, and gentle sounding of the cavity will aid in determining the uterine size.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Overall uterine size can be evaluated with bimanual examination, but in some cases the overall size may not correspond to the size of the cavity. There are several factors to consider: Does the patient have a 10 cm exophytic pedunculated fibroid that is attached to a normal size uterus? If so, the uterine cavity will be normal size, yet on bimanual examination, the uterine size is large. Does the patient have multiple intramural fibroids that make the uterus enlarged? Does the patient have a 10 cm intracavitary fibroid that grossly enlarges the uterus? Hysteroscopic visualization of the endometrium is useful in determining the volume of the cavity and presence of myomas within the cavity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The ability to instill fluid for hysteroscopy gives a sense of the uterine distensibility. A surgeon may note that higher intrauterine pressure is required to maintain uterine distention when the uterus has multiple uterine fibroids. Factors that decrease compliance, in our experience, include gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/z/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a>, prior endometrial ablation, multiple intramural fibroids greater than 4 cm, and adenomyosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The bladder catheter is inserted through the cervix and into the uterine cavity. We use a size 16 French catheter with a 3 to 30 mL balloon. Inflate the balloon with sterile water until mild resistance is encountered. There is a subtle tactile feeling when it becomes more difficult to distend the balloon; recognizing this feeling is achieved with experience with intrauterine procedures. The amount of fluid instilled into the balloon should be recorded in the operative note. If the patient complains of lower pelvic pain after emerging from anesthesia, the balloon should be deflated until tolerated by the patient.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">After inflation, the catheter bag should be monitored for volume of blood drainage. In our practice, we generally leave the intrauterine catheter in place four to eight hours; however, surgeons must individualize the care of each patient. To remove the catheter, it should be deflated over several hours and blood loss monitored. The balloon can be reinflated if increased bleeding occurs. With the balloon removed, if bleeding is minimal, the patient can be discharged from the surgical unit.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In terms of efficacy, in one series of 216 resectoscope procedures, four patients (1.9 percent) developed postoperative uterine bleeding and were successfully treated with this procedure [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10039" href="/z/d/drug information/10039.html" rel="external">Vasopressin</a> – If the patient continues to bleed briskly with the intrauterine balloon in place, we administer an intracervical injection of vasopressin (eg, 10 units in 100 mL of normal <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a>, injected into the cervical stroma in 5 mL aliquots at the 10, 2, 5, and 8 o'clock positions around the ectocervix).
