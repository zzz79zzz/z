Determining the underlying cause of an irregular rhythm is important as it may be a life-threatening or serious condition. In most cases, the cause of an irregular heart rhythm is identified by an in-depth history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (ECG), which can be completed by the primary clinician. In some cases, referral to a pediatric cardiologist is required for further diagnostic workup and, if necessary, treatment.</p><p>The etiology and evaluation of an irregular heart rhythm in children will be reviewed here. Tachycardia and bradycardia in children and the approach to the child with palpitations are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6435.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with tachycardia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5759.html" rel="external">"Bradycardia in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6436.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with palpitations"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">TYPES OF IRREGULAR HEART RHYTHM</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Asymptomatic child</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An irregular heart rhythm may be detected in an asymptomatic child during a routine physical examination or evaluation for some other issue. In this setting, the most common rhythm irregularities include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sinus arrhythmia  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef78161" href="/z/d/graphic/78161.html" rel="external">waveform 1</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ventricular premature beats (VPBs)  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef57511" href="/z/d/graphic/57511.html" rel="external">waveform 2</a>), bigeminy  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef51529" href="/z/d/graphic/51529.html" rel="external">waveform 3</a>), or trigeminy  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef64181" href="/z/d/graphic/64181.html" rel="external">waveform 4</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Premature atrial contractions (PACs; also referred to as premature atrial beats, premature supraventricular complex, or premature supraventricular beats)  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef66489" href="/z/d/graphic/66489.html" rel="external">waveform 5</a>)</p><p></p><p>VPBs and PACs are most likely to be noted in asymptomatic children, though they can also occur in symptomatic children.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">Sinus arrhythmia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Sinus arrhythmia is a normal physiologic variant characterized by an increased heart rate during inspiration and a decreased heart rate during expiration  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef78161" href="/z/d/graphic/78161.html" rel="external">waveform 1</a>). Rhythm variability is caused, in part, by changes in parasympathetic input to the heart, which is mediated by the vagus nerve. Vagal tone, in turn, is modulated by the respiratory cycle. During expiration, enhanced vagal tone lowers the heart rate, and, during inspiration, vagal withdrawal increases the heart rate. Sinus arrhythmia is abolished during active exercise because vagal tone is decreased and the sympathetic tone is increased, resulting in a rapid heart rate throughout the respiratory cycle.</p><p>Sinus arrhythmia is a benign condition, even in individuals (eg, physically trained athletes) in whom this vagal/respiratory heart rate pattern is markedly pronounced. The diagnosis is made by electrocardiogram (ECG). (See <a class="local">'Electrocardiogram'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Ventricular premature beats</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>VPBs, also referred to as premature ventricular contractions, are premature depolarizations of the ventricles leading to early systolic contraction of the ventricles  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef57511" href="/z/d/graphic/57511.html" rel="external">waveform 2</a>). VPBs are usually followed by a pause and occur without regularity, resulting in an irregular heart rhythm. VPBs also may, on occasion, occur in an irregular pattern (eg, every other beat [bigeminy]  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef51529" href="/z/d/graphic/51529.html" rel="external">waveform 3</a>) or every third beat [trigeminy]  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef64181" href="/z/d/graphic/64181.html" rel="external">waveform 4</a>)).</p><p>In an asymptomatic healthy child, VPBs that occur in isolation are generally benign and produce few or no symptoms. VPBs commonly occur in infancy, decline in incidence in early childhood, and become increasingly common again in adolescence and adulthood.</p><p>VPBs rarely cause true hemodynamic compromise, except in patients with frequent VPBs and severely depressed left ventricular function or when they are concurrent with bradycardia. In these patients, VPBs may be associated with an increased risk of a malignant arrhythmia, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). Frequent or polymorphic VPBs also may be a harbinger of a more malignant arrhythmia, such as catecholaminergic polymorphic VT and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5786.html" rel="external">"Causes of wide QRS complex tachycardia in children", section on 'Ventricular tachycardia'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical significance and evaluation of VPBs are discussed separately.

These electrical impulses result in early systolic ventricular contraction  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef66489" href="/z/d/graphic/66489.html" rel="external">waveform 5</a>). Although PACs occur most commonly in isolation in infants and young children, they can occur throughout childhood. In asymptomatic children, PACs are benign and are unlikely to be associated with sustained tachyarrhythmias.

Common clinical manifestations of reentrant SVT are palpitations, chest pain, fatigue, and lightheadedness. Infants may manifest with pallor, fussiness, irritability, poor feeding, and/or cyanosis. Most children tolerate short episodes of tachycardia well. However, prolonged episodes can precipitate heart failure.</p><p>Certain forms of SVT, such as AV reentrant tachycardia, may be associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef76226" href="/z/d/graphic/76226.html" rel="external">waveform 11</a>).

An accurate description may be useful in identifying the underlying arrhythmia. For example, palpitations due to sinus tachycardia usually have a gradual onset and termination and are associated with anxiety or activity. In contrast, patients with reentrant tachyarrhythmia typically have a sudden onset and ending of palpitations that correlate with the opening and closing of the circuit responsible for the arrhythmia.

In particular, transtelephonic monitoring is most useful in trying to determine whether SVT or VT is present. Transtelephonic monitor provides a rhythm recording, which can either be stored or transmitted by telephone to a health care provider. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/958.html" rel="external">"Ambulatory ECG monitoring", section on 'Event (loop) monitor'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">There are three basic types of transtelephonic monitors:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Activation by the patient – The event monitor is activated by the patient at the onset of symptoms.

However, not all have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The rhythm recordings from these devices are generally limited to a single lead (usually limb lead I or inverted I). In addition, they afford limited recording time, usually missing the onset or termination of an abnormal rhythm. While these limitations usually do not preclude identification of atrial fibrillation or common forms of SVT, they may be less reliable for identifying uncommon forms of arrhythmia. As technology advances and arrhythmia detection algorithms further improve, these smartwatch monitors may prove to be a valuable tool for identifying and managing patients with arrhythmia. Data on how to best integrate such devices into optimal arrhythmia management are limited.

In contrast, patients in whom the ECG findings of WPW syndrome persist during exercise may still be at risk for sudden death and require further assessment with electrophysiology study (EPS)  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71674" href="/z/d/graphic/71674.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).

However, if ventricular ectopy worsens and the patient develops nonsustained or sustained VT, further invasive evaluation and management (ie, EPS) are required. If VPBs remain and there is no complex ectopy, the result of the exercise testing is equivocal.
