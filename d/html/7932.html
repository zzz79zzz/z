HTRs can range in severity from instantaneous, massive, intravascular hemolysis that may cause disseminated intravascular coagulation, shock, kidney failure, and death, to mild, clinically inapparent hemolysis weeks after the transfusion or an isolated serologic change. The main determinants of severity and timing are the specific RBC antigens targeted and the nature of the alloantibodies (IgG versus IgM, sub-class of IgG, ability of the antibody to bind complement) as well as their strength (titer).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H776999573"><span class="h2">Mechanism of RBC destruction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute HTRs (AHTRs) are classically due to ABO incompatibility, most often the result of clerical or procedural error [<a href="#rid7">7-12</a>]. Pathologically, HTRs are associated with accelerated destruction of RBCs. In the most common situation, transfusion of RBCs leads to hemolysis of the transfused cells by the recipient's immune response against an allogeneic RBC antigen that is foreign to the recipient.</p><p>Less commonly, transfusion of plasma-containing antibodies directed against a recipient's RBC antigen leads to hemolysis of the recipient's RBCs. This is less common and less severe, primarily because the incompatible donor plasma is instantly diluted upon transfusion, reducing the titer of the transfused antibodies. </p><p>The first event in a typical AHTR involves binding of recipient antibodies to antigens on the transfused RBCs  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111852" href="/d/graphic/111852.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). This requires that the recipient has previously been exposed to the implicated antigen (or a cross-reacting antigen) and has generated antibodies capable of opsonizing the RBCs.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Type O, A, and B individuals undergo constant stimulation to produce antibodies that react with the antigens that they lack (A and B antigens on type A, B, or AB cells), due to exposure to intestinal microorganisms that are similar enough to A and B to elicit molecular mimicry. These naturally occurring anti-A and anti-B antibodies in type O recipients are typically of the IgM class, but they also can include IgG. In the case of ABO incompatibility, these IgM antibodies can rapidly fix complement and can cause massive, immediate, intravascular hemolysis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7924.html" rel="external">"Red blood cell antigens and antibodies", section on 'ABO blood group system'</a> and <a class="local">'Site of RBC destruction (intravascular or extravascular)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">On occasion, an AHTR may occur when an individual with blood group A, B, or AB is transfused with a blood product (eg, plasma, apheresis platelets) containing a high titer of ABO alloantibodies (high titer anti-A given to an A or AB recipient, or high titer anti-B given to a B or AB recipient) [<a href="#rid13">13-15</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Antibodies to most other RBC antigens such as Kidd, Kelly, or Duffy are elicited by prior transfusion or other forms of exposure to allogeneic RBCs such as pregnancy or sharing of intravenous needles. Only a small amount of exposure (&lt;1 mL of blood) is required to elicit an antibody response, although this can be variable.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>These antibodies may persist in the circulation at high enough levels to cause immediate hemolysis when they encounter the antigen, leading to an AHTR. (See <a class="local">'Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In some cases, the titer of antibodies may decline to undetectable levels, and re-exposure to the antigen will cause an anamnestic response over the ensuing several days, leading to a delayed HTR (DHTR). (See <a class="local">'Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions and delayed serologic transfusion reactions'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The abundance of the antigen on the RBC surface also influences the severity of the reaction. Antigen density varies significantly for different RBC antigens. As an example, ABO antigens are present at approximately 200,000 to 800,000 per cell, while Kell antigens are present at approximately 3000 to 6000 per cell, a 100-fold difference [<a href="#rid3">3,16-18</a>]. RBC antigens and their capacity for eliciting HTRs are discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7924.html" rel="external">"Red blood cell antigens and antibodies"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In some cases, binding of the alloantibodies to the RBCs is accompanied by binding of complement components such as C3b, with resulting activation of the complement cascade. Antibodies and complement proteins can both act as opsonins and can both facilitate phagocytosis and destruction of the foreign cells by macrophages. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3964.html" rel="external">"IgG subclasses: Physical properties, genetics, and biologic functions"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3968.html" rel="external">"Complement pathways"</a>.)</p><p>In addition to promoting phagocytosis, macrophage activation also leads to production of proinflammatory cytokines that can elicit a systemic response, including fever, chills, abdominal or flank pain, and other nonspecific symptoms  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111852" href="/d/graphic/111852.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation of AHTR'</a> below and <a class="local">'Clinical presentation of DHTRs and DSTRs'</a> below.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2336496090"><span class="h2">Site of RBC destruction (intravascular or extravascular)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lysis of RBCs can occur intravascularly (within the circulation) or extravascularly (within the reticuloendothelial system). The principal determinants of the site of RBC destruction are the antibody concentration on the RBC surface and whether the antibody (especially if IgG) is able to fix complement, leading to formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which causes the RBCs to lyse osmotically in the circulation  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111905" href="/d/graphic/111905.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). The abundance of splenic/hepatic macrophages and their state of activation may also play a role.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intravascular hemolysis</strong> – Intravascular hemolysis occurs when the antibody against the RBC antigen is capable of binding and activating complement. The terminal, lytic phase of complement activation, involving components C5 to C9 (the MAC), creates multiple holes in the RBC membrane that lead to lysis. The lysis occurs in the circulation, leading to release of free hemoglobin, which in turn can contribute to shock with hypotension, nephrotoxicity with oliguric kidney failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with bleeding and/or thrombosis. Intravascular hemolysis is more acute, severe, and potentially life-threatening than extravascular hemolysis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Extravascular hemolysis</strong> – Extravascular hemolysis occurs when the antibody against the RBC antigen opsonizes the RBCs. This leads to their sequestration and phagocytosis by macrophages and other phagocytes of the reticuloendothelial system, highly concentrated in the liver and spleen. The complete destruction of the antibody-coated RBC may take several passes through the macrophage system, with bits of membrane being removed with each pass and the annealing of the remaining membrane resulting in its becoming an osmotically fragile spherocyte or microspherocyte prior to its removal from circulation. Hemoglobin is released intracellularly into the macrophages, bound to ferritin, and stored. Clinical manifestations of extravascular hemolysis are generally milder, often marked only by low grade fever and hyperbilirubinemia, though there is the potential for severe hemolysis and/or kidney failure.</p><p></p><p>In many cases, RBC lysis is not purely intravascular or extravascular, especially when the formation of the MAC is partially inhibited and/or when the reticuloendothelial system becomes overwhelmed. Additional information about the different complement pathways and associated proteins is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3968.html" rel="external">"Complement pathways"</a>.)</p><p>There are major clinical implications of the site (or principal site) of RBC lysis. Both lead to a drop in hemoglobin (or lack of the expected rise with transfusion) and laboratory markers of hemolysis such as increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), increased indirect bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin. Intravascular lysis can also lead to diffuse pain, acute kidney failure, and DIC. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation of AHTR'</a> below.)</p><p>Assessment of the site of RBC destruction and key features of management of intravascular hemolysis related to transfusion are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation and immediate management of AHTR'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2288695248"><span class="h2">Timing of hemolysis (acute or delayed)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As with other transfusion reactions, HTRs can be classified as acute or delayed based on how soon after transfusion they occur [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Acute reactions are those that occur during the transfusion or within 24 hours after the transfusion has been administered. Delayed reactions are those that occur more than one day following completion of the transfusion. DHTRs typically occur one to two weeks following transfusion.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>AHTR</strong> – AHTRs typically occur early during the transfusion, after administration of as little as a few mL of incompatible blood due to ABO incompatibility. In AHTRs, the temporal relationship to the transfusion is clear, but it may initially be challenging to determine what type of reaction is occurring (eg, febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction, septic transfusion reaction) since there is substantial overlap in presentations.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>DHTR</strong> – DHTRs can occur one to two weeks, and as many as four weeks following transfusion. For hospitalized patients, this is often after the patient has left the hospital and is no longer having frequent laboratory monitoring. In DHTRs that are apparent, anemia and hemolysis are often obvious, but it may be challenging to determine whether or not the transfusion is responsible.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Delayed Serologic Transfusion Reaction (DSTR)</strong> – DSTRs occur with the same timing as DHTRs. However, individuals with a DSTR are completely asymptomatic and lack laboratory evidence of hemolysis. A DSTR is not diagnosed until an alloantibody is identified serologically on a subsequent type and screen sample [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1336727325"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prevalence of acute HTRs (AHTRs) has been estimated at approximately 1 in 70,000 per blood product transfused [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Overall, the rate of AHTRs and delayed HTRs has decreased [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study from the Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) reporting system in the United Kingdom found that from 2016 to 2022, there were 24 ABO-incompatible transfusions, with approximately 1.6 million RBC units transfused annually [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. While ABO-incompatible RBC transfusions have been decreasing over the last 25 years, SHOT estimated that between 2016 and 2022, there were 2118 ABO-incompatible near miss events (wrong blood in tube during type and crossmatch sample collection). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Between 2012 and 2021, the number of fatal hemolytic transfusion reactions reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been stable [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. In 2021, there were five reported fatal ABO-incompatible hemolytic transfusion reactions, of which four were attributed to error. As there were 10.8 million whole blood and RBC units transfused in the United States, the estimated fatality rate was approximately 1 per 2 million units transfused in 2021. </p><p></p><p>The prevalence of DHTRs and DSTRs are likely to be underestimated since symptoms are usually mild or absent; frequency estimates range from approximately 1:800 to 1:11,000. The large range exists because some studies reporting DHTRs also include DSTRs. Overall, the rates of DHTRs and DSTRs have been decreasing as more sensitive RBC antibody screening assays have become available and have prevented exposure to allogeneic RBC antigens [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis of DHTR or DSTR'</a> below.)</p><p>HTRs occur most often after transfusion of RBCs, but they can also occur after transfusion of other products (eg, Fresh Frozen Plasma, platelets, granulocytes) because RBCs or anti-RBC antibodies may be present in these products [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Mechanism of RBC destruction'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H354742"><span class="h1">ACUTE HEMOLYTIC TRANSFUSION REACTIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute HTR (AHTR) refers to transfusion-associated hemolysis that occurs during the transfusion or within the first 24 hours after transfusion. AHTR is a medical emergency that <strong>requires immediate cessation of the transfusion</strong>, as well as immediate evaluation and interventions to reduce the risks of serious organ damage to the patient and other potentially affected patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/95132.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with a suspected acute transfusion reaction", section on 'Immediate actions (all patients)'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H354773"><span class="h2">Clinical presentation of AHTR</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The presentation of AHTR depends on the type of incompatibility, blood product, and volume transfused; together these determine the degree of hemolysis.

Because of the increased sensitivity of the recipient's RBCs to complement, any antigen-antibody reaction capable of activating complement (donor RBC-recipient antibody; donor WBC-recipient antibody; recipient RBC-donor antibody) can trigger hemolysis in a recently transfused patient with PNH. Various methods to reduce this effect have been used, including washing RBCs to remove donor plasma and leukoreduction to remove donor WBCs, but none are supported by high quality evidence.

If the DHTR has been ongoing, the reticulocyte count may be correspondingly increased in patients with a normally functioning bone marrow. In addition to laboratory findings of immune hemolysis, the peripheral blood smear may show spherocytes or microspherocytes, and urinalysis may show urinary hemosiderin.</p><p>A DHTR may less commonly present with intravascular hemolysis and associated findings, similar in quality but often less severe in degree compared with intravascular hemolysis during an AHTR. This situation is generally indicative of an acquired alloantibody to an antigen in the Kidd (Jk) blood group system, as these antibodies (though IgG) can be capable of binding complement, which is necessary for causing intravascular hemolysis, or, in individuals with SCD, due to bystander hemolysis or hyperhemolysis. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation of AHTR'</a> above.)</p><p>Hyperhemolysis (also referred to as hyperhemolytic crisis) is an extremely rare type of DHTR in which hemolysis of transfused RBCs is accompanied by hemolysis of the patient's own RBCs. This phenomenon is often clinically severe and has been seen most often in multiply-transfused patients with SCD, but it has also been reported in patients with thalassemia and in other settings [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Treatment with intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) and glucocorticoids has been reported to be successful in some cases, as discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7119.html" rel="external">"Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease", section on 'Hyperhemolytic crisis'</a>.)</p><p>When a new alloantibody is identified and there is no evidence of hemolysis, the diagnosis of DSTR is often made by the blood bank when more blood is ordered. This provides the rationale for repeating pretransfusion testing in an individual who has recently received a transfusion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7953.html" rel="external">"Pretransfusion testing for red blood cell transfusion"</a>.)</p><p>If an asymptomatic, recently transfused patient is found to have either a new positive DAT or antibody screen, a thorough evaluation is indicated to enable the clinician to distinguish between a DHTR and a DSTR. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis of DHTR or DSTR'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1775055248"><span class="h2">Evaluation of DHTR and DSTR</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial evaluation of a suspected DHTR involves review of the transfusion history and laboratory testing for hemolysis, including a complete blood count (CBC) with reticulocyte count, indirect bilirubin, antiglobulin (Coombs) testing (both direct and indirect), and antibody identification if indicated. If the hemolysis appears brisk, based on falling hemoglobin and rising indirect bilirubin levels, an LDH or serum haptoglobin may be confirmatory. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5932.html" rel="external">"Overview of hemolytic anemias in children", section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7076.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of hemolytic anemia in adults", section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a>.)</p><p>It is important to have an antibody screen performed by the transfusion service or the hospital blood bank, because prevention of future reactions depends on the blood bank identifying and permanently recording the specific RBC antigen to which the patient has become sensitized in the patient's record. It is also helpful for the blood bank or transfusion service to give the patient written or electronic documentation about the implicated antigen in case the patient is seen at a different facility that does not have direct access to the information.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2537147499"><span class="h2">Differential diagnosis of DHTR or DSTR</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other possible diagnoses to consider in a patient with a suspected DHTR include other causes of anemia unrelated to the transfusion, other causes of fever and jaundice, and a RBC alloantibody without hemolysis.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anemia</strong> – Other causes of anemia are numerous, and include iron deficiency, bleeding, anemia of chronic disease, hemolysis, bone marrow disorders, and inherited anemias. At least one of these is likely to be responsible for the original need for transfusion. Like DHTR, these may be apparent following transfusion; some may be associated with laboratory evidence of hemolysis; and some may be characterized by a positive antiglobulin (Coombs) test. Unlike DHTR, these anemias are not caused by alloantibodies. The evaluation of unexplained anemia is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5927.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with anemia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7133.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to anemia in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fever/Jaundice</strong> – Other causes of fever and jaundice in a patient who has received a transfusion more than 24 hours prior to the onset of these symptoms include infections and other complications. Like DHTR, these reactions may require a high index of suspicion and a more thorough evaluation. Unlike DHTR, these reactions are not associated with alloimmune hemolysis. Possible causes are presented in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69959" href="/d/graphic/69959.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) and in separate topic reviews. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2886.html" rel="external">"Fever in the surgical patient"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3615.html" rel="external">"Classification and causes of jaundice or asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H354826"><span class="h2">Management of DHTR and DSTR</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For individuals with a DHTR, the hemoglobin level should be monitored until it is clear that hemolysis has ended. The frequency of monitoring is determined by the severity of hemolysis. DSTRs are only identified in retrospect, so hemoglobin monitoring does not apply.</p><p>No specific interventions are required for a DHTR in the absence of brisk hemolysis, as defined by a falling hemoglobin, rising bilirubin, absent serum haptoglobin, and/or the presence of evidence of intravascular hemolysis (hemoglobinuria), although symptomatic treatment may be helpful (eg, with antipyretics) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. If there is ongoing hemolysis, it would be prudent to consult the hematology service and consider giving a glucocorticoid, intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> (IVIG), or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a>. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation of DHTR and DSTR'</a> above.)</p><p>Kidney failure can occur in the setting of brisk hemolysis; thus, prophylactic measures to protect kidney function should be used until it is clear that the hemolysis has ended, as indicated by the stability of the hemoglobin level. These measures include hydration (if not contraindicated) with close monitoring of urinary output.</p><p>For both DHTR and DSTR, it is critical to avoid future transfusions containing the implicated RBC antigen. It is therefore important to perform the evaluation, document the alloantibody, and inform the patient and caregivers of the importance of avoiding the antigen in future transfusions. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation of DHTR and DSTR'</a> above and <a class="local">'Prevention'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1689949162"><span class="h1">PREVENTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some HTRs are preventable, including those due to misidentification of the patient or blood product due to clerical error. Others may be impossible to prevent, such as those due to a low level or weak alloantibody that does not reach the limits of detection on pretransfusion testing. Antibodies to allogeneic RBC antigens may have developed during exposures of which the patient was not aware, such as exposure to a paternal red blood cell (RBC) antigen during pregnancy.</p><p>For the 1990 report on deaths due to HTRs, the authors concluded that "wherever errors could be made, errors occurred" and "human errors occur at an irreducibly small rate despite our best efforts (to prevent them)" [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. A multicenter study evaluating 331 type and screen sample collection errors leading to wrong blood in tube (WBIT) found that 50 percent were due to the wrong label being applied to the type and screen blood draw tube, and 48 percent were due to blood being drawn from the wrong patient [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Most of these WBIT events were due to a combination of protocol violations and lapses. WBIT errors dramatically increase the risk of AHTRs due to ABO incompatible transfusion. </p><p>Systematic procedures to minimize the likelihood of an HTR should be incorporated into standard institutional policies and operating procedures [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>].

The main determinants of severity, site of hemolysis (intravascular or extravascular)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111905" href="/d/graphic/111905.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>), and timing are the specific RBC antigens and the nature and titer of alloantibodies present at the time of transfusion. (See <a class="local">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevalence</strong> – ABO incompatible acute HTRs (AHTRs) are rare and getting rarer, but fatal reactions continue to happen, on the order of 1 event per 2 million transfusions. ABO incompatible AHTRs are most often due to clerical error. HTRs are most common with RBC transfusion but can also occur with plasma-containing products. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>AHTRs</strong> – AHTRs occur during or within 24 hours of completing the transfusion. An AHTR is a medical emergency that requires immediate cessation of the transfusion if still in progress, as well as immediate evaluation and interventions to reduce the risks of serious organ damage to the patient and other potentially affected patients. (See <a class="local">'Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Immediate actions</strong> – The most common presentation of AHTR is immediately upon RBC transfusion with ABO blood group incompatibility. The initial steps include <strong>immediately stopping the transfusion</strong>, providing hemodynamic support, and contacting the transfusion service to help with the evaluation  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96323" href="/d/graphic/96323.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Immediate goals are to determine if hemolysis has occurred, to distinguish among possible causes, and to stabilize the patient. The untransfused blood and tubing should not be discarded.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Additional testing</strong> – Laboratory testing for AHTR includes repeat ABO compatibility testing and in some cases additional antibody testing; inspection of the serum and urine for pink color due to free hemoglobin; testing for hemolysis (haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], and bilirubin levels); and direct and indirect antiglobulin (Coombs) testing. Some individuals may require testing for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hyperkalemia, and kidney impairment, and nephrologist and/or hematologist consultation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> – The differential diagnosis of AHTR includes other acute transfusion reactions and other causes of hemolysis, either caused by, exacerbated by, or unrelated to the transfusion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs)</strong> – DHTRs occur &gt;24 hours after the transfusion, typically due to an anamnestic response to a previously encountered foreign RBC antigen (through pregnancy, prior transfusion, solid organ, or hematopoietic cell transplantation), especially those of the Kell or Rh system. DHTR symptoms are often mild. If a DHTR is suspected, it is important to have an evaluation for RBC alloantibodies performed in the blood bank. No specific interventions are required for a DHTR in the absence of brisk hemolysis, but monitoring of the hemoglobin (and occasionally other parameters) may be appropriate. (See <a class="local">'Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions and delayed serologic transfusion reactions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Delayed serologic transfusion reactions (DSTRs)</strong> – DSTRs are identical to DHTRs, but the patients are asymptomatic. DSTRs are diagnosed when the transfusion service laboratory detects a new clinically significant antibody on subsequent sample testing by either a positive DAT or a positive antibody screen. (See <a class="local">'Definitions (DHTR versus DSTR)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevention</strong> – Systematic procedures to minimize the likelihood of an HTR should be incorporated into standard institutional policies and operating procedures.
