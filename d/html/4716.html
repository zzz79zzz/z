The earliest classification schemes for hematologic malignancies were based on tissue architecture and cytologic appearance, but beginning in the 1990s, newer schemes increasingly incorporated immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and genetic findings. Contemporary classification schemes of hematopoietic neoplasms are based on cellular lineage (according to immunophenotype), clinical attributes (eg, acute versus chronic, cytopenias/cytoses), and genetic features (eg, gene fusions, rearrangements, mutations).</p><p>Beginning with the third World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Hematologic Malignancies in 2001, successive editions of the WHO classification scheme have been used by consensus among pathologists. However, in 2022, in addition to publication of a newly revised WHO fascicle, another classification scheme was published. Despite some differences, both schemes incorporate additional genetic findings, and it is likely that most pathologists will provide diagnoses using both of the following new schemes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>International Consensus Classification (ICC)</strong> [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>World Health Organization 5</strong><strong><sup>th</sup></strong><strong> edition (WHO5)</strong> [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]</p><p></p><p>This topic compares the ICC and WHO5 classification schemes with each other. Earlier nosologic schemes are included in the discussion to enable interpretation of data in the older literature and for care of patients previously treated for conditions with now-outdated names. </p><p>Details of classification, pathogenesis, evaluation, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of specific disease entities are presented separately.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Classification schemes for hematologic malignancies continue to evolve with greater insight into pathologic features, pathophysiology, management, and outcomes. Two distinct classification schemes for hematopoietic neoplasms were published in 2022: the International Consensus Classification (ICC) [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>] and the World Health Organization 5<sup>th</sup> edition (WHO5) [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. We favor use of these new schemes, rather than the WHO revised 4<sup>th</sup> edition (WHO4R) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>] and earlier nosologic schemes. Because the two schemes are not entirely aligned, for the foreseeable future, classification of hematologic neoplasms according to both schemes is preferable to using one or the other classification alone. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1038008778"><span class="h2">International Consensus Classification (ICC)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ICC was created under the auspices of the United States-based Society for Hematopathology (SH) and the European Association for Haematopathology (EAHP), with input from clinical advisory committees (CACs), which included pathologists, hematologists, oncologists, geneticists, and bioinformaticians. Many of the contributors to ICC participated in WHO4R, but they objected when a proposed WHO 5<sup>th</sup> edition did not include involvement by SH, EAHP, and CACs. ICC is not affiliated with the WHO.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2254778115"><span class="h2">World Health Organization 5th edition (WHO5)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>WHO5 is a successor to earlier editions of the WHO classification scheme (so-called "blue book" monographs) that were prepared under the aegis of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Rather than seek input from CACs, WHO5 created subject content by directly engaging multidisciplinary author teams that included hematopathologists, hematologists, oncologists, geneticists, epidemiologists, molecular biologists, and others. As described above, because of the schism in hematopathology, the WHO5 was produced without input from SH, EAHP, and CACs. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1110007738"><span class="h2">Previous classification schemes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The earliest classification systems were primarily based on tissue architecture and histologic appearance.

In addition, there are differences throughout both schemes in naming otherwise identical entities and in diagnostic criteria for particular neoplasms [<a href="#rid1">1-4,14</a>]. Similarities and differences between the ICC and the WHO5 schemes are described under the following broad categories:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Myeloid neoplasms</strong> – Include myeloproliferative neoplasms (such as chronic myeloid leukemia), acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic neoplasms/syndromes, and other myeloid disorders.

We use the abbreviation "MDS" for these disorders in both ICC and WHO5. (See <a class="local">'Myelodysplastic neoplasms/syndromes (MDS)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Acute myeloid leukemias (AML)</strong> – (See <a class="local">'Acute myeloid leukemia'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) </strong>– (See <a class="local">'MDS/MPN syndromes'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differences</strong> – ICC [<a href="#rid1">1</a>] and WHO5 [<a href="#rid3">3</a>] differ in how they incorporate particular cytogenetic/genetic findings, group certain distinctive myeloid malignancies, and distinguish between AML and MDS with increased blasts. They also differ in how they describe phases of CML; classify cases with mutated <em>TP53</em>; and address neoplasms that arise during disease evolution, following cytotoxic treatment, or that are associated with germline pathogenic gene variants. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Key differences in classification of myeloid disorders between ICC and WHO5 include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Distinction between MDS and AML</strong> – Emerging data suggest that the biology and treatment response of MDS with high blast counts (ie, 10 to 19 percent) represent a continuum with AML. ICC recognizes this by creating "MDS/AML," a new diagnostic category for such myeloid neoplasms. While WHO5 retains the name "MDS with increased blasts-2" for these neoplasms, it acknowledges that this category "may be regarded as AML-equivalent for therapeutic considerations and from a clinical trial design perspective when appropriate." (See <a class="local">'Myelodysplastic neoplasms/syndromes (MDS)'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Myeloid neoplasms with </strong><strong><em>TP53</em></strong><strong> mutations</strong> – Certain combinations of <em>TP53</em> abnormalities influence prognosis of myeloid neoplasms, independent of the blast count. ICC recognizes this by creating new categories for MDS, MDS/AML, or AML with <em>TP53</em> abnormalities. While the WHO5 does not create specific categories for myeloid malignancies with <em>TP53</em> mutations, the WHO5 monograph acknowledges that MDS with multiple <em>TP53</em> abnormalities may be regarded as being equivalent to AML for treatment purposes. (See <a class="local">'Myeloid neoplasms with mutated TP53'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Disorders associated with</strong> <strong>germline pathogenic gene variants</strong> – Certain germline pathogenic variants are associated with unique biological attributes that maybe seen across all age groups. In response, ICC grouped disorders such as juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) in a new category, "Pediatric and/or germline mutation-associated disorders." These are included in a newly created category ("Secondary myeloid neoplasms") that includes malignancies that arise in the setting of known predisposing factors. The modifier "associated with germline (gene) variant" is used to indicate an association with a germline pathogenic variant. (See <a class="local">'Pediatric and/or germline mutation-associated disorders'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Treatment-related myeloid neoplasms</strong> – Both ICC and WHO5 acknowledge the role of genetics and exposure to prior cytotoxic therapy in determining the biology of myeloid malignancies that arise after exposure to prior cytotoxic therapy. However, to reduce redundancy in describing what might be biologically overlapping entities, ICC uses the diagnostic qualifier, "therapy-related" following the diagnosis of MDS, AML, or MDS/AML. By contrast, WHO5 groups treatment-related myeloid neoplasms in a new category, "Myeloid neoplasms post-cytotoxic therapy"; assignment to this category is based on medical history, rather than the specific disease and/or genetic features. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4506.html" rel="external">"Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms: Epidemiology, causes, evaluation, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>These and other differences in classification of specific disorders are discussed below and in separate topics.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3721761897"><span class="h2">Categories of myeloid neoplasms</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Myeloproliferative neoplasms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>MPNs are clonal stem cell disorders associated with excessive proliferation of one or more myeloid progenitors (eg, granulocytic, erythroid, or megakaryocytic). Hematopoiesis is usually effective and, combined with increased numbers of progenitors, typically leads to an increase in one or more of the cellular elements in peripheral blood. Bone marrow cellularity is usually increased and the percentage of blasts in marrow may be increased, but the blast percentage is always &lt;20 percent. Most MPNs are associated with mutations that cause abnormal activation of pro-growth signaling pathways, leading to growth factor-independent proliferation of marrow progenitor cells.</p><p>The following entities are included in the MPN category by both ICC [<a href="#rid1">1</a>] and WHO5 [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chronic myeloid leukemia</strong> – In CML, excessive proliferation of the granulocytic lineage leads to increases at all stages of myeloid maturation. CML is always associated with a <em>BCR::ABL1</em> fusion gene, which is usually created by a (9;22) chromosomal translocation the leads to formation of a derivative chromosome 22, known as the Philadelphia chromosome, after the city in which it was discovered. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4543.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">ICC and WHO5 include the same diagnostic criteria for CML, but their labels for disease phases of CML differ; ICC describes three phases (ie, chronic phase, accelerated phase, and blast phase), while WHO5 describes two phases (ie, chronic phase, blast phase).  </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Classic </strong><strong><em>BCR::ABL1</em></strong><strong>-negative MPNs</strong> – The following "classic" MPNs lack the <em>BCR::ABL1</em> fusion gene:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Polycythemia vera (PV) </strong>–<strong> </strong>PV presents with an increased hematocrit/red blood cell mass.

Diagnostic criteria are the same in ICC and WHO5. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4517.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polycythemia vera"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Essential thrombocythemia (ET)</strong> – ET is a clonal disorder associated with thrombocytosis. Activating mutations in the gene encoding the non-receptor tyrosine kinase JAK2 are found in about half of cases. Other cases are associated with activating mutations in <em>MPL</em> (which encodes the thrombopoietin receptor [TPO-R]; 5 percent of cases), or in <em>CALR</em> (which encodes a protein, that when mutated, is secreted and binds and activates TPO-R; 25 to 35 percent of cases) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Diagnostic criteria for ET are the same in both systems.

(See <a class="local">'Precursor lymphoid neoplasms'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Mature B cell neoplasms </strong>– Includes "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia," "Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma," monoclonal gammopathies, plasma cell neoplasms, "Follicular lymphoma," "Diffuse large B cell lymphoma," high-grade lymphomas, and others. ICC and WHO5 are largely concordant in subtyping these entities. (See <a class="local">'Mature B cell neoplasms'</a> above.)  </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Hodgkin lymphoma</strong> <strong>(HL)</strong> – Four categories of "Classic HL" and "Nodular lymphocyte predominant HL (NLPHL)" are largely unchanged.

(See <a class="local">'Hodgkin lymphoma (HL)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Mature T cell or NK cell neoplasms </strong>– Includes various cutaneous and systemic T cell and NK cell neoplasms.
