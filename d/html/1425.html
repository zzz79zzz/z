         Bicuspid aortic valve is the most prevalent congenital cardiac abnormality, affecting 1 percent of the population with a 2 to 3:1 male predominance [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. A bicuspid aortic valve may be functionally normal or it may be stenotic and/or regurgitant. Bicuspid aortic valve is the most common cause of congenital aortic stenosis (AS) and the most common cause of isolated aortic regurgitation (AR). Dilation of the ascending aorta is likely to coexist independent of valvular function [
         <a href="#rid2">

         A bicuspid aortic valve is typically detected by echocardiography performed to evaluate the murmur of AS and/or aortic regurgitation (AR) or an ejection click. An isolated, functionally normal bicuspid aortic valve is likely to go unrecognized in women of childbearing age because auscultatory signs are inconspicuous or unrecognized [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Rarely, a bicuspid aortic valve is first identified during pregnancy or postpartum after a patient presents with dissection of the thoracic aorta [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>

        <p>
         All patients with bicuspid aortic valve should undergo preconception transthoracic echocardiography, including assessment for aortic valve dysfunction (AS and AR) and ascending aortic dilation. Evaluation should also include cross-sectional imaging (eg, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) to detect aortic coarctation and assessment for features of Turner syndrome. (See

         Women with bicuspid aortic valve should be counseled prior to and during pregnancy regarding potential risks and their management.

         Bicuspid aortic valve occurs sporadically and as an autosomal dominant inherited disorder with variable penetrance. It may occur as an isolated lesion or associated with other congenital cardiovascular defects or aortopathy syndromes. Large family studies have found the prevalence of bicuspid aortic valve to be approximately 9 to 10 percent in first-degree relatives of the individual with bicuspid aortic valve [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Echocardiographic screening of first-degree relatives is discussed separately. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Fetal ultrasound is recommended when the mother has bicuspid aortic valve since fetal congenital heart disease has been reported in approximately 4 percent of women with congenital AS [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Bicuspid aortic valve is frequently associated with congenital abnormalities of the aorta (eg, coarctation of the aorta and patent ductus arteriosus) [

         For patients with an indication for valve or aortic surgery, preconception (or postpartum) surgery is preferred to surgery during pregnancy because of the fetal risks of surgery. Valve or aortic surgery should be
         <strong>
          avoided
         </strong>
         during pregnancy if possible. The maternal risks are similar to those in nonpregnant women, but cardiopulmonary bypass during pregnancy incurs risks for the fetus. These issues are discussed elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97124.html" rel="external">
          "Pregnancy and valve disease", section on 'Cardiac surgery during pregnancy'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Indications for intervention for AS, aortic regurgitation (AR), and aortic dilation prior to pregnancy are aimed at reducing the risk of maternal and fetal complications during and following pregnancy, including the risk of requiring surgery during pregnancy. These indications are discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Indications for surgery'
         </a>
         below and

         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         If surgery must be performed during pregnancy (eg, for refractory heart failure [HF] caused by severe AS or AR, aortic dissection, or progressive enlargement of the aorta with impending rupture), intervention during the second trimester is recommended to avoid the teratogenic risks of the first trimester and risks of impacting third-trimester delivery. It may be preferable to delay surgery until the fetus is viable.

         Options for intervention depend upon whether the patient with bicuspid aortic valve requires aortic valve intervention only, repair of the aorta only, or combined aortic valve and ascending aorta surgery. These procedure types are discussed separately. (See

         Most patients with bicuspid aortic valve with an indication for valve intervention require valve replacement. Alternatives to aortic valve replacement are available for only selected patients with severe bicuspid AS or AR, as discussed below. For AS, only selected patients are candidates for balloon or surgical aortic valvotomy. For AR, only selected patients are candidates for aortic valve repair. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Aortic stenosis treatment prior to pregnancy'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">
          'Aortic regurgitation treatment prior to pregnancy'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Aortic valve replacement for severe AS is performed by surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), although data on TAVI are more limited in patients with bicuspid aortic valve than in patients with tricuspid valve. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Aortic stenosis treatment prior to pregnancy'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129707.html" rel="external">

         and
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129707.html" rel="external">
          "Bicuspid aortic valve: Intervention for valve disease or aortopathy in adults", section on 'Procedures for aortic stenosis'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Aortic valve replacement for severe AR associated with bicuspid aortic valve is generally performed by SAVR. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Aortic regurgitation treatment prior to pregnancy'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129707.html" rel="external">
          "Bicuspid aortic valve: Intervention for valve disease or aortopathy in adults", section on 'Procedures for aortic regurgitation'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The choices for SAVR are a bioprosthetic valve, a homograft valve, a pulmonary autograft (Ross procedure), and a mechanical valve [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. TAVI involves implantation of a bioprosthetic valve.
        </p>
        <p>
         The long-term utility of implantation of a bioprosthetic aortic valve in women of childbearing age is not well established  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef96336" href="/z/d/graphic/96336.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Although anticoagulation is generally not required for bioprosthetic valves (after the first three to six months), there is a high rate of structural failure, which may exceed 60 percent at 15 years in younger patients. The failure rate may not be as high for newer-generation bioprosthetic valves. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8143.html" rel="external">
          "Choice of prosthetic heart valve for surgical aortic or mitral valve replacement"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Another option that avoids a need for anticoagulation is a Ross procedure that replaces the aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve (pulmonary autograft) and replaces the pulmonary valve with a homograft. The advantage of this procedure is that anticoagulation, with its attendant risks (including fetal risks during pregnancy from vitamin K antagonist [VKA]), is not required. However, cardiovascular complications are common after the Ross procedure, and reoperation/reintervention is often required involving one or both valves. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1342.html" rel="external">
          "Use of anticoagulants during pregnancy and postpartum"
         </a>
         and
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8143.html" rel="external">
          "Choice of prosthetic heart valve for surgical aortic or mitral valve replacement", section on 'Ross procedure'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Limited data are available on outcomes during and following pregnancy in women who have undergone the Ross procedure. In a study of eight women who had 14 pregnancies after Ross procedure, there were no maternal deaths, no thromboembolic or hemorrhagic events, and no evidence of deterioration of valve function [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. A later study included 33 women who had undergone Ross procedure: 11 women with 18 subsequent pregnancies carried to a gestational age &gt;20 weeks and 22 without subsequent pregnancies [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. There was no significant change in autograft diameter after the first pregnancy (mean 3.5 cm prior to 3.7 cm after), but the autograft was significantly dilated after the second (mean 4.3 cm) and third (mean 4.5 cm) pregnancies. However, freedom from combined endpoints (reinterventions, autograft dilation ≥5.0 cm, greater than moderate aortic/autograft regurgitation, and death) was higher in the pregnancy group than in the nonpregnancy group.
        </p>
        <p>
         The least satisfactory option for valve replacement in anticipation of pregnancy is a mechanical prosthesis, which is generally durable but requires life-long anticoagulation. VKA (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">
          warfarin
         </a>
         ) is considered the safest form of anticoagulation for the mother with a mechanical heart valve. However, warfarin crosses the placenta, and the fetus is anticoagulated. Warfarin therapy is associated with a dose-dependent risk of embryopathy (particularly during the first trimester), and later in gestation it increases the risk of fetal bleeding and fetal loss. Heparin does not cross the placenta, and low molecular weight heparin use requires anti-Xa dose adjustment during pregnancy for patients with mechanical valve prostheses and is associated with low fetal risk but higher risk of maternal thromboembolism and mortality than VKA. Management of antithrombotic therapy for a mechanical valve during pregnancy is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8126.html" rel="external">

         Pregnant women with bicuspid aortic valve and aortic dilation are at potential risk of spontaneous aortic dissection, usually in the third trimester or postpartum, especially if there is an associated aortic coarctation [

          5
         </a>
         ]. The predisposition to ascending aortic dissection among patients with bicuspid aortic valve reflects an inherent abnormality of the ascending aortic media [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,13
         </a>
         ]. The development of aortic root and/or ascending aorta enlargement is independent of whether the bicuspid aortic valve is functionally normal, stenotic, or regurgitant. Pregnancy-associated increases in heart rate, blood pressure, and stroke volume result in increased aortic stress, which may promote aortic dilation and/or dissection. It has not been established whether pregnancy also exacerbates intrinsic aortic structural changes. (See

         Among patients with bicuspid aortic valve, aortic dilation is common but limited data suggest that the frequency of aortic dissection during pregnancy is low with contemporary management.

The onset of pregnancy-related dissection in 27 women was 4 in the first trimester, 11 in the third trimester, and 12 postpartum (mean of 12.5 days postpartum). Only 2 of the 29 women had bicuspid aortic valve, both had an ascending (type A) aortic dissection during the third trimester, and in each a bicuspid aortic valve was first diagnosed after presentation with dissection. Aortic dimensions at the time of dissection were reported for one of these patients: 5.2 cm at the sinus of Valsalva and 4.6 cm at the tubular ascending aorta.

         Pre- or postpartum ascending aortic dissection is associated with significant fetal and maternal risk, which has declined with contemporary management. A review of 61 women with pre- or postpartum aortic dissection, including four with bicuspid aortic valve and prepartum ascending aortic dissection, found that aortic root enlargement &gt;4.0 cm and/or an increase in aortic root size during pregnancy were risk factors for type A dissection [

         All patients with bicuspid aortic valve should undergo transthoracic echocardiography to assess the aortic valve and ascending aortic (aortic root and tubular ascending aorta) size and to assess for coarctation [

        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, every pregnant woman with a dilated ascending aorta should undergo echocardiographic measurement of ascending aortic dimensions serially (eg, monthly or every two months if the ascending aorta diameter is ≥4.0 cm; every 12 weeks if the ascending aorta diameter is above normal but &lt;4.0 cm) until the patient is six months postpartum to assess for possible progression of aortopathy [

If the ascending aorta is incompletely visualized by transthoracic echocardiography or there is disease beyond the ascending aorta, additional imaging should be performed to image the aorta. Magnetic resonance imaging is generally preferred during pregnancy to avoid maternal and fetal radiation exposure. While transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is another potential option for thoracic aortic imaging, after 18 weeks of gestation, TEE is associated with an increased risk of aspiration and might require intubation, so TEE is generally not used for routine aortic imaging during pregnancy [

         It is unknown whether pregnancy changes the natural history of bicuspid-related aortic disease as has been shown in a study of women with Marfan syndrome [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. In that study, although the pregnancies were uncomplicated, the prevalence of aortic dissection and elective aortic surgery was higher in women after pregnancy than in a nonpregnant matched cohort. Pregnancy was associated with an increased aortic growth rate, which did not return to baseline after pregnancy. In contrast, an observational study found no impact of pregnancy on the long-term risk of aortic surgery or dissection for both the Marfan and the bicuspid aortic valve patients [

         As noted in the American Association for Thoracic Surgery Consensus guidelines on bicuspid aortic valve-related aortopathy, the aortic size threshold at which pregnancy should be avoided is not known; some have suggested an ascending aorta or aortic root diameter threshold of &gt;4.5 cm, but this is controversial [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>

         This contrasts with recommendations for pregnancy in women with Marfan syndrome from major societies (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and ESC), which suggest avoiding pregnancy in those with enlargement of the aortic root greater than 4.5 cm, since this identifies a particularly high-risk group of individuals with Marfan syndrome.

         Patients with AS with a standard indication for valve intervention (such as symptomatic severe AS regardless of LVEF or asymptomatic severe AS with LVEF &lt;50 percent) should delay conception until the AS has been addressed. Also, we suggest valve intervention prior to pregnancy for patients with asymptomatic severe AS with preserved LVEF. These recommendations are consistent with the 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association valve disease guideline [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. However, some experts do not require valve intervention prior to pregnancy for patients with severe AS with preserved LVEF and confirmed absence of symptoms (including normal exercise test and serum natriuretic peptide level) [

         Most patients with bicuspid aortic valve with severe AS requiring valve intervention require aortic valve replacement; for young patients, surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is generally preferred, as the long-term durability and effects of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are not yet known. Balloon or surgical aortic valvotomy is an alternative option for only selected patients (generally &lt;25 years old) with noncalcified severely stenotic aortic valves and no more than mild aortic regurgitation [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38

        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with a repaired bicuspid aortic valve, the risks associated with pregnancy are lowest when the mean valve gradient is ≤25 mmHg and LV function is normal.

         If a woman with bicuspid AS presents early in pregnancy with severe AS and/or an LVEF below 40 percent, some experts suggest termination of pregnancy followed by reparative surgery before another attempt at pregnancy.

         All patients with bicuspid aortic valve should undergo preconception transthoracic echocardiography to assess valve function and the thoracic aorta. If the thoracic aorta is incompletely visualized by transthoracic echocardiography or there is disease beyond the ascending aorta, additional cross-sectional imaging (magnetic resonance imaging is generally preferred) should be performed to assess aorta size. If the aorta is dilated, we recommend serial (eg, monthly or bimonthly if the ascending aorta diameter is ≥4.0 cm; every 12 weeks if the ascending aorta diameter is above normal but &lt;4.0 cm) echocardiographic imaging during pregnancy and for six months postpartum.

         Surgery during pregnancy should generally be avoided due to significant fetal risks, although it is indicated if there is severe symptomatic aortic valve disease and if a transcatheter approach is not an option. (See

         Controlled vaginal delivery is preferable in the majority of patients. Cesarean delivery is recommended only for obstetric indications or in the presence of severe cardiovascular disease such as aortic dissection, enlarging aortic aneurysm, severe AR, critical AS, or in the setting of therapeutic vitamin K antagonist (eg,
