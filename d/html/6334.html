         Splinting plays a major role in the management of musculoskeletal injuries, including treatment of overuse and soft tissue injuries (eg, tendonitis and sprains), as well as for traumatic injuries like extremity fractures and joint dislocations. Immobilization of the extremity through splinting may serve to decrease pain and bleeding, and prevent further soft tissue, vascular, or neurologic compromise [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-7
         </a>
         ]. Splinting may also provide definitive treatment for some injuries [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8-10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Compared with casts, splints permit swelling and may prevent neurovascular compromise. Timely splinting (as soon as possible after the injury) is recommended in most cases. Close attention to detail and familiarization with proper splinting technique can increase patient comfort and decrease the likelihood of further injury.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, preliminary evidence suggests that many splints are applied incorrectly with the potential for causing unnecessary injury. As an example, in a prospective, observational study that evaluated 275 splints applied for pediatric fractures in emergency departments or urgent care centers, 93 percent were deemed to have been applied incorrectly, with 77 percent of the splints having the application of the elastic bandage directly to the skin, 59 percent noted to have improper positioning, and 52 percent with an inappropriate splint length, most commonly too long and not permitting free range of motion at the metacarpal joint [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Skin or soft tissue complications occurred in 40 percent of patients; excessive swelling was most frequent (28 percent).

         Splints have traditionally been made of plaster of Paris, but in recent years many different types of splinting materials have become available. These include pre-formed plaster, fiberglass, pre-padded fiberglass, malleable aluminium, air splints, vacuum splints, and pre-formed "off-the-shelf" splints for nearly every body part.

         </span>
         The choice between pre-formed splints and custom splints is largely one of convenience and compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
         Commercial pre-formed splints are typically made of Velcro and hard plastic. They are very convenient and come in a variety of sizes to fit most patients. However, since these splints are not custom-molded, they do not provide the same level of immobilization as custom built splints. Additionally, patients can easily remove commercial splints, potentially causing delayed healing, fracture displacement, or re-injury. Hence, custom splinting with plaster, fiberglass, or similar materials may be preferred when precise and continuous immobilization is required.

         Most splints are made from plaster or fiberglass. Plaster splints are made from gauze that is impregnated with plaster of Paris, a powdered form of gypsum. When water is added, the gypsum recrystallizes and hardens in a heat-releasing reaction [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. To minimize the risk of burns, use water that is no warmer than room temperature. Plaster splints take between 2 and 8 minutes to set, but they do not reach their maximum strength for approximately 24 hours. Plaster splints are easier to mold and are less expensive than fiberglass splints. However, they are more difficult to apply and become soggy when wet [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Fiberglass and other synthetic splints (eg, Orthoglass, OCL, and Velcro splints) usually are pre-padded and easier to apply. In addition, synthetic splints set more quickly and are lighter and longer-wearing, and are water-resistant [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5,12
         </a>
         ]. However, they are more expensive and do not mold as well as plaster splints.
        </p>
        <p>
         More sophisticated prefabricated splints, consisting of plastic shells lined with air cells, foam, or gel components, are widely available. These splints are often used for soft tissue injuries or bony injuries that require prolonged periods of immobilization [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Air splints (also called air casts) provide less support than plaster or fiberglass splints (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78043" href="/z/d/graphic/78043.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). They can be used to treat ankle sprains and low-risk fractures of the distal fibular physis (ie, Salter-Harris Type I fractures of the distal fibula). Air splints prevent eversion/inversion movement while permitting free flexion/extension. Furthermore, the amount of air in the splint can be increased as swelling resolves in order to maintain support during healing.

         Advise field personnel to splint injuries suspected to be fractures before the patient is transported for medical evaluation. Commercial splinting devices are available and easy to use. If commercial devices are unavailable field personnel can manufacture splints from other available, malleable, semi-rigid material [

         Make sure that splints are of appropriate size, weight, and shape. In children, make the plaster or fiberglass slab wide enough to cover approximately one-half of the circumference of the extremity in children; do not allow the edges to overlap.

         Prevention of skin breakdown by the use of proper padding is vitally important. Pad the heels, elbows, and all bony prominences adequately; place padding between the digits to prevent maceration; place extra padding over the fracture site.

         Make sure that there is another evaluation, usually performed by an orthopedist, 7 to 10 days after injury. By this time, swelling usually has resolved and a cast can be applied if one is indicated. A cast provides longer lasting support and immobilization for the treatment of fractures. Initiate physical therapy (if indicated) after splinting, so as to prevent "freezing" or contracture of the joints.

         Complications rarely occur when splints are applied correctly and maintained properly by the patient.

         Complications include sores, abrasions, and infections from loose or ill-fitting splints; neurovascular compromise from tight-fitting splints; contact dermatitis; pressure sores; and thermal burns (from heat released during setting of plaster) [

         The type of splint varies depending upon the site of the injury. The most basic splint is composed of a layer of stockinette, with or without padding, and several layers of plaster (or pre-padded fiberglass) that are molded to provide comfort, support, and immobilization (

          1,3-7,13

         Use gutter splints primarily for phalangeal and metacarpal fractures. Radial gutter splints, with a hole cut before application, through which the thumb can pass, may also have a role in adults with distal forearm fractures, although evidence is limited to one small trial [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         These splints extend from the proximal forearm to beyond the distal interphalangeal joint and can be radial (immobilizing the index and long fingers) or ulnar (immobilizing the ring and little fingers, also called the boxer splint). Make sure that the splint is wide enough to surround both fingers and the wrist.
        </p>
        <p>
         In order to avoid finger stiffness, splint the fingers with the metacarpophalangeal joints in 70 degrees flexion, the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint in 20 to 30 degrees of flexion, and the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint in no more than 5 to 10 degrees of flexion (

          General principles
         </strong>
         – Splinting plays a major role in the management of musculoskeletal injuries, particularly those involving extremity fractures and joint dislocations. Immobilization of the extremity through splinting decreases pain and bleeding and prevents further soft tissue, vascular, or neurologic compromise. Protective splinting of hand injuries may enable athletes to return to sport while in season, deferring definitive treatment until after the season. Splinting may provide definitive treatment for some injuries. (See
         <a class="local">
          'General principles'

         <strong>
          Assess extent of injury prior to splint application

         ). For most fractures, the splint should immobilize the joint above and the joint below the fractured bone. For most dislocations, the splint should immobilize the bone above and the bone below the reduced joint. Proper padding, correct sizing of splint materials, and reassessment of neurovascular status are important to prevent complications from splinting. (See

          Plaster splints
         </strong>
         – These are made from gauze that is impregnated with plaster of Paris, a powdered form of gypsum. When water is added, the gypsum recrystallizes and hardens in a heat-releasing reaction. To minimize the risk of burns, use water that is no warmer than room temperature. Plaster splints take between 2 and 8 minutes to set, but they do not reach their maximum strength for approximately 24 hours. Plaster splints are easier to mold and are less expensive than fiberglass splints. However, they are more difficult to apply and become soggy when wet. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Customized plaster splints'

          Fiberglass splints
         </strong>
         – These and other synthetic splints (eg, Orthoglass, OCL, and Velcro splints) usually are already padded and easier to apply. In addition, synthetic splints set more quickly and are lighter, longer wearing, and water resistant. However, they are more expensive and do not mold as well as plaster splints. (See
