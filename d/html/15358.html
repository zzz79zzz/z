         Coronary reperfusion with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) improves outcomes in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), an MI with a new or presumably new left bundle branch block, or a true posterior MI if performed in a timely fashion. Most procedures are now performed with drug-eluting stents, which are associated with a lower rate of restenosis than bare-metal stents. (See

         This topic will address some of the technical aspects of PCI, as well as adjunctive medications when used in the periprocedural period. Issues related to the performance of primary PCI will be reviewed here. The determinants of outcome, the clinical trials demonstrating the benefit of primary PCI compared with fibrinolytic therapy, selection of a reperfusion strategy, the possible role of PCI after fibrinolysis, and the role of PCI in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes are discussed separately.

         Percutaneous coronary intervention after fibrinolytic therapy may be indicated in patients who remain unstable or in stable patients who have had incomplete reperfusion or as part of a pharmacoinvasive strategy. This issue is discussed elsewhere. (See

         Bleeding complications are common in patients with STEMI and they predict a worse prognosis [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Many of these major bleeds occur in relation to the access site for PCI, particularly when the femoral artery is used. The risk of bleeding is lower with radial artery access. In patients undergoing primary PCI, we prefer the radial to the femoral approach if performed by experienced operators. This issue is discussed in greater detail separately. (See

         The role of adjunctive intravascular imaging techniques, such as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), has not been established in patients with primary PCI. Several registries have found discordant results. In the ADAPT–DES study in which 813 STEMI patients were enrolled, IVUS use was associated with improved outcomes in STEMI patients [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. In the CREDO-Kyoto AMI Registry, 3028 patients with STEMI underwent PCI with or without IVUS. Following risk adjustment, there was no difference in target vessel failure between the groups (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, CI 0.86-1.51) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. However, the risk of stent thrombosis was lower with IVUS guidance. Likewise, a randomized, multicenter trial of angiographic compared with OCT-guided drug-eluting stent placement found that OCT-guidance did not reduce the incidence of major adverse cardiac events. OCT guidance led to post-PCI stent optimization in 29 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         With their superior temporal and spatial resolution compared with angiography, IVUS and OCT may result in additional balloon inflations, and/or stent deployment to treat angiographically silent findings such as minor edge dissections, strut metal apposition, and plaque prolapse. Whether this will translate into improved clinical outcomes await larger, prospective randomized trials.

          Direct stenting

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Low-profile stent delivery systems allow for a direct stenting technique (ie, placement of a stent without predilation). The advantages of direct stenting include less radiation exposure and contrast use, as well as shorter procedural times and a lower risk of distal embolization (ie, "no reflow phenomenon") caused by plaque fragmentation. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/81.html" rel="external">
          "Suboptimal reperfusion after primary percutaneous coronary intervention in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction", section on 'No reflow'

         and
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1569.html" rel="external">
          "Percutaneous coronary intervention with intracoronary stents: Overview"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with an acute STEMI undergoing primary PCI, we typically perform PCI with direct stenting unless there are anatomic factors that favor predilation, such as significant calcification, diffuse disease, TIMI 0 flow  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51941" href="/z/d/graphic/51941.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), or inadequate visualization of the lesion. Direct stenting may reduce the risk of no-reflow phenomenon caused by plaque fragment emboli and increases the likelihood of myocardial perfusion and salvage [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The data that describe the effect of direct stenting are limited to relatively small trials and observational studies. However, the aggregate data suggest that direct stenting may reduce the risk of short- and long-term mortality. A 2015 meta-analysis included three randomized trials and nine observational studies that compared direct stenting to predilation [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Analysis of the trials found that direct stenting was associated with a large but uncertain reduction in the risk of short-term mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.29, 95% CI 0.07-1.2) and long-term mortality (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.26-1.2). Analysis of the observational studies reported a similar reduction in short-term mortality (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.29-0.68) and long-term mortality (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33-0.94). When analyzed together, the pooled data suggest a reduction in both short-term (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.29-0.65) and long-term mortality (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37-0.86).

         Drug-eluting stents (DES) are used in preference to bare-metal stents (BMS) in almost all PCI procedures because they reduce the incidence of restenosis and target vessel revascularization without causing a significant increase in the cumulative rate of adverse outcomes. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1575.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The concern that rates of stent thrombosis with first-generation DES were higher than the rates with BMS are no longer relevant; second-generation DES have lower restenosis rates and lower stent thrombosis rates and, accordingly, have replaced both BMS and first-generation DES [
         <a href="#rid9">

         Many randomized trials, including TYPHOON, PASSION, SESAMI, DEDICATION, and HORIZONS AMI, have evaluated outcomes at one year or less. They demonstrated that the lower rate of restenosis of sirolimus- or paclitaxel-eluting stents relative to BMS, when used for primary PCI, is similar to that in other settings.
        </p>
        <p>
         The long-term outcomes of first-generation DES and BMS have been compared in multiple trials and their meta-analyses. We believe that the best evidence comes from a 2012 meta-analysis that used individual patient data from nearly 6300 patients enrolled in 11 randomized trials of primary PCI that compared either paclitaxel- or sirolimus-eluting stents with BMS [
         <a href="#rid15">

The primary end point of six-month angiographic in-stent late-luminal loss was not significantly different between the DEB-BMS and BMS groups and neither group performed as well as the DES group. In addition, DEB induced more uncovered and malapposed stent struts than BMS, but less than DES. The results of this study have limited applicability as a first-generation stent was the comparator.

         Coronary lesions causing acute STEMI often have substantial thrombus associated with them. This thrombus can embolize spontaneously or be pushed downstream with periprocedural intracoronary artery manipulation. Macro- or microembolization of this material to the distal circulation, which occurs in 5 to 10 percent of cases, is associated with worse clinical outcomes [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24,25
         </a>
         ]. Interventions such as thrombectomy or the use of distal embolic protection devices have not been shown to improve patient important outcomes. (See

        <p>
         A few observational studies and one small randomized trial raised the possibility that deferred (at a second procedure) placement of a stent might reduce the impact of thrombus-related impairment of distal flow [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26-28
         </a>
         ]. The DANAMI 3-DEFER trial randomly assigned 1215 STEMI patients to either standard PCI with stenting or to deferred stent implantation 48 hours after the index procedure [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29

         ]. At a median follow-up of 42 months, there was no difference in the rate of the primary end point, a composite of all-cause mortality, hospital admission for heart failure, recurrent infarction, and any unplanned revascularization of the target vessel within two-year follow-up (18 versus 17 percent; HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.76-1.29).
        </p>

         Our recommendation to not perform deferred stenting in most cases is based an absence of clear benefit and the increased costs (eg, longer hospital stay and greater radiation and contrast exposure) associated with performing two procedures.

         Ischemic postconditioning refers to the ability of a series of brief occlusions of either the coronary or a remote arterial circulation after a severe ischemic insult to protect against ischemic-reperfusion injury. An initial clinical trial of intermittent coronary artery occlusion in primary PCI suggested smaller infarct size and a higher myocardial blush grade. Before postconditioning can be recommended in patients who undergo primary PCI, additional studies are needed to confirm efficacy in a larger number of patients, to determine the optimal protocol, to assess treatment effect using a more accepted measure of infarct size after reperfusion (eg, SPECT imaging), and to determine long-term outcomes.

         The potential safety of early discharge was evaluated in the PAMI-2 trial, which included 471 patients who were deemed to be at low risk after successful primary PCI (age ≤70, no malignant arrhythmias, native vessel being the infarct-related artery, one or two vessel disease, and left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;45 percent) [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. These patients were randomly assigned to traditional care or to accelerated care on a telemetry unit followed by hospital discharge on day three. Patients receiving accelerated care were discharged three days earlier (4.2 versus 7.1 days for traditional care) with a significant reduction in cost. At six months, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of mortality (0.8 versus 0.4 percent), unstable angina, reinfarction, stroke, heart failure, or their combined occurrence (15.2 versus 17.5 percent).

         Despite scant randomized trials regarding early discharge, observational data have not identified a risk to early discharge. In a study linking the National Cardiovascular Data Registry CathPCI Registry to the United States Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services claims, 33,920 patients were examined [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. There was no difference in 30-day mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events between short (≤3 days) and medium (4 to 5 days) length of stay (adjusted hazard ratio 1.00, 95% CI 0.74-1.34).

          Role of fibrinolysis
         </strong>
         – Pretreatment with fibrinolysis is limited to patients in whom primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is likely to be excessively delayed because of local logistic problems or interhospital transfer. Fibrinolytic therapy given just before planned PCI (previously called "facilitated PCI") is not recommended because outcomes may be worse. (See

          'Percutaneous coronary intervention after fibrinolytic therapy'

          Arterial access
         </strong>
         – For patients undergoing primary PCI, we prefer the radial, as opposed to the femoral, approach if performed by operators skilled in radial technique and if the anticipated impact on door-to-balloon time is negligible.

          Direct stenting or predilation
         </strong>
         – In patients with an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary PCI, we typically perform PCI with direct stenting unless there are anatomic factors present that favor predilation, such as significant calcification, diffuse disease, TIMI 0 flow  (

         <strong>
          Selection of stent type

         – We prefer durable polymer or bioresorbable polymer drug-eluting stents (DES) over bare-metal stents (BMS). (See
