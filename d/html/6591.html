         The mode of envenomations by coral, sea urchins, venomous fish, and stingrays vary by animal. These envenomations are painful. The degree of pain is largely determined by the amount of venom injected and the animal encountered.
        </p>
        <p>
         The puncture wounds associated with marine envenomations often have retained foreign bodies and are frequently contaminated. Most wounds are superficial although stingrays can cause deep penetrating injuries.

         Coral are cnidarians, like jellyfish, and members of the class Anthozoa [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Coral stings and lacerations are common among snorkelers, surfers, and scuba divers who touch, step, or fall onto coral [

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Coral stings are usually only mildly toxic with local pain and erythema. The sting is caused by venomous capsules called nematocysts and can be treated similarly to jellyfish stings. In contrast, lacerations from coral  (

         The sea urchin is an echinoderm, and the most significant member of this phylum in United States waters. Other members of this phylum include starfish and sea cucumbers, which have no venom apparatus (poisonous rather than venomous). Echinoderms have long, sharp spines made of

          calcium carbonate
         </a>
         that easily penetrate flesh, rubber soled shoes, or wet suits, and may break off deep in the wound. Some species have venom-producing glands at the tips of the spines and thus, are venomous. Injuries typically occur after stepping or falling on an urchin, which results in multiple puncture wounds  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54699" href="/z/d/graphic/54699.html" rel="external">

         Clinical findings include redness, swelling, bleeding from multiple puncture wounds  (

         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Discoloration may occur around the wounds and may indicate retained sea urchin spines. If the change in color resolves within 48 hours, it is unlikely that a spine remains lodged in the skin [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Imaging with plain radiographs or ultrasound may help identify the presence of embedded spines  (

         Venomous fish have specific apparatus designed to inject poison. Stings occur in the marine and fresh water environment and also from fish kept in private aquariums. The venom apparatus is similar for fish worldwide. Spines cover integumentary sheaths which contain venom glands. When the spine penetrates the victim's skin, the surrounding integument covering the spine ruptures and venom is injected into the wound. The typical injury depends upon the fish and how it is encountered. For example, stonefish and weeverfish usually cause injuries when they are stepped on by swimmers or divers because they are bottom-dwellers, catfish cause injuries to the upper limbs when they are removed from fishing lines, and lionfish or scorpionfish typically envenomate the hands or fingers during routine care and feeding by their aquarium handlers.

         <a href="#rid6">
          6-11
         </a>
         ]. The pain may resolve over one hour in minor injuries, but with more severe stings (eg, marine catfish or stonefish  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82851" href="/z/d/graphic/82851.html" rel="external">
          picture 3
         </a>
         )) the pain may persist for over 24 hours and may radiate. Local effects include a simple puncture wound with erythema and edema in more severe cases. Uncommonly the spine can break off in the wound such as with catfish spine injuries when they are being removed from fishing lines. The spines may also have a series of "teeth" or barbs making removal difficult. Extensive tissue injury and necrosis is usually a result of infection.
        </p>
        <p>
         Systemic effects have been reported in more severe cases, including nausea, vomiting, headache, sweating, hypotension and even syncope. However, despite many reports of systemic effects they are most likely to be secondary to severe pain. Fatalities have been attributed to many types of venomous fish, including stonefish and catfish. However, these cases are poorly reported and in many cases are more likely due to septicemia from secondary infection.

         </span>
         There are over 150 species of stingrays worldwide, accounting for thousands of injuries every year [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,12-14
         </a>
         ]. Stingrays possess whip-like tails with a furrowed, serrated spine containing secretory venom cells and sacs. When the animal is stimulated or frightened, it flings the barbed tail upward, embedding the spine in the victim which releases the venom. The resulting wound is a combination of a puncture and jagged laceration, usually of a limb  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67496" href="/z/d/graphic/67496.html" rel="external">
          picture 7
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In temperate and semitropical zones, injuries often occur during late summer and early fall when stingrays burrow within the sand in shallow surf. Unsuspecting bathers may step on a stingray while entering the water. Stings may be prevented by shuffling the feet along the bottom when walking in the surf and wading at shallow ocean depths. Injuries to the upper limbs are less common when stingrays are removed from fishing lines and thoraco-abdominal trauma may occur rarely to divers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Stingray injuries will cause immediate and intense pain at the site of entry. Pain may then radiate up the limb and usually persists for hours. The wound site may appear erythematous and dusky, but there is often significant bleeding which will depend upon the site of injury  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67496" href="/z/d/graphic/67496.html" rel="external">
          picture 7
         </a>
         ). Although numerous systemic effects are reported, they are uncommon and usually related to the systemic response to severe pain. A study of 393 patients with stingray injuries found that one-half had complete resolution of their pain within one week and almost all had resolution or improvement in their pain by one month [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The size and length of the stingray spine will dictate the extent of injury and larger spines are at an increased risk of trauma and secondary infection. Death or severe injury may also occur if the spine penetrates a major blood vessel, the heart, or another vital organ [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Thoracoabdominal injuries should be managed as per major penetrating trauma but have the additional risk of foreign body retention and infection. Those wounds that extend through the chest or abdominal wall will always need exploration in the operating room [

         Patients with jellyfish or sea anemone stings do not have puncture wounds. After a jellyfish sting, linear red, urticarial lesions typically develop a few minutes later, although sometimes these lesions do not appear for several hours. "Tentacle prints" may be seen on examination of the skin, and less commonly vesiculation and ecchymosis  (

         This animal is found in Papua New Guinea and Australia and its saliva contains tetrodotoxin which is a sodium channel blocker. The venomous bite typically occurs when it is picked up. The patient often thinks the bite is trivial at the time. However, symptoms begin within 10 to 20 minutes, and are marked by neurologic symptoms, such as paresthesias, muscular weakness, and respiratory arrest rather than pain. Treatment is supportive and includes close monitoring of respiratory status and timely endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation if respiratory failure occurs. (See

         Sea snakes reside in a variety of tropical regions including the warmer portions of the Indian and Pacific oceans from the East Coast of Africa to the West Coast of the United States and Central and South America. Typically they are found close to land in coral reefs or along islands although the pelagic sea snake may be found in open water [

        <p>
         The bite of a sea snake is often painless with limited local tissue injury. However, after a quiescent period which may last up to several hours, systematic effects become apparent. The predominant systemic features are due to myotoxicity. Clinical features include muscle pain and tenderness, trismus and sometimes weakness, with systemic rhabdomyolysis in severe cases, acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19-21
         </a>
         ]. The urine will often appear dark due to myoglobinuria. Sea snakes do not cause coagulopathy; neurotoxicity has been reported after sea snake bites in Australia but is not a regular feature of envenomation [

         Cone snails are primarily found in the warm regions of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Envenomation occurs when the detachable radicular tooth is discharged via a harpoon-like apparatus and has primarily been described in divers and shell collectors [

Stings typically occur on the hand when the shell is held outside of water and are painful. Localized numbness spreads up the affected arm and can be accompanied by partial or complete total paralysis. Based upon one case report, paralysis may begin soon after the sting and may be prolonged. Total recovery has been described within three days of the sting [

         Cercarial dermatitis, also known as swimmer's itch, is an itchy maculopapular rash that follows skin penetration by cercariae larvae of nonhuman schistosomes (often avian) which are found widely in natural bodies of fresh and salt water on all continents  (

         ). The distribution of the rash is limited to areas of the body immersed in water. Itchy red papules that may become vesicular develop hours to a day or so after exposure to water contaminated with schistosomes. As the bather's skin dries, the larvae burrow into the epithelium and then die. (See

         Seabather's eruption is due to skin penetration by the tiny larvae of jellyfish, including Linuche unguiculata, Edwardsiella lineata, and probably other species, which are found in oceans (salt water). The larvae release nematocysts and inject toxin. The distribution of the lesions conforms to skin areas covered by a bathing suit, wet suit, or points of pressure (eg, wristbands of diving suits, flexural areas). Skin lesions are inflammatory papules, often becoming vesicular or pustular  (

         We suggest that patients with pain following marine envenomations undergo hot water immersion of the involved area (water temperature 40 to 45°C) for up to 90 minutes. If a thermometer is not available, the clinician can use the hottest water temperature that is tolerated by the patient on an unaffected limb; adults should test the water temperature for young children. Hot water immersion should not be used for longer than 90 minutes and is contraindicated in patients who have had local or regional anesthesia for pain control. There is considerable risk of burns in patients with exposure for longer than 90 minutes and the risk increases with water temperature and duration of exposure.
        </p>

         Unlike jellyfish stings where there is good evidence for the effectiveness of hot water immersion, the evidence to support this therapy for penetrating marine injuries is primarily derived from case reports, small case series, and anecdotal experience.

         – Deep penetrating wounds into the thorax or abdomen after stingray encounters warrant additional methods of evaluation such as computed tomography (CT) or diagnostic laparoscopy for abdominal wounds and thoracic ultrasound, echocardiography, chest CT, esophagoscopy and esophagography, or bronchoscopy for thoracic wounds.

It is reasonable to remove visible and easily removed spines during initial evaluation and then closely follow the patient for a week or more. If there are ongoing signs or symptoms of a retained foreign body, then surgical removal may be required.

         Wounds caused by marine envenomations require close follow-up because of the risk of serious infection [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ]. Empiric oral or parenteral antibiotics, depending upon the severity of infection for prophylaxis are indicated if signs of infection develop [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Suggested antibiotic regimens are the same as previously described for prophylaxis of deep wounds. The most common marine pathogens are facultatively anaerobic Gram-negative rods and other bacteria that commonly produce soft tissue infections in association with exposure to water or water-related animals (eg,
         <em>
          Vibrio vulnificus

         , and
         <em>
          Mycobacterium marinum

        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, infections from marine injuries can still be caused by normal skin flora. Thus, antibiotic coverage should also include antibiotics with activity against Staphylococcal and Streptococcal species (eg,

         </strong>
         – Wounds caused by coral, sea urchins, spiny fish, or stingrays are common occurrences around the world during fishing, swimming, snorkeling, scuba diving, and aquarium maintenance. The mode of envenomation varies by animal and can include venomous stings and punctures with a spine. (See

         <strong>
          Clinical manifestations
         </strong>
         – Marine envenomations are characterized by pain, which can be severe, and puncture wounds to the affected area. The degree of pain is largely determined by the amount of venom injected and the animal encountered. Severe pain is common after stonefish and stingray envenomations. Most wounds are superficial although stingrays can cause deep penetrating injuries. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Epidemiology and clinical manifestations'

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of a marine envenomation is supported by a history of an encounter with a coral, sea urchin, venomous fish, or stingray during water activities, sudden onset of pain, and single or multiple puncture wounds (depending upon the animal) especially when foreign bodies (eg, bits of coral, sea urchin spines, fish or stingray spines and integument) are present.

          Pain management
         </strong>
         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         In a patient with pain following a marine envenomation, we suggest immersing the involved area in hot water (40 to 45°C) for up to 90 minutes (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Patients may also receive opioids (eg, intravenous

          morphine

         ) for moderate to severe pain and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (eg,

          acetaminophen

         for mild pain. If pain persists, local or regional anesthesia may also be required but should
         <strong>
          never
         </strong>
         be combined with hot water immersion. (See

          Stonefish envenomation
         </strong>
         – In a patient with stonefish envenomation who does not receive adequate pain relief from hot water immersion and parenteral analgesia, we suggest administering stonefish antivenom (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Allergic reaction and anaphylaxis are known adverse effects of the antivenom. Thus, it should only be given in settings where close monitoring, immediate availability of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/z/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">
          epinephrine

         and antihistamines, and resuscitation capability are assured. (See

         <strong>
          Wound care
         </strong>
         – Patients with marine envenomations should also undergo meticulous local wound care including irrigation, removal of foreign bodies, and tetanus prophylaxis, as needed  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61087" href="/z/d/graphic/61087.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). Wounds should be left open or, if extensive or in a cosmetically important areas, undergo delayed primary closure. Deep penetrating wounds and deep limb injuries to the thorax or abdominal cavity following stingray envenomation require management as for severe penetrating trauma, including exploration in the operating room.

         – In a patient with deep puncture wounds, especially those with retained foreign bodies, and penetrating wounds caused by stingrays, we suggest administration of prophylactic antibiotics (

          Antibiotic options

         – Antibiotics are indicated if signs of infection develop after marine envenomation and should consist of agents with activity against common marine bacteria and skin flora. Empiric and directed antibiotic therapy of such infections include the following options (see
