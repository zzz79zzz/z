RV has a range of disease severity; in some patients, it is associated with substantial morbidity and an increased risk of mortality and can require intensive immunosuppressive therapy.</p><p>RV typically occurs in patients with longstanding, erosive RA and may affect a wide range of blood vessel types, from medium-sized muscular arteries to somewhat smaller arterioles or post-capillary venules. Clinical features of both medium- and small-vessel disease may be found within a given patient, and RV is generally classified among the forms of vasculitis associated with systemic diseases rather than based upon the size of the vessels involved. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8226.html" rel="external">"Overview of and approach to the vasculitides in adults", section on 'Vasculitis associated with systemic disease'</a>.)</p><p>RV may lead to blood vessel occlusion, necrosis, and tissue ischemia in a manner that resembles other forms of systemic vasculitis. In its tendency to affect medium-sized arteries and involve the skin, peripheral nerves, eyes, heart, muscles, and other organs, RV often has a clinical appearance similar to polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Treatment practices for RV have been adapted from those for other better studied forms of systemic vasculitis, particularly granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), with which it also shares a number of features. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8245.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3117.html" rel="external">"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of RV is presented here. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of RV are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8243.html" rel="external">"Etiology and pathogenesis of rheumatoid vasculitis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8237.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatoid vasculitis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In determining treatment approaches for the patient with rheumatoid vasculitis (RV), an understanding of the clinical context in which this extraarticular manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) occurs is essential. The typical patient with RV has rheumatoid nodules, is seropositive, and has suffered from RA for at least a decade before systemic vasculitis becomes apparent. Consequently, at the time of RV onset, intensive and potentially toxic treatments will often be required in patients who have already incurred considerable morbidity from RA and its therapies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8237.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatoid vasculitis", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>Diagnostic tests such as biopsies should be performed prior to initiating immunosuppressive therapies, such as glucocorticoids, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>. In selected patients with organ- or life-threatening disease, it is occasionally necessary to perform the diagnostic procedure after treatment has been begun. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8237.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatoid vasculitis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Successful management of RV requires balancing the risks and benefits of therapies required for its treatment. Treatment considerations are often complicated by comorbidities that patients with RV have sustained through the years, including cytopenias, renal dysfunction, hepatic damage, gastrointestinal ulceration, and the complications of glucocorticoids, including hypertension, glucose intolerance, skin fragility, and others. RV is also mimicked by a number of infections, including both viral (human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, herpes zoster) and bacterial (tuberculosis, endocarditis) etiologies that must be excluded before initiating immunosuppressive therapy. Finally, in patients with RA, other forms of "idiopathic" vasculitis such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), eosinophilic GPA (EGPA; Churg-Strauss), or giant cell arteritis (GCA, also known as temporal arteritis and as Horton disease) may occur, whereas secondary forms such as cocaine- and/or drug-induced vasculitis must be ruled out as well. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8237.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatoid vasculitis", section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The type, distribution, and severity of organ damage resulting from RV are collectively weighed to determine appropriate treatment:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Isolated cutaneous involvement generally has a good prognosis and often does not require immunosuppressive drug therapy beyond glucocorticoids. However, some forms of cutaneous vasculitis, particularly when there are severe skin ulcers, may require <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>, or another immunosuppressive agent to induce disease remission. Even in these more limited cases of RV, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/z/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a> (MTX) or other glucocorticoid-sparing agents may be needed because of the burden of glucocorticoid-related side effects, especially when longer courses or higher doses of these agents are necessary. (See <a class="local">'Cutaneous vasculitis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Systemic RV with involvement of internal organs or with severe involvement of peripheral nerves has a poorer prognosis and warrants immunosuppressive treatment, typically with initially high doses of glucocorticoids in combination with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>. (See <a class="local">'Systemic vasculitis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>The management of medications the patient is already receiving for RA depends upon the clinical manifestations and the planned therapy (see <a class="local">'Systemic vasculitis'</a> below). As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients who develop systemic RV while on MTX, the further use of MTX depends upon whether the patient is going to be treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a> for their RV. Patients treated with rituximab are typically continued on MTX, the dosing of which should be optimized; patients who are treated with cyclophosphamide should discontinue MTX before starting cyclophosphamide treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7507.html" rel="external">"Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7491.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults", section on 'Initial therapy with methotrexate'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients who develop cutaneous or systemic RV while being treated with a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor should generally discontinue the TNF inhibitor. The use of these agents has been infrequently associated with the development of a drug-induced vasculitis, which is limited to the skin in the majority of the patients. Some patients with cutaneous vasculitis may not need further intervention for their vasculitis if it resolves with the discontinuation of the TNF inhibitor, which is common in patients with cutaneous vasculitis induced by the drug. We also discontinue the TNF inhibitor when treating systemic vasculitis with either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7974.html" rel="external">"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors: Induction of antibodies, autoantibodies, and autoimmune diseases", section on 'Vasculitis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Autopsy studies have identified a substantially higher prevalence of RV than is clinically apparent [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]; thus, there are likely to be individuals with early RV who could benefit from earlier treatment. The incidence of RV appears to be decreasing since the 1980s, suggesting that prompt and more aggressive treatment strategies and more effective medications may help to prevent the development of RV [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Because RV is associated with (high levels of) rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies, and sometimes antinuclear antibodies and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and other extraarticular disease, particular vigilance for RV is warranted in patients with these characteristics. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8237.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatoid vasculitis", section on 'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">CUTANEOUS VASCULITIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Isolated nailfold infarctions can be treated with local measures and have a good prognosis, while leg ulcerations due to rheumatoid vasculitis (RV) may require treatment similar to that used for systemic involvement. (See <a class="local">'Isolated nailfold infarctions'</a> below and <a class="local">'Leg ulceration'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Isolated nailfold infarctions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The treatment of isolated nailfold infarctions  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74000" href="/z/d/graphic/74000.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>), which are often associated with rheumatoid nodulosis and due to a low-grade small-vessel vasculitis [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>], depends upon whether they are painful and if there is skin breakdown. Such lesions can simply be observed in patients with minimal or no symptoms and intact skin, since there is a low risk for progression to systemic RV [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>In patients with painful nailfold infarction or infarcts with superficial skin breakdown, we suggest symptomatic treatment including bandaging and topical analgesics. If bandaging is insufficient to alleviate symptoms or the superficial ulceration does not show improvement over several days, we have had good success with topical <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9276" href="/z/d/drug information/9276.html" rel="external">clobetasol</a> propionate (0.05% ointment applied daily at bedtime) [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]. Topical clobetasol may be applied once or twice daily for up to 14 days, depending upon severity and the duration of therapy needed to achieve clearing of the lesions.</p><p>Long-term follow-up in 30 patients with nailfold vasculitis supports this approach [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Although patients with isolated nailfold vasculitis are at increased risk for other types of extraarticular disease, systemic therapy is not required for these lesions. They do not herald the imminent development of systemic RV.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Leg ulceration</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1820689061"><span class="h3">Initial ulcer management with topical measures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial treatment of leg ulcerations should include an approach similar to that for skin ulcers due to venous stasis, with a focus on good wound care and appropriate use of systemic antibiotics for superinfection. The treatment of venous stasis ulcers is discussed in more detail elsewhere. Briefly, our approach to topical and local therapy in the patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and presumed RV is as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients with eschar, we use wet-to-moist <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> dressings to debride the ulcer to a base of granulation tissue.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In those with adequate arterial circulation, we use compression bandages or stockings to help reduce swelling if there is concomitant venous stasis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We use occlusive hydrocolloid (or hydrogel) dressings or, for patients with very exudative ulcers, calcium alginate-containing dressings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We use topical glucocorticoids only on smaller lower-extremity ulcers, less than one centimeter in diameter, and particularly on digital ulceration. However, their efficacy for skin ulcers due to RV has not been formally evaluated.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We do not use antibiotic-containing ointments or creams.</p><p></p><p>A majority of leg ulcers in patients with RA probably have a vascular insufficiency etiology, which supports use of this approach, and the ulceration of RV can appear very similar. One series of 36 patients with RA and leg ulcers from Germany found three with RV, two with pyoderma gangrenosum, and 15 with chronic venous insufficiency, peripheral arterial disease, or a combination of these [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>The duration of therapy with local and topical measures depends upon the severity of the ulcer and the adequacy of the response to these treatments. In the absence of other signs of systemic vasculitis, we have a low threshold for obtaining a biopsy of isolated non-healing ulcers as a basis for determining the need for further immunosuppressive therapy. Ulcers that do not respond to conservative measures may signal the presence of underlying RV or another etiology, including cutaneous malignancy or infection (including herpes zoster), which can present with skin ulceration [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>Isolated skin ulceration greater than one centimeter across, or extending deeply to the fascia, should be biopsied early (within one to two weeks of appearance), to determine if systemic immunosuppressive therapies are warranted; whereas small, isolated, lower-extremity ulcers in older patients may merit up to four weeks of conservative management before pursuing a biopsy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8237.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatoid vasculitis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2369791484"><span class="h3">Ulcers due to RV and/or resistant to initial topical measures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with ulcers and systemic RV or with ulcers resistant to topical measures alone require systemic therapy in addition to the local measures. Only very small ulcers are managed only topically (see <a class="local">'Initial ulcer management with topical measures'</a> above). For patients who have systemic RV and skin ulcerations, as well as those with multiple progressively worsening skin ulcers but without systemic disease, immunosuppressive therapy, as well as local skin care, is usually essential for healing (see <a class="local">'Systemic vasculitis'</a> below). Conservative wound care measures are continued through the course of therapy until re-epithelialization is complete. (See <a class="local">'Initial ulcer management with topical measures'</a> above.)</p><p>In patients with skin ulcers resistant to topical measures, as in other patients with systemic RV, the diagnosis of RV should usually have been confirmed by biopsy prior to initiating immunosuppressive therapies, such as glucocorticoids, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>.
