This topic will review factors associated with performing an upper endoscopy, including indications, patient preparation, technical aspects, tissue sampling, and complications. Detailed discussions of specific diagnostic and therapeutic interventions carried out during an upper endoscopy and special considerations for upper endoscopy in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2270.html" rel="external">"Endoscopic interventions for nonmalignant esophageal strictures in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1260.html" rel="external">"Methods to achieve hemostasis in patients with acute variceal hemorrhage"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2573.html" rel="external">"Overview of the treatment of bleeding peptic ulcers"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2236.html" rel="external">"Barrett's esophagus: Surveillance and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2261.html" rel="external">"Overview of the treatment of achalasia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2673.html" rel="external">"Overview of endoscopic resection of gastrointestinal tumors"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127965.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Issues related to gastrointestinal disease in adults", section on 'Implications for endoscopy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2662.html" rel="external">"Wireless video capsule endoscopy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1213982073"><span class="h1">PATIENT SELECTION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2894907332"><span class="h2">Indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, upper endoscopy is recommended if the results are likely to influence management of the patient, if empiric treatment for a suspected benign disorder has been unsuccessful, if the procedure can be used as an alternative to or to investigate a finding on radiographic evaluation, or if a therapeutic maneuver may be needed. Diagnostic, screening/surveillance, and therapeutic indications for upper endoscopy are outlined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66596" href="/z/d/graphic/66596.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In addition, upper endoscopy is indicated if the results would affect the management of other diseases (eg, a patient with a history of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding who requires anticoagulation or treatment with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug). Upper endoscopy is generally not indicated when the results will not affect management or for periodic surveillance of benign lesions unless surveillance of a premalignant condition is warranted.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1313220246"><span class="h2">Contraindications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Relative contraindications for upper GI endoscopy include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients who cannot tolerate moderate sedation, monitored anesthesia care (MAC), or general anesthesia in whom unsedated upper endoscopy is not feasible (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2569.html" rel="external">"Sedation-free gastrointestinal endoscopy"</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients who are hemodynamically unstable</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with GI obstruction</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with abnormal coagulation studies (platelet count &lt;20,000/microL), particularly if biopsies or therapeutic maneuvers are anticipated</p><p></p><p>In addition, patient selection must take into account not only the indication(s) for the procedure but also patient-related factors, such as comorbid illnesses, that might increase the risk of performing an upper endoscopy or make the examination more difficult. As with any procedure, patients in whom the risks of upper endoscopy are believed to outweigh the benefits should not undergo the procedure. Whether the procedure is urgent or elective, decisions regarding the timing of endoscopy and the management of antiplatelet agents in such patients should involve both the gastroenterologist(s) and prescribing clinician(s) caring for the patient. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2632.html" rel="external">"Management of antiplatelet agents in patients undergoing endoscopic procedures"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86233.html" rel="external">"Noncardiac surgery after percutaneous coronary intervention", section on 'Our approach'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H67012257"><span class="h1">PREPROCEDURE CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prior to the procedure, patients should be evaluated for other factors that may affect the ability to safely and successfully perform an upper endoscopy.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1314831110"><span class="h2">Presedation assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients require a presedation evaluation to identify underlying conditions that may increase risk and to create a plan for procedural sedation that minimizes risk while managing coexisting medical conditions. Presedation assessment should include an evaluation of the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anatomic considerations such as a small mouth or a limited range of motion in the jaw (factors that may make it difficult to insert the protective mouth piece), a limited range of motion of the neck that may make correct patient positioning difficult, or the presence of a Zenker's diverticulum, which increases the difficulty and risk of esophageal perforation during esophageal intubation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Comorbid illnesses that may increase the risks associated with sedation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use of medications such as benzodiazepines, narcotics, or cannabis that may increase a patient's tolerance to the effects of sedation [<a href="#rid2">2-5</a>]. This includes taking a complete history of factors that might make sedation more difficult, such as prior difficulties with sedation, narcotic or benzodiazepine use, diminished mental capacity, and agitation or severe anxiety. It also includes considering whether the patient has any characteristics that pose an increased risk for aspiration (eg, ascites, nonempty stomach, active bleeding), difficult airway management (eg, obesity, nonvisibility of the uvula, prior history of difficult intubation), or increased cardiopulmonary complications of endoscopy (eg, comorbidities, obesity, older age, etc).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1213982080"><span class="h2">Patient preparation</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H67012131"><span class="h3">Diet</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients should follow preoperative fasting guidelines as they would for any type of anesthetic  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94641" href="/z/d/graphic/94641.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Specifically, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) guidelines state that patients should fast for a minimum of two hours after ingestion of clear liquids and six hours after ingestion of light meals before sedation is administered. [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The period of fasting may need to be longer if there is known or suspected delayed gastric emptying [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In emergency situations that cannot be delayed, the airway may need to be protected by endotracheal intubation.

In general, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be continued safely in patients having an upper endoscopy.

A preprocedure simulation of the up and down maneuver that will be necessary to pass the endoscope from the mouth to the upper esophageal sphincter is recommended to assure proper orientation of all equipment.</p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9092" href="/z/d/drug information/9092.html" rel="external">Benzocaine</a> spray or gel is used in some endoscopy centers for topical pharyngeal anesthesia. However, it may not improve patient tolerance of the procedure when intravenous sedation is also being used, and it is rarely associated with methemoglobinemia [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Complications'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7094.html" rel="external">"Methemoglobinemia", section on 'Topical anesthetics'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1213982087"><span class="h3">Insertion and esophageal intubation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The upper endoscope is introduced into the mouth under direct visualization, allowing for limited visualization of the tongue, other structures in the mouth, and ultimately the hypopharynx. The endoscopist can often view the epiglottis, the vocal cords, both piriform sinuses, and the arytenoid cartilages  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82592" href="/z/d/graphic/82592.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). In patients at risk for squamous neoplasia, particular attention should be given to both raised lesions and flat areas of discoloration with sharp borders in the oropharynx, as well as during inspection of the squamous esophagus below [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>The cricopharyngeus muscle and esophageal orifice appear below the opening to the trachea, seemingly between the piriform sinuses. The endoscope is passed posteriorly toward the upper esophageal sphincter, which is at the level of the thyroid cartilage, 15 to 18 cm from the incisors. The upper esophageal sphincter is passed under direct visualization, often with the assistance of insufflation, a gentle chin lift, and slight application of pressure. We use only CO<sub>2</sub> gas to insufflate the lumen of the GI tract for inspection, rather than air, to decrease the incidence of overdistension and its accompanying discomfort.</p><p>Esophageal intubation should be done slowly and gently, in part to avoid intubation of a Zenker's diverticulum since doing so can lead to a perforation. A Zenker's diverticulum is an outpouching of the posterior oropharynx just proximal to the upper esophageal sphincter caused by decreased compliance of the upper esophageal sphincter. Care must also be taken in patients with known or suspected proximal esophageal strictures, which can make esophageal intubation difficult and can increase the risk of perforation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2242.html" rel="external">"Zenker's diverticulum"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1213982094"><span class="h3">Esophagus and esophagogastric junction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Following intubation of the esophagus, the tubular esophagus is examined. The esophagus is typically approximately 25 cm in length. The esophagus is examined both on insertion of the scope and on withdrawal of the instrument after inspection of the stomach and duodenum. Withdrawal should be carried out slowly and with adequate CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation to ensure complete visualization. </p><p>The EGJ is generally approximately 40 cm from the incisors. There are both anatomic and histologic markers that separate the esophagus from the stomach. However, landmarks differentiating the esophagus from the stomach may be difficult to identify due to movement of the esophagus and stomach during the examination. The top of the gastric folds is the landmark generally believed to represent the EGJ. In patients without Barrett's esophagus, this is also the area of the squamocolumnar junction. The squamocolumnar junction is the area where the squamous epithelial lining of the esophagus meets the columnar lining of the stomach. Because this transition from squamous to columnar epithelium is typically uneven around the circumference of the lumen, it is also referred to as the Z-line. The transition from squamous to columnar epithelium results in a color change. The columnar mucosa of the stomach is salmon colored, whereas the squamous mucosa is pale pink  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83182" href="/z/d/graphic/83182.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). In patients without a hiatus hernia, the EGJ also corresponds with the lower esophageal sphincter, though the lower esophageal sphincter is extrinsic and cannot be seen endoscopically. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2259.html" rel="external">"Hiatus hernia", section on 'Anatomy and physiology of the esophagogastric junction'</a>.)</p><p>Important features include the color of the mucosa and evidence of erythema, erosions, ulcers, strictures, rings, webs, varices, or diverticula. Hiatus hernias are frequently identified during upper endoscopy. A hiatus hernia is a condition where some portion of the stomach has herniated through the esophageal hiatus in the crural diaphragm. In this situation, the columnar-lined mucosa and top of the gastric folds will be seen proximal to the extrinsic narrowing of the lumen caused by the diaphragmatic pinch. Hiatus hernias may be seen during retroflexed examination of the stomach as well. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2259.html" rel="external">"Hiatus hernia", section on 'Upper endoscopy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1213982101"><span class="h3">Stomach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The stomach is entered after passing the region of the EGJ. Initial visualization is usually of the relatively large folds of the greater curvature of the stomach  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55359" href="/z/d/graphic/55359.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). The examination usually proceeds along the greater curvature of the stomach towards the pylorus  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68173" href="/z/d/graphic/68173.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Certain techniques improve examination of the stomach and minimize the risk of complications. These include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Insufflation of the stomach</strong> – The stomach should be insufflated to allow for inspection, but excessive insufflation should be avoided as gastric distension can induce retching or belching.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Suctioning fluid in the fundus</strong> – The pool of gastric fluid in the fundus seen upon entering the stomach should be suctioned. This improves visualization of the area and minimizes the risk of reflux of gastric fluid and possible aspiration. However, care should be taken to avoid applying suction to the mucosa, as doing so may create suction artifacts that appear as abnormal mucosa. In addition, since any contact between the endoscope and the mucosa can result in trauma, it is best to examine the mucosa throughout the upper GI tract while avoiding contact with the mucosa.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inspection</strong> – While all areas of the stomach should be carefully examined, particular attention should be paid to the incisura, which is an area of the angularis along the lesser curvature.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Retroflexion</strong> – Adequate visualization of the proximal stomach and EGJ is achieved through retroflexion. Retroflexion allows the endoscopist to see areas that are not well visualized during the initial direct examination  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68753" href="/z/d/graphic/68753.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). The technique involves the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Distending the stomach with CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Advancing the endoscope to the region of the angularis on the lesser curvature in the antrum or the distal gastric body.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Turning the endoscope up-down dial to the maximal up position to achieve a 140- to 160-degree bend at the tip of the endoscope.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Locking the wheels of the endoscope to increase stiffness of the tip of the endoscope.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Withdrawing the endoscope to pull the tip of the endoscope toward the EGJ  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69189" href="/z/d/graphic/69189.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Rotating the endoscope to obtain a 360-degree view of the upper stomach.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Hiatus hernias are particularly easy to see when the endoscope is in the retroflexed position  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83183" href="/z/d/graphic/83183.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>). It is important to note that items placed through the endoscope's accessory channel, such as a biopsy forceps, may be difficult to use when the endoscope is in the retroflexed position, and thus may need to be passed to the tip of the instrument before retroflexion is performed. In addition, care is required to ensure that the retroflexed endoscope does not become entrapped within a hiatus hernia or in the esophagus. This is normally done by making sure that the retroflexed endoscope is not pulled into the hernia or the esophagus.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1213982108"><span class="h3">Pyloric intubation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pylorus is traversed under direct visualization  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82398" href="/z/d/graphic/82398.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>). Opening the pylorus for passage of the endoscope sometimes requires insufflation, gentle pressure, and patience in patients who have particularly active or motile pyloric regions.</p><p>In patients with a "J-shaped" stomach, intubating the pylorus may be difficult as extreme angulation of the endoscope may be required. Attempts to traverse the pylorus in such patients may result in significant looping in which the shaft of the endoscope presses on the greater curvature of the stomach. The pressure applied to the gastric wall by the loop can result in patient discomfort. In such circumstances, removing air from the stomach or application of external pressure on the abdominal wall in the left upper quadrant may help with passage of the endoscope through the pylorus.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1213982115"><span class="h3">Duodenum</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>After passing through the pylorus, the endoscope enters the duodenal bulb. The endoscope is then advanced through the duodenal sweep and into the second portion of the duodenum. The duodenal bulb is often devoid of characteristic features, though there may be raised bumps and polypoid areas representing either prominent Brunner's glands or heterotopic foci of gastric mucosa. The duodenum distal to the bulb has distinctive circular rings called valvulae conniventes  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61994" href="/z/d/graphic/61994.html" rel="external">picture 7</a>).</p><p>The ampulla of Vater is found in the second portion of the duodenum and is the site where the common bile duct and pancreatic duct empty into the duodenum. While the ampulla may be seen with a standard forward-viewing endoscope, a more complete examination of the ampulla requires the use of a side-viewing duodenoscope (the same endoscope used for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography). This is not done routinely as part of an upper endoscopy and requires specialized skills and equipment. However, it may be required for some patients, such as those with familial adenomatous polyposis, who are undergoing screening for ampullary adenomas. If examination of the ampulla is required, the examination should be performed with an endoscopist who is trained in the use of a side-viewing duodenoscope. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2592.html" rel="external">"Familial adenomatous polyposis: Screening and management of patients and families", section on 'Screening'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H67011595"><span class="h2">Diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A variety of diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers can be carried out during upper endoscopy. The most common diagnostic maneuver is tissue sampling.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2685552329"><span class="h3">Tissue sampling methods</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Tissue sampling is an important part of many upper endoscopic procedures [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. Specimens obtained during procedures can be sent for histologic, cytologic, or microbiologic analysis, depending on the type of sample and clinical indication for tissue sampling. When submitting samples, it is helpful to provide the pathologist, cytologist, or microbiologist with details such as the clinical history, specimen-specific location and appearance, and the question to be answered. Including the endoscopy report and photographs of the area in question can also provide useful clinical context.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Biopsy</strong> – A biopsy forceps is placed though the accessory channel of the endoscope and advanced to the target area, and the forceps is opened and closed to obtain a pinch biopsy. Many forceps have a "spike" that allows for the acquisition of more than one sample per pass of the forceps.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The tubular esophagus may be difficult to biopsy because the forceps comes out of the accessory channel parallel to the wall of the esophagus. This problem can be solved by the "turn-in" technique, where the tip of the endoscope is turned to be more perpendicular to the wall of the esophagus (or anywhere in the upper GI tract where this is an issue), allowing for a more direct angle in which to obtain a biopsy. This technique may be augmented by suctioning of the mucosa into the biopsy forceps, which is opened close to the tip of the endoscope before tissue acquisition, allowing for a larger sample to be obtained with each "bite" of the biopsy forceps.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Typically, biopsy forceps can only sample mucosal lesions. If a submucosal lesion is encountered, it may be possible to perform stacked or tunneled biopsies in which the same location is biopsied multiple times with the hope of obtaining deeper samples. This frequently is unsuccessful and increases the risk of perforation (especially in the esophagus), so it should be done with extreme caution. Submucosal lesions typically require assessment by endoscopic ultrasound to fully characterize and to provide tissue samples if indicated.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When urgent diagnosis of suspected cancer is needed in a hospital setting, endoscopic forceps biopsies can be processed by frozen section or by smashing small specimens for immediate cytology preparation. This may save time and avoid repeat procedures if delayed processed biopsies are negative [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Brushings</strong> – A brush within a sheath is placed through the accessory channel of the endoscope and advanced to the target area.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

Routine upper endoscopy is performed using a high-definition white-light endoscope. (See <a class="local">'Equipment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient selection </strong>–<strong> </strong>Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is indicated in the diagnostic evaluation of signs and symptoms of a wide variety of GI disorders as well as for therapeutic interventions  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66596" href="/z/d/graphic/66596.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Contraindications</strong> –<strong> </strong>Relative contraindications for upper GI endoscopy include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients who cannot tolerate moderate sedation, monitored anesthesia care (MAC), or general anesthesia in whom unsedated upper endoscopy is not feasible.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients who are hemodynamically unstable.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients with GI obstruction.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients with severe coagulation abnormalities (platelet count ≤20,000/microL), particularly if biopsies or therapeutic maneuvers are anticipated. (See <a class="local">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Presedation assessment</strong> –<strong> </strong>Patients require a presedation evaluation to identify underlying conditions that may increase risk and to create a plan for procedural sedation that minimizes risk while managing coexisting medical conditions. (See <a class="local">'Presedation assessment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient preparation</strong> –<strong> </strong>Prior to elective upper GI endoscopy, patients should fast for a minimum of two hours after ingestion of clear liquids and six to eight hours after ingestion of light meals, and sometimes longer if there is known or suspected delayed gastric emptying. Most medications can be continued up to the time of endoscopy and are usually taken with a small sip of water. The morning doses of some medications may need to be adjusted prior to upper endoscopy, such as medications for diabetes. The decision of whether to stop antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants must take into account the procedure-related risk of bleeding and the risk of periprocedural thrombosis. Antibiotic prophylaxis is only indicated in selected patients undergoing upper endoscopy  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51133" href="/z/d/graphic/51133.html" rel="external">table 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54121" href="/z/d/graphic/54121.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). (See <a class="local">'Patient preparation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preprocedure testing</strong> –<strong> </strong>Preprocedure testing is not routinely required in all patients and should be used selectively based on the patient's medical history, physical examination findings, and procedural risk factors. (See <a class="local">'Preprocedure testing in selected patients'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complications </strong>– Complications of upper endoscopy include complications due to sedation, related to the endoscopy, and complications related to diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers.
