TO GOAL BLOOD PRESSURE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3071298892"><span class="h2">Overview of our approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A variety of randomized trials have addressed the issue of goal blood pressure in patients with hypertension. These trials, discussed in detail below, form the rationale for our approach to initial management of hypertension and goal blood pressure.</p><p>In general:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Our proposed blood pressure targets depend in part upon the method by which the blood pressure is measured (see <a class="local">'Importance of how blood pressure is measured'</a> below):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In particular, blood pressure that is measured in the office (ie, medical care setting) should be obtained in a standardized manner. There are two ways to performed high-quality office blood pressure measurement: automated oscillometric blood pressure monitoring (AOBPM), which requires specialized equipment, and standardized office-based measurement using proper preparation and technique  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115862" href="/z/d/graphic/115862.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), which requires only ordinary equipment. These two methods of measuring blood pressure in the office were used in nearly all outcome trials in hypertension and provide readings that approximate daytime ambulatory blood pressure (using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring [ABPM]) and self-measured (home) blood pressure monitoring. These techniques are described in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3879.html" rel="external">"Blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Together, these four methods of blood pressure measurement are preferable to the manner by which blood pressure is typically measured in the medical care setting, in which blood pressure is measured (usually once) in the office with a stethoscope or oscillometric device and without proper patient preparation or technique. Due to the lack of standardization, this typical method of measurement can vary from office to office and from one medical provider to the next. Although it is an inferior method of measurement, it is faster and less cumbersome and therefore is the one primarily used worldwide. Henceforth in this topic, the four preferred options for blood pressure measurement will be referred to as "non-routine" since they are less commonly implemented. The non-preferred method will be referred to as "routine" since it is the method typically used in clinical practice. As noted above, one of the non-routine methods should ideally be used to make decisions about blood pressure management.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Blood pressure targets differ depending upon the technique of measurement because "routine" methods typically provide higher blood pressure readings compared with the preferred, "non-routine" methods. On a population level, routine measurements are generally 5 to 15 mmHg higher than non-routine measurements (although there will be uncertainty about the difference in any given individual). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3879.html" rel="external">"Blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In addition, blood pressure targets are based upon the patient's risk for having a future cardiovascular event [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Specifically, we recommend or suggest, depending upon the strength of the evidence, a more intensive goal for most patients with one or more of the following higher-risk characteristics  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117101" href="/z/d/graphic/117101.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) (see <a class="local">'Goal blood pressure in higher-risk patients'</a> below):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (prior history of coronary disease, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), or documented peripheral arterial disease) (see <a class="local">'Patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients with heart failure (see <a class="local">'Patients with heart failure'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patents with diabetes mellitus (see <a class="local">'Patients with diabetes mellitus'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (see <a class="local">'Patients with chronic kidney disease'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Older adults (&gt;65 years of age) (see <a class="local">'Older adults'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (and an estimated 10-year risk of future cardiovascular events of 10 percent or greater) (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/107063.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>) (see <a class="local">'Patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients without any of these characteristics are considered lower risk; we recommend a less intensive goal in such patients.</p><p></p><p>There are strong data supporting treatment decisions in some patient populations, such as in those with severely elevated blood pressure (eg, diastolic pressure ≥110 mmHg), in those at high cardiovascular risk, and in older adults. However, data are weak and largely indirect for many other patient populations. As such, good clinical judgment and shared decision-making between patient and provider are paramount.</p><p>The lower blood pressure targets in higher-risk groups are relevant to a large segment of the population [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Pursuing more intensive blood pressure lowering in such patients is likely to be cost effective, despite the need for more medication and additional monitoring [<a href="#rid6">6-9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1244538168"><span class="h2">Importance of how blood pressure is measured</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Blood pressure targets depend in part upon the method by which the blood pressure is measured  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117101" href="/z/d/graphic/117101.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Blood pressure monitoring to determine whether the patient is at goal should ideally employ one of the following four methods: standardized office-based measurement, AOBPM, home blood pressure monitoring, or ABPM. The four methods, described briefly below, are referred to as "non-routine" in this topic because they are uncommonly implemented. The "routine" method that is typically used worldwide to measure blood pressure should ideally not be used for clinical decision-making.</p><p>A variety of methods and equipment are used to measure blood pressure in clinical practice; all methods of measurement, in particular office measurements, should follow specific standards (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3879.html" rel="external">"Blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in adults"</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>"Routine" (typical/casual) office blood pressure (non-preferred method) – Routine office blood pressure is typically measured once at the beginning of the office visit, with a care provider in the room and without proper patient preparation (ie, without having the patient first empty their bladder, without having the patient appropriately seated and rested for three to five minutes with both feet on the ground, without refraining from conversation during measurement, without using the correct cuff size, etc). It is likely that such routine measurements are highly variable from office to office and from one care provider to the next.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>"Non-routine" standardized methods (preferred method):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Standardized office-based measurement – Standardized office measurement does not require specialized equipment (blood pressure can be taken manually or with an oscillometric device) but does require proper patient preparation and proper technique  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115862" href="/z/d/graphic/115862.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>AOBPM – AOBPM uses an oscillometric device that is programed to average multiple consecutive readings after the patient has rested in a seated position for approximately five minutes. The device is activated by a care provider, who then can leave the room. AOBPM requires specialized equipment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Home blood pressure – Home blood pressure, typically using an automated oscillometric device (which has been checked for accuracy in the clinician's office), is self-measured by the patient while out of the office. Typically, multiple readings are obtained daily over several consecutive days and then these readings are averaged to guide clinical decision-making. A common scenario is to instruct patients to take two to four daily readings for five to seven days before attending the clinic. Proper technique should be followed  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115862" href="/z/d/graphic/115862.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>ABPM – ABPM is determined using a device (worn by the patient) that takes blood pressure measurements over a 24-hour period, usually every 15 to 30 minutes during the daytime and every 30 to 60 minutes during sleep.</p><p></p><p>The auscultatory method of measurement using a manual cuff is the most common technique employed in clinical practice and, in addition, was the technique used in most early clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy. In newer trials, oscillometric devices have been used. In all trials, standardized preparation and technique were followed  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115862" href="/z/d/graphic/115862.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>AOBPM (attended and unattended) is less frequently employed in clinical practice but was the technique that was used in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) and the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial. Goal blood pressure trials that used home blood pressure measurement or ABPM are lacking.</p><p>On average, systolic pressure readings are typically 5 to 15 mmHg lower with non-routine compared with routine measurement because the "white coat" effect may be absent and because routine measurements are performed without proper patient preparation and technique [<a href="#rid10">10-15</a>]. Some studies have reported even more dramatic differences between non-routine and routine measurement [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. However, it is critical to realize that this average difference in blood pressure between measurement methodologies applies to the population and <strong>not</strong> the individual. Some patients do not experience a white coat effect, and there is therefore some uncertainty in setting goals according to the method of measurement. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3879.html" rel="external">"Blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3820.html" rel="external">"Out-of-office blood pressure measurement: Ambulatory and self-measured blood pressure monitoring"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1503546515"><span class="h2">Why baseline risk matters: Absolute versus relative risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The management of adults diagnosed with hypertension depends in part upon the patient's risk for future cardiovascular events. (See <a class="local">'Goal blood pressure in higher-risk patients'</a> below and <a class="local">'Goal blood pressure in lower-risk patients'</a> below.)</p><p>In general, therapeutic decisions should be made based upon the absolute benefits and harms of a particular treatment and <strong>not</strong> the relative benefits and harms. Suppose, for example, that a blood pressure reduction of 10/5 mmHg produces a 20 percent <strong>relative risk</strong> reduction (ie, a relative risk [RR] of 0.80) for major cardiovascular events. Now suppose there are two hypertensive patients:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The first patient is a 50-year-old, nonsmoking, nondiabetic, African-American woman with a total cholesterol of 190 mg/dL, a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol of 45 mg/dL, and a systolic pressure of 135 mmHg. This patient has a predicted 10-year risk of having a major atherosclerotic cardiovascular event of 3 percent (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/107063.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The second patient is a 50-year-old, diabetic, African-American woman who smokes cigarettes, has a total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL, an HDL cholesterol of 35 mg/dL, and a systolic pressure of 135 mmHg. This patient has a predicted 10-year risk of having a major atherosclerotic cardiovascular event of 20 percent (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/107063.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>).</p><p></p><p>Usually, the relative risk reduction of a treatment is similar across different patients and populations with different baseline risk [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Thus, for both patients presented above, antihypertensive therapy would reduce the <strong>relative risk</strong> of cardiovascular events by 20 percent. However, the first patient would have an <strong>absolute risk</strong> reduction of 0.6 percent (from 3 percent to 2.4 percent), and the second patient would have an <strong>absolute risk</strong> reduction of 4.0 percent (from 20 percent to 16 percent).

This difference was due to differences in the rates of heart failure (1.4 versus 2.2 percent), myocardial infarction (2.2 versus 3.0 percent), and cardiovascular death (0.9 versus 1.5 percent). Among those with known cardiovascular disease at baseline, the risk of the primary endpoint was also lower (11.0 versus 13.3 percent), although this was not statistically significant.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intensive treatment also significantly reduced mortality (3.5 versus 4.6 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurred more frequently among patients assigned to intensive therapy (3.8 versus 2.3 percent) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].

Mild to moderate AKI does not typically warrant reduction of antihypertensive therapy unless hyperkalemia is also present [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In addition, the incidence of CKD (defined as a substantive decline in eGFR from ≥60 to &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) was higher in patients assigned intensive therapy (3.7 versus 1.0 percent) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. However, this excess of new-onset CKD in the intensive group was accompanied by decreased, rather than increased, levels of kidney injury biomarkers [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].

Thus, the rate of adverse events reported in SPRINT may be an underestimate of the adverse event rate that would be seen with intensive treatment in routine practice. In addition, patients in routine practice may require more antihypertensive medications than participants in SPRINT (the average was three in the intensive treatment group, and approximately one-fourth required four or more medications), and this could increase risk of adverse events.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Blood pressure in SPRINT was measured using attended and unattended AOBPM, which corresponds more closely with mean daytime blood pressure (using 24-hour ambulatory monitoring) than with the routine (casual) blood pressure measurements that are typically performed (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3879.html" rel="external">"Blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in adults", section on 'Technique of measurement'</a>). Routine systolic pressure measurements are usually higher than AOBPM measurements (by 5 to 15 mmHg). Thus, if clinicians use routine blood pressure measurement (the most common method in clinical practice) rather than AOBPM, then targeting a systolic pressure of &lt;120 mmHg is likely to increase the risk of hypotensive adverse events.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Most patients enrolled in SPRINT had diastolic pressures greater than 70 mmHg at baseline, and these pressures remained above 65 mmHg during the course of the trial in the majority, even in the intensive treatment group. By contrast, many older adults with isolated systolic hypertension have low diastolic pressure (ie, less than 60 to 65 mmHg) at baseline; such patients may not tolerate aggressive lowering of the systolic pressure, particularly those who have existing coronary artery disease. (See <a class="local">'Older adults with isolated systolic hypertension'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>In addition, high-quality meta-analyses found that more versus less intensive blood pressure lowering produced cardiovascular benefits [<a href="#rid30">30-33</a>]. As an example, a meta-analysis of 19 goal blood pressure trials (excluding SPRINT) combining 44,989 patients found a significant reduction in major cardiovascular events with more intensive as compared with less intensive blood pressure lowering (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.96) [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p>Evidence supporting lower blood pressure targets also comes from trials that examined the effects of adding an antihypertensive medication, as compared with placebo, to the existing regimen among patients with known cardiovascular disease and a baseline blood pressure that was already below 140 mmHg (using routine measurements).

In six trials, ACE inhibitor therapy (including HOPE, EUROPA, CAMELOT, and PEACE) significantly reduced both total mortality (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81-0.94) and nonfatal myocardial infarction (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73-0.94). A limitation to this meta-analysis is that it did not distinguish between angiotensin inhibition and lower attained blood pressure as the mechanism of benefit. This limitation was overcome in a 2011 meta-analysis that included 25 placebo-controlled trials with more than 63,000 patients in which active treatment consisted of all major classes of antihypertensive drugs, including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, or combination therapy [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. Drug therapy significantly lowered the risks of all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction to the same degree as in the earlier meta-analysis (pooled RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.95 and 0.80, 95% CI 0.69-0.93, respectively), suggesting that there was no specific benefit from therapy with angiotensin inhibitors compared with other antihypertensive drugs. Rather, the benefit seen likely resulted from blood pressure lowering. The absolute risk reductions in all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction were 14 and 13 per 1000 persons treated.</p><p>However, recommendations based upon SPRINT and these meta-analyses should <strong>not</strong> necessarily be applied to patients who are at low risk of having a cardiovascular event. In the Third HOPE trial (HOPE-3; discussed below), for example, patients at low or moderate risk for cardiovascular events whose blood pressure was &lt;140/&lt;90 mmHg did not benefit from antihypertensive therapy [<a href="#rid49">49</a>].

Thus, achieved blood pressure in these patients is frequently much lower than these thresholds.

The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was similar in the two groups. As was observed during the trial phase, there was no difference between groups in the progression of kidney disease (defined as doubling of the serum creatinine, a diagnosis of ESKD, or death). However, among patients with a baseline urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of greater than 0.22 (corresponding to absolute protein excretion of 300 mg/day; the median 24-hour protein excretion in these patients was approximately 1000 mg/day), there was a significant reduction in risk of progression with intensive blood pressure control (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.93).

The effect of more intensive blood pressure control on the incidence of ESKD depended upon whether or not patients had proteinuria (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41-0.85 in patients with proteinuria &gt;1 g/d and HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.83-1.32 in patients with lower amounts of proteinuria).

Individualization of blood pressure management is key in this population since the clinical benefit from intensive control is unlikely to be realized within one to two years [<a href="#rid79">79</a>]. We also individualize goals and share decision-making with patients and caretakers in those with postural hypotension, severe frailty, those with dementia, and/or in patients who are nonambulatory or institutionalized (eg, reside in a skilled nursing facility). </p><p>Goal blood pressure in older adults, measured using AOBPM, was examined in SPRINT [<a href="#rid80">80</a>]. SPRINT enrolled a subgroup of more than 2600 ambulatory adults aged 75 years or older with a baseline blood pressure of 142/71 mmHg (consistent with isolated systolic hypertension), including 349 categorized as being fit, 1456 as less fit, and 815 as frail according to a validated frailty index. At 3.1 years, rates of both the primary cardiovascular endpoint and all-cause mortality were significantly lower among those assigned more intensive (goal of &lt;120 mmHg; mean achieved systolic blood pressure 123) versus less intensive (goal of &lt;140 mmHg; mean achieved systolic blood pressure 135) systolic blood pressure lowering (2.6 versus 3.8 percent and 1.8 versus 2.6 percent, respectively). The benefit from more intensive blood pressure control was present in both fit and frail older adults. Serious adverse events were similar in the two treatment groups and did not depend upon frailty.</p><p>A meta-analysis of 10,857 hypertensive adults aged 65 years or older combined these results from SPRINT with three other large randomized goal blood pressure trials [<a href="#rid81">81</a>]. After a mean follow-up of 3.1 years, more intensive versus less intensive blood pressure lowering reduced the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (3.7 versus 5.2 percent), cardiovascular mortality (1.1 versus 1.7 percent), and heart failure (1.3 versus 2.0 percent). Rates of stroke and myocardial infarction were also lower, but the results were not statistically significant. Similarly, a subsequent trial of 199 high-risk hypertensive patients aged ≥75 years found that intensive blood pressure lowering (24-hour systolic pressure goal ≤130 compared with ≤145 mmHg) resulted in a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity at three years (4 versus 17 percent); in addition, all patients had hyperintense white matter lesions in the brain at baseline, and intensive therapy slowed the accrual of such lesions [<a href="#rid82">82</a>].</p><p>A large trial published after this meta-analysis assigned 8511 Chinese adults aged 60 to 80 years to either a more intensive (goal systolic pressure &lt;130 mmHg) or less intensive (systolic pressure &lt;150 mmHg) goal blood pressure strategy [<a href="#rid83">83</a>]. At baseline, mean age was 66 years, mean blood pressure was 146/82 mmHg, and 65 percent had a calculated Framingham Risk Score greater than or equal to 15 percent. Achieved systolic blood pressure, assessed using standardized office-based blood pressures  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115862" href="/z/d/graphic/115862.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), was 127 mmHg in the more intensive group and 136 mmHg in the less intensive group. At 3.3 years, the rates of stroke (1.1 versus 1.7 percent), acute coronary syndrome (1.3 versus 1.9 percent), and heart failure (0.1 versus 0.3 percent) were modestly decreased with intensive blood pressure lowering. All-cause mortality was not significantly different (1.6 versus 1.5 percent). Hypotension was more common in the intensive group, but other major adverse events (eg, syncope, fracture, worsening kidney function) were similar between the groups. The findings from this trial are generally consistent with those from SPRINT, although the population studied was lower risk at baseline and the difference in attained systolic blood pressure was smaller than in SPRINT.</p><p>Blood pressure goals may not be easy to achieve in older adults, particularly in those with a baseline systolic pressure greater than 160 mmHg. If attaining goal blood pressure proves difficult or overly burdensome for such patients, the systolic pressure that is reached with two or three antihypertensive agents (even if above target) may be a reasonable interim goal. Once maximally tolerated therapy is reached and blood pressure control remains suboptimal, then additional efforts to engage older adults in healthful lifestyle change can facilitate better blood pressure control.</p><p>One potential limitation to achieving goal blood pressure is that lowering the blood pressure may impair mental function, leading to manifestations such as confusion or sleepiness. In such patients, antihypertensive therapy should be reduced, and the systolic pressure should be allowed to rise to a level at which these symptoms resolve. More gradual and much slower lowering of blood pressure may then be pursued in an attempt to attain goal blood pressure [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2710374071"><span class="h4">Older adults with isolated systolic hypertension</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When treating older patients with isolated systolic hypertension, we and others suggest a minimum on-treatment diastolic pressure of 55 to 60 mmHg (using office-based blood pressure) [<a href="#rid84">84-86</a>].

There are two ways to performed high-quality, standardized office blood pressure measurement: automated oscillometric blood pressure monitoring (AOBPM), which requires specialized equipment, and standardized office-based measurement using proper technique  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115862" href="/z/d/graphic/115862.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), which requires only ordinary equipment. These two methods of measuring blood pressure in the office provide readings that approximate daytime ambulatory blood pressure (using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring [ABPM]) and self-measured (home) blood pressure monitoring. These four methods, while superior, are uncommonly performed and therefore are referred to as "non-routine."</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Although not the preferred method, the way blood pressure is typically obtained in the medical care setting, in which blood pressure is measured (usually once) with a stethoscope or oscillometric device, lacks proper patient preparation and proper technique. Although it is an inferior method of measurement, it is faster and potentially less cumbersome and is the one primarily used in clinical practice (and therefore is referred to as "routine" measurement).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Blood pressure targets differ depending upon the technique of measurement because "routine" methods typically provide higher blood pressure readings compared with the preferred, "non-routine" methods.
