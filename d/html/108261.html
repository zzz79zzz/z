In a nationally representative survey in the United States that identified pregnant and nonpregnant women with major depression, pregnant women were less likely to receive mental health treatment than nonpregnant women (49 versus 57 percent) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Untreated disease causes maternal suffering and is associated with poor nutrition, comorbid substance use disorders, poor adherence with antenatal care, postpartum depression, impaired relationships between the mother and her infant and other family members, and an increased risk of suicide [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>].</p><p>Barriers to treatment of antenatal depression include cost, reluctance to engage in treatment (eg, fear of exposing the fetus to antidepressant medication or lack of interest in psychotherapy), unavailability of clinicians, and stigma [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. In addition, many clinicians are uncomfortable prescribing medications because they lack sufficient experience and expertise [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], and the literature describing pharmacotherapy for antenatal depression is often inconsistent [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews choosing a specific treatment for mild to moderate episodes of antenatal unipolar major depression.

An episode of unipolar major depression is a period lasting at least two weeks, with five or more of the following nine symptoms: depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in most or all activities, insomnia or hypersomnia, change in appetite or weight, psychomotor retardation or agitation, low energy, poor concentration, guilt or thoughts of worthlessness, and recurrent thoughts about death or suicide  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994" href="/z/d/graphic/89994.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Additional information about the clinical presentation and diagnosis of unipolar major depression is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91774.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Clinical features"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1721.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3082779280"><span class="h2">Severity of illness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When selecting a treatment for antenatal major depression, clinicians should determine the severity of illness:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mild to moderate</strong> – Mild to moderate episodes of unipolar major depression are generally characterized by five or six depressive symptoms  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994" href="/z/d/graphic/89994.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), as indicated by a score &lt;20 points on the self-report Patient Health Questionnaire – Nine Item (PHQ-9)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307" href="/z/d/graphic/59307.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). However, the instrument includes items about changes in appetite, energy, and sleep, which may reflect the physical effects of pregnancy rather than depression. Additional information about the PHQ-9 is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14860.html" rel="external">"Using scales to monitor symptoms and treat depression (measurement based care)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with mild to moderate illness do not manifest suicidal behavior or obvious impairment of functioning and are less likely to develop complications such as psychotic features and catatonia, compared with patients who are severely ill. Mild to moderate depression can typically be managed in outpatient or partial hospital settings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Severe</strong> – Severe unipolar major depression is characterized by seven to nine depressive symptoms  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994" href="/z/d/graphic/89994.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), as indicated by a score ≥20 points on the PHQ-9  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307" href="/z/d/graphic/59307.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Severely ill patients often report suicidal ideation and behavior, typically demonstrate obvious impairment of functioning, and frequently manifest poor judgment that places the patient and others (including children) at risk for imminent harm [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In addition, patients with severe depression can develop complications such as psychotic features and catatonic features, and often have a history of severe or recurrent depressive episodes [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Patients with severe major depression should be referred to a psychiatrist for management and may require inpatient hospitalization [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>].</p><p></p><p>Difficulties may arise in determining the number of depressive symptoms that are present during pregnancy because changes in appetite, energy, and sleep may be due to depression, or may represent normal pregnancy-related changes. The presence of these somatic symptoms should be evaluated in the context of normal expectations for pregnancy. As an example, although food aversions can occur during pregnancy, patients with anorexia who fail to gain weight may have mild to moderate depression, and pregnant patients with anorexia who lose weight may have severe depression. In the same vein, pregnancy can cause fatigue. However, lack of energy to the point that patients need to make a significant effort to initiate or maintain usual daily activities can be a mild to moderate depressive symptom, and anergia to the point that patients cannot get out of bed for hours during the day is probably a symptom of severe depression. Persistent uncertainty as to whether an episode of major depression is mild to moderate or severe can be resolved by referral to a psychiatrist (preferably one specializing in perinatal disorders).</p><p>This topic discusses choosing a specific treatment for mild to moderate episodes of antenatal major depression.

Patients generally start with initial therapy and progress through each step until they respond. The best evidence supports using a structured psychotherapy such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) as the primary treatment. However, many patients receive antidepressant medications, and some patients receive psychotherapy plus an antidepressant. As part of treatment, all patients should receive psychoeducation about depression, with emphasis upon self-care including rest, time for self, adequate sleep, keeping a consistent schedule, minimizing stressors, and asking for and accepting support. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/108004.html" rel="external">"Unipolar major depression in pregnant women: Prevention and general principles of treatment", section on 'Educating patients and families'</a>.)</p><p>Continuation treatment is generally indicated for patients who respond to acute treatment of unipolar major depression, and additional maintenance treatment is indicated for patients with an increased risk of recurrence. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14674.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Continuation and maintenance treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H682789545"><span class="h2">Initial treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Initial treatment of mild to moderate episodes of antenatal unipolar major depression consists of pharmacotherapy (antidepressants) or psychotherapy. The choice depends upon multiple factors, including the patient’s history, preferences, and availability of treatment [<a href="#rid1">1,4,8,11-17</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with a prior history of unipolar major depression, we frequently use an antidepressant as initial treatment of antenatal major depression [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Antidepressants are also indicated if psychotherapy is not available, and for patients who prefer pharmacotherapy (eg, they previously responded well to antidepressants, they perceive psychotherapy as too time consuming, or they previously did not respond to psychotherapy).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients who present with mild to moderate antenatal unipolar major depression, and have no prior history of major depression, we recommend a structured psychotherapy as first-line treatment. We typically choose either CBT or IPT, which are likely to be most effective in patients who are psychologically minded. Ideally, the psychotherapy is modified for use in pregnant patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Psychotherapy is also a reasonable alternative to pharmacotherapy for patients who prefer it, including patients who were successfully treated in the past for major depression with antidepressants but have never received psychotherapy. Some pregnant patients prefer psychotherapy over pharmacotherapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Initial treatment of mild to moderate antenatal major depression with antidepressants is consistent with practice guidelines from the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments [<a href="#rid19">19</a>], and administering structured psychotherapy as initial treatment is consistent with multiple treatment guidelines, including those from the American Psychiatric Association, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [<a href="#rid17">17,19-22</a>].</p><p></p><p>It is important to assess the benefit of previous treatment to guide selection of a specific antidepressant or psychotherapy for antenatal major depression [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. If pharmacotherapy is indicated and the patient was successfully treated with a particular antidepressant prior to pregnancy, the same drug is typically used during pregnancy. Additional information about choosing an antidepressant for antenatal depression is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1703.html" rel="external">"Severe antenatal unipolar major depression: Choosing treatment", section on 'Initial treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Similarly, if structured psychotherapy is indicated and the patient was successfully treated with a particular psychotherapy prior to pregnancy, the same therapy generally is used during pregnancy. For patients who were not previously treated successfully with a structured psychotherapy, we typically choose either CBT or IPT. These two therapies have been more widely studied in perinatal populations than other psychotherapies, and are also the most widely studied in the general population of patients with depression. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1725.html" rel="external">"Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1725.html" rel="external">"Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment", section on 'Efficacy of psychotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>The specific choice between CBT and IPT is guided by availability and patient preference, as well as specific depressive symptoms:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients with prominent dysfunctional thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes (eg, “I’m going to be a terrible mother”), or marked symptoms of anxiety, we use CBT. For depression that includes marked inactivity, we use CBT that emphasizes behavioral activation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">CBT for major depression combines cognitive therapy and behavioral therapy. Cognitive therapy attempts to modify dysfunctional thoughts and illness beliefs; one technique is cognitive restructuring, which involves reframing distorted thoughts (eg, “I’m no good”) by empirically testing them and considering more benign explanations. Behavioral therapy aims to change problematic behaviors that occur in response to dysfunctional thoughts, depressive symptoms, and environmental stimuli; specific techniques include behavioral activation (counteracting inertia and avoidance by assigning rewarding activities for patients to complete between treatment sessions), problem solving (identifying the problem, generating multiple solutions, considering the consequences of each solution, choosing one solution, and acting upon it), progressive muscle relaxation, abdominal breathing exercises, and physical exercise.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the depressive syndrome occurs in the context of role disputes (conflicts with others over different expectations about the relationship, such as conflicts with one’s partner), role transitions (major changes in life roles or circumstances such as difficulty in adjusting to pregnancy), or grief, we suggest IPT. The therapy focuses upon improving problematic interpersonal relationships or circumstances that are directly related to the current depressive episode.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Additional information about IPT for unipolar depression in the general population is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15675.html" rel="external">"Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) for depressed adults: Indications, theoretical foundation, general concepts, and efficacy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14680.html" rel="external">"Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) for depressed adults: Specific interventions and techniques"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Structured psychotherapy for unipolar major depression is usually time-limited (eg, 6 to 10 sessions); thus, patients treated with CBT or IPT generally receive a full course of therapy, regardless if nonresponse persists through the middle phases of treatment.</p><p>If psychotherapy is indicated for mild to moderate episodes of antenatal unipolar major depression, and CBT and IPT are not available, a reasonable alternative is a different psychotherapy. (See <a class="local">'Treatment-refractory patients'</a> below.)</p><p>For mild to moderate episodes of antenatal major depression that are initially treated with pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy, we suggest also prescribing adjunctive treatments, depending upon patient preferences and availability. (See <a class="local">'Adjunctive treatments'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3199492258"><span class="h3">Relationship conflict</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For pregnant patients with mild to moderate depressive disorders that stem from poor family functioning and relationship problems, family/couples therapy may be used as a primary or adjunctive treatment, based upon randomized trials in patients who usually were not pregnant. Using couples therapy for mild to moderate antenatal major depression is consistent with practice guidelines from the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>During evaluations for family therapy, women should be assessed individually to assure privacy, particularly when screening for intimate partner violence, and again with her partner to assess any relationship discord. The assessment of families and efficacy and administration of family therapy are discussed separately.

(See <a class="local">'Unipolar major depression'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mild to moderate episodes of unipolar major depression are generally characterized by five or six depressive symptoms. Patients with mild to moderate illness do not manifest suicidal behavior or obvious impairment of functioning, are less likely to develop complications such as psychotic features, and can typically be managed in outpatient or partial hospital settings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Severe unipolar major depression is characterized by seven to nine depressive symptoms. Severely ill patients often report suicidal ideation and behavior, typically demonstrate obvious impairment of functioning, and often manifest poor judgment that places the patient and others at risk for imminent harm. In addition, patients with severe depression can develop complications such as psychotic features, and often have a history of severe or recurrent depressive episodes. Patients with severe major depression should be referred to a psychiatrist for management and often require inpatient hospitalization. (See <a class="local">'Severity of illness'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The general principles and issues involved in treating unipolar major depression during pregnancy include setting, history of prior treatment, educating patients and families, adherence, monitoring symptoms, prescribing antidepressants, managing nonresponse, and making referrals.

We typically choose either cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), which are likely to be most effective in patients who are psychologically minded.

These patients are generally treated with either antidepressants or a psychotherapy other than CBT or IPT, such as behavioral activation, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, or supportive psychotherapy.
