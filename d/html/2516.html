A variety of tumors, both malignant and benign, may arise within the small intestine. Malignant tumors include adenocarcinomas, neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoids), stromal tumors and other sarcomas, and lymphomas. Benign lesions that may arise in the small bowel include adenomas, leiomyomas, fibromas, and lipomas.</p><p>Metastatic lesions from malignancies such as melanoma, lung, breast, cervix, and colon can also involve the small bowel, as can neoplasms associated with polyposis syndromes such as familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome or Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and diseases such as Crohn and celiac disease. These are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2593.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2533.html" rel="external">"Peutz-Jeghers syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4070.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4774.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults"</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis and staging of small bowel tumors will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of the specific types of tumors are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2517.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical features, and types of small bowel neoplasms"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2509.html" rel="external">"Treatment of small bowel neoplasms"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4055480269"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Typically, patients with small intestinal tumors of any type present either with an incidental mass on abdominal imaging or after developing signs and/or symptoms of intestinal disease.</p><p>These may include one or more of the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abdominal pain</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Small bowel obstruction (manifesting as nausea and/or vomiting or, in the case of a duodenal primary, the additional symptom of jaundice)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bleeding (manifesting as overt bleeding or unexplained iron-deficiency anemia)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anorexia and/or unintentional weight loss</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bowel perforation (manifesting as acute abdominal pain and signs and symptoms of peritoneal infection)</p><p></p><p>In addition, patients with lymphoma may present with systemic "B" symptoms (ie, fever, weight loss, drenching night sweats). Malignant tumors are more likely to be symptomatic as compared with benign lesions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2517.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical features, and types of small bowel neoplasms", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4695.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and initial evaluation of non-Hodgkin lymphoma", section on 'Systemic "B" symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>The variable nature of the presenting symptoms, combined with the general lack of physical findings, can contribute to a delay in diagnosis in many cases. Prior to the advent of specific small bowel imaging and endoscopic techniques, lag time between initial presentation and diagnosis could be significant, with a reported mean of 18 months for malignant tumors and three years for benign lesions in some studies [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. More recently, an analysis in patients with localized small bowel adenocarcinoma noted a much shorter median time from initial medial evaluation to diagnosis (31 days, range 1 to 390 days) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. However, even in contemporary series, the appropriate discovery of small bowel neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) can take up to 36 months for definitive diagnosis [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Neuroendocrine tumors'</a> below.)</p><p>As prognosis is closely linked to disease extent for all of the major malignant small bowel tumors, early detection and treatment can contribute to a favorable outcome [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. However, given the nonspecific nature of the presenting symptoms, a high index of suspicion is essential for early diagnosis and treatment [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3486492273"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with symptoms suggestive of a small bowel neoplasm and patients with an incidental finding on cross-sectional imaging done for another reason where a small bowel tumor is part of the differential diagnosis should undergo a complete history and physical examination. A minimum laboratory workup should include a complete blood count with differential, measurement of serum electrolytes, liver function tests, and fecal occult blood test as warranted.</p><p>The specific components of the subsequent diagnostic and staging workup depend on the clinical presentation, and are addressed in the following sections. For most patients, we base our initial workup on the clinical presentation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2015722850"><span class="h2">General approach to patients with suggestive symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is no single method that is recommended as best for imaging of the small intestine in a patient with a suspected small bowel tumor. Dedicated small bowel cross-sectional imaging using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endoscopic techniques including video capsule endoscopy (VCE), push enteroscopy, and device-assisted enteroscopy (double balloon and single balloon enteroscopy or spiral enteroscopy) are options that may be complementary in establishing a diagnosis. One retrospective study of 257 patients with localized small bowel adenocarcinoma showed that in 197 patients whose diagnostic modalities were known, the diagnosis was made by endoscopy in 38 percent, during surgery in 35 percent, with radiographic imaging in 21 percent, and via VCE in 6 percent [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. A single diagnostic procedure, however, may be insufficient for a definitive diagnosis, and multiple tests may be needed sequentially to evaluate the small intestine adequately.</p><p>Although there is no established best initial testing strategy or sequence of diagnostic tests in general, for patients with a suspected small bowel tumor, it is reasonable to start with the least invasive modality such as VCE if there are no obstructive symptoms, or with dedicated cross-sectional imaging, if obstructive symptoms are present [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. However, guidelines are not definitive on this issue. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2662.html" rel="external">"Wireless video capsule endoscopy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2652.html" rel="external">"Overview of deep small bowel enteroscopy"</a>.)</p><p>A suggested approach to patients with specific symptoms is outlined in more detail below. (See <a class="local">'Our approach to patients with specific symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3382567450"><span class="h2">Patients with incidental findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because of the rarity of small intestinal neoplasms, there is no recommended population-based screening for any of the tumors that arise in the small bowel. Thus, incidental tumors tend to be detected only in the setting of cross-sectional imaging being performed for unrelated reasons (eg, back pain, kidney stones). In this setting, our diagnostic approach is outlined in the algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef133178" href="/z/d/graphic/133178.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) and summarized below:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If imaging suggests a small intestinal mass and there is no evidence of metastatic disease, we recommend the appropriate endoscopic evaluation (esophagogastroduodenoscopy [EGD], push enteroscopy, ileocolonoscopy, or device-assisted enteroscopy depending on the location of the lesion) in order to visualize the mass and obtain tissue for pathologic diagnosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">EGD is typically only able to examine through the second portion of the duodenum, while push enteroscopy can advance into the most proximal parts of the jejunum. Ileocolonoscopy allows examination of the most distal part of the ileum (terminal ileum). Because of its capacity to advance deeply into the small bowel, device-assisted enteroscopy may be the endoscopic procedure of choice. From an antegrade (oral) approach, it may reach as far as the distal jejunum and proximal ileum, and from a retrograde (anal) approach, this technique may allow access to the mid-distal ileum. The success of deep enteroscopy, however, is variable even in expert hands, depending on patient anatomy, endoscopic approach, endoscopist experience and skills, and available facilities. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13928.html" rel="external">"Overview of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13927.html" rel="external">"Overview of colonoscopy in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2652.html" rel="external">"Overview of deep small bowel enteroscopy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If endoscopic evaluation is complete and unremarkable, and if suspicion for invasive malignancy is low, we recommend close follow-up with short-interval (eg, three months) cross-sectional imaging.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If endoscopic evaluation is incomplete, and there is no evidence of obstruction, VCE is recommended for visualization of areas not accessed by endoscopy, although tissue cannot be sampled using this approach.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If suspicion is high for an invasive malignancy, options for further workup include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>CT enterography.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Integrated fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/CT (FDG PET/CT).<em> </em>This study may be helpful for lesions that are of sufficient size to be functionally detected, generally &gt;1 cm. However, FDG uptake can also occur with inflammation, and PET scanning generally does not help narrow the differential diagnosis. (See <a class="local">'Integrated PET/CT'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Somatostatin receptor-based imaging (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="108440" href="/z/d/drug information/108440.html" rel="external">Gallium Ga-68 DOTATATE</a> PET). This study may be helpful for suspected small bowel neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), but we generally reserve this approach for symptomatic patients with diarrhea and/or cutaneous flushing in whom there is suspicion for carcinoid syndrome, especially if the results of cross-sectional imaging are consistent with this diagnosis. (See <a class="local">'Our approach to patients with specific symptoms'</a> below and <a class="local">'Somatostatin receptor-based imaging'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Intraoperative enteroscopy (IOE) or laparoscopy/surgical exploration.

(See <a class="local">'Tumor markers'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H786082344"><span class="h2">Our approach to patients with specific symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our approach to symptomatic patients depends on the predominant symptom.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2490424932"><span class="h3">Abdominal pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Abdominal pain of variable duration and quality is the most common symptom of a small bowel neoplasm (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2517.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical features, and types of small bowel neoplasms"</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If there is suspicion that abdominal pain is due to a small bowel neoplasm, the initial evaluation should include cross-sectional imaging (ie, CT abdomen/pelvis) with intravenous (IV) contrast, provided no contraindications exist. This is often performed shortly after presentation, especially in acute care settings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If there is no apparent small bowel lesion or apparent metastatic disease, and suspicion remains high for a neoplasm, direct endoscopy (EGD and/or colonoscopy) may be the next step. Malignancies of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract and colon are more common than small bowel tumors and should be excluded as a source of abdominal pain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If a lesion is identified, it must be biopsied to allow for accurate diagnosis and to guide management. Biopsy should use the least invasive means possible; percutaneous biopsy may be used to sample suspected metastases, and an endoscopic approach may be used to biopsy a putative primary. If a lesion is accessible with a push enteroscopy or ileocolonoscopy, these procedures should be employed. If the lesion is deeper in the small bowel, device-assisted enteroscopy is the recommended approach depending on the patient's clinical status and available resources. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2652.html" rel="external">"Overview of deep small bowel enteroscopy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If no lesion is identified on cross-sectional imaging or direct endoscopies and suspicion remains high for a neoplasm, VCE may be used as the next step, as long as obstructive symptoms are absent, but tissue cannot be obtained using this approach.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Notably, despite advances and expansions in available diagnostic modalities that target the small bowel, there remains a distinct possibility that these measures may not establish a definitive diagnosis. In such cases, if a strong suspicion for invasive cancer (eg, persistent unexplained abdominal pain, iron-deficiency anemia, weight loss) remains, surgical referral may be appropriate for consideration of diagnostic laparoscopy/surgical exploration or intraoperative enteroscopy. However, if suspicion for malignant etiology is low, follow-up imaging and/or endoscopy with evaluation of blood counts and complete metabolic panel within 6 to 12 weeks may also be reasonable.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2499912827"><span class="h3">Unintentional weight loss/anorexia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The differential diagnosis for unintentional weight loss/anorexia is broad in the absence of any other common symptoms mentioned above. The overall approach is reviewed in detail elsewhere.

The differential diagnosis should also include lesions extrinsic to the small bowel (eg, adenopathy, hernia, volvulus, adhesions from prior small bowel surgery), and non-malignant intrinsic causes (eg, intramural hemorrhage, intussusception)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53183" href="/z/d/graphic/53183.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8037.html" rel="external">"Etiologies, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms typically include abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, early satiety, and constipation, although watery overflow diarrhea is possible with high-grade partial obstructions. Typically, patients will present in the acute care setting and have cross-sectional imaging (often CT abdomen/pelvis) already performed showing a transition point at the site of the primary with or without clear evidence of a mass. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8037.html" rel="external">"Etiologies, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults"</a>.)</p><p>As the majority of bowel obstructions do not reflect malignant disease, initial steps include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Detailed review of radiographic imaging for areas that are concerning for a mass or regional lymph nodes at the site of obstruction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Careful assessment of patient's history regarding clinical symptoms and signs concerning for malignancy, including unexplained iron-deficiency anemia or chronic weight loss, cutaneous flushing, or the presence of "B" type systemic symptoms (ie, fever, night sweats, weight loss) that may raise concern for lymphoma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4743.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of primary gastrointestinal lymphomas"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>For proximal or very distal masses in the small bowel, EGD and/or ileocolonoscopy can be conducted for examination, biopsy, and definitive diagnosis. Push enteroscopy and device-assisted enteroscopy techniques can be considered if EGD/ileocolonoscopy are unrevealing, but VCE is contraindicated and should be strictly avoided in patients with suggestion of small bowel obstruction to avoid retention and impaction of the capsule at the site of obstruction. Capsule retention may necessitate surgical or endoscopic retrieval. (See <a class="local">'Enteroscopy'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2662.html" rel="external">"Wireless video capsule endoscopy", section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1">Most patients with neoplastic tumors presenting with obstruction will require definitive or palliative surgical intervention; however, those patients diagnosed with small intestinal lymphoma are likely to respond rapidly to induction chemotherapy, thus supporting the effort to determine histologic diagnosis in the least invasive manner possible. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16228.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of limited stage diffuse large B cell lymphoma", section on 'Other extranodal sites'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4710.html" rel="external">"Treatment of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma)", section on 'Small intestine MZL'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4218676105"><span class="h3">Bowel perforation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bowel perforation is a rare presenting symptom of small bowel neoplasm. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2517.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical features, and types of small bowel neoplasms"</a>.)</p><p>In most cases, the patient will present in the acute care setting and have cross-sectional imaging (often CT abdomen/pelvis) already performed showing intraperitoneal free air, evidence of abscess associated with the intestinal wall, signs of peritonitis, with or without clear evidence of a mass. Further diagnostic studies are not generally indicated, and endoscopy, in particular should be generally avoided.</p><p>Most patients will be managed surgically to repair the defect. Some are managed conservatively if evidence suggests spontaneous closure of the perforation or if there are patient-specific medical comorbidities precluding surgery, or if goals of care do not support surgical intervention. Tissue should be obtained at the time of surgery to provide a histologic diagnosis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3718758893"><span class="h3">Chronic diarrhea with or without cutaneous flushing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with well-differentiated NETs often present with symptoms similar to those of other small bowel tumors.
