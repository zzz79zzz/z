The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019 [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</p><p>In children, COVID-19 is usually mild. However, in rare cases, children can be severely affected, and clinical manifestations may differ from adults. In April of 2020, reports from the United Kingdom documented a presentation in children similar to incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD) or toxic shock syndrome [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. Since then, there have been reports of similarly affected children in other parts of the world [<a href="#rid4">4-11</a>]. The condition has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C; also referred to as pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome [PMIS], pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 [PIMS-TS], pediatric hyperinflammatory syndrome, or pediatric hyperinflammatory shock).</p><p>The epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of MIS-C will be discussed here. The management and outcome of MIS-C and other aspects of COVID-19 in children and adults are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129614.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) management and outcome"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127488.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis in children"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128389.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management in children"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/126981.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Epidemiology, virology, and prevention"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128323.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Clinical features"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128404.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127501.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127429.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management in hospitalized adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127926.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Hypercoagulability"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127759.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Evaluation of adults with acute illness in the outpatient setting"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/139068.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management of adults with acute illness in the outpatient setting"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Understanding of COVID-19 and MIS-C continues to evolve.

(See <a class="local">'Society guideline links'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H825178150"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While the incidence of MIS-C is uncertain, it appears to be a relatively rare complication of COVID-19 in children, occurring in &lt;1 percent of children with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In one report from New York State, the estimated incidence of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in persons &lt;21 years old was 322 per 100,000, and the incidence of MIS-C was 2 per 100,000 [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. However, the epidemiology of MIS-C may shift due to widespread exposure in the pediatric population with subsequent waves of COVID-19, especially the Omicron variant, as well as increasing vaccination rates [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Some data suggest that MIS-C is less common and less severe with the Omicron variant compared with earlier variants [<a href="#rid16">16-21</a>]. Accumulating evidence also suggests that vaccination for COVID-19 is rarely associated with development of MIS-C and may protect against it [<a href="#rid22">22-24</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129614.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) management and outcome", section on 'Vaccination for COVID-19'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129849.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Vaccines", section on 'History of SARS-CoV-2 infection'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129849.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Vaccines", section on 'Children'</a>.)</p><p>The initial reports of MIS-C emerged from the United Kingdom in April 2020 [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. Since then, there have been reports of similarly affected children in other parts of the world, including Europe, Canada, the United States, and South Africa [<a href="#rid4">4-6,8-11,14,25-28</a>]. Notably, there have been disproportionately few reports of MIS-C from China and other Asian countries with high rates of COVID-19 early in the pandemic [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p>While some children with MIS-C meet criteria for complete or incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD) (see <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below), the epidemiology differs from that of classic KD. Most MIS-C cases have occurred in older children (≥5 years of age) and adolescents [<a href="#rid2">2,8-11,16,25,26,30,31</a>]. Black and Hispanic children were initially disproportionally affected [<a href="#rid11">11,14,32</a>], although this was probably due to increased risk of exposure to and infection with SARS-CoV-2, not increased risk for MIS-C, since rates have varied with subsequent waves [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. By contrast, classic KD typically affects infants and young children and has a higher incidence in East Asia and in children of Asian descent. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6416.html" rel="external">"Kawasaki disease: Epidemiology and etiology", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>The epidemiology of MIS-C also differs from that of severe acute COVID-19 illness in children, which more often occurs in children with underlying health problems. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127488.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis in children", section on 'Risk factors for severe disease'</a>.)</p><p>The first report of MIS-C was a series of eight children seen at a tertiary center in South East England [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In subsequent larger case series from the United Kingdom and the United States, &gt;70 percent of affected children were previously healthy [<a href="#rid11">11,32</a>]. The most common comorbidities were obesity and asthma. The median age was 8 to 11 years (range 1 to 20 years). There have been rare reports of an illness resembling MIS-C occurring in adults [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127933.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Care of adult patients with systemic rheumatic disease", section on 'COVID-19 as a risk factor for rheumatologic disease'</a>.)</p><p>There is a lag of several weeks between the peak of COVID-19 cases within communities and the rise of MIS-C cases [<a href="#rid8">8,9,11,14,34</a>]. For example, in London, the peak of COVID-19 cases occurred in the first to second weeks of April, while the spike of MIS-C cases occurred in the first to second week of May [<a href="#rid9">9,34</a>]. This three- to four-week lag coincides with the timing of acquired immunity, suggesting that MIS-C represents a postinfectious complication of the virus rather than acute infection.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2173907406"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pathophysiology of MIS-C is not well understood.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Immune dysregulation</strong> – It has been suggested that the syndrome results from an abnormal immune response to the virus, with some clinical similarities to Kawasaki disease (KD), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and cytokine release syndrome. However, based on the available studies, MIS-C appears to have an immunophenotype that is distinct from KD and MAS [<a href="#rid35">35,36</a>]. The exact mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers the abnormal immune response are unknown. A postinfectious process is suggested based on the timing of the rise of these cases relative to the peak of COVID-19 cases in communities, as discussed above. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Preliminary studies suggest that patients with severe MIS-C have persistent immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies with enhanced ability to activate monocytes [<a href="#rid37">37</a>], persistent cytopenias (particularly T cell lymphopenia) [<a href="#rid35">35,36,38</a>], and greater activation of CD8+ T cells [<a href="#rid38">38</a>] that differ from findings in acute COVID-19 infection. The certainty of these findings is limited due to the small number of patients in these studies.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Understanding the mechanisms of the exaggerated immune response in MIS-C is an area of active investigation. The pathophysiology of KD, MAS, and cytokine release syndrome are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6416.html" rel="external">"Kawasaki disease: Epidemiology and etiology", section on 'Immunologic response'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/118012.html" rel="external">"Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)", section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>SARS-CoV-2 virus</strong> – Many affected children have negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 but have positive serology, a finding that further supports the hypothesis that MIS-C is related to immune dysregulation occurring after acute infection has passed. However, some children do have positive PCR testing. In the early case series, there were 783 children in whom both PCR and serology were performed [<a href="#rid8">8,9,11,27,30,39</a>]. Of these, 60 percent had positive serology with negative PCR, 34 percent were positive on both tests, and 5 percent were negative on both tests.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A study examining SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences from 11 children with MIS-C did not detect any differences compared with the viral sequences from children with acute COVID-19 without MIS-C [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. These preliminary data suggest that viral factors are less likely to explain why some children develop multisystem inflammation following SARS-CoV-2 infection, while others do not. It is more likely that host factors are responsible for the abnormal inflammatory response in MIS-C.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Additional details of the virology of SARS-CoV-2 and the immune response are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/126981.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Epidemiology, virology, and prevention", section on 'Virology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mechanisms of myocardial injury</strong> – The mechanisms of myocardial injury in MIS-C are not well characterized. Possible causes include injury from systemic inflammation, acute viral myocarditis, hypoxia, stress cardiomyopathy, and, rarely, ischemia caused by coronary artery (CA) involvement [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. Cardiac dysfunction may result from a combination of these mechanisms in some patients. Given the variability in clinical presentation, it is likely that different mechanisms are responsible in different patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">There are limited data characterizing cardiac histopathology in MIS-C. In a report of a fatal case of MIS-C, autopsy findings were notable for evidence of myocarditis, pericarditis, and endocarditis characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in cardiac tissue by electron microscopy and PCR. However, some clinical features in this patient were uncharacteristic of MIS-C (most notably, there was severe pulmonary involvement), and it is possible that these autopsy findings are more reflective of severe acute COVID-19 rather than MIS-C. As discussed below, there is considerable overlap in the presentation of MIS-C and severe acute COVID-19. (See <a class="local">'Spectrum of disease'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Mechanisms of myocardial injury in adult patients with COVID-19 are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129342.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Cardiac manifestations in adults", section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2589496221"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3805400458"><span class="h2">Onset of symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In children who have a known history of documented or suspected COVID-19, the usual duration between acute infection and onset of MIS-C symptoms is two to six weeks. However, rare cases of MIS-C occurring &gt;6 weeks after the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. In such cases, thorough investigation for other causes of the presentation needs to be undertaken. In many cases in 2020, the duration of time between acute infection and onset of MIS-C symptoms was unknown because the child was asymptomatic at the time of acute infection. However, due to increased surveillance testing, patients in the later surges of MIS-C more often knew about their exposure and/or date of positive testing. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2441860344"><span class="h2">Presenting symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The relative frequencies of various presenting symptoms in the available case series were as follows  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef128294" href="/d/graphic/128294.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid9">9,11,14,27,31,32,44-47</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fever, usually persistent (median duration four to six days) – 100 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea) – 60 to 100 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rash – 45 to 76 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Conjunctivitis – 30 to 81 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mucous membrane involvement (red or swollen lips, strawberry tongue) – 27 to 76 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Neurocognitive symptoms (headache, lethargy, confusion) – 29 to 58 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Respiratory symptoms – 21 to 65 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sore throat – 10 to 16 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Myalgia – 8 to 17 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Swollen hands/feet – 9 to 16 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lymphadenopathy – 6 to 16 percent</p><p></p><p>Common presenting symptoms include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fever</strong> – Most patients present with three to five days of fever, though fewer days of fever have been reported.

However, in rare cases, children can be severely affected, and clinical manifestations may differ from adults. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is an uncommon complication of COVID-19 that is characterized by prominent cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and mucocutaneous signs and symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Epidemiology</strong> – MIS-C appears to be a relatively rare complication of COVID-19 in children. MIS-C can occur at any age from infancy through late adolescence, but most cases have occurred in previously healthy children between the ages of 6 to 12 years. Cases of MIS-C typically peak several weeks after surges of COVID-19 in the community. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pathophysiology</strong> – The pathophysiology of MIS-C is not well understood. It is thought to result from an abnormal immune response to the virus, with some clinical similarities to Kawasaki disease (KD), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and cytokine release syndrome. However, MIS-C appears to have an immunophenotype that is distinct from KD and MAS. Most affected children have positive serology for SARS-CoV-2 with negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a finding that further supports the hypothesis that MIS-C is related to immune dysregulation occurring after acute infection has passed. However, some children do have positive PCR testing. (See <a class="local">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical presentation</strong> – The clinical presentation of MIS-C may include persistent fevers, gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea), rash, and conjunctivitis. Patients typically present with three to five days of fever, followed by development of shock and/or multisystem involvement. Laboratory findings include lymphocytopenia, elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], D-dimer), and elevated cardiac markers (troponin, brain natriuretic peptide [BNP]). Other clinical findings are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef128294" href="/d/graphic/128294.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).
