         Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count below the lower limit of the reference range. Typically this is &lt;150,000/microL (&lt;150 x 10
         <sup>
          9
         </sup>
         /L) for adults. (See

          "Laboratory test reference ranges in adults", section on 'Platelet count'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Thrombocytopenia severity can be further subdivided by platelet count [
         <a href="#rid1">

         </a>
         ]:

        <p>
         However, these numbers must be interpreted (and the cutoffs may be adjusted) depending on the underlying disease. As an example, in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) we consider a platelet count &lt;30,000/microL to represent severe thrombocytopenia. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6676.html" rel="external">
          "Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Thrombocytopenia'

        </p>
        <p>
         Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;30,000 to 50,000/microL) confers a greater risk of bleeding and implies a greater likelihood for needing treatment, but the correlation between the platelet count and the risk of bleeding varies according to the underlying condition and may be unpredictable.

          Findings
         </strong>
         – Platelet counts are fairly stable over time in healthy individuals but vary between individuals. This is because total platelet mass, rather than platelet count, is regulated. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6672.html" rel="external">

         A study of serial platelet counts in 3789 individuals found that &lt;0.1 percent of the participants had variation in platelet count by &gt;98,000/microL [

         A study from the United States involving &gt;12,000 adults in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database found consistency in platelet counts across the general population with a tendency toward higher values in females, younger adults, and some people of color [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3

         ]. The reasons are not clear and may reflect higher rates of iron deficiency in these individuals (iron deficiency anemia can increase the platelet count); we do not endorse different platelet count ranges for different populations.

          Implications

         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         The wide normal range between individuals and the narrow normal range within each individual have implications for evaluating any individual patient's platelet count:

         A small proportion of the healthy population (approximately 2.5 percent) will have a baseline platelet count &lt;150,000/microL because platelet counts are normally distributed and reference ranges typically include two standard deviations above and below the mean.
        </p>

          •
         </span>
         An individual can have a significant decrease in platelet count and still be within the 'normal' range and thus not be flagged as abnormal. As an example, a drop in platelet count from 400,000 to 200,000/microL is concerning, even though the value is still ≥150,000/microL. Such a reduction may be clinically significant and requires evaluation. At a minimum, the platelet count should be repeated.

         These issues highlight the importance of obtaining previous platelet counts to determine whether the count is stable or trending downward. (See

         Bleeding is a concern in patients with severe thrombocytopenia. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Severity of thrombocytopenia'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the correlation between platelet count and bleeding risk is relatively weak. In addition, platelet dysfunction and coagulation abnormalities play an important role in bleeding risk.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinical predictors of bleeding include prior bleeding episodes, the presence of wet purpura, and hematuria. Studies have documented increased bleeding risk in individuals with ITP who have oral purpura and in individuals with a hematologic malignancy who have hematuria [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. (See

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The concept of a "safe" platelet count is imprecise, lacks evidence-based recommendations, and depends on the disorder and on the patient (even with the same disorder) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. The following may be used as guides but should not substitute for clinical judgment based on individual patient and disease factors:

         Surgical bleeding is generally not a concern with platelet counts &gt;50,000/microL (&gt;100,000/microL for some high-risk procedures such as neurosurgery or major cardiac or orthopedic surgery). Some procedures may be safely performed at lower platelet counts. Examples include certain dermatologic procedures, cataract surgery, and bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. The decision to proceed with a procedure also depends on the chronicity of the thrombocytopenia and the urgency of the procedure.

         Severe spontaneous bleeding is rare; it is most likely with platelet counts &lt;20,000/microL, especially &lt;10,000/microL. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7918.html" rel="external">
          "Platelet transfusion: Indications, ordering, and associated risks", section on 'Prevention of spontaneous bleeding'

         </span>
         Bleeding risk in ITP may be slightly lower compared with other conditions for the same platelet count (eg, we are less concerned about bleeding in an individual with ITP and a platelet count of 30,000/microL than we are about bleeding in an individual with aplastic anemia and a platelet count of 30,000/microL).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Other factors may affect bleeding risk (eg, platelet dysfunction, coagulation abnormalities). Some inherited platelet function disorders are associated with thrombocytopenia and have bleeding out of proportion to the degree of thrombocytopenia due to platelet dysfunction. Similarly, patients with severe liver disease or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) may have a greater risk of bleeding from impaired coagulation than from thrombocytopenia. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6675.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         By contrast, most individuals with hemostatically normal platelets (as in ITP) do not have severe spontaneous bleeding even with low platelet counts. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6676.html" rel="external">

         Rarely, patients with thrombocytopenia are at risk for thrombosis rather than, or in addition to, bleeding. Most of these disorders are rare, but they are important to consider because urgent treatment may be needed to prevent life-threatening thrombosis.

          Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)
         </strong>
         – HIT is an uncommon complication of heparin exposure in which antibodies to a platelet factor 4 epitope induced by heparin can cause thrombocytopenia and platelet activation, leading to life-threatening venous and/or arterial thrombosis. This diagnosis should be considered in a patient recently exposed to heparin who develops thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, anaphylaxis, or skin reactions. Treatment involves immediate discontinuation of heparin and administration of a nonheparin anticoagulant. (See

It resembles spontaneous HIT in that there is no prior heparin exposure, and it is associated with life-threatening venous and/or arterial thrombosis.

         – Intraarterial devices such as cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuits, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) devices, and intraaortic balloon pumps (IABPs) are common causes of thrombocytopenia in hospitalized patients. Causes are multifactorial and include consumption and destruction within the circuit and others. (See

          Postoperative
         </strong>
         – Postoperative thrombocytopenia may occur if there is significant consumption of platelets during surgery or in wound healing. Dilutional thrombocytopenia may also contribute. This is generally a diagnosis of exclusion made when other causes of thrombocytopenia are absent and the platelet count gradually normalizes. (See

          Thrombosis
         </strong>
         – Large thromboses can consume platelets, causing transient thrombocytopenia. This typically occurs very early (within the first day or two) and is relatively mild, although more severe thrombocytopenia can occur. A series of four individuals with thrombocytopenia and an associated literature review documented platelet counts between 33,000 and 88,000/microL in the four with extensive venous thromboembolism (VTE) and platelet counts &lt;150,000/microL in 10 percent of historical patients with a pulmonary embolus (mean platelet count, 293,000/microL) [

          Fluid resuscitation or massive transfusion
         </strong>
         – Massive fluid resuscitation or massive transfusion without proportionate transfusion of platelets can cause thrombocytopenia. In massive transfusion, platelet counts are reduced in proportion to the number of red blood cell (RBC) units transfused in a 24-hour period [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17
         </a>

         Thrombocytopenia from splenic pooling of platelets is typically mild to moderate (in the range of 60,000 to 100,000/microL). Severe thrombocytopenia or bleeding in the setting of splenomegaly should prompt investigation for other causes. (See

         ). Petechiae are caused by red blood cell (RBC) extravasation from capillaries; they are asymptomatic, nontender, nonpalpable, and do not blanch under pressure. They are most dense in dependent areas where the hydrostatic pressure on the small superficial vessels is greatest, including the feet and ankles in ambulatory patients and the presacral area in bedridden patients. Petechiae are not found on the soles of the feet, where the vessels are protected by the strong subcutaneous tissue.

          Ecchymoses
         </strong>
         – Ecchymoses (bruises) are nontender areas of bleeding into the skin, usually with multiple colors due to extravasated blood (red, purple) and breakdown products of heme pigment (green, orange, yellow). Ecchymotic lesions characteristically are small, multiple, and superficial. They may develop without noticeable trauma and do not spread into deeper tissues.

         It can be helpful to document the extent of skin lesions (mark with a pen) to identify new lesions and/or expansion of existing lesions, which may signify persistent or worsening thrombocytopenia or may raise additional concerns about increased bleeding risk.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other sites of bleeding such as occult blood in the stool or hematuria require appropriate evaluation and treatment, regardless of the cause of thrombocytopenia. (See

          ITP
         </strong>
         – A presumptive diagnosis of ITP is made when the history, physical examination, and laboratory data do not suggest an alternative diagnosis. In a patient with incidentally discovered asymptomatic thrombocytopenia and a probable diagnosis of ITP, no further evaluation beyond the routine history, physical examination, CBC, review of the peripheral blood smear, metabolic panel, liver function tests, and testing for HIV and HCV infection is necessary. Antiplatelet antibody studies are not routinely done, and imaging studies are reserved for evaluation of suspected lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly on physical examination, or infection. (See

         In rare cases, severe reduction or absence of megakaryocytes with no other abnormalities may occur. This finding is most often reported in patients with SLE and may be due to an autoantibody directed against the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor or may be T cell-mediated. (See

         Thrombocytopenia by itself does not protect against venous or arterial thrombosis, and appropriate use of thromboprophylaxis or anticoagulants should not be withheld from a patient with mild to moderate thrombocytopenia (&gt;50,000/microL) if indicated. For patients with more severe thrombocytopenia, decisions are made on a case-by-case basis regarding the risks of bleeding and benefits of anticoagulation.

In general, procedures with a greater risk of bleeding are performed at higher platelet counts. While there is some flexibility in individual circumstances, anesthesiologists and surgeons performing these procedures will have the last word. General guidelines are presented separately. (See

Individuals with impaired platelet function may require platelet transfusions despite adequate platelet counts, depending on the procedure. Attention should also be paid to correcting coagulation abnormalities if present.

          Definition
         </strong>
         – Thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;150,000/microL [&lt;150 x 10
         <sup>
          9
         </sup>
         /L]) can be mild, moderate, or severe. We are most concerned about spontaneous bleeding with platelet counts &lt;10,000/microL and surgical bleeding with counts &lt;50,000/microL. Rarely, there is a risk of thrombosis rather than, or in addition to, bleeding. (See

         <strong>
          Laboratory testing
         </strong>

          Referral and bone marrow
         </strong>
         – Hematologist consultation is appropriate to confirm a new hematologic diagnosis or if the cause of thrombocytopenia is unclear, especially when urgent intervention is needed. Bone marrow evaluation may be helpful if the cause is unclear or a bone marrow disorder is suspected. (See

          Management
