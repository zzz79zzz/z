As an example, a prospective study enrolled pregnant women (n = 223); after controlling for potential confounding factors (eg, maternal age, gestational age, and maternal postnatal depression), the analyses found that high levels of antenatal depressive symptoms were associated with decreased cognitive performance in children at age 18 months [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>However, other studies suggest that antenatal depression is not associated with diminished cognition in the offspring:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One prospective study included offspring (n = 27) of women with antenatal major depression who were not treated with antidepressants, and offspring (n = 98) of women without antenatal depression or exposure to antidepressants [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].

Whereas controls performed as expected, performance was altered in infants of depressed mothers [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A prospective study found that maternal antenatal symptoms of anxiety and depression, lasting for approximately 30 weeks, were associated with language delay in children age three years (n &gt;50,000) (relative risk 1.8, 95% CI 1.4-2.4) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The effect was independent of exposure to SSRIs during pregnancy and other potential confounders.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A prospective study included children of women who screened positive for antenatal depression but not postnatal depression (use of antidepressant drugs not specified, n &gt;1500), and children of women who screened negative for antenatal and postnatal symptoms (n &gt;8000). The children were screened for developmental delays, including language skills, at age 18 months [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Developmental delays were more likely to be observed in offspring of mothers with antenatal depressive symptoms than controls (odds ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-2.0).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H778459289"><span class="h3">Intelligence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multiple prospective studies suggest that prenatal depression is not associated with adverse effects upon intelligence in the offspring [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One observational study compared the intelligence of children (age three to six years) born to women with antenatal depression who were not treated with antidepressants (n = 54) and children of women who were healthy during pregnancy (n = 62) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The full scale intelligence quotients in children of depressed mothers and healthy mothers were comparable (108 and 112); verbal and performance intelligence quotients were also comparable.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study evaluated children of women with antenatal depressive symptoms (presumably not treated with antidepressants, n = 81), and children (n = 949) of women without antenatal depression; the children were tested at age three years [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].

However, the effect appeared to be mediated at least in part by unhealthy diets before and after delivery.

Several studies suggest that emotional and behavioral dysfunction is greater in the offspring of depressed pregnant women, compared with the offspring of nondepressed pregnant women [<a href="#rid1">1,4,7,14,15</a>]. As an example:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A prospective study followed a community cohort of mother-child dyads (nearly 8000) for up to 14 years, and controlled for potential confounding factors (such as obstetric outcomes [eg, birth weight and gestational age], parenting behavior, and postnatal depression) in the analyses [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Prenatal depression was associated with emotional problems (anxiety and/or depression) and behavioral problems (eg, ADHD, conduct disorder, and/or oppositional defiant disorder) in the children at age four years. In addition, the adverse effects persisted at age 13 years. However, the use of medications was not reported.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A prospective study comprised pregnant women (n &gt;2200) and their children, aged two to six years [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. After adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, maternal history of depression, use of psychotropics during pregnancy, and maternal and paternal postpartum depression), the analyses found that antenatal maternal depressive symptoms were associated with emotional and behavioral problems. This effect was most pronounced in women with consistently high depressive symptoms across pregnancy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One prospective study included children (n = 98) of women with prenatal depressive symptoms who were not treated with antidepressants, and children (n = 723) of women who did not have depressive symptoms and were not treated with antidepressants; the children were assessed at age four or five years [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. After adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, maternal age, smoking, and use of alcohol), the analyses found that behavioral problems were greater in the children exposed to prenatal depressive symptoms.</p><p></p><p>Although antenatal depression appears to be associated with impairment of general emotional and behavioral functioning, the observed effect is sometimes small:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A prospective observational study compared children born to women with antenatal depressive symptoms who were not treated with antidepressants (n = 231) and children of women who were healthy during pregnancy (n &gt;48,000); the children were assessed at age seven years [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Emotional and behavioral problems (eg, conduct and peer problems, and hyperactivity and inattention) were present in more children of women with antennal depressive symptoms than controls (4 versus 3 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A prospective study included pregnant women with prenatal depressive symptoms (n = 376) and pregnant women without clinically significant depression (n &gt;5500); none of the women were treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. After controlling for potential confounding factors (eg, maternal age, education, and postnatal depressive symptoms), affective problems were more common in children of mothers with depressive symptoms, compared with children of mothers without depression (odds ratio 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.8).</p><p></p><p>Both genetics and environmental influences (eg, the quality of parenting and effects of living in a household with depressed individuals) are probably involved in the association between antenatal depression and psychopathology in the offspring [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

In addition, the rate of depression was higher in grandparents, as well as aunts and uncles, of children with autism. However, the study did not report the use of antenatal antidepressants.</p><p></p><p>The studies that suggest prenatal maternal depression is associated with autism support the hypothesis that the association between antenatal exposure to SSRIs and autism in some observational studies is due to confounding by indication. If women with depression or other indications for SSRIs are more likely to have children with autism spectrum disorder, a false association between SSRI use and autism may be found in observational studies [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].
