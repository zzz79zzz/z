HBV infection is a global public health problem. It is estimated that there are more than 250 million HBV carriers in the world, of whom approximately 600,000 die annually from HBV-related liver disease. </p><p>The following topic review will summarize issues related to the management of HBV infection. The recommendations below are generally consistent with guidelines from the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines, Asian-Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines, and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guidelines [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. Clinical decisions regarding individual patients should be based upon patient-specific clinical information and test results.</p><p>Topic reviews that discuss the management of pregnant women and children with HBV infection, as well as the data supporting this section, are presented separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83476.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B and pregnancy"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5943.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hepatitis B virus infection in children and adolescents"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/116139.html" rel="external">"Management of hepatitis B virus infection in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/109973.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus: Case studies"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3661.html" rel="external">"Pegylated interferon for treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection"</a>.) </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3653.html" rel="external">"Entecavir in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3656.html" rel="external">"Tenofovir and adefovir for the treatment of chronic HBV infection"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2621326403"><span class="h1">ACUTE INFECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of acute HBV infection is based upon the detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60627 graphicRef60827" href="/d/graphic/60627.html" rel="external">table 1A-B</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69344" href="/d/graphic/69344.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Treatment of acute HBV depends upon the clinical setting. However, appropriate measures should be taken to prevent infection in all exposed contacts, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8520" href="/d/drug information/8520.html" rel="external">hepatitis B immune globulin</a> and hepatitis B vaccine should be administered to all household and sexual contacts who are not known to be immune. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3630.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, transmission, and prevention of hepatitis B virus infection", section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p>For most patients, treatment is mainly supportive. The likelihood of liver failure from acute HBV is less than 1 percent, and in immunocompetent adults, the likelihood of progression to chronic HBV infection is less than 5 percent [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. There are known subgroups of patients whose prognosis is relatively worse (eg, patients who are immunocompromised, have concomitant infection with hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus [HCV or HIV], have preexisting liver disease, or are older adults), but the role of antiviral therapy for such patients remains unsettled since few studies have addressed its benefits during acute infection.</p><p>As a general rule, we treat patients with a severe or a protracted course (eg, those who develop a coagulopathy [international normalized ratio (INR) &gt;1.5], those with persistent symptoms or marked jaundice [bilirubin &gt;3 mg/dL] for more than four weeks after presentation) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. We also treat patients with acute liver failure due to HBV to reduce the likelihood of reinfection post-liver transplant, should a liver transplant become necessary.</p><p>For those who require treatment, tenofovir or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8816" href="/d/drug information/8816.html" rel="external">entecavir</a> are acceptable options given as monotherapy. Treatment can be stopped after confirmation that the patient has cleared HBsAg (two consecutive tests four weeks apart). <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9544" href="/d/drug information/9544.html" rel="external">Lamivudine</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9488" href="/d/drug information/9488.html" rel="external">telbivudine</a> can also be used, as the duration of treatment is generally short. However, since severe exacerbations of chronic HBV in previously undiagnosed patients can be difficult to differentiate from acute HBV, tenofovir or entecavir are preferred. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8690" href="/d/drug information/8690.html" rel="external">Adefovir</a> is not typically used because of its weak antiviral activity, and interferon should be avoided because of the risk of bacterial infections and a further increase in hepatic necroinflammation in patients with severe hepatitis or acute liver failure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3341184351"><span class="h1">CHRONIC HEPATITIS B</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of chronic HBV infection is based upon the persistence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) for greater than six months. A number of risk factors for HBV infection have been identified, providing a rationale for screening  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55052" href="/d/graphic/55052.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51820" href="/d/graphic/51820.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3,5-7</a>]. A more detailed discussion of screening and diagnosis of HBV is found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3680.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus: Screening and diagnosis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3641.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus immunization in adults"</a>.)</p><p>The management of chronic HBV infection is complex and depends upon multiple factors including clinical variables (eg, the presence or absence of liver inflammation and/or cirrhosis), the patient's immunologic response to infection (eg, hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg] status), virologic factors (eg, the HBV viral load and genotype), and risk factors for disease progression (eg, age &gt;40 and family history of hepatocellular carcinoma).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Initial evaluation</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2830321264"><span class="h3">General approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial evaluation of patients with chronic HBV infection should include  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62875" href="/d/graphic/62875.html" rel="external">table 4</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A history and physical examination, emphasizing: risk factors for coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis delta virus (HDV), and/or HIV; use of alcohol; family history of HBV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); and signs and symptoms of cirrhosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Laboratory tests, including: a complete blood count with platelets, liver chemistry tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin), international normalized ratio (INR), and tests for HBV replication (HBeAg, antibody to HBeAg [anti-HBe], HBV DNA). Testing for immunity to hepatitis A virus (HAV) with HAV immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody should be performed in patients who are not known to be immune. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Evaluation for other causes of liver disease (eg, hemochromatosis, HCV, HDV) by testing for iron, total iron binding capacity, ferritin, and HCV antibody in all patients. For HDV, we screen patients with a history of injection drug use and those who migrated from countries where HDV is prevalent (eg, Southern or Eastern European countries); however, other experts suggest one-time screening for HDV in all patients with chronic hepatitis B. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3666.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hepatitis D virus infection"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Screening for HIV infection in those who have not undergone routine screening, and in those persons with ongoing risk factors for HIV (eg, injection drug use, multiple sexual exposures, men who have sex with men).

Noninvasive assessments of liver fibrosis, notably measurements of liver stiffness, are increasingly used instead of liver biopsies; however, liver stiffness can be influenced by inflammation as well as fibrosis, and therefore, liver stiffness measurements may overestimate liver fibrosis in patients with a high ALT (more than 100 units/L) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1239.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis: Overview of serologic tests and imaging examinations"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96717.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis: Ultrasound-based elastography"</a> and <a class="local">'Role of liver biopsy'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H271367753"><span class="h3">Role of liver biopsy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients will not need a liver biopsy. However, a liver biopsy may be useful in the following scenarios:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients who have persistently elevated ALT but persistently low HBV DNA to exclude other causes of liver disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients who do not meet criteria for treatment but are at risk for having histologically active or advanced liver disease that would benefit from treatment. These include patients who have ALT levels that are normal or mildly elevated (&lt;2 x the upper limit of normal [ULN]), an HBV viral load that is persistently elevated (eg, &gt;6 months), and one of the following risk factors:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Age &gt;40 years.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A family history of HCC.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">An elevated HBV DNA is considered &gt;2000 international units/mL (10<sup>4</sup> copies/mL) for HBeAg-negative patients or &gt;20,000 international units/mL (&gt;10<sup>5</sup> copies/mL) for HBeAg-positive patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A normal serum ALT level alone in patients with active viral replication does not predict mild or normal histologic findings [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. As an example, one report found that up to 37 percent of patients with persistently normal ALT and HBV DNA levels &gt;10,000 copies/mL (approximately &gt;2000 international units/mL) had significant fibrosis and inflammation on liver biopsy. On subgroup analysis, most such patients had an ALT in the high range of normal and were older than 40 years of age. By contrast, two studies in patients in the immune tolerant phase of chronic HBV infection found that despite high HBV DNA levels, most patients had no or minimal fibrosis [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The decision to obtain a liver biopsy should be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with a specialist in liver diseases. More detailed information on the approach to liver biopsy is presented elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3587.html" rel="external">"Approach to liver biopsy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3458586686"><span class="h2">Indications for antiviral therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The decision to initiate treatment is primarily based upon the presence or absence of cirrhosis, the ALT level, and the HBV DNA level  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58520" href="/d/graphic/58520.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). However, there are additional indications for patients with certain concurrent conditions, such as malignancy and pregnancy. (See <a class="local">'Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Pregnant women'</a> below and <a class="local">'Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients who are deemed <strong>not</strong> to be treatment candidates at presentation, and those who decide to defer treatment, should undergo monitoring of liver biochemical tests, HBV DNA, and HBeAg status since liver disease and/or HBV replication may become active later. The frequency of monitoring is described in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62875" href="/d/graphic/62875.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). These patients should also undergo HCC surveillance if indicated. (See <a class="local">'Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma'</a> below.)</p><p>Our approach is consistent with recommendations from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The AASLD, European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), and Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) guideline recommendations are very similar. However, there are minor differences related to the year of publication, the prevalence of HBV infection within the population, and the availability of resources [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3065210357"><span class="h3">Acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with life-threatening liver disease secondary to HBV should initiate antiviral therapy. This includes patients with acute liver failure (eg, fulminant acute HBV, severe exacerbation of chronic HBV), as well as those with decompensated cirrhosis and a detectable HBV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (regardless of the ALT level) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Such patients should also be evaluated for liver transplant. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4584.html" rel="external">"Liver transplantation in adults: Preventing hepatitis B virus infection in liver transplant recipients"</a>.)</p><p>Nucleos(t)ide analog treatment has been shown to stabilize liver disease, and in some cases reverse liver failure [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. Antiviral treatment also reduces the risk of recurrent HBV should these patients require liver transplantation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4584.html" rel="external">"Liver transplantation in adults: Preventing hepatitis B virus infection in liver transplant recipients"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3148217523"><span class="h3">Compensated cirrhosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with compensated cirrhosis and an HBV DNA &gt;2000 international units/mL (&gt;10<sup>4 </sup>copies/mL) should be treated with antiviral therapy regardless of the HBeAg status or the serum ALT level  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58520" href="/d/graphic/58520.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). Treatment should be considered even if HBV DNA levels are lower than 2000 international units/mL, since there are data showing that patients with cirrhosis and low HBV DNA levels have a higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma than those with undetectable HBV DNA levels [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1491214867"><span class="h3">Patients without cirrhosis</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2818821227"><span class="h4">HBeAg-positive (immune active phase)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For HBeAg-positive patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be initiated when the HBV DNA is &gt;20,000 international units/mL (&gt;10<sup>5</sup> copies/mL) and the ALT is &gt;2 x ULN  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58520" href="/d/graphic/58520.html" rel="external">table 5</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The ULN should be considered 35 U/L for males and 25 U/L for females; these levels should be used rather than individual laboratory cut-off levels. Treatment should be delayed for three to six months in newly diagnosed HBeAg-positive patients with compensated liver disease to determine whether spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion will occur. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3627.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus: Clinical manifestations and natural history", section on 'Phases of chronic HBV infection'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with chronic hepatitis whose serum ALT is persistently below 2 x ULN can be observed, considering treatment if and when the serum ALT becomes higher  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62875" href="/d/graphic/62875.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). Exceptions to this rule include: those who have recurrent hepatitis flares that fail to clear HBeAg, patients with icteric flares, those with active or advanced histologic findings (such as moderate/severe inflammation or bridging fibrosis/cirrhosis) or advanced fibrosis on noninvasive tests such as elastography, patients with extrahepatic manifestations (eg, HBV-related polyarteritis nodosa), patients above the age of 40 who remain HBeAg-positive with persistently high HBV DNA levels, those with a family history of HCC (there is a lower threshold for HBV DNA and ALT in these patients), and health care providers performing exposure-prone procedures (as required by local guidelines). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3630.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, transmission, and prevention of hepatitis B virus infection", section on 'Health care providers'</a>.)</p><p>Although treatment can lead to virus suppression in HBeAg-positive patients with normal ALT (immune tolerant phase), the likelihood of HBeAg seroconversion on treatment is low, and HBV DNA rebounds to baseline levels when treatment is stopped. The poor results are true for monotherapy as well as combination therapy with two nucleos(t)ide analogs or a nucleos(t)ide analog and pegylated interferon (PegIFN) [<a href="#rid18">18-20</a>]. In addition, despite high HBV DNA levels, the risk of HCC during follow-up to 10 years is low [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Thus, the benefits of long-term treatment in such patients, most of whom are young and Asian with perinatally acquired HBV infection, must be balanced against the risks of drug resistance, side effects, and costs, particularly since some of these individuals will undergo spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion and remain in remission for many years afterwards.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H761104648"><span class="h4">HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment may be initiated immediately once a diagnosis of HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis (ALT &gt;2 x ULN and HBV DNA &gt;2000 international units/mL) is established because sustained remission is rare in the absence of treatment.

In a systematic review that included 1716 patients with chronic HBV who discontinued oral therapy (of whom 18 percent had cirrhosis), virologic remission, defined as HBV DNA &lt;20,000 international units/mL, was maintained in 50 percent of patients after 12 months, 39 percent after 24 months, and 38 percent after 36 months [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].

In a systematic review that evaluated the duration of HBV DNA suppression after treatment discontinuation in 17 studies of HBeAg-negative patients who achieved virologic remission while on therapy, the probability of having virologic remission 12 months after discontinuing treatment was 51 percent when remission was defined as HBV DNA &lt;20,000 international units/mL [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].

We explain that several studies have evaluated the risk of virologic and clinical relapse in HBeAg-negative patients who have achieved virologic suppression for several years but continue to have detectable HBsAg [<a href="#rid42">42-47</a>]. While studies indicate that viral relapse (detection of HBV DNA by PCR assay) is nearly universal when the nucleos(t)ide analog is stopped prior to HBsAg clearance, regardless of specific patient characteristics [<a href="#rid42">42</a>], not all patients will experience clinical relapse (HBV DNA &gt;2000 international units/mL and ALT &gt;2 x ULN). In one study that evaluated 21 patients who stopped nucleos(t)ide analog therapy, 63 percent did not reinitiate therapy after almost three years of follow-up because they had an HBV DNA &lt;2000 international units/mL or HBsAg loss [<a href="#rid44">44</a>].

In a randomized trial in Europe that included 178 HBeAg-negative patients without cirrhosis who had HBV DNA suppression for ≥4 years on nucleos(t)ide analog therapy, HBsAg loss was observed at 96 weeks after randomization in 8 of the 79 patients (10 percent) who discontinued treatment and 0 of 79 who continued treatment; however, 35 percent of those who discontinued therapy experienced ALT flares, and 14 percent resumed treatment [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. Similarly, in a retrospective study of 1541 HBeAg-negative patients from North America, Europe, and Asia who discontinued nucleos(t)ide analog therapy (23 percent of whom were HBeAg positive at the start of treatment), the cumulative HBsAg loss was 14 percent after four years, with 50 percent having resumed treatment by year 4 [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. White individuals were six times more likely to lose HBsAg, while patients ≥50 years of age were more likely to resume treatment. In this study, 15 (1 percent) of patients experienced hepatic decompensation and 12 died; of these 12, 9 were liver related. These data indicate that, in select patients (HBeAg-negative and no cirrhosis), discontinuation of nucleos(t)ide analog therapy after ≥4 years of therapy may be associated with a higher rate of HBsAg loss, more so in White than in Asian patients, but over time, many will develop clinical relapse necessitating resumption of treatment. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Several new HBV markers including quantitative HBsAg level, HBV RNA level, and hepatitis B core related antigen (HBcrAg) level have been shown to be predictive of sustained clinical remission or HBsAg clearance after withdrawal of nucleos(t)ide analogs [<a href="#rid37">37,45,50</a>]. If a quantitative HBsAg level is obtained, a low level (&lt;100 international units/mL) at the time of treatment withdrawal is the best marker of HBsAg clearance.

(See <a class="local">'Choice of initial agent'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">For most patients who are initiating therapy with tenofovir, we recommend <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="110861" href="/d/drug information/110861.html" rel="external">tenofovir alafenamide</a> (25 mg daily), if available, rather than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9895" href="/d/drug information/9895.html" rel="external">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</a> (TDF) (300 mg daily) (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). Although there is more experience with TDF, tenofovir alafenamide appears to be equally effective and is associated with less renal and bone toxicity. In addition, for most patients who were originally started on TDF, we suggest switching to tenofovir alafenamide (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a class="local">'Nucleos(t)ide analogs'</a> above and <a class="local">'Choice of initial agent'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">There are special treatment considerations when choosing an antiviral agent for patients with decompensated cirrhosis or reduced kidney function and for women who are pregnant. (See <a class="local">'Choice of initial agent'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83476.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B and pregnancy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Patient monitoring</strong> – Patients should be monitored while on therapy to assess for virologic response and medication toxicity. Most patients receiving nucleos(t)ide analog therapy will require at least four to five years of treatment, and some may require indefinite treatment  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58520" href="/d/graphic/58520.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). (See <a class="local">'Monitoring on therapy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Duration and treatment endpoints'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients with persistent viremia</strong> – The management of patients with persistent viremia or breakthrough infection on therapy depends upon the viral load and the antiviral agent that was used. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Tenofovir- or entecavir-resistant virus is unlikely to emerge in treatment-naïve patients, and most cases of treatment failure are due to poor adherence. However, on rare occasion, a patient may need to be transitioned to an alternative agent. (See <a class="local">'While receiving tenofovir or entecavir'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>By contrast, drug-resistant virus is likely to develop in patients failing therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogs, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9544" href="/d/drug information/9544.html" rel="external">lamivudine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8690" href="/d/drug information/8690.html" rel="external">adefovir</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9488" href="/d/drug information/9488.html" rel="external">telbivudine</a>. For patients with persistent viremia or breakthrough infection on one of these agents, we recommend tenofovir rather than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8816" href="/d/drug information/8816.html" rel="external">entecavir</a> (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). Tenofovir is effective in suppressing HBV replication in this setting, whereas entecavir should generally be avoided since there is a high risk of entecavir resistance developing in patients with pre-existing drug-resistant virus after lamivudine or telbivudine treatment. (See <a class="local">'While receiving other nucleos(t)ide analogs'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient counseling</strong> – Patients with chronic HBV should receive counseling on ways to prevent worsening liver disease (eg, avoid alcohol use, hepatitis A vaccination) and to reduce transmission to others. In addition, screening for hepatocellular carcinoma is indicated for certain high-risk patients. (See <a class="local">'Counseling and prevention'</a> above and <a class="local">'Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Sarin SK, Kumar M, Lau GK, et al.
