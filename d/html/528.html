The best strategy for management of acute exacerbations of asthma is early recognition and intervention, before attacks become severe and potentially life-threatening. Detailed investigations into the circumstances surrounding fatal asthma have frequently revealed failures on the part of both patients and clinicians to recognize the severity of the disease and intensify treatment appropriately [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>The management of acute asthma exacerbations will be presented here.

Asthma action plans are based upon symptoms and peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements and provide clear instructions on how to detect and respond to changes in these parameters [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. An example is available through the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhlbi.nih.gov%2Fresources%2Fasthma-action-plan-2020&amp;token=NbVaTGtxQubNH6cOHdPGYiClrc9to%2Bn496F37zDge9XAjtKYIqvyYtXWLbDMn5Qe%2Bm2f1uYo6%2FVPgqvEExtHHK8AtSQsFLDSFqHlsS1NKKs%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=528" target="_blank">NHLBI Asthma action plan</a>).

For the latter group, a decrease in peak expiratory flow may be the first sign that asthma control is deteriorating. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23099126"><span class="h2">Symptoms and severity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Symptoms that patients should recognize as suggesting an asthma exacerbation include breathlessness, wheezing, cough, and chest tightness. Some patients also report reduced exercise tolerance and fatigue as symptoms of an asthma exacerbation. Patients who have long-standing asthma are generally able to determine when they have an exacerbation.</p><p>Patients who contact their clinician should be asked about the timing of onset, likely cause (if known), severity of symptoms (eg, provoked by exertion, present at rest, causing awakening from sleep), and risk factors for asthma-related death (ie, impaired lung function, oral glucocorticoid use, prior emergency department visits, hospitalization or intubation for asthma)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119887" href="/d/graphic/119887.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Symptoms of a severe exacerbation include intractable coughing, sensation of air hunger, inability to speak in complete sentences because of labored breathing, worsening respiratory distress when attempting to lie flat, and agitation. </p><p>Current medications and response to treatment of previous exacerbations should also be explored.</p><p>The symptoms of an asthma exacerbation are nonspecific, so the initial assessment should include assessment for other processes that might present with these symptoms, such as acute bronchitis, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or bronchiectasis, pneumonia, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and inducible laryngeal obstruction (also called vocal cord dysfunction). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/563.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of wheezing illnesses other than asthma in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23099132"><span class="h2">Peak expiratory flow</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Measurement of expiratory airflow with a peak expiratory flow (PEF) meter (or spirometer) provides an assessment of the severity of airflow limitation [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Peak flow measurements take less than one minute to perform and are safe and inexpensive. However, careful instruction is needed to obtain reliable measurements  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53856" href="/d/graphic/53856.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/568.html" rel="external">"Peak expiratory flow monitoring in asthma"</a>.)</p><p>Peak flow values can help patients and providers judge the severity of an asthma exacerbation and help guide decision-making regarding treatment and the preferred site of medical care (home, medical office, or emergency department). They provide useful adjunctive data to be combined with assessment of symptoms and physical findings. In our experience their greatest value is detection of severe airflow obstruction in a patient whose history and examination are deceptively benign. Failure to recognize severe airflow obstruction during an asthma exacerbation can result in undertreatment, with potentially life-threatening consequences.</p><p>Normal values for PEF differ with sex, height, and age  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57257 graphicRef62839" href="/d/graphic/57257.html" rel="external">table 3A-B</a>). Each patient should establish a baseline measure with which to compare future readings. A decrement in PEF of greater than 20 percent from normal, or from the patient's personal best value, signals the presence of an asthma exacerbation. The difference in PEF from the patient’s baseline helps one gauge the severity of the change. A PEF ≤50 percent of baseline should be considered a severe attack. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23099879"><span class="h2">Risk factors for fatal asthma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some patients are at greater risk for life-threatening and potentially fatal asthma attacks. It is helpful to identify such patients and to educate them about identifying early warning signs of deterioration based on PEF monitoring, following a prednisone-based action plan, and seeking emergency care promptly.

(See <a class="local">'Detecting an exacerbation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Algorithms for management</strong> – Approaches to the management of acute exacerbations of asthma at home and in the medical office are outlined in the algorithms  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef119823" href="/d/graphic/119823.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef119824" href="/d/graphic/119824.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). Patients should seek immediate emergency department care if they have symptoms or signs suggestive of a severe exacerbation (eg, marked breathlessness, inability to speak more than short phrases, use of accessory muscles) or a PEF ≤50 percent of baseline, or have risk factors for a fatal attack  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119887" href="/d/graphic/119887.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Need for urgent medical attention'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prompt initiation of therapy</strong> – Regardless of the treatment location (home or office), the following pharmacologic interventions are the cornerstone of therapy:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Fast-acting beta-agonist</strong> – For all patients with symptoms of an asthma exacerbation, we recommend prompt administration of a rapid onset (fast-acting) beta-agonist (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>), either in the form of a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) or the long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8946" href="/d/drug information/8946.html" rel="external">formoterol</a>. Formoterol has an onset of action comparable to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9396" href="/d/drug information/9396.html" rel="external">albuterol</a> and must be given in a combination inhaler with a glucocorticoid (GC). (See <a class="local">'Fast-acting bronchodilator'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><strong>SABA</strong> – The usual dose of SABA (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9396" href="/d/drug information/9396.html" rel="external">albuterol</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10215" href="/d/drug information/10215.html" rel="external">levalbuterol</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="140501" href="/d/drug information/140501.html" rel="external">albuterol-budesonide</a>) at home is two to four inhalations from a metered-dose inhaler (albuterol MDI 90 mcg/inhalation; levalbuterol MDI 45 mcg/inhalation) with a valved holding chamber ("spacer") or dry powder inhaler (albuterol DPI 90 mcg/actuation), while in the office four to six inhalations can be given. Albuterol or levalbuterol can also be given by nebulizer (2.5 mg or 1.25 mg, respectively). Dosing can be repeated every 20 minutes for one hour (three doses), as needed. (See <a class="local">'Short-acting beta-agonist'</a> above and <a class="local">'Inhaled short-acting beta-agonists'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><strong>Inhaled GC-formoterol</strong> – The usual dose of inhaled GC-formoterol for an acute exacerbation (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8524" href="/d/drug information/8524.html" rel="external">budesonide-formoterol</a> 80 mcg-4.5 mcg or 160 mcg-4.5 mcg) is one to two inhalations, which can be repeated every 20 minutes for one hour (6 inhalations/treatment; maximum 12 inhalations/day), if needed. (See <a class="local">'Combination glucocorticoid-formoterol'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Oral glucocorticoids</strong> – For patients whose symptoms have been recurrent over one to two days or do not improve after one to three doses of fast-acting beta-agonist and/or whose PEF remains &lt;80 percent of personal best or predicted, we recommend initiation of oral glucocorticoids (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). The typical initial dose is the equivalent of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> 40 to 60 mg orally. (See <a class="local">'Initiation of oral glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Trigger avoidance and monitoring response</strong> – Additional steps at home include removal from sources of potential triggers (eg, animal dander, tobacco smoke) and monitoring of medication response  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef119823" href="/d/graphic/119823.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Home treatment'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment in medical office</strong> – For patients who present to the medical office with an asthma exacerbation, a focused history and physical examination should be performed promptly and nearly concurrently with administration of the first dose of SABA  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef119824" href="/d/graphic/119824.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Office management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Signs of severe exacerbation</strong> – Patients with features of a severe or life-threatening asthma exacerbation (eg, breathless at rest, unable to speak in full sentences, heart rate &gt;120/minute, respiratory rate &gt;30/minute, PEF ≤50 percent of predicted or personal best, pulse oxygen saturation &lt;90 percent) should be urgently transferred to an emergency department. (See <a class="local">'Indications for urgent transfer to emergency department'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Supplemental oxygen</strong> – Supplemental oxygen should be titrated to a pulse oxygen saturation of 93 to 95 percent, if necessary. (See <a class="local">'Office management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Oral glucocorticoids</strong> – Most patients who require office-based treatment for an acute asthma exacerbation and have a PEF &lt;80 percent of predicted or personal best after initial SABA treatment are candidates for oral glucocorticoids. An initial dose can be administered in the office (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> 40 to 60 mg or equivalent), if available. (See <a class="local">'Systemic glucocorticoids'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Disposition</strong> – After office-based fast-acting beta-agonist treatment, patients who have no improvement or have worsening symptoms and/or a declining PEF will need transfer to an emergency department for further management. (See <a class="local">'Worsening or lack of improvement'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients who are treated in the office and are improved enough to go home should complete a course of glucocorticoids (equivalent of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> 40 to 60 mg daily for five to seven days).
