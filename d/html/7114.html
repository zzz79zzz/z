Vaso-occlusion results in recurrent painful episodes (previously called sickle cell crisis) and a variety of serious organ system complications that can lead to life-long disabilities and even death. Hemolysis of red blood cells (RBC) causes chronic anemia and pigment gallstones. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7119.html" rel="external">"Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease"</a>.)</p><p>There are multiple components to the management of SCD, including the prevention and treatment of the complications of SCD, as well as the potential cure for this illness:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevention of complications</strong> – Primary prevention of the acute complications of SCD includes routine health management with a hematologist or a health care provider with expertise in SCD.

Routine office visits are used to educate the affected individual and family/caregivers about SCD, infection prevention, pain management strategies, and anticipatory guidance for possible complications (eg, splenic sequestration, avascular necrosis of the femoral head, stroke, leg ulcers). Education regarding the nature of the disease, genetic counseling, and psychosocial assessments of individuals and their families/caregivers are also best accomplished during these visits, reinforced, when possible, with telephone-based outreach programs [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p>In addition, obtaining steady state laboratory values (eg, hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, white blood cell count, pulse oximetry readings) during routine visits will provide standards for comparison during clinical exacerbations, because these values are often abnormal at baseline.</p><p>A comprehensive health care maintenance program for SCD individuals should include the components discussed below [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>].

These benefits are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef129652" href="/z/d/graphic/129652.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Other medications to reduce vaso-occlusive complications are available if hydroxyurea is ineffective, if it cannot be tolerated, or if vaso-occlusive episodes continue despite hydroxyurea.

Their clinical course from these infections is often more severe than individuals without SCD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7119.html" rel="external">"Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease", section on 'Infection'</a>.)</p><p>The two major measures for preventing infection in individuals with SCD are immunization for all patients, and prophylactic penicillin for all young children (eg, &lt;5 years of age) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. A review of the patient's immunizations should be performed at every medical contact to ensure that they are up to date, and parents/caregivers of young children should confirm that prophylactic penicillin is being used appropriately. Infection prevention in those with certain compound heterozygous SCD syndromes (eg, hemoglobin SC, sickle cell-beta thalassemia) depends on the degree of functional asplenia. (See <a class="local">'Immunizations'</a> below and <a class="local">'Prophylactic penicillin'</a> below and <a class="local">'Hb SC disease and sickle cell-beta thalassemia'</a> below.)</p><p>Parents and caregivers of infants and children with SCD should also be instructed regarding early recognition of infection, which may present with isolated fever. A formal plan should be created for seeking medical attention for a predetermined elevated temperature (&gt;38.5°C or &gt;101.5°F), and a strategy discussed regarding plans in case a fever develops during travel or when visiting with family members or caregivers who may not be familiar with the routine. Adults should also have a clear plan for seeking medical attention for signs of infection. Fever should be considered a <strong>medical emergency</strong> requiring prompt medical attention, blood culture, and treatment with antibiotics. This important issue is discussed separately.

A 2012 Cochrane review of these trials included data from 457 patients with SCD [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].

Adverse effects were minimal. Further discussion of these trials and related issues, such as penicillin resistance and country-specific guidelines, is presented elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1412.html" rel="external">"Prevention of infection in patients with impaired splenic function", section on 'Antibiotic prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p>A randomized trial directly evaluated the safety of stopping penicillin prophylaxis in 400 children with SCD who had received penicillin prophylaxis for at least two years immediately before their fifth birthdays and had received the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine between two and three years of age, and again at the time of randomization (ie, had received optimal prophylaxis) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. The incidence of systemic pneumococcal infection during 3.2 years of follow-up was very low and not significantly different in those receiving placebo or continued penicillin prophylaxis (2 versus 1 percent).</p><p>The decision of whether to continue antibiotic prophylaxis after age five must be made on a case-by-case basis. Based upon the above data, many pediatric clinicians elect to stop prophylaxis if the child has not had a prior severe pneumococcal infection or splenectomy and is receiving comprehensive care, including administration of the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9784" href="/z/d/drug information/9784.html" rel="external">pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</a> (PPSV23) [<a href="#rid8">8,27</a>].

As an example, publicly insured children with SCD often receive inadequate antibiotic prophylaxis. In a review of Washington State and Tennessee Medicaid programs, the average SCD patient was dispensed only 148 days of prophylactic medication per year [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].
