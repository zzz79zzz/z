         Fever of ≥39°C (102.2°F) taken rectally is the threshold above which evaluation for a source of occult infection, including urinary tract infection (UTI), may be warranted in children 3 to 36 months of age with no identified infectious source on physical examination [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. A temperature of 39°C or greater by methods other than rectal measurement should be regarded as a fever of concern. Temperatures measured by other, non-rectal methods that are near 39°C should be interpreted on a case-by-case basis using the overall clinical assessment. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5989.html" rel="external">
          "Fever in infants and children: Pathophysiology and management", section on 'Site and method of measurement'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The history of an elevated temperature recorded at home should be considered equivalent to that taken in a medical facility, especially if antipyretic medications have been given prior to evaluation. Although a temperature ≥39°C (102.2°F) may require additional evaluation, febrile children with temperatures lower than this threshold can also have a serious bacterial infection and warrant careful assessment of all clinical findings to determine further care. Furthermore, in addition to occult infection, prolonged fevers may warrant additional workup for atypical Kawasaki disease (duration ≥5 days) or fever of unknown origin (duration ≥7 days). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15689.html" rel="external">
          "Incomplete (atypical) Kawasaki disease"
         </a>

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In some settings, the diagnosis and height of fever are obtained by measurement at other sites (eg, axillary or tympanic membrane). However, investigations for risk of serious bacterial illness have typically relied on rectal temperatures [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. For this reason, we advise the use of rectal temperatures to guide decision-making in this age group. If rectal temperatures are not available in a setting, then measurements from other sites need to use the range of normal values for that device to determine if a fever is present. Furthermore, the clinician should recognize that these devices may provide contradictory results when compared with rectal temperatures. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5989.html" rel="external">

         – The majority of these patients with bacterial infection have acute otitis media, although unimmunized or incompletely immunized children with acute otitis media and a temperature ≥39°C (102.2°F) are still at risk for occult bacteremia [

         When a complete history and physical examination cannot identify a specific source of fever ≥39°C (102.2°F) in previously healthy, otherwise well-appearing child between three months and three years of age, the illness is called fever without a source [

         </a>
         ]. Alternative terms are fever without localizing signs or fever without a focus. Previously healthy children 3 to 36 months of age with fever ≥39°C (102.2°F) and no infectious source identified on physical examination are at risk for occult infections such as UTI, occult bacteremia, and clinically occult pneumonia.

         Fever without a source has been described in febrile young infants with COVID-19 but has not been commonly reported in young children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, it is an important consideration in children with a known exposure to COVID-19 or those who develop other manifestations of the infection. (See

In the post-conjugate vaccine era, herd immunity has decreased the risk for invasive bacterial illness in unvaccinated children and adults, although the risk is still higher than in vaccinated patients.

         Previously healthy febrile children who are ill appearing or have unstable vital signs should be managed for presumed sepsis or septic shock (ie, rapid stabilization, evaluation for serious infection, and empiric treatment with intravenous antibiotics as discussed in detail separately).

         The immunization history largely determines the subsequent evaluation in children with fever without a source because the child who is unimmunized or incompletely immunized is at a much greater risk for occult bacteremia. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Risk by immunization status'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Regardless of immunization status, children with a fever ≥7 days and no source warrant a different evaluation as discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5993.html" rel="external">
          "Fever of unknown origin in children: Evaluation"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Historical findings that suggest an occult source of infection may be subtle. The provider should ask about the child's functional status, including oral intake, presence of irritability or lethargy, change in activity, and associated symptoms. Cough with symptoms of respiratory distress suggests pneumonia. In older, more verbal children, dysuria, frequency, abdominal pain, back pain, or new-onset incontinence may point to a urinary tract infection (UTI). Decreased walking, crawling, or movement of an extremity may indicate a deep soft tissue or bone infection.
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinician should also identify any underlying medical condition that increases the child's risk for serious infection, such as sickle cell disease, underlying immunodeficiency, drug-induced immunocompromise, or anatomic abnormality (eg, ureteral reflux or chronic lung disease).

         <a class="local">
          'Fever with a source'
         </a>
         above). For unimmunized or incompletely immunized children 3 to 36 months of age with a fever ≥39°C (102.2°F), acute otitis media or an upper respiratory tract infection other than a recognizable viral illness such as croup, bronchiolitis, or influenza should

To avoid multiple blood draws, we typically obtain the blood culture with the initial blood tests and hold it until the results are available.

         Serum PCT has better diagnostic accuracy for invasive bacterial illness (bacteremia or meningitis) in children with fever without a source compared with WBC or ANC, although only a small number of studies have been performed in unimmunized or incompletely immunized children 3 to 36 months of age [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>

        <p>
         The recommended studies for these children reflect the increased risk of bacteremia compared with completely immunized children and are drawn from experience and guidelines developed during the pre-conjugate vaccine era [

         In children who are not toilet-trained, urine should be collected by catheterization or, in exceptional cases (eg, tight phimosis or severe labial adhesions), suprapubic aspiration. Bag specimens should not be sent for culture because they are frequently contaminated. An acceptable alternative to catheterization of every child for urine culture is to collect a bagged specimen and rely on the results of the urinalysis only if completely negative. A positive result mandates subsequent catheterization for a repeat urinalysis and culture. A clean-voided urine specimen is preferred in toilet-trained children. (See

         ]. However, this approach has not undergone prospective validation in an unselected population of infants and young children who have fever without a source. Furthermore, the calculated post-test probability is based upon the results of an enhanced (unspun) urinalysis, which is frequently not available. (See

         Among a population of children with high rates of immunization, an elevated WBC, by itself, has both limited sensitivity and specificity as an indicator of serious bacterial infections, particularly as other pathogens such as

For example, in a multicenter, retrospective observational study of almost 42,000 children 3 to 36 months of age who had blood cultures performed after introduction of Hib and PCV7, a WBC ≥15,000/microL had a sensitivity and specificity of 72 and 55 percent, respectively, for bacteremia [

         When the prevalence of invasive bacterial illness (IBI), such as bacteremia, sepsis, and/or bacterial meningitis, is &gt;1 percent, inflammatory markers, particularly procalcitonin (PCT), show promise for the detection of IBI in young children who have fever without a source [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41,48
         </a>
         ]. In a meta-analysis of 12 studies (almost 7300 children, the majority younger than three months of age), PCT at a threshold of 0.5 ng/mL identified IBI with a sensitivity of 82 percent and specificity of 86 percent (positive likelihood ratio [LR] 6, summary area under the curve 0.88) [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. In the study included in this meta-analysis that was performed in children younger than 36 months, procalcitonin showed similar diagnostic accuracy for IBI [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49
         </a>
         ]. Thus, measurement of PCT in unimmunized or incompletely immunized children 3 to 36 months of age is a reasonable approach, although more study in this population is warranted to determine the optimal threshold value. PCT levels rise in response to bacterial infections more rapidly than other markers, such as C-reactive protein [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50

         Preliminary research has also identified and validated candidate proteins, specifically tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and interferon gamma-induced protein that, when combined with C-reactive protein in an experimental assay, distinguished bacterial from viral infections in febrile children (3 months to 18 years of age) with higher sensitivity and specificity than C-reactive protein or PCT [

          Definition
         </strong>
         – The following guidance applies to well-appearing children 3 to 36 months of age, with fever ≥39°C (102.2°F), who have no underlying medical condition that would alter susceptibility to infection and no focus of infection identified by a complete physical examination, referred to below as children who have fever without a source. A thorough history, including immunization status and complete physical examination, should be performed in all febrile children to identify obvious and subtle focuses of infection. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Potential causes
         </strong>
         – The majority of children with fever have either a self-limited viral infection or a recognizable source of bacterial infection (see
         <a class="local">
          'Fever with a source'
         </a>
         above). Relatively common occult sources of infection include pneumonia and urinary tract infections (UTIs), with occasional cases of bacteremia. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Occult bacterial infection'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In addition to occult infection, prolonged fevers may warrant additional workup for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C, duration 3 to 5 days), typical or atypical Kawasaki disease (duration ≥5 days) or fever of unknown origin (duration ≥7 days). (See

          Ill-appearing
         </strong>
         – Children who are ill appearing or have unstable vital signs should be stabilized, evaluated, and managed for presumed sepsis or septic shock, including rapid stabilization, evaluation for serious infection, and empiric treatment with intravenous antibiotics as discuss in detail separately.

         Abnormal blood inflammatory markers – For children who have PCT &gt;0.5 ng/mL, WBC ≥15,000/microL, or ANC ≥10,000/microL, we recommend parenteral antibiotic therapy pending culture results (

         Once these patients receive parenteral antibiotics, they may be discharged to home with assured follow-up within 24 hours and again at 48 hours to reevaluate for progression of illness and to adjust treatment based upon blood and urine culture results. Patients in whom outpatient follow-up is uncertain should be admitted. (See

         Abnormal urinalysis – Well-appearing, incompletely or unimmunized children with a urinalysis indicative of a likely UTI (eg, positive leukocyte esterase or nitrite on dipstick, positive Gram stain, or &gt;5 white blood cells per high-powered field) should be treated for a UTI. Patients who subsequently have a positive urine culture require additional treatment tailored to the identified organism and their clinical status and warrant renal imaging as described separately.

         Normal blood and urine testing – Well-appearing, incompletely or unimmunized children with normal blood and urine studies may be followed as outpatients, but their caregivers should be instructed to promptly seek medical attention if they child becomes ill appearing, develops dehydration, has signs of a localized bacterial infection, has fever ≥40.5°C (104.9°F), or has a fever that persists for &gt;48 hours.

         ). We suggest that the child who is well on follow-up, afebrile, and has an isolate from a preliminary report of a blood culture that is a likely contaminant be followed on a daily basis as an outpatient without antibiotic treatment, pending the final identification of the organism (

         Children at increased risk for UTI should undergo urine testing, including a urine culture. Urine for culture should be collected by catheterization or, in exceptional cases (eg, tight phimosis or severe labial adhesions), suprapubic aspiration. The use of bag urine specimens for culture should be discouraged because they are frequently contaminated. Patients with abnormal urinalysis require empiric treatment for a urinary tract infection.
