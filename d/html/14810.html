         Female orgasmic disorder is characterized by a persistent or recurrent delay, infrequency, or absence of orgasm, or markedly diminished intensity of orgasm, despite adequate sexual stimulation. To diagnose female orgasmic disorder, the symptoms must be present on all or almost all occasions of sexual activity and must cause significant distress [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Treatment for female orgasmic disorder consists principally of psychosocial interventions, though clinical trials of their efficacy are limited.
        </p>

         This topic discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder. The treatment of female orgasmic disorder; the assessment of patients with sexual dysfunction; the epidemiology, risk factors, evaluation, and an overview of treatment of women with sexual dysfunction; and the prevalence and management of sexual dysfunction due to serotonergic antidepressants are discussed separately.

         Female orgasmic disorder may be lifelong or acquired, generalized (occurring in all situations), or situational (occurring in select situations). An example of the situational type of the disorder is a woman who has orgasms through masturbation but not during partnered sexual activity. Distinctions between “primary” and “secondary” orgasmic disorder are important because of their implications for case conceptualization and clinical management. (See

         Women with primary female orgasmic disorder have not previously experienced orgasm in any situation. In the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR), “Never experienced an orgasm under any situation” can be specified [

         Women with secondary female orgasmic disorder have previously been orgasmic but present with current orgasmic dysfunction. As examples, this category would include women who were once orgasmic but not any longer (generalized) as well as women who are orgasmic through masturbation but not partnered sexual activity (situational).

         Epidemiologic studies have found the estimated prevalence of orgasmic dysfunction to vary internationally from approximately 20 to 40 percent. Female orgasmic disorder has a lower prevalence than these estimates, because diagnostic criteria for female orgasmic disorder require that the symptoms are distressing or bothersome to the respondent [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnostic criteria'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Surveys conducted in the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Australia have estimated that 18 to 29 percent of women report problems with attaining orgasm [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-9
         </a>
         ]. As an example, a nationally representative survey of over 25,000 adult women in the United States found that approximately 21 percent reported problems with attaining orgasm [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Only a subgroup of the samples in large epidemiological studies of sexual dysfunction are likely to have met criteria for female orgasmic disorder. Studies that incorporate measurement of orgasmic difficulties and concurrent associated distress can provide more accurate estimates of the prevalence of female orgasmic disorder. As examples, a study of 500 United States women using a more detailed instrument found that only 4.7 percent of respondents endorsed both problems with orgasm and high levels of associated distress [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. A similarly designed study of 356 Australian women concluded that 8 percent of women endorsed problems with orgasm and concurrent related personal distress [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ], a figure that was replicated in another survey of 6986 Australian women between the ages of 18 and 39 [

         Country of origin and self-identified ethnicity are not consistently associated with problems with orgasm. Data from a study of 40- to 80-year-old adults in 29 countries found somewhat higher prevalences of problems with orgasm among women in East and Southeast Asian countries [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16

         There are few rigorous studies of comorbidity of female orgasmic disorder specifically, although several studies have examined associations between subjective difficulty with orgasm and other psychiatric conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Females with depression are two to four times more likely than females without depression to report problems in reaching orgasm [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,20
         </a>
         ]. This association may be weaker outside the United States and United Kingdom [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. In a survey of a nationally representative household survey in the United States, 55 percent of adult women who reported a distressing problem with orgasm also endorsed one or more key symptoms of depression. Similar percentages of depressed women reported problems with low sexual desire and sexual arousal [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ], suggesting a generalized effect of depression on sexual function in women.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinically significant anxiety symptoms are associated with a twofold risk of problems with orgasm [

         Women vary in the intensity, type, and duration of stimulation required for orgasm. Most women require some degree of clitoral stimulation to experience orgasm. Indirect stimulation of the clitoris through vaginal intercourse may be sufficient to trigger orgasm in the majority of women, at least part of the time [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ], whereas others may respond more readily and reliably to direct clitoral stimulation. Stimulation of other erotically sensitive areas (eg, breast or nipple stimulation) may trigger orgasm as well. Some women with complete spinal cord injury maintain the ability to experience orgasm through vaginal-cervical stimulation, a process that appears to be vagally mediated [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22,23
         </a>
         ]. As examples, orgasms can occur in women during sleep [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24,25
         </a>
         ], and there are isolated reports of women who are able to experience orgasm through fantasy alone [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,27
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Anatomic differences among women may explain some variation in the ease with which women may experience orgasm solely through vaginal intercourse [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28-30
         </a>
         ]. The inability to do so is not a disorder, but rather a typical (and sometimes modifiable) variant of sexual response.
        </p>
        <p>
         Data from population-based twin studies suggest that heritable factors may account for over 30 percent of variance in orgasmic frequency during intercourse and at least 45 percent of variance in orgasmic frequency with masturbation [

         Problems with orgasm in women are multifactorial and may be related to a variety of inhibitory psychosocial factors at the level of the individual, couple, and/or sociocultural context. While some of these factors are modifiable, others may represent more stable traits (eg, a general tendency toward behavioral inhibition such as introversion, or a lower propensity for sexual excitement).

         The Dual Control Model proposes that a combination of excitatory and inhibitory processes contribute to sexual response [

         Research suggests that inhibitory factors associated with orgasmic difficulty include worry or negative thoughts about one’s own sexual function and the tendency to be easily distracted or interrupted from sexual arousal [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36-39
         </a>
         ]. It is unclear, however, whether these factors cause or are caused by orgasmic dysfunction.
        </p>
        <p>
         Positive attitudes and representations of sexuality appear to be associated with better orgasmic function and/or a higher frequency of orgasm during sexual activity in women. Evidence suggests that individuals who report being more easily sexually aroused are less likely to experience orgasmic dysfunction [

         Although female orgasmic disorder may manifest as a complete absence of orgasm, some women with acquired female orgasmic disorder report delayed orgasm (ie, requiring longer and/or more intense stimulation to reach orgasm) or a less intense experience of orgasm. Women may also report a sense of impending orgasm that does not reach a peak or resolution despite continued stimulation, sometimes resulting in a feeling of sexual frustration or unresolved genital tension.

        <p>
         Orgasmic dysfunction caused by medical illness or drug treatment is usually experienced globally, that is, in both partnered and masturbatory activity, whereas acquired situational female orgasmic disorder is more likely to manifest only in partnered sexual activity.

         In young women and in women with limited sexual experience, the course of lifelong, global female orgasmic disorder is difficult to distinguish from normal sexual development. A period of sustained sexual activity is generally necessary in order to establish whether the problem is persistent or recurrent, although a pattern of orgasm difficulty with masturbation could meet this criterion. Once manifest, the disorder is likely to persist if precipitating factors (eg, stress, relationship conflict, medication use) do not resolve.

         The onset, duration, and frequency (ie, the proportion of sexual encounters in which there is a problem with orgasm) of symptoms, including any change over time – The clinician should assess whether the patient’s symptoms have been lifelong or acquired. Women with primary anorgasmia may express uncertainty about what orgasm feels like. When acquired female orgasmic disorder is suspected, it is important to compare feelings of arousal to the previous state of functioning.

         Intensity of arousal – It can be difficult to describe or assess the intensity of arousal. Asking the woman to what extent she feels “excited” or “turned on” during sexual encounters can help establish her subjective perception of sexual arousal. It can be helpful for the clinician to inquire about the patient's experience of physical indicators of sexual arousal during sexual stimulation, such as genital warmth, tension, pulsing, and lubrication. If the woman appears to experience little or no sexual arousal with most sexual encounters, the diagnoses of female sexual arousal disorder and/or hypoactive sexual desire disorder should be considered.

         Presence or absence of difficulties with orgasm during masturbation – It is common for women to report experiencing orgasm through self-stimulation but not during partnered sexual activity. This alone does not necessarily establish the presence of situational female orgasmic disorder, since partnered sexual activity may not be sufficiently arousing or the problem may not be sufficient to cause distress in this context.

         If orgasm problems are limited to one particular partner but not past partners, careful assessment may reveal interpersonal problems or concerns about the pattern of sexual activity in the relationship. Alternatively, the partner may lack sexual knowledge and skills. The clinician should be sensitive to the possibility that a patient may find it less threatening to take on the label of “dysfunctional” than to describe problems with the partner or the relationship.

         Assessment needs to determine whether the woman is anorgasmic despite the presence of adequate sexual stimulation. This requires careful history taking and appraisal of contextual factors that might influence sexual response. The absence of an orgasm is an expected consequence of a sexual encounter that lacks psychological and physical stimulation.

         Anxiety or inhibition related to sexuality – This can be assessed by inquiring about the frequency of self-monitoring during sexual activity, the woman’s level of comfort in discussing sexual topics with her partner, and her perception of her own body, especially her genitals. Observing the woman’s speech and behavior (eg, marked avoidance of language referring to genitals or sexual behaviors) may also provide evidence of general discomfort with sexuality. Further assessment may include queries about sexual mores and values in the woman’s family of origin, which may reveal negative attitudes or a lack of knowledge about sexuality.

         Female orgasmic disorder should only be diagnosed in women who experience marked distress or interpersonal difficulty due to absent or delayed orgasm. It is important to inquire about the impact of the problem on the woman’s life and the nature of her concern. Most women seeking treatment for a sexual problem are significantly distressed. In some cases, the woman may not be distressed by the absence of orgasm itself, but by it causing her to worry about whether she is “normal.”
        </p>
        <p>
         The woman’s partner may look upon her lack of orgasm as a reflection of their own desirability or competence as a lover. In these instances, a diagnosis is not necessarily appropriate, particularly if the woman does not otherwise perceive her response as problematic. In this case, the issues should be reframed as an opportunity to educate the woman and her partner about typical variations in sexual response.

         Interviewing the couple jointly can yield valuable data about how the partners communicate, solve problems together, and show affection. Presence of conflict, distrust or instability may affect sexual response and function.
        </p>
        <p>
         The woman should ideally be interviewed alone at some point during the assessment so that private thoughts and feelings can be shared candidly. As an example, the woman may feel uncomfortable talking about her lack of sexual knowledge in the presence of her partner, or she may have difficulty voicing her sexual frustrations and wishes. Some material may be “taboo” within the couple; for instance, a woman who fantasizes about another person to achieve orgasm is unlikely to admit this in the presence of her partner.
        </p>
        <p>
         How best to handle such private information should be agreed upon by all parties at the beginning of the assessment.

         Medical history including current use of medications – A medical work-up may be useful if the patient experiences a relatively sudden, generalized, and persistent loss of orgasmic response in the absence of other obvious causal factors. A physical examination can also rule out causes of genital discomfort or dyspareunia that contribute to sexual difficulties. The medical evaluation of women with sexual dysfunction is discussed separately. (See

         Although validated self-report questionnaires are not sufficient to establish a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder, they can help establish the frequency and severity of symptoms and can be used to monitor treatment response over time. It is generally helpful to assess multiple domains of sexual function to understand how different sexual problems (such as low sexual arousal or sexual pain) may contribute to difficulties with orgasm.
        </p>
        <p>
         For assessment of patients with female orgasmic disorder, we favor use of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60
         </a>
         ], a brief, clinically feasible, and psychometrically robust measure. The FSFI consists of 19 items covering six domains of functioning, including a three-item orgasmic function domain. Scores can be generated for individual domains and for overall sexual function. In previous research, domain and total FSFI scores discriminated reliably between women with and without sexual problems, including female orgasmic disorder [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61-63
         </a>
         ]. For women involved in a long-term relationship with a sexual partner, assessment of general functioning within the intimate relationship can be collected self-report measures such as the Dyadic Adjustment Scale [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64,65
         </a>
         ], which has been validated in both opposite-sex and same-sex couples and used in a number of studies of sexual function [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Measures of genital sensory function, such as tactile, vibratory, and temperature perception thresholds, appear to show some correlation with orgasmic function [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67
         </a>
         ]. Clitoral sensitivity might influence propensity for problems with orgasm. One study found that clitoral, but not vaginal, vibratory sensation thresholds were significantly higher in a sample of 90 women with primary complaint of orgasmic dysfunction as compared to a control group of 110 women without orgasmic difficulties [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68
         </a>
         ]. However, quantitative sensory measures lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for use in detecting problems with orgasm in the general population [
         <a href="#rid69">
          69
         </a>

         Problems with orgasm are not a typical symptom of other mental disorders but may accompany manifestations of mood disturbance or anxiety. As an example, a diagnosis of depression is associated with a loss of interest in sex, which may lead to secondary orgasmic dysfunction. Population-based studies have found that depression is a risk factor for orgasm problems in women [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ], although it is unclear whether this reflects the widespread use of antidepressant medication. Anxiety that distracts the woman from attending to sexual stimulation (eg, uncontrollable worry) or creates psychological discomfort with sexual stimulation (eg, contamination fears) may also contribute to problems with orgasm.

          Female orgasmic disorder
         </strong>
         – Female orgasmic disorder is characterized by a persistent or recurrent delay, infrequency, or absence of orgasm, or marked reduction in the intensity of orgasm, with the symptoms causing marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. Female orgasmic disorder may be lifelong or acquired, generalized, or situational. (See

          Epidemiology
         </strong>
         – Epidemiologic studies have found the estimated prevalence of problems with orgasm to vary internationally from 20 to 40 percent; however, the prevalence of female orgasmic disorder is lower than these estimates, because diagnostic criteria for female orgasmic disorder require that the symptoms are distressing or bothersome to the respondent.

          Pathogenesis
         </strong>
         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Problems with orgasm in females are multifactorial and may be related to a variety of inhibitory psychosocial factors at the level of the individual, couple, and/or sociocultural context. Other underlying causes include medical related, medication related, substance use related. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Psychological and cultural factors'
         </a>
         above and

         <strong>
          Clinical features
         </strong>
         – Although female orgasmic disorder may manifest as a complete absence of orgasm, some women with acquired female orgasmic disorder report delayed orgasm (ie, requiring longer and/or more intense stimulation to reach orgasm) or a less intense experience of orgasm. Women may also report a sense of impending orgasm that does not reach a peak or resolution despite continued stimulation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical features'

         <strong>
          Assessment
         </strong>
         – Assessment and diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder is based on self-reported symptoms, usually during the course of a clinical interview. Careful history of quality, course, duration, situational specificity, and impact of symptoms are essential components of the assessment of female orgasmic disorder. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Differential diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The differential diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder includes medical and substance-induced conditions (such as multiple sclerosis and alcohol intoxication), iatrogenic causes (including serotonergic antidepressants and pelvic surgery), and other mental disorders (such as major depression).
