         The presence of high amounts of cholesterol in a pleural effusion is termed a cholesterol pleural effusion (also called chyliform effusion or pseudochylothorax). Cholesterol pleural effusions are rare and primarily need to be distinguished from chylothorax (the presence of chyle in a pleural effusion).

         The etiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of cholesterol pleural effusions will be reviewed here.

         Cholesterol pleural effusions are rare. Epidemiologic studies are limited to case reports and case series with only a few hundred cases reported internationally [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. However, the incidence may be higher in those at risk (eg, patients with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and rheumatoid arthritis)  (

         ) and in areas endemic for paragonimiasis (eg, Far East, West Africa, and Central and South America). In one large series, three-quarters were men [

         </span>
         While chronic inflammation in the pleural membrane may be a risk factor for the development of a cholesterol effusion, the pathogenesis of cholesterol effusions is unknown. Most likely, different mechanisms of pathogenesis exist in different clinical settings.
        </p>
        <p>
         It has been postulated that lysis of erythrocytes and neutrophils in pleural fluid releases cholesterol and other lipid constituents from degenerating cell membranes; these compounds may be "trapped" in the pleural space by thickened pleural membranes. Eventually, these lipid constituents become concentrated and impart a milky quality to the pleural fluid [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         An alternate theory is that the pleural cholesterol is derived from serum lipids bound to low density lipoproteins (LDLs) that accumulate in the pleural space during acute inflammation [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Over time, lipoprotein binding of cholesterol shifts from LDLs to high density lipoproteins (HDLs). The mechanism for this shift in lipoprotein binding is not known.

          ETIOLOGIES
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Any condition associated with a chronic pleural effusion with or without thickened or calcified pleural membranes can result in a cholesterol pleural effusion  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121783" href="/z/d/graphic/121783.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The two most common etiologies of cholesterol pleural effusion are tuberculous and chronic rheumatoid pleuritis, which, in the largest series to date, were responsible for 89 percent of reported cases [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Worldwide, paragonimiasis is a common etiology in endemic areas (eg, Far East, West Africa, and Central and South America). Rare causes of cholesterol pleural effusions include hepatopulmonary echinococcosis, chronic hemothorax, chronic pneumothorax (including that induced for the treatment of tuberculosis), syphilis, lung cancer, and pleural metastases [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-11
         </a>
         ]. Rarely, cholesterol effusions have also been associated with alcoholism, traumatic pulmonary cysts, heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, and Hodgkin disease [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In a systematic review of 62 studies of 104 reported cases in which underlying causes of cholesterol effusions were diagnosed in 87 cases, 51 percent (44 cases) were due to tuberculosis, 38 percent (33 cases) rheumatoid arthritis, and the remainder attributed to other diagnoses that included paragonimiasis (3 cases), yellow nail syndrome (2 cases), iatrogenic (2 cases), hydatidosis (1 case), Demons-Meigs syndrome (1 case), malignant pleural effusion (1 case), and uncertain etiology (17 cases) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Seventeen additional cases had unknown or unreported underlying diagnoses. A cholesterol pleural effusion can develop in the setting of pleural scarring from tuberculosis, despite successful treatment of the infection. In a series of 11 patients with cholesterol pleural effusions who had previously undergone pneumothorax therapy for tuberculous, progressive pleural thickening developed over the subsequent 5 to 40 years [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13

         The clinical findings are nonspecific and are more likely to represent those of a moderate to large pleural effusion. In many cases, because the findings are nonspecific and the condition is rare, a cholesterol effusion is often not suspected until pleural fluid returns as milky on thoracentesis. (See

         </span>
         Cholesterol pleural effusion usually presents in patients with a known or suspected chronic pleural effusion. Although one series reported a median age at presentation of 58 years, the range was wide (20 to 88 years); three-quarters were men [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. While some patients may be asymptomatic, many patients present with progressive or slow-onset dyspnea induced by the mechanical effects of the pleural effusion [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,4,14
         </a>
         ]. Less commonly, patients may complain of chest pain [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. On physical examination, findings of decreased breath sounds and dullness on percussion may be present, depending on the size and location of the effusion. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4380.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of pleuropulmonary diseases associated with rheumatoid arthritis", section on 'Pleural disease'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The time course of onset of symptoms due to a cholesterol pleural effusion varies. Typically, patients have a history of pleural disease dating back five years or longer [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. However, in one case series of six patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the duration of symptoms associated with the cholesterol effusions was relatively brief (median 15 months) and the pleura was normal or only minimally thickened [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Rapid onset of a cholesterol effusion has also been reported in two patients with tuberculous pleurisy [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ] and one patient with hepatothoracic echinococcus [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Signs and symptoms of an underlying disease are sometimes present [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,14
         </a>
         ]. For example, weight loss, fever, night sweats, arthralgias, joint stiffness, or rheumatoid nodules on the skin may be seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients with paragonimiasis are typically from an endemic area (eg, Asia, Africa, and South America) and report consuming raw shellfish [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7,17
         </a>
         ]; symptoms may be more rapid in onset, migratory nodules on the lower abdominal wall, inguinal region, and thighs may be present, and effusions may be bilateral [

         A cholesterol pleural effusion should be suspected in a patient with progressive dyspnea from a chronic pleural effusion in the setting of conditions known to be associated with its development  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121783" href="/z/d/graphic/121783.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         The initial diagnostic test for patients suspected to have a cholesterol pleural effusion is analysis of the pleural fluid collected by thoracentesis or from a pre-existing chest tube  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131055" href="/z/d/graphic/131055.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Samples of pleural fluid should be assessed for triglyceride and cholesterol levels in addition to the tests typically sent in all patients undergoing thoracentesis, which include white blood cell count and differential, glucose, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), total protein, cytology, and microbiologic smear, Gram stain, and culture. Specifically, when a cholesterol pleural effusion is suspected, fluid should also be examined under polarized light for the presence of cholesterol crystals, which, when found, is diagnostic. When the diagnosis remains unclear after testing, pleural fluid lipoprotein analysis to demonstrate the absence of chylomicrons is obtained. (See

         The appearance of pleural fluid in patients with a cholesterol effusion is classically milky white, turbid, or opaque  (

         ). In a systematic review of 83 cases of cholesterol pleural effusion in which the gross appearance of the fluid was described, fluid appeared milky in 46 percent, turbid/cloudy in 40 percent; opaque in 8 percent; oily yellow in 2 percent; and bloody, bloody-chylous, or serous in the remainder (1 percent each) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2

         ]. The pleural fluid is exudative in nature in all reported cases. Pleural fluid typically has a lymphocyte predominance (61 percent of patients) and a low number of nucleated cells (&lt;5000 cells/microL) predominance. Automatic cell counters can misinterpret the presence of a large number of cholesterol crystals, typical of cholesterol pleural effusions as high white and red cell counts, which is corrected by performing a manual cell count [

         When a cholesterol pleural effusion is suspected based upon the above general findings and chemistries and the diagnosis requires additional confirmation, pleural fluid should be examined under polarized light for the presence of cholesterol crystals. Cholesterol crystals appear as rectangular plates with notched edges  (

         Contrast-enhanced chest CT will often reveal thickening of the parietal and visceral pleura in 80 percent of cases [

          2,23

         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. CT is also helpful in evaluating the effusion size, the presence of trapped lung, and the presence of a possible underlying cause (rheumatoid nodules, apical scarring suggesting old tuberculosis, or masses and ring shadow lesions with linear streaks suggesting paragonimiasis). Signs of nonexpandable lung (eg, thickened or calcified pleura, loculations) may also be seen on chest CT and help predict a poor response to initial drainage. (See

         For patients who present with pleural fluid that is turbid or milky in appearance, the major differential includes chylothorax and empyema. Rarely, tube feed leaks due to a misplaced catheter can cause milky-appearing fluid. For the patients who do not have pleural fluid with a milky appearance, the differential diagnosis is broader considering that cholesterol effusions are exudative  (

          table 1

         ). In parallel, a drainage procedure, typically thoracentesis, is performed for symptomatic effusions [

          2
         </a>
         ]. Patients with a cholesterol effusion are at increased risk of having nonexpandable lung and such cases additionally typically need a more-aggressive approach that involves surgical decortication/pleurectomy. Similarly, recurrence is often treated surgically. The natural history without therapy is unknown. (See

         In general, we suggest that patients with symptomatic cholesterol pleural effusions undergo a drainage procedure (therapeutic thoracentesis or chest tube/catheter drainage). In contrast, most patients who are asymptomatic can be observed clinically and drainage performed, only if symptoms develop. Although therapeutic thoracentesis is typically our first-choice, choosing between thoracentesis and chest tube/catheter drainage is often institution- or operator-specific. Assessment of the contribution of the effusion to dyspnea may be challenging especially in patients with underlying lung disease. In general, patients with resting or progressive dyspnea, patients with chest pain, and patients with moderate to large-sized effusions are drained. Ultimately, symptoms related to the effusion are best appreciated when the patient reports improvement

         drainage.

        <p>
         Due to the longstanding nature of many cholesterol pleural effusions, the underlying pleura may be thickened and fibrotic such that patients with cholesterol pleural effusions are at increased risk of nonexpandable lung (ie, poor re-expansion of the underlying lung following thoracentesis). If nonexpandable lung is suspected clinically before therapeutic thoracentesis (usually by the demonstration of thickened pleura on chest computed tomography), measuring pleural pressures during the procedure may confirm the presence of nonexpandable lung and guide the volume of drainage. Nonexpandable lung after thoracentesis/drainage may be suggested by poor lung re-expansion, development of chest discomfort during the procedure, the presence of pneumothorax ex vacuo, air bubbles during drainage, or rapid reaccumulation of pleural fluid (days). (See

         Although estimates are limited to case series, up to two-thirds of patients with a cholesterol pleural effusion may fail initial therapy and the effusion may reaccumulate, typically over a period of several weeks to months. Rapid recurrence may suggest paragonimiasis or nonexpandable lung. Symptomatic patients with expandable lung should undergo repeat thoracentesis or a more definitive treatment (eg, pleurodesis) while those with nonexpandable lung may benefit from surgical decortication or indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) in the nonsurgical candidate.

         In patients with recurrent symptoms due to a cholesterol pleural effusion who have expandable lung, we suggest repeat thoracentesis. The rationale for this approach is that a second or third intervention may be sufficient, allowing time for the underlying disease to be treated.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the rare patients with expandable lung who have recurrent cholesterol effusions despite two or three attempts at therapeutic thoracentesis (ie, failed repeat thoracentesis), we suggest pleurodesis. Choosing among the options of chemical (medical or surgical) or mechanical (surgical) pleurodesis is operator-dependent and may also depend upon patient candidacy for surgery. In the largest case series of 104 patients with cholesterol pleural effusions, only three cases underwent pleurodesis with talc, Povidine, or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9986" href="/z/d/drug information/9986.html" rel="external">
          tetracycline
         </a>

         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Refractory cases may require surgical pleurectomy.
        </p>
        <p>
         In this population there are limited data to support use of indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) drainage devices while medical therapy is ongoing [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Nonetheless, IPC may be appropriate in patients who decline repeat thoracentesis or pleurodesis. Limited data in other patients with recurrent nonmalignant pleural effusion (NMPE) have also reported some success with IPC use; however, the risk of infections may be increased in some patients with NMPE (eg, patients with rheumatoid arthritis on immunosuppressive agents). IPC use and management of refractory NMPE are provided separately. (See

         For patients with persistent dyspnea after initial therapeutic thoracentesis in whom dyspnea is thought to be due to nonexpandable lung, we suggest surgical decortication (removal of a restrictive layer of fibrous tissue overlying the lung) with or without visceral pleurectomy (procedure to increase adherence of visceral and parietal pleural membranes). Rarely, a total or partial pleurectomy (removal of pleura) may be performed. The main purpose of surgical procedures is the improvement in symptoms and lung function and the avoidance of the risks of empyema and pleurocutaneous fistula due to repetitive thoracentesis [

          1,22,28

        </p>
        <p>
         Decortication is a major surgical procedure with significant morbidity. Selection of an appropriate surgical approach requires careful individualization of care based upon the underlying etiology of the effusion, operability of the patient, response to initial thoracentesis, extent of the pleural fluid loculation, degree of pleural thickening, and institutional surgical skills and resources. Alternatively, some surgeons combine decortication with pleurodesis. Combining decortication with pleurodesis results in adequate lung re-expansion and also minimizes the risk of a recurrent cholesterol pleural effusion. (See

        <p>
         Decortication has been reported to reduce dyspnea when performed in patients with cholesterol pleural effusions, although the number of reported cases is small [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,13,29

         ]. A systematic review of 104 patients with cholesterol pleural effusion reported favorable outcomes in the 13 out of 15 patients who underwent decortication/pleurectomy [

         For patients who decline surgery or patients who are not surgical candidates and have an expandable lung, options include bedside chemical pleurodesis via a chest tube or thoracoscopic talc insufflation.

         Cholesterol pleural effusions are rare. However, the incidence may be higher in those with chronic pleural inflammation including patients with tuberculous and rheumatoid pleurisy and in areas endemic for paragonimiasis  (

         The clinical findings of a cholesterol pleural effusion are nonspecific and are more likely to represent those of a moderate to large pleural effusion. In many cases, because the findings are nonspecific and the condition is rare, it is often not suspected until pleural fluid returns as milky on thoracentesis. The effusion is typically unilateral and frequently associated with pleural thickening. (See

         For patients suspected to have a cholesterol pleural effusion, the initial diagnostic test is analysis of the pleural fluid for its appearance/color and for white blood cell count and differential  (

         ). Pleural fluid should also be analyzed for glucose, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and total protein levels, as well as for cytology, microbiologic smear, Gram stain, and culture. Specifically, pleural fluid levels of triglyceride and cholesterol should also be measured. (See

         A cholesterol pleural effusion is classically milky white/turbid, has exudative characteristics, and may have additional features on chemistry that are suggestive of the underlying pathology (eg, eosinophilia to suggest paragonimiasis, low pH, high LDH, low glucose to suggest rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis, or malignancy).

         The diagnosis of a cholesterol effusion is supported by an elevated cholesterol concentration greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL (5.18 mmol/L) and a triglyceride concentration below 110 mg/dL (1.24 mmol/L) together with a cholesterol/triglyceride ratio &gt;1. The cholesterol/triglyceride ratio &gt;1 appears to be more sensitive for the diagnosis (98 percent). In the appropriate clinical context, these findings are typically sufficient for the diagnosis. However, the cholesterol level may be less than 200 mg/dL in a quarter of patients and the triglyceride concentration above 110 mg/dL (1.24 mmol/L) in another quarter. (See

         ); however, 10 percent of patients do not have cholesterol crystals such that their absence does not rule out the diagnosis. (See
         <a class="local">

         For patients who present with pleural fluid that is turbid or milky in appearance, the major differential includes chylothorax and empyema, and rarely, tube feed leaks due to a misplaced catheter. For the patients who do not have pleural fluid with a milky appearance, the differential diagnosis is broader considering that cholesterol effusions are exudative  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54055" href="/z/d/graphic/54055.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). In most cases, triglyceride and cholesterol analysis and the demonstration of cholesterol crystals will distinguish a cholesterol pleural effusion from all other causes of an exudative effusion, regardless of its appearance. When the diagnosis remains in doubt, we suggest pleural fluid lipoprotein analysis, to demonstrate the absence of chylomicrons (which is diagnostic of chylothorax). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Differential diagnosis'

         For patients diagnosed with a cholesterol pleural effusion, the causative underlying disease, if not already known, should be sought based upon history (eg, tuberculous exposure, arthritis, helminth endemic area) and physical examination. Testing may include tuberculin skin testing, laboratory testing (eg, peripheral eosinophilia, rheumatoid factor), microbiologic cultures of pleural fluid, and pleural fluid cytology or biopsy. (See
         <a class="local">

         The initial step in the management of cholesterol effusions is treatment of the underlying disease process, whether it is tuberculosis, paragonimiasis, rheumatoid pleurisy, or other treatable disease. In parallel, patients who are assessed to be symptomatic from their cholesterol pleural effusion (eg, resting or progressive dyspnea, chest pain), should undergo a drainage procedure; therapeutic thoracentesis or chest tube or catheter drainage is appropriate. For patients without symptoms referable to the cholesterol effusion, we typically avoid a drainage procedure and wait for a clinical and radiologic response to treatment of the underlying disease (eg, weeks to months). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial management'

         Although data are limited, up to two-thirds of patients with a cholesterol pleural effusion may fail initial therapy over a period of several weeks to months. Managing such patients is challenging and options may depend upon whether the lung is expandable or nonexpandable. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Recurrent pleural effusion'
         </a>
         above.)

         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         For patients who have recurrent cholesterol effusion and expandable lung, we suggest repeat thoracentesis rather than pleurodesis (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). The rationale for this approach is that a second or third intervention may be sufficient, allowing time for the underlying disease to be treated. For patients who fail repeated attempts of therapeutic thoracentesis, medical or surgical pleurodesis is typically indicated. An indwelling catheter (IPC) may be appropriate in patients who decline repeat thoracentesis or pleurodesis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Expandable lung (repeat thoracentesis)'
         </a>
         above.)

          •
         </span>
         For patients who have recurrent cholesterol effusion and symptoms thought to be due to nonexpandable lung, curative options are limited. In this population, we suggest surgical decortication with or without visceral pleurectomy (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). The rationale for this approach is the avoidance of empyema and pleurocutaneous fistula associated with repetitive thoracentesis. Alternatives, for patients who decline or are not candidates for surgery, include continued intermittent thoracentesis or placement of an IPC. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Recurrent pleural effusion'

         The prognosis of patients with cholesterol pleural effusions is poorly studied. Outcome varies and likely depends upon the nature of the underlying etiology and clinical factors such as age, severity of associated lung disease, and the degree of expandable or nonexpandable lung. (See
