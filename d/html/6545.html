         Proximal tibial fractures are infrequent in children relative to diaphyseal and distal tibial fractures. In toddlers, metaphyseal corner or bucket handle fractures are highly associated with child abuse. (See

         Other patterns of injury correspond to the age of the child and the type of force [

         Young children (three to nine years of age) are at risk for greenstick or complete metaphyseal fractures when valgus or varus stress is applied. Jumping on a trampoline with other children is a common mechanism.

         Physeal fractures are commonly seen in young adolescents (12 to 14 years of age) and are related to high energy mechanisms (eg, sports injuries, motor vehicle collisions)  (

          figure 1

         ). These fractures are significantly more common in males than females [

         Tibial tubercle avulsion occurs in older adolescents during active quadriceps contraction with forced flexion of the knee (eg, landing from a jump during basketball, hurdling, high jump or gymnastics or being tackled in American football or rugby).

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         The tibia is the major weight-bearing bone of the lower leg  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54800" href="/z/d/graphic/54800.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         and
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65590" href="/z/d/graphic/65590.html" rel="external">
          figure 3
         </a>
         ). The proximal portion of the bone, the tibial plateau, forms the lower surface of the knee joint  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69611" href="/z/d/graphic/69611.html" rel="external">
          figure 4
         </a>
         ). The thicker of the two articular surfaces is the medial tibial condyle, while the lateral tibial condyle is a relatively thinner and weaker portion of the joint. Separating the medial from the lateral tibial condyle is the tibial spine (intercondylar eminence), an important bony prominence that anchors the attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).
        </p>
        <p>
         The diaphysis, or long shaft of the bone, flares at either end of the bone metaphysis and terminates in the rounded end of the bone called the epiphysis. The physis, or growth plate, is the active zone of bone lengthening that links the epiphysis to the rest of the bone  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79444" href="/z/d/graphic/79444.html" rel="external">
          figure 5
         </a>
         ). The epiphysis of the proximal tibia is a pressure epiphysis and is subject to compressive forces. Injuries to pressure epiphyses and to growth plates can result in growth disturbances.
        </p>
        <p>
         The tibial tuberosity is another key landmark located on the anterior surface, one to two centimeters below the joint line and the inferior patellar pole [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. As the site of attachment for the patellar tendon, the tubercle is subject to tensile forces and thus, both inflammatory and avulsion injuries. However, injury to the tubercle does not pose a risk of growth disturbance.
        </p>
        <p>
         The interosseous membrane is a strong fibrous structure that connects the tibia and fibula along the length of the two bones. Proximally, this structure, reinforced by strong anterior and posterior ligaments, forms a synovial joint, the proximal tibiofibular articulation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another fibrous structure, the crural fascia, surrounds the bones and muscles of the lower leg. Fascial extensions and the interosseous membrane separate the muscles, nerves, and vessels of the lower leg into four distinct compartments  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66579" href="/z/d/graphic/66579.html" rel="external">
          figure 6
         </a>
         ). Three of these, the anterior, posterior, and deep posterior compartments, all border the tibia and can be compromised by tibial injury.
        </p>
        <p>
         Vascular compromise can arise more proximally from the following etiologies [
         <a href="#rid4">

        <p>
         The tibial and common peroneal nerves and their branches provide the key innervation to the muscles of the lower leg and foot. The tibial nerve parallels the course of the posterior tibial artery and courses through the deep posterior compartment. In the popliteal space, branches of the tibial nerve provide innervation to the posterior compartment and to the popliteus muscle. The common peroneal nerve divides to form the superficial and deep peroneal nerves, providing innervation to the muscles in the lateral and anterior lower leg, respectively.

         Metaphyseal corner or bucket handle fractures result from intentional pulling and rotation forces applied to the leg when a toddler is grabbed by the ankle or by rapid acceleration and deceleration forces, such as when an infant is shaken violently while the legs are dangling.

          Tibial tubercle avulsion fractures
         </strong>
         – These injuries typically occur during forced flexion against actively contracting quadriceps (eg, an adolescent planting a leg to dunk a basketball)  (

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Repeated flexion of the knee occurs in athletes who kick and jump or who climb steps for training. These activities engage the quadriceps muscles and exert force on the patellar tendon and its insertion site, the tibial tubercle. This repeated pulling on the tubercle in young adolescents may lead to an apophysitis (Osgood-Schlatter disease). (See

         Compartment syndrome may rarely occur prior to or after definitive orthopedic care of a proximal tibial fracture. When compartment syndrome is suspected based on clinical findings, immediate management includes relieving all external pressure on the compartment.

         Diagnosis of a metaphyseal fracture (corner or bucket handle fracture) in a toddler is highly suggestive of child abuse and should prompt involvement of an experienced child protection team (eg, social worker, nurse, child abuse specialist).

         Valgus deformity – Fractures of the proximal tibial metaphysis are prone to develop a progressive valgus angular deformity, despite anatomic alignment during the initial treatment. This may reflect altered growth mechanics about the proximal tibial physis. The vast majority of the progressive valgus will resolve spontaneously over three years. However, close orthopedic follow-up is needed for those few cases where osteotomy may be necessary to correct the angulation if it does not resolve.

         Popliteal artery injury – With a significant hyperextension injury, a posteriorly displaced proximal tibial shaft can tent the popliteal artery. In one series of 30 proximal tibial epiphyseal injuries, 16 (53 percent) were displaced and three had peripheral ischemia at presentation [

          Clinical presentation
         </strong>
         – Children with proximal tibial fractures have pain, swelling, and/or deformity at the site of injury. They usually are unable to ambulate. Proximal physeal tibial fractures are typically high-energy injuries that warrant careful evaluation for compartment syndrome and, less commonly, popliteal artery injury. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Physical findings'

         <strong>
          Radiographic diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral plain radiographic views of the lower leg, including the knee and ankle, should be obtained in the child with a suspected proximal tibial fracture to establish the diagnosis. Complicated fractures may require additional imaging (eg, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) in consultation with a radiologist or orthopedic surgeon to fully characterize the injury. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Radiographic findings'

         <strong>
          Vascular compromise
         </strong>
         – The emergency clinician should promptly identify children with vascular insufficiency caused by popliteal artery tear  (

         </a>
         ) and obtain an emergency consult from an orthopedic surgeon with appropriate pediatric expertise. Rarely, these children will require partial closed reduction in the emergency department in an attempt to restore distal circulation. Patients who display a cold, white or cyanotic foot despite reduction and fixation require operative exploration and vascular repair. (See

          Open fractures

          Acute compartment syndrome

         – The rapid overview provides clinical findings and treatment for acute compartment syndrome  (

          table 5
         </a>
         ). Patients with suspected compartment syndrome should have emergency orthopedic consultation; any dressing, splint, cast, or other restrictive covering removed and ensure that the extremity is
         <strong>
          not

         elevated. Compartment pressure measurement helps identify patients in need of fasciotomy, the definitive treatment for decompression of all involved compartments. (See

          Child protection
         </strong>
         – Diagnosis of a metaphyseal fracture (corner or bucket handle fracture) in a toddler is highly suggestive of child abuse and should prompt involvement of an experienced child protection team (eg, social worker, nurse, child abuse specialist). In many parts of the world (including the US, UK, and Australia), a mandatory report to appropriate governmental authorities is also required for cases of suspected abuse. (See
