         Acute or chronic dysfunction of the heart or kidneys can induce acute or chronic dysfunction in the other organ. In addition, both heart and kidney function can be impaired by an acute or chronic systemic disorder. The term "cardiorenal syndrome" (CRS) has been applied to these interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
         The prognosis and treatment of type 1 and 2 CRS will be reviewed here. Issues related to the prevalence of a reduced glomerular filtration rate in patients with heart failure (HF), the diagnosis of type 1 and 2 CRS, and the mechanisms by which acute and chronic HF lead to worsening renal function are discussed separately.

         A reduced baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is generally associated with a worse prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF). However, the prognostic significance of worsening renal function (WRF) likely depends upon its cause. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Change in glomerular filtration rate during therapy for heart failure'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         An analysis of the PROTECT trial identified multiple different trajectories in renal function during hospitalization for acute heart failure [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The most common trajectories were in-hospital transient rise in serum creatinine (19 percent), sustained increase (17.6 percent), and decrease (14.5 percent). After multivariable adjustment, no trajectory of change was associated with significantly better or worse outcomes, questioning the prognostic importance of changes in renal function during acute HF.

         The prevalence of moderate to severe reductions in GFR (less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m
         <sup>

         </sup>
         ) in patients with HF has ranged from 30 to 60 percent in large clinical studies [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. This observation is important clinically because the baseline GFR is a predictor of mortality in both acute and chronic HF [

         A systematic review of 16 studies included more than 80,000 patients with HF [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The patients were categorized as having normal renal function (estimated GFR [eGFR] 90 mL/min or higher), mildly impaired renal function (eGFR 53 to 89 mL/min, serum creatinine greater than 1.0 mg/dL [88.4 micromol/L], or serum cystatin C greater than 1.03 to 1.55 mg/dL), or moderately to severely impaired renal function (eGFR less than 53 mL/min, serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL [133 micromol/L] or higher, or serum cystatin C of 1.56 mg/dL or higher). Serum cystatin C may be a better marker of GFR than serum creatinine under certain circumstances because unlike creatinine production, cystatin C production is less dependent upon muscle mass and therefore less influenced by nutritional status [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The mortality rate at a follow-up of one year or more was 24 percent in those with a normal eGFR compared with 38 and 51 percent in patients with mild and moderate to severe reductions in eGFR, respectively (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.6 and 2.3). It was estimated that mortality increased by approximately 15 percent for every 10 mL/min reduction in eGFR.

         Similar findings were noted in a report of 2680 patients with chronic HF in the CHARM program who were followed for a median of almost three years [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         to 2.92 at an eGFR below 45 mL/min. This effect was independent of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), but all-cause mortality increased continuously with reductions in LVEF below 45 percent (adjusted HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.13-1.23 per 5 percent decrease in LVEF).

         Among 4917 patients with a continuous-flow LV assist device (LVAD), worse preimplant renal dysfunction correlated with lower survival rate with an approximately 20 percent lower two-year survival in patients with eGFR &lt;30 mL/min compared with those with eGFR ≥60 mL/min [

         Worsening or improving GFR is associated with increased mortality risk in some patient populations but the cause of worsening GFR influences its prognostic significance [

         ]. Incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) was 69.0/1000 patient-years in patients with HF versus 14.5/1000 patient-years in those without. Twenty-two percent of HF patients compared with 8.5 percent of patients without HF experienced a rapid decline in eGFR. HF patients had greater than two times the risk of incident CKD, a composite of incident CKD or mortality, as well as rapid eGFR decline.

         Worsening renal function, defined as an elevation in serum creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL (27 micromol/L) or more, occurred in 26 percent of patients.

         All-cause mortality was significantly higher in the patients with worsening renal function compared with those with a serum creatinine that was unchanged or increased by less than 0.2 mg/dL (18 micromol/L): 43 versus 36 percent. The findings were the same in hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients.

         However, other evidence suggests that patients with improving or worsening renal function may have worse outcomes. Fluctuating renal function may occur in a sicker cohort of patients with significantly worse survival than patients with stable renal function, as illustrated by the following studies:

         An analysis of data on 401 patients enrolled in the ESCAPE trial found that patients with an improvement or a decline in estimated GFR during treatment of acute decompensated HF had similar outcomes [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Compared with patients with a stable GFR, those with either an improvement or a decline in GFR were significantly more likely to have a reduced cardiac index and to require intravenous inotrope and vasodilator therapy, and had a significantly higher rate of all-cause mortality.

         Similarly, an observation study of 903 patients found that those with improved GFR during hospitalization for HF had worsened survival compared with patients with stable renal function [

         The mechanism of worsening renal function in HF is important in determining its prognostic significance. An analysis of data on 6337 subjects enrolled in the Studies Of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) showed that early worsening renal function was associated with increased mortality in the overall population [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. However, in the
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9405" href="/z/d/drug information/9405.html" rel="external">
          enalapril
         </a>
         group, early worsening renal function was not associated with increased mortality, while in the placebo group, the association with mortality was strengthened. A significant survival benefit from enalapril therapy was observed in patients who continued enalapril despite early worsening renal function. These findings suggest that worsening renal function is not always a marker of adverse clinical outcome. On the contrary, in the case of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor administration, it is a manifestation of the agent’s pharmacologic properties, which exert a favorable effect on long-term outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other studies of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition have similarly demonstrated beneficial effects on long-term outcomes despite an initial early decline in renal function [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23,24
         </a>
         ]. An analysis of data from the Heart failure End point evaluation of Angiotensin II Antagonist
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9574" href="/z/d/drug information/9574.html" rel="external">
          Losartan
         </a>
         (HEAAL) trial found that 150 mg losartan compared with 50 mg was associated with increased risk of acute rise in serum creatinine as well as with greater long-term reductions in eGFR, but that despite these effects, high-dose losartan retained its net clinical benefit and was associated with reduced risk of death or HF hospitalization [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. Early decline in GFR in the setting of initiation of RAAS antagonists may reflect antagonism of angiotensin II-mediated efferent arteriolar constriction.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, as noted below, treatment of decompensated HF with diuretics may improve survival despite worsening renal function. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diuretics'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In an analysis of the ESCAPE trial, in-hospital WRF was not associated with increased risk of mortality among patients who were successfully decongested at discharge [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. Transient increases (bumps) in serum creatinine during decongestion may be predominantly functional or hemodynamic in nature. Increases in creatinine observed during aggressive decongestion may thus be clinically benign events, not signifying true injury nor associated with subsequent adverse outcomes [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. In an analysis of the Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation – Acute Heart Failure (ROSE-AHF) trial, 283 patients with baseline and 72-hour urine tubular injury biomarkers were analyzed [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. There was no correlation between change in tubular injury biomarkers and metrics of diuresis and decongestion. Changes in renal filtration markers, serum creatinine, and cystatin C during aggressive diuresis were not associated with changes in markers of renal tubular injury, KIM-1, NGAL, and NAG. Thus, transient increases in serum creatinine most likely reflect temporary changes in renal filtration rather than acute kidney injury [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. Other investigations have similarly found a lack of association between serum and urinary NGAL and subsequent WRF defined by rising serum creatinine [

         Given the limitations imposed by impaired renal function on the ability to correct volume overload and the frequent association between impaired or worsening renal function and mortality in patients with heart failure (HF), it is possible that effective treatment of the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) could improve patient outcomes. On the other hand, the worse prognosis in patients with HF and impaired renal function could primarily reflect a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) being a marker of more severe cardiac disease. In this setting, improving renal function alone would not necessarily improve patient outcomes. (See
         <a class="local">

         There are no medical therapies that have been shown to directly increase the GFR (manifested clinically by a decline in serum creatinine) in patients with HF. On the other hand, improving cardiac function can produce increases in GFR, indicating that types 1 and 2 CRS have substantial reversible components. (See

         Diuretics, typically beginning with a loop diuretic, are first-line therapy for managing volume overload in patients with HF as manifested by peripheral and/or pulmonary edema. In patients with HF, an elevated BUN/creatinine ratio should not deter diuretic therapy if clinical evidence of congestion is present. Issues related to diuretic dosing, the time course of the diuresis, the side effects of diuretic therapy, and the management of refractory edema in these patients are discussed elsewhere. (See

         ]. Hemoconcentration was defined as baseline-to-discharge increases in the top one-third of the group in at least two of the following: hematocrit, serum albumin, and serum total protein. Patients with hemoconcentration were treated with higher doses of loop diuretics and more fluid loss, lost more weight, and had greater reductions in intracardiac filling pressures compared with patients without hemoconcentration. Hemoconcentration was strongly associated with worsening renal function (odds ratio 5.3), but also was associated with a significantly lower 180 day mortality rate (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.16, 95% CI 0.02-0.44). Although the total number of deaths was small (n = 29), this study suggests that aggressive decongestion in the face of worsening renal function may favorably affect survival.

         ]. While a decline in eGFR was associated with high risk of both death and the composite outcome, this did not hold true if there was evidence of decongestion (defined as a decline in B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP], N-terminal pro-BNP, or weight, or an increase in hematocrit, albumin, or total protein). Thus, worsening eGFR was not associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes if markers of decongestion were improving.

         Additionally, the timing of hemoconcentration may be important, as a study of 845 consecutive inpatients with HF found that hemoconcentration achieved late during the hospitalization was associated with improved survival while early hemoconcentration was not associated with improved survival compared with no hemoconcentration [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48

        <p>
         These findings provide support for the recommendation included in the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association HF guidelines that the goal of diuretic therapy is to eliminate clinical evidence of fluid retention such as an elevated jugular venous pressure and peripheral edema [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49

         Angiotensin inhibition with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) is a standard part of the therapy of HF with reduced ejection fraction, being associated with symptomatic improvement, reduced hospitalization for HF, and enhanced survival.

         Despite the above benefits, ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy for HF is not generally associated with an improvement in renal function. Although a minority of patients have an increase in GFR after initiation of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, most have a moderate reduction in GFR that can often be ameliorated by reducing the intensity of diuretic therapy. Additionally, there is a dose effect. Compared with low-dose ARB therapy in chronic HF, high-dose

        <p>
         Determining a threshold of eGFR decline that can still be tolerated after initiating ACE inhibitor therapy among patients with HFrEF remains a challenging question. An analysis from the SOLVD trials incorporated assumptions regarding the varying degrees of hemodynamic medication-related decline and found that in most models, up to a 15 percent eGFR decline after

         initiation was still associated with significant mortality benefit, and up to 40 percent eGFR decline with enalapril was still associated with significant protection against hospitalizations for heart failure [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. These results give reassurance to clinicians that, at least among stable HFrEF outpatients without advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD; patients with creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dL were excluded), there should be compelling reason beyond a moderate eGFR decline to withdraw this beneficial class of medications.

        <p>
         While clinical trials of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonists in HF have not specifically focused on patients with the CRS, subgroup analyses of patients with and without CKD as well as cohort studies have demonstrated that the beneficial effect of RAAS antagonism on clinical outcomes is not mitigated by concomitant CKD [

         Ultrafiltration refers to the removal of isotonic fluid from the venous compartment via filtration of plasma across a semipermeable membrane. In HF patients, ultrafiltration is most often considered in patients with acute decompensated HF and diuretic resistance and/or impaired renal function. By removing isotonic fluid, ultrafiltration tends to maintain physiologic electrolyte balance, in contrast to diuretic therapy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3495.html" rel="external">
          "Management of refractory heart failure with reduced ejection fraction", section on 'Ultrafiltration'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Three randomized trials (UNLOAD, RAPID-CHF, and CARESS-HF) compared ultrafiltration with diuretic therapy in patients with acute decompensated HF [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67-69
         </a>
         ]. The mean baseline serum creatinine levels were 1.5, 1.7, and 2.0 mg/dL (133, 150, and 177 micromol/L), respectively. In UNLOAD and RAPID-CHF, ultrafiltration was associated with a significantly greater rate of fluid loss than diuretic therapy but no difference in serum creatinine. In CARESS-HF, ultrafiltration was compared with stepped pharmacologic therapy (including bolus plus high doses of continuous infusion loop diuretics, addition of thiazide diuretic [
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9644" href="/z/d/drug information/9644.html" rel="external">
          metolazone
         </a>
         ], and selected intravenous inotrope and/or vasodilator therapy) in patients with worsening renal function and persistent congestion [
         <a href="#rid69">
          69
         </a>
         ]. Although weight loss was similar in ultrafiltration and stepped pharmacologic therapy groups, ultrafiltration therapy caused an increase in serum creatinine and a higher rate of adverse events. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3495.html" rel="external">
          "Management of refractory heart failure with reduced ejection fraction", section on 'Ultrafiltration'

        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, although ultrafiltration may be helpful for fluid removal in acute decompensated HF in patients unresponsive to diuretic therapy, the available evidence does not establish ultrafiltration as first line therapy for acute decompensated HF or as an effective therapy for CRS. The 2013 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines note that ultrafiltration is reasonable for patients with refractory congestion not responding to medical therapy [

          Reduced GFR and prognosis
         </strong>
         – Reduced glomerular filtration rates (GFR) are common in patients presenting with heart failure (HF) and are associated with increased mortality. A systematic review found that mortality increased by approximately 15 percent for every 10 mL/min reduction in estimated GFR. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Reduced GFR and prognosis'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Change in GFR during HF therapy
         </strong>
         – A fall in GFR during treatment of HF has often been associated with increased mortality in clinical studies in which the risk of mortality increased progressively with the degree of worsening renal function. However, other evidence suggests that patient outcomes may be improved with aggressive fluid removal even if accompanied by a rise in serum creatinine. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Change in glomerular filtration rate during therapy for heart failure'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Management
         </strong>
         – Given the limitations imposed by impaired renal function on the ability to correct volume overload and the strong association between impaired or worsening renal function and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with HF, it is possible that effective treatment of the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) would improve patient outcomes. On the other hand, the worse prognosis associated with CRS could primarily reflect a reduced GFR being a marker of more severe cardiac disease. In this setting, improving renal function alone would not necessarily improve patient outcomes. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Management'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         There are no medical therapies that have been shown to directly increase GFR in patients with the CRS. On the other hand, improving cardiac function can produce increases in GFR, indicating that types 1 and 2 CRS have substantial reversible components. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Management'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Diuretics
         </strong>
         – The effect of diuretic-induced fluid removal on the GFR is variable in patients with HF. Although fluid removal may result in increases in serum creatinine and rising serum creatinine is associated with worse prognosis in patients with HF, aggressive decongestion leading to worsening renal function may be associated with improved survival.
