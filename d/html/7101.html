         The porphyrias are metabolic disorders caused by altered activities of enzymes within the heme biosynthetic pathway. Porphyrias can cause neurovisceral manifestations (eg, abdominal pain, motor and sensory peripheral neuropathy, neuropsychiatric changes) and/or cutaneous photosensitivity (either chronic and blistering or acute and mostly nonblistering). Although uncommon, they are likely to be encountered by clinicians in any specialty, and they are readily diagnosed by biochemical and genetic testing. This topic provides an overview of the porphyrias, with an emphasis on information that clinicians in any specialty should know about these diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
         Altered enzyme activity is usually due to an inherited mutation in the gene for that enzyme. The most notable exception is the most common of the porphyrias, porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), which is caused by acquired inhibition of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), the fifth enzyme in the pathway, specifically in the liver. A heterozygous disease variant in the
         <em>
          UROD
         </em>
         gene predisposes to PCT in approximately 20 percent of cases but is not sufficient by itself to cause the disease (ie, penetrance is very low).
        </p>
        <p>
         Porphyrias can be challenging to diagnose because they are rare and their symptoms are nonspecific. Biochemical diagnostic testing is essential and need not be complex if only one or a few first-line tests are used for screening, with further testing only when a screening test is positive. The specific screening test used depends on the type of porphyria suspected. Porphyrias are categorized into three clinical types, which guide the choice of screening tests (ie, there is no "porphyrin screen" that tests for all porphyrias).
        </p>
        <p>
         The three most common porphyrias (porphyria cutanea tarda [PCT], acute intermittent porphyria [AIP], and erythropoietic protoporphyria [EPP], in that order) differ completely from each other in terms of clinical manifestations, diagnostic testing, and treatment, as discussed below. Each represents one of the three clinical categories of the porphyrias – acute neurovisceral, chronic blistering cutaneous, and acute nonblistering cutaneous. Other topic reviews within UpToDate should be consulted when one of the specific porphyrias is suspected or diagnosed. Links to these topics are presented in the section on classification. (See

         Heme is made in all tissues, but its synthesis is most active in the bone marrow and liver.

          Bone marrow
         </strong>
         – The bone marrow accounts for &gt;80 percent of daily heme synthesis; this is because the bone marrow must provide the large amounts of heme needed to serve as the prosthetic group for hemoglobin.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The synthesis of heme and globin is closely coordinated in erythroblasts and reticulocytes. The rate of heme synthesis depends on the expression of the erythroid-specific gene (
         <em>
          ALAS2
         </em>
         ) as well as genes for several other enzymes in the pathway (see
         <a class="local">
          'Enzymes and intermediates'
         </a>
         below). Expression of these enzymes is also upregulated by heme and by iron [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Upregulation by iron is controlled by an iron-responsive element (IRE) in the
         <em>
          ALAS2
         </em>
         messenger RNA (mRNA) that is not present in the mRNA for
         <em>
          ALAS1
         </em>
         , which encodes the housekeeping form of the enzyme and is active in all tissues including liver [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. (See

         <strong>
          Liver
         </strong>
         – The liver accounts for most of the rest of overall heme synthesis. In the liver, heme is used primarily as the prosthetic group for various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which metabolize toxins and drugs in the endoplasmic reticulum. These are especially abundant and inducible in the liver and have high rates of turnover. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2904.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of pharmacogenomics", section on 'CYP isoenzymes and drug metabolism'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In the liver, ALAS1 has a key regulatory role in heme synthesis, and ALAS1 is rate limiting for hepatic heme synthesis [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6
         </a>
         ]. A regulatory heme pool controls the expression of the hepatic
         <em>
          ALAS1
         </em>
         gene and the transport of ALAS1 into mitochondria. This provides a sensitive feedback mechanism, whereby an increased need for liver heme results in upregulation of
         <em>
          ALAS1
         </em>
         expression. Likewise,
         <em>
          ALAS1
         </em>
         is downregulated when the regulatory heme pool is augmented with heme and there is no requirement to increase hepatic heme synthesis. This regulatory heme pool has not been specifically defined and may comprise multiple intracellular pools.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         Since most of the heme synthesized in liver is used for the production of CYPs, induction of CYPs by drugs and other factors leads to induction of ALAS1 through this feedback mechanism [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. In addition, the
         <em>
          ALAS1
         </em>
         gene and certain CYP genes share upstream enhancer elements that respond to inducing chemicals and interact with the pregnane X receptor (PXR); this is an additional mechanism for coordinated induction of hepatic ALAS1 and hepatic CYPs [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ].

         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         Induction of hepatic heme oxygenase, which enzymatically degrades heme, can cause depletion of the regulatory heme pool and consequently cause ALAS1 induction.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         These hepatic feedback mechanisms are important in the acute hepatic porphyrias (AHP), which are exacerbated when hepatic
         <em>
          ALAS1
         </em>
         is induced [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,9
         </a>
         ]. Accordingly, treatment of AHP with heme, which, when infused intravenously, is taken up primarily in hepatocytes, where it repletes the regulatory heme pool, results in downregulation of ALAS1 and amelioration of the acute attack [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. (See

          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Synthesis of heme begins in mitochondria, where the first enzyme in the pathway, delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS, 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase), catalyzes a reaction between two simple molecules, glycine and succinyl-coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA), to form delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an amino acid committed exclusively to the synthesis of heme. ALAS requires pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (a derivative of vitamin B6 [pyridoxine]) as a cofactor.
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, ALAS occurs in two forms that are encoded by different genes. The housekeeping (or ubiquitous) enzyme, which is found in all tissues, is termed ALAS1; the
         <em>
          ALAS1
         </em>
         gene is found on chromosome 3. No disease-causing
         <em>
          ALAS1
         </em>
         mutations are described; however, increased
         <em>
          ALAS1
         </em>
         expression is important in the acute hepatic porphyrias. The erythroid-specific form, termed ALAS2, is produced only in bone marrow erythroblasts. The
         <em>
          ALAS2
         </em>
         gene is found on the X chromosome (Xp11.21) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,12
         </a>
         ].
         <em>
          ALAS2
         </em>
         mutations cause sex-linked sideroblastic anemia (loss-of-function mutations) or X-linked protoporphyria (gain-of-function mutations). (See

          table 1
         </a>
         ). In seven of the eight types of porphyria, mutation of a gene that affects one of the pathway enzymes is responsible. The exception is porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), which is caused by an acquired inhibitor (uroporphomethene, a uroporphyrinogen molecule that has become partially oxidized) rather than a gene mutation. This inhibitor contributes to reducing activity of the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) enzyme in the liver to less than approximately 20 percent of normal. Approximately 20 percent of individuals with PCT are heterozygous for a pathogenic variant in the
         <em>
          UROD
         </em>
         gene that acts as a predisposing factor. (See

         In most inherited cases of porphyria, a causative variant affects the gene that encodes the relevant heme synthesis enzyme. In a few cases, the mutation affects a regulatory gene rather than the enzyme itself. Rare examples include cases of congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) due to a mutation of

PBG is not substantially increased in any medical conditions other than AIP, HCP, and VP. ALA and PBG both accumulate in AIP, HCP, and VP; ALA but not PBG accumulates in ADP (as well as in other conditions where ALAD activity is decreased, particularly lead poisoning and hereditary tyrosinemia type 1).

         Protoporphyrin (mostly metal-free rather than zinc-chelated) accumulates in the protoporphyrias (EPP and XLP) and causes acute nonblistering photosensitivity. Greater solubility of protoporphyrin in nonaqueous cellular components may explain this distinctive type of photosensitivity. As noted above, protoporphyrin is excreted only in bile and feces. Erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin is elevated in many disorders (iron deficiency, hemolysis, lead poisoning); for diagnosis of EPP and XLP, it is important to demonstrate predominant elevation of metal-free protoporphyrin.

         All of the heme pathway intermediates are colorless and nonfluorescent, with the exception of protoporphyrin, which, like other oxidized porphyrins, is reddish-colored and fluoresces, especially when illuminated by light near 400 nm (the Soret absorption band for porphyrins). When porphyrinogen intermediates accumulate and leave the intracellular environment, they mostly spontaneously oxidize to the corresponding porphyrins, which are reddish and fluorescent.
        </p>
        <p>
         While PBG is colorless, it can degrade in urine to porphobilin, which is brownish. PBG at high concentrations can also spontaneously form porphyrins, which are reddish. These urine colors are the source of the name "porphyria"; the Greek word for the color purple is "porphyrus" [

         Porphyrias are classified as hepatic or erythropoietic based on whether pathway intermediates first accumulate in the liver or the bone marrow, respectively. This classification reflects pathophysiology but not necessarily other important features of these diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is useful to group porphyrias clinically into three categories, based on the presence of acute neurovisceral and/or skin manifestations (chronic blistering or acute); these do not fully correspond with the hepatic versus erythropoietic designation  (

         These porphyrias cause acute and chronic symptoms due to effects on the nervous system. The most common presenting symptom is neuropathic abdominal pain. The motor, sensory, and autonomic nervous systems are often affected, resulting in autonomic changes (eg, tachycardia, hypertension), muscle weakness, sensory loss, and pain in the back, chest, and extremities. Even severe symptoms may be discounted because they mimic other diseases, and physical findings are often minimal.
        </p>
        <p>
         The prototype and most common of these is AIP. Identical symptoms occur in the other AHPs (ADP, HCP, and VP). HCP and VP may also present with blistering skin lesions.
        </p>
        <p>
         AIP, HCP, and VP are autosomal dominant inherited disorders with low penetrance and female predominance. Erythrocyte porphyrins are normal or only slightly elevated in these AHPs. Approaches to diagnosing and distinguishing among AHPs are discussed below. (See

        <p>
         ADP is autosomal recessive and extremely rare, with only eight documented cases worldwide, all of whom have been males (which is unexplained), usually with onset of attacks in their early teens. All cases of ADP have elevated erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin, suggesting an erythropoietic component.
        </p>
        <p>
         Very rare cases of homozygous AIP, HCP, and VP have a completely different phenotype and marked elevations of erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin. Clinical features include impaired neurologic development and chronic, blistering skin lesions starting in early childhood, with an absence of acute attacks.

         Porphyrias are rare disorders with nonspecific clinical manifestations similar to those of many other more common diseases. As a result, their diagnosis and appropriate treatment are often delayed. This is unfortunate because biochemical first-line screening tests are sensitive for diagnosis of these disorders, and additional second-line testing readily differentiates the various types of porphyria. Diagnostic confirmation by DNA analysis is readily available. Moreover, effective treatments are available but will not be provided unless a diagnosis is made.
        </p>
        <p>
         The three most common porphyrias are porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), and erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), in that order  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51232" href="/z/d/graphic/51232.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). Presenting symptoms and diagnostic testing are very different for these three conditions, which are prototypical examples of the three major types of porphyria presentations  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef117978" href="/z/d/graphic/117978.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). With knowledge of diagnostic approaches for these three most common types, the less common porphyrias will also be diagnosed and therefore not neglected.

         Diagnostic guidelines on the evaluation of abdominal pain may neglect to mention porphyrias, or they may not provide guidance on how and when testing should be done. Therefore, specific testing for porphyria is seldom considered an important part of the diagnostic workup for the cardinal symptoms of these disorders, and delayed diagnosis continues to be a major problem.

         Abdominal pain with a relatively unremarkable examination is the most common neurovisceral manifestation of AHP  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56856" href="/z/d/graphic/56856.html" rel="external">
          table 5
         </a>
         ). Other symptoms and signs may be present, but their significance not recognized. Effects on the central nervous system may cause insomnia, agitation, hallucinations, seizures, or hyponatremia, which is often attributed to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Manifestations of peripheral neuropathy (extremity pain, paresis) are often present. Rarely, one or more of these manifestations occur in the absence of abdominal pain. These three groups of symptoms (abdominal pain, central nervous system abnormalities, and peripheral neuropathy) have been described as a "classic triad" that should suggest acute porphyria, but because they are all highly nonspecific, they are often seen as unrelated and not suggestive of a unifying diagnosis. Therefore, screening for AHP (by measuring urine porphobilinogen [PBG] and porphyrins) should be considered even when suspicion has not risen to a high level.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other common gastrointestinal symptoms of AHP include nausea, vomiting, constipation, and, less commonly, diarrhea. Additional symptoms may include pain in the limbs, head, neck, or chest; and others listed in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56856" href="/z/d/graphic/56856.html" rel="external">
          table 5
         </a>
         ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings can resemble those in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), which points to the potentially substantial effects of AHP on the central nervous system. AHP can also mimic Guillain-Barre syndrome [
         <a href="#rid23">

        <p>
         Multiple previous hospitalizations and/or visits to the emergency department (ED) with abdominal pain and negative evaluations, especially if accompanied by neurologic or psychiatric symptoms, can be important diagnostic clues [

         In AIP and the other acute porphyrias, attacks are often precipitated by factors such as stress, caloric restriction, medications, or cyclic hormonal changes. Many of these factors act through induction of hepatic ALAS1. (See

        <p>
         In severe cases of AIP, hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), or variegate porphyria (VP), the urine may develop a red or brown color due to a high concentration of porphobilin, a brownish auto-oxidation product of PBG, and porphyrins, which are reddish.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The same symptoms recurred two years later, resulting in multiple ED visits. She reported some increase in alcohol intake to compensate for stressful circumstances. She was admitted to a psychiatric unit with mental status changes and hallucinations and then transferred to an ED for evaluation of abdominal pain. In the ED, she had a grand mal seizure associated with hyponatremia. She was admitted to a medical unit with tachycardia and hypertension (heart rate 120 beats per minute; blood pressure 174/114), along with disorientation; there were no focal neurologic signs.

         Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid showed no abnormalities; MRI of the brain showed multiple areas of subcortical signal abnormalities. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was abnormal with recurring single and multiple spike and sharp discharge activity appearing to arise from the left anterior temporal region. Laboratory testing revealed increased aminotransferases (ALT 114 international units/L, AST 94 international units/L), which were attributed to alcohol.

         Importantly, AHP is
         <strong>
          readily
         </strong>
         ruled in or out at the time of symptoms by a simple urine test for porphobilinogen (PBG), which is both highly sensitive and highly specific. Thus, urine PBG is the most important first-line screening test when AHP is suspected  (

         ). Urine porphyrins should also be measured, as discussed below.
        </p>
        <p>
         A timed urine collection is not needed; a spot urine sample is sufficient and generally preferred. Collecting urine for 24 hours can cause unnecessary delays in diagnosis. Highly dilute urine can give falsely negative results [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]; thus, if an initial test result is expressed as PBG per liter of urine, the urine creatinine should also be measured on the same sample and the PBG result expressed per gram (or micromol) of urine creatinine. However, a very high result expressed per liter
         <strong>
          is
         </strong>
         diagnostically meaningful.

         PBG can also be measured in serum or plasma, which is essential if AHP is suspected in a patient with advanced renal disease [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,28
         </a>
         ]. However, in patients with AHP and normal kidney function, PBG concentrations are higher in urine, so urinary measurements are more sensitive and therefore preferred.
        </p>
        <p>
         Normal urinary excretion of PBG is &lt;2 to 4 mg (&lt;9 to 18 micromol) per day [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. Amounts expressed per gram creatinine are roughly the same, since adults excrete 0.7 to 2.0 grams of creatinine daily. PBG excretion during an AHP attack is markedly elevated, with typical values at least 5 to 10 times the upper limit of normal (eg, &gt;10 to 100 mg/day [or per g/creatinine]; &gt;44 to &gt;440 micromol/day)  (

        </p>
        <p>
         A rapid test kit for urinary PBG is no longer available, and samples at most sites must be sent to a referral laboratory. When a result is needed urgently, the laboratory should be contacted and asked to expedite the testing.
        </p>
        <p>
         The most common AHP is AIP. Less common possibilities include hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), variegate porphyria (VP), and delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase (ALAD) porphyria (ADP; which is very rare). To help diagnose these AHPs, total porphyrins are also measured at the time of presentation.

         <span class="glyph">

         Total porphyrins are elevated in all four AHPs. In HCP and VP, total porphyrins may remain elevated for a longer period of time than PBG. However, urine porphyrin elevations are very nonspecific and occur in many medical conditions other than porphyrias.

         ALA can also be measured but is not essential at screening. Normal urinary excretion of ALA is &lt;7 mg (&lt;53 micromol) per day. In an acute attack of AIP, HCP, or VP, urinary ALA excretion is elevated, but generally less so than PBG (when expressed in mg).

         For an individual who already carries a well-documented diagnosis of porphyria, starting therapy for an acute attack can be based on clinical features, without waiting for biochemical confirmation. However, a urine sample should be sent before treatment to document a PBG elevation. (See

         , it is important to evaluate appropriately for any other condition that may have precipitated the attack, such as an infection or other intercurrent illness. Importantly, individuals with porphyria are equally susceptible as the general population to the development of other medical or surgical conditions that may be mistaken for an acute attack of porphyria (eg, appendicitis, urinary tract infection [UTI]).

         The diagnosis of AHP becomes more challenging in patients without symptoms (eg, if the patient describes a history consistent with attacks but is currently well) because levels of porphyrin precursors and porphyrins may be normal in asymptomatic individuals. As a result, it can be difficult to diagnose or to "rule out" acute porphyria when symptoms were present months or years previously. For previously diagnosed patients, it is important to obtain the original laboratory reports and determine if the initial diagnosis was accurate. If the initial diagnosis does not appear accurate (eg, if minor abnormalities were likely over-interpreted), then comprehensive testing needs to be pursued, similar to an asymptomatic individual with a history that suggests AHP.
        </p>
        <p>
         If comprehensive testing is needed, it should include urinary ALA, PBG, and porphyrins; fecal and plasma porphyrins; and erythrocyte PBGD, which may establish a diagnosis of AIP even in asymptomatic patients. Such comprehensive testing is not cost-effective and not warranted in patients with current or recent symptoms, and, as described above, screening by measuring only urine PBG and porphyrins is recommended for individuals who present with acute porphyria symptoms.

         For suspected blistering cutaneous porphyria, measurement of plasma or urine porphyrins is the first-line screening test  (

        </p>
        <p>
         Normal levels of plasma porphyrins are typically &lt;1 mcg/dL (higher in individuals with end-stage kidney disease) [

         ]. Elevations in plasma and urine total porphyrins are found in all active cases with blistering cutaneous porphyrias (PCT, HEP, VP, HCP, and CEP), with the degree of elevation generally reflecting the severity of the lesions. For example, in subclinical or mild cases of PCT, the degree of elevation may be small.

         When total plasma or total urine porphyrins are elevated, fractionation of porphyrins in urine, feces, plasma, and erythrocytes by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) enables recognition of specific patterns that differentiate the various types of blistering cutaneous porphyria (PCT, HEP, VP, HCP, CEP).

          PCT

         – PCT is the most common porphyria; it is due to acquired inhibition of hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD). It is an iron-related condition that usually presents in adults with blistering skin lesions; neurovisceral manifestations are absent. Susceptibility factors include alcohol or estrogen use, smoking, hepatitis C, HIV infection,

         A normal level of total porphyrins in plasma or urine (expressed per gram or mmol of creatinine) is sufficient to eliminate the possibility of a blistering cutaneous porphyria, even with slight increases in some individual porphyrins (separated and measured by HPLC).

         Blistering cutaneous porphyrias are largely chronic, and treatment is seldom urgent. Avoidance of sunlight is advised but is not usually of immediate benefit for these chronic conditions, in part because skin fragility contributes to blister formation and is slow to resolve. Blistering lesions are prone to bacterial infections, which should be treated promptly.

         Acute nonblistering photosensitivity occurs in the protoporphyrias, of which EPP is the most common. Patients with protoporphyria develop immediate photosensitivity (usually within minutes of sunlight exposure) manifested by acute pain, which compels them to seek shelter from light. With more prolonged exposure, pain may be followed by erythema, swelling, and systemic symptoms that may last for several days, but with few if any blisters or lasting skin changes. (See

         In individuals with suspected protoporphyria, the initial screening test is erythrocyte total protoporphyrin  (

          algorithm 5

Elevation of metal-free protoporphyrin is a distinctive feature of protoporphyrias, whereas zinc protoporphyrin is elevated in many other erythrocytic disorders.
        </p>
        <p>
         The deficient enzyme in EPP is ferrochelatase (FECH), which catalyzes the insertion of iron into protoporphyrin to make heme (see

          "Erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria", section on 'Pathogenesis'

         ). FECH can accept other metals and therefore catalyzes formation of zinc protoporphyrin from any protoporphyrin remaining after completion of heme and hemoglobin synthesis. Deficient FECH activity in EPP impairs synthesis of both heme and zinc protoporphyrin, so the excess protoporphyrin that accumulates in EPP is mostly metal-free.
        </p>
        <p>
         The normal range for erythrocyte total protoporphyrin is up to approximately 80 mcg/dL, with some variation related to age. In EPP and XLP, erythrocyte total protoporphyrin is usually increased to between 300 and 5000 mcg/dL or higher, and consists mostly of metal-free protoporphyrin (ie, protoporphyrin not complexed with iron [as in heme] or zinc [as in zinc protoporphyrin]). Plasma porphyrin levels are usually but not always increased  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89036" href="/z/d/graphic/89036.html" rel="external">
          table 6
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Increased erythrocyte total porphyrin is not specific for EPP and is also seen in many non-porphyria conditions such as lead poisoning, iron deficiency, anemia of chronic disease, and hemolytic conditions, but in contrast to EPP, the excess protoporphyrin in these conditions is mostly zinc-chelated because FECH activity is not impaired.

         In EPP, the increased erythrocyte protoporphyrin is typically &gt;85 percent metal-free and &lt;15 percent zinc protoporphyrin.

         In XLP, both metal-free and zinc protoporphyrin are increased, and metal-free protoporphyrin is usually predominant. The
         <em>
          ALAS2
         </em>
         gain-of-function mutations in XLP lead to the formation of amounts of protoporphyrin exceeding the capacity of normal FECH activity, resulting in excess metal-free as well as zinc protoporphyrin.

         In protoporphyria resulting from
         <em>
          CLPX
         </em>
         mutation, reduced CLPX activity prolongs ALAS2 activity. Therefore, as in XLP, there are increases in both metal-free and zinc protoporphyrin.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The presence of both markedly elevated erythrocyte total protoporphyrin and a predominance of metal-free protoporphyrin (rather than zinc protoporphyrin) allows for ready diagnosis of protoporphyria  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60572" href="/z/d/graphic/60572.html" rel="external">
          table 7
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         However, selection of an appropriate laboratory for testing of erythrocyte protoporphyrin is important [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. Some referral laboratories in the United States (Quest and LabCorp) measure only zinc protoporphyrin but report misleadingly that they have measured both total and "free protoporphyrin". The term "free protoporphyrin" is in fact an obsolete term that originally meant iron-free rather than metal-free protoporphyrin. When this term originated, the existence of zinc protoporphyrin in erythrocytes had not yet been described. Another laboratory (ARUP) measures total protoporphyrin but does fractionate into metal-free and zinc protoporphyrin [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Fractionation of metal-free and zinc protoporphyrin is important because increased erythrocyte total protoporphyrin, but with a predominance of zinc protoporphyrin, is a nonspecific finding seen in a variety of conditions, as noted above. Therefore, even a marked increase in erythrocyte total protoporphyrin is not diagnostic for protoporphyria unless the proportion of metal-free exceeds that of zinc protoporphyrin.

         Marked erythrocyte protoporphyrin elevations do not occur in other photosensitivity disorders causing such immediate reactions. (See

          Background
         </strong>
         – The porphyrias are metabolic disorders caused by altered activities of one of the eight enzymes  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54358" href="/z/d/graphic/54358.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ) involved in heme biosynthesis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef117995" href="/z/d/graphic/117995.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Porphyrias are associated with accumulation of one or more heme synthesis pathway intermediates  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80601" href="/z/d/graphic/80601.html" rel="external">
          table 3

          table 7
         </a>
         ). All are caused by disease variants in heme synthesis genes except porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), in which an acquired inhibitor of UROD is found only in the liver. Heterozygosity for a
         <em>
          UROD

         variant contributes in approximately one-fifth of cases. (See

          Classification
         </strong>
         – Porphyrias are hepatic or erythropoietic depending on where heme pathway intermediates first accumulate (liver or bone marrow). Clinically, they have distinctive features (acute neurovisceral, with increased ALA or PBG, or cutaneous, due to photosensitizing porphyrins; further divided as chronic blistering or acute nonblistering)  (

Other AHPs are hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), variegate porphyria (VP), and ALA dehydratase porphyria (ADP; very rare). Initial screening is with spot urine PBG and total porphyrins (normalized to creatinine), obtained as quickly as possible during an acute attack if the diagnosis has not already been established.
