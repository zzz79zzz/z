Transplantation carries many risks and costs, although it is much less expensive than gene therapy. Nevertheless, many individuals will not have a suitable donor, sufficiently resourced care facilities, and/or financial resources to pursue transplant.</p><p>This topic discusses transplantation in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (beta thalassemia major), including predictors of a successful outcome, pretransplant evaluation, donor selection, and source of stem cells, as well as management issues in the immediate post-transplant period.</p><p>Care following transplant, including donor chimerism (ie, engraftment), graft failure, retransplantation, chronic graft-versus-host disease, and reduction of excess iron stores, is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3555.html" rel="external">"Thalassemia: Management after hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7146.html" rel="external">"Iron chelators: Choice of agent, dosing, and adverse effects"</a>.)</p><p>The general management of thalassemia, including the decision to pursue medical therapy or transplantation and progress in gene therapy, is also presented in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7118.html" rel="external">"Management of thalassemia"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H801575"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS AND PREDICTORS OF A GOOD OUTCOME</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Allogeneic transplantation carries many risks and costs, and for many individuals, a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical donor is not available. Thus, the decision to pursue transplantation is challenging and must incorporate information about the patient's age, health, and resources as well as the values and preferences of the patient and family/caregivers. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2472167075"><span class="h2">Indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Transfusion dependence due to thalassemia is the principal indication. The ideal candidate is a child who has been treated with regular transfusions and chelation and who has an HLA-identical donor; such a patient has a more than 90 percent likelihood of cure and a 4 percent risk of transplant-related mortality. For such patients, we suggest allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) rather than lifelong medical therapy  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef127604" href="/d/graphic/127604.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Childhood is the optimal age; the procedure should be performed as early as possible to avoid complications associated with chronic transfusions [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, there is no absolute age cutoff if the patient is healthy and can tolerate the procedure. Similarly, the lack of a sibling donor is not an absolute contraindication, as fully matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplantation has been associated with success in experienced reference centers. </p><p>The algorithm illustrates the role of HSCT in thalassemia management  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef127604" href="/d/graphic/127604.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Allogeneic HSCT has been studied extensively for beta thalassemia major, with excellent outcomes in selected patients, as discussed below and in the following section. (See <a class="local">'Outcomes: allogeneic transplantation versus medical therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Allogeneic HSCT for severe alpha thalassemia has been described in very few case reports either performed in utero or immediately after birth [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]; homozygous alpha thalassemia causes hydrops fetalis and is not compatible with survival in utero or soon after birth.</p><p></p><p>The likelihood of cure decreases and the risk of death increases with older patient age, longer iron toxicity exposition, and a less well-matched donor. Because the risks of HSCT and medical therapy are very different, the values and preferences of the patient and family/caregivers, availability of the procedure, and costs play a large role in deciding whether or not to pursue transplant. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7118.html" rel="external">"Management of thalassemia", section on 'Decision to pursue allogeneic HSCT'</a>.)</p><p>HSCT outcomes are best for individuals who have undergone rigorous medical therapy with transfusions and iron chelation, which minimizes the risks of organ damage from iron toxicity. (See <a class="local">'Outcomes: allogeneic transplantation versus medical therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>While it may be possible to pursue transplantation in individuals with extensive iron stores, a previous episode of heart failure, or compensated cirrhosis, there is a greater likelihood of adverse outcomes in such individuals, and these increased risks may impact decision making. We generally would not pursue this approach for a patient with severe organ damage from iron overload (eg, uncompensated cirrhosis).</p><p>For adults who have undergone lifelong regular and consistent chelation therapy, outcomes from HSCT and medical therapy are less well documented [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. We generally would favor continuation of medical therapy in such an adult. However, adult transplant data are derived from older studies in which participants had previously received suboptimal transfusion and chelation regimens. In the modern era, it is likely that adult thalassemia patients are in much better general clinical conditions and, due to the concept expressed above, transplant results could be better than in previous years and a controlled transplant program could be developed [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p>For children or adults who have not received regular lifelong transfusion and chelation, the risks and benefits are less certain, and decisions are highly individualized. For individuals with comorbidities such as renal failure or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, we would avoid transplantation because the risks of transplant toxicity would be too great.</p><p>Our approach is consistent with 2014 guidance from an international expert panel from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), of which the author is a member [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1533155540"><span class="h2">Outcomes: allogeneic transplantation versus medical therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HSCT and medical therapy both have risks. Transplantation has a higher up-front risk of transplant-associated morbidity and mortality, but most of the patients who survive are cured of thalassemia. Medical therapy must be continued throughout life, and it carries risks associated with chronic transfusions (alloimmunization, transfusion reactions) and chelation therapy (neurotoxicity, kidney toxicity, and others). Each approach has distinct long-term outcomes that should be taken into account.</p><p>There are no randomized trials comparing allogeneic HSCT with medical therapy for transfusion-dependent thalassemia [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Only a 2017 retrospective case-control study has been published, showing no statistically different overall survival with transplantation versus conventional medical therapy (transfusions and iron chelation) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>Outcomes for both modalities continue to improve with greater experience and refinements in management. Thus, assessment of outcomes generally must rely on the experience of transplant centers and comparisons across studies.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Allogeneic HSCT</strong> – Thousands of patients with thalassemia have undergone allogeneic transplantation worldwide. Outcomes were illustrated in a 2016 retrospective series from the EBMT that included data from 1493 patients with beta thalassemia major transplanted after year 2000 [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Overall survival for the whole cohort at two years was 88±1 percent. Features that correlated with improved survival included:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Younger age</strong> – Younger patients had better outcomes than older patients, with an age threshold of 14 years or younger determined to be optimal. For the entire cohort, 1359 transplants (91 percent) were done in children, with a median age of 6.6 years. Two-year survival was 96 percent for those transplanted below age 14 years and 82 percent for those transplanted above the age of 14 years.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Matched sibling donor</strong> – HLA-matched siblings were associated with better outcomes than partially matched related donors or MUDs. For the entire cohort, 1061 transplants (71 percent) were done with HLA-matched sibling donors. Two-year survival was 91 percent in the HLA-matched sibling group, 68 percent with a mismatched related donor, and 77 percent with a MUD. Similar results have been reported from China and India [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Matched sibling umbilical cord blood or bone marrow</strong> – Umbilical cord blood or bone marrow from an HLA-identical sibling was associated with better outcomes than peripheral blood stem cells. Two-year survival was 93 percent with umbilical cord blood, 90 percent with bone marrow, and 81 percent with peripheral blood stem cells, a statistically significant difference.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">For all of these groups, approximately 6 to 8 percent of patients who survived the transplant had recurrence of thalassemia (eg, due to graft rejection or graft failure), making thalassemia-free survival approximately 6 to 8 percent lower than overall survival [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The effects of recipient age and relatedness of the donor in this EBMT report are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52120" href="/d/graphic/52120.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">These outcomes represent significant improvements since HSCT for thalassemia was first pioneered in the early 1980s, and results continue to improve over time  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113752" href="/d/graphic/113752.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid10">10-16</a>]. In a longitudinal series from 2023, 73 patients received a transplant; of these, 10 people (14 percent) died of complications of the transplant [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Analysis by birth cohort demonstrated that all of the deaths occurred in individuals born earlier; of relevance, there were no transplant-related deaths after 2010. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Earlier studies established the importance of pretransplant risk assessment for iron overload, and improvements in chelation therapy and transplant techniques (conditioning regimen and supportive care) are likely to account for the improved outcomes. (See <a class="local">'Impact of iron overload (Pesaro prognostic system)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Attempts to reduce mortality by lowering the dose of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a> in the conditioning regimen have improved survival, but the risk of thalassemia recurrence was also higher. (See <a class="local">'Myeloablative conditioning regimens'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Several centers worldwide have developed expertise in transplanting patients with hemoglobinopathies, and we advise transplantation in an experienced center that has the necessary facilities for a hemoglobinopathy patient available. Outcomes may also be better if care is provided by a specialized thalassemia center. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Medical therapy</strong> – Medical therapy (regular transfusions with iron chelation) has transformed thalassemia major from a lethal childhood disease to a chronic condition with survival into adulthood. Studies have documented progressively better survival over time, likely due to increased monitoring of iron stores, earlier and better use of iron chelation, and the availability of better-tolerated iron chelating agents.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A 2017 study involving 454 patients with thalassemia major treated with medical therapy in Taiwan reported a decrease in the annual mortality rate from 2.9 percent in 2007 to 0.7 percent in 2011; the oral iron chelator <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8794" href="/d/drug information/8794.html" rel="external">deferasirox</a> became available in Taiwan in 2007 [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A 2008 study from the United Kingdom Thalassaemia Register found a decline in the mortality rate from 12.7 deaths per 1000 patient-years from 1980 to 1999 to 4.3 deaths per 1000 patient-years from 2000 to 2003 [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. This was attributed to reduced deaths from iron overload, which declined from 7.9 to 2.3 deaths per 1000 patient-years. A modeling study that extrapolated from these and other data predicted a survival rate of 63 percent at the age of 50 years in resource-rich countries [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A 2006 study involving 284 patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia from Cyprus who were born after 1974 and treated medically found estimated survival rates of 100, 99, and 93 percent at 10, 20, and 30 years of age, respectively [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A 2004 study involving 720 patients from Italy who were born after 1960 and were treated with medical therapy reported that 68 percent were alive at the age of 35 years; survival improved progressively with each birth cohort [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Several of these studies have reported better survival outcomes in females than in males [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. This may reflect better adherence to chelation therapy in females.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">As noted above and in more detail separately, survival with medical therapy continues to improve and may exceed that described in the above reports, provided patients are followed in experienced centers and resources are widely available [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7118.html" rel="external">"Management of thalassemia", section on 'Prognosis'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">It should also be noted that the excellent data reported in Italy refer to patients followed in a few reference centers who represent only approximately 14 percent of the entire Italian thalassemia population.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3335368"><span class="h2">Impact of iron overload (Pesaro prognostic system)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Outcomes correlate with the exposure to iron, including both the severity of iron overload and the duration of exposure [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Outcomes: allogeneic transplantation versus medical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>The importance of pretransplant iron chelation must be emphasized. It is not simply a matter of chelating iron immediately prior to transplant; chelation should be ongoing throughout the entire period of transfusions to prevent iron-induced organ injury. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7118.html" rel="external">"Management of thalassemia", section on 'Assessment of iron stores and initiation of chelation therapy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7146.html" rel="external">"Iron chelators: Choice of agent, dosing, and adverse effects", section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p>In the 1980s, the Pesaro group developed a simple prognostic system based on indicators of iron overload to predict outcomes from allogeneic HSCT [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The system includes three risk factors that were found to correlate with survival on multivariate analysis:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Quality of chelation therapy before transplantation (regular versus not regular)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hepatomegaly (liver edge palpable more than 2 cm below the costal margin)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Any degree of liver fibrosis at pretransplant hepatic biopsy examination</p><p></p><p>Class I patients have zero risk factors and are defined by optimal control of iron stores for their entire lives. Class II patients have one or two risk factors, and class III patients have all three risk factors [<a href="#rid14">14,25</a>].</p><p>Data from the Pesaro group on transplantation outcomes in children &lt;16 years of age with thalassemia correlated with survival at three years as follows [<a href="#rid14">14-16,26</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Class I – 94 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Class II – 80 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Class III – 61 percent</p><p></p><p>Although much time has passed since these data were acquired, and these precise numerical classifications are probably outdated, these results are still important because they provide the proof of concept of how prolonged exposure to iron toxicity can be the cause of the oxidative damage to human tissues, which are consequently made more susceptible by transplantation and its complications and toxicity [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. </p><p>As an example, in a retrospective study that evaluated outcomes in patients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic HSCT, GVHD incidence and severity were similar in the three categories of patients, but the probability of surviving GVHD differed significantly. Mortality rates following acute grade III to IV GVHD were 27, 48, and 84 percent for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients, respectively [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1843281767"><span class="h2">Considerations for adults</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The vast majority of experience with allogeneic HSCT for thalassemia is with children. However, adults have had good outcomes.</p><p>In the 2016 report from the EBMT group, adults constituted 9 percent (133 of 1493) of thalassemia HSCT recipients [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The median age was 22.9 years (range, 18 to 45 years). At two years of follow-up, adults who received a transplant form an HLA-identical sibling donor had an overall survival of 80 percent and a thalassemia-free survival of 76 percent.</p><p>As with children, prevention of organ toxicity from iron overload is likely to be a key predictor of good outcomes, although this has not been demonstrated in clinical trials. At the time of this analysis, all adults were not regularly receiving chelation therapy and had already developed significant organ injury before regular chelation was initiated, blunting the benefits of iron removal. Controlled trials in well-chelated patients are warranted [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2281453801"><span class="h2">Alpha thalassemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Severe alpha thalassemia presents in utero, and many patients do not survive until birth due to severe hydrops fetalis. However, cases have been reported describing early transfusional support followed by allogeneic transplant [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Transplantation is considered investigational in this setting. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/131582.html" rel="external">"Alpha thalassemia major: Prenatal and postnatal management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2705119581"><span class="h1">PRETRANSPLANT EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1794627384"><span class="h2">Assessment of organ damage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The main purpose of the pretransplant evaluation is assessment of the patient's transplant-associated risk due to organ damage from excess iron stores.</p><p>We perform the following testing:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Liver iron assessment</strong> – Liver iron is assessed using liver biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This can be omitted in children age 3 years or younger since these children are unlikely to have developed cirrhosis.

Because of the non-malignant nature of this disease, we suggest a 10 of 10 HLA matched unrelated donor. These donors are identified from donor registries. In many cases, ethnic groups with a high incidence of thalassemia tend to be underrepresented in these registries; however, a number of studies have demonstrated good outcomes with MUD transplantation for thalassemia, and experience continues to expand.

Since patients with thalassemia are often heavily transfused and do not receive prior therapy, the barrier to engraftment is higher and graft failure is a major concern with the use of less intensive preparative regimens.

Outcomes are best for individuals treated with rigorous medical therapy with transfusions and iron chelation  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113752" href="/d/graphic/113752.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Other predictors of good outcomes include younger age, matched sibling donor, and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from bone marrow rather than peripheral blood. (See <a class="local">'Indications and predictors of a good outcome'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ideal age</strong> – The ideal candidate is a child under 14 years of age who has been treated with regular transfusions and chelation and who has a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor. Such patients have &gt;90 percent likelihood of cure and 4 percent risk of transplant-related mortality.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For such patients, we suggest allogeneic transplantation rather than lifelong medical therapy (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Transplant may also be appropriate in older children or adults with an HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) who have received appropriate chelation therapy. Medical therapy is a reasonable alternative, using transfusions, and, for older adolescents and adults, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="126108" href="/d/drug information/126108.html" rel="external">luspatercept</a>  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef127604" href="/d/graphic/127604.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Transplantation and medical therapy differ substantially in their risks and burdens and have not been directly compared. Patient and family/caregiver preferences play a substantial role. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7118.html" rel="external">"Management of thalassemia", section on 'Decision to pursue allogeneic HSCT'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pretransplant evaluation</strong> – The main purpose is assessment of transplant-associated risk due to organ damage from excess toxic iron from exposure. Sperm banking may be appropriate for postpubertal boys. In some cases, oocyte preservation may be possible for girls. (See <a class="local">'Pretransplant evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Donor</strong> – A healthy HLA-identical sibling is the ideal donor. A MUD can often be identified from a donor registry. Other options including umbilical cord blood from an unrelated donor and haploidentical transplant are considered investigational but may be appropriate in some cases  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64890" href="/d/graphic/64890.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See <a class="local">'Donor selection'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Stem cell source</strong> – For thalassemia, we suggest bone marrow rather than peripheral blood as a stem cell source (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). The major rationale reduced risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Some individuals may use HSCs from peripheral blood. Umbilical cord blood from an HLA-matched sibling appears to have a lower risk of GVHD than peripheral blood, but it must be banked at delivery. (See <a class="local">'Stem cell source'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Conditioning </strong>– Standard myeloablative conditioning uses <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9173" href="/d/drug information/9173.html" rel="external">busulfan</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8452" href="/d/drug information/8452.html" rel="external">fludarabine</a>. Radiation is avoided due to effects on growth and secondary malignancies. Reduced-intensity and nonmyeloablative regimens are under investigation and may be used in high-risk individuals or for haploidentical transplant. (See <a class="local">'Conditioning regimen'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Post-transplant</strong> – Immediate post-transplant management involves hematopoietic support, infection prophylaxis, and GVHD prevention (see <a class="local">'Immediate post-transplant management'</a> above).
