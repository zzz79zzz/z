However, virtually all patients eventually develop progressive disease. These males are considered to have castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). A number of standard systemic therapies have been shown to prolong survival in this setting  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef127197" href="/d/graphic/127197.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112896.html" rel="external">"Overview of the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)"</a>.)</p><p>Prostate cancers are frequently characterized by abnormalities in a variety of growth factor signaling pathways that control the cell cycle and apoptosis, as well as aberrations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage repair pathways. As these cellular pathways are being understood, new potential therapeutic targets are being identified, through molecular testing of both the tumor and the germline, for which there may be targeted agents with activity against advanced disease. All males with advanced metastatic prostate cancer who might be candidates for genomically-targeted therapy should undergo molecular testing of their tumor and germline DNA to identify potential therapeutic molecular targets. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6926.html" rel="external">"Molecular biology of prostate cancer"</a>.)</p><p>One strategy for treating advanced metastatic CRPC relies on targeting tumors that are deficient in homologous recombination repair (HRR). Genes that are directly or indirectly implicated in HRR include <em>BRCA1</em>, <em>BRCA2</em>, <em>CHEK2</em>, <em>ATM</em>, <em>PALB2</em>, <em>FANCA</em>, and <em>RAD51D, </em>among others. HRR is a DNA repair pathway of clinical interest due to the sensitivity of HRR deficient cells to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, and potentially platinum-containing chemotherapy.</p><p>This topic will review the biology and identification of HRR in males with prostate cancer and will review DNA repair-targeted therapies in metastatic CRPC with HRR deficiency. An overview of therapy for CRPC (both nonmetastatic and metastatic) is provided elsewhere, as is a separate discussion of immunotherapy for CRPC. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112896.html" rel="external">"Overview of the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6937.html" rel="external">"Immunotherapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2037002394"><span class="h1">DNA REPAIR AND HRR DEFICIENCY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2655777407"><span class="h2">Basic biology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Each cell is equipped with DNA damage response mechanisms that guard the genome against mutational insults. Double-strand breaks are a particularly hazardous form of DNA damage, and they are repaired by two major repair pathways: error-free (high-fidelity) homologous recombination and non-homologous (low fidelity) end-joining (NHEJ) [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>Defective DNA repair is a common hallmark of cancer. HRR deficiency was initially described in cancers that arose in the setting of germline mutations in the tumor suppressors <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em>, which are associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). It is now understood that genetic and epigenetic inactivation of other genes can lead to HRR deficiency in sporadic cancers as well, which some have termed "BRCA-ness" or a BRCA-like phenotype [<a href="#rid3">3-6</a>].</p><p>HRR is required for the repair of double-strand breaks that are generated during DNA interstrand crosslinking, which occurs during treatment with platinum-type chemotherapy drugs. For this reason, cells that have HRR deficiency may be particularly sensitive to platinum-containing chemotherapy, although platinum agents are not specifically approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in prostate cancer. (See <a class="local">'Platinum-containing chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity is essential for the repair of single-strand DNA breaks via the base excision repair pathway, which is a primary repair pathway for DNA single-strand breaks [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. In the nucleus, PARP1 and PARP2 enzymes sense single-strand DNA breaks and recruit DNA repair complexes to the site, which then result in post-translational modification of the DNA, a process known as PARylation or poly-ADP ribosylation. PARP inhibitors block this PARylation, and they may also trap the PARP enzymes on injured DNA, preventing binding of incoming repair proteins [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The trapped PARP-DNA complexes are more cytotoxic than unrepaired single-strand breaks caused by PARP inactivation alone [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H499544212"><span class="h2">Identifying patients who are likely to respond to PARP inhibitors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Genomic testing is indicated for males with advanced prostate cancer who might be eligible for treatment with molecularly targeted therapy. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has issued a provisional clinical opinion that supports both somatic and germline genomic testing in metastatic or advanced cancer, including prostate cancer, when there are genomic biomarker-linked therapies approved by regulatory agencies for the type of cancer, including PARP inhibitors for males with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and alterations associated with HRR deficiency [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. For patients without tissue-based genomic testing, treatment may be based on actionable mutations in cell free (circulating tumoral) DNA (ctDNA).</p><p>Cancer cells with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> have defective HRR function, and the unrepaired DNA breaks that result after treatment with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors eventually can lead to cancer cell death [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. This process is referred to as "synthetic lethality," in which two conditions that would independently not cause cell death, when present in combination cause lethal injury to the cell [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>].</p><p>The available evidence suggests that response rates to PARP inhibitors are highest in individuals with germline or somatic <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations [<a href="#rid15">15-18</a>]. However, there may be a differential benefit from PARP inhibitor therapy across subgroups with <em>BRCA</em>1/2 alterations [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. In particular, due to the relative rarity of <em>BRCA1</em> mutations compared with <em>BRCA2</em> mutations in prostate cancer, the efficacy of PARP inhibition in the <em>BRCA1</em> subset remains unclear and will be better defined in the future with additional data [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>].</p><p>In addition to <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em>, preclinical and clinical studies indicate that pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in other genes that are directly or indirectly involved in the HRR pathway might also be associated with varying levels of sensitivity to PARP inhibitors [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. In prostate cancer, these genes include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><em>ATM</em> [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><em>CHEK2</em> [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><em>PALB2</em> [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><em>FANCA </em>[<a href="#rid24">24-26</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><em>RAD51B</em> [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><em>BRIP1</em> [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]</p><p></p><p>The list of genes involved in HRR is far from complete, and the number of prostate cancer cases likely to respond to PARP inhibitors is expected to expand over time [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H942186998"><span class="h3">Selecting which type of sample to use to identify HRR alterations using NGS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in genes that regulate HRR can be detected in a number of different ways [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. The majority of males with advanced prostate cancer will have been referred for germline genetic testing as this is recommended by several groups, including NCCN and ASCO. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112282.html" rel="external">"Genetic risk factors for prostate cancer", section on 'Who needs referral for genetic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>There are several ways to assess for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, including germline testing and multipanel somatic gene testing using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The choice of method depends on patient factors (ie, whether a variant has been identified in other family members) as well as laboratory factors (ie, local availability/expertise).</p><p>If NGS is chosen, the optimal choice of sample depends on the availability of primary or metastatic tissue, the availability of ctDNA (which is related to high disease burden), or sample availability that is limited to germline DNA from blood (leukocytes) or saliva. The quality of available tissue, including sample age, biopsy site, and tumor purity, impacts sequencing results [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. ctDNA analysis may have lower sensitivity to detect certain types of alterations, including deletions and rearrangements. Both somatic and germline sequencing are recommended, as alterations in <em>BRCA1/2</em> occur at near-equal frequency in the germline and somatically, and the identification of a germline variant has implications for risks of other cancers in the patient and family members [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/121802.html" rel="external">"Gene test interpretation: <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i>"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112282.html" rel="external">"Genetic risk factors for prostate cancer", section on 'Specific genes associated with inherited predisposition'</a>.)</p><p>Broadly speaking, the four types of specimens that can be used for interrogation of HRR-related genetic variants are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fresh biopsy of a metastatic lesion is ideal, if feasible [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Archival biopsy/primary tumor tissue, preferably less than five years old [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>ctDNA; although assay of ctDNA may miss deletions unless disease burden is high [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Blood or saliva sample (germline-only testing).</p><p></p><p>The PARP inhibitor <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="111396" href="/d/drug information/111396.html" rel="external">rucaparib</a> is approved in the United States for <em>BRCA1/2</em>-mutated CRPC based on the presence of a deleterious <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation (germline and/or somatic) in a plasma sample.
