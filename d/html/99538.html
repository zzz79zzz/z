Although it is common, the complaint should not be ignored, because children with functional constipation will benefit from prompt and thorough evaluation and treatment. Delayed or inadequate intervention may result in stool-withholding behavior, with worsening constipation and psychosocial consequences.</p><p>The clinician also has an important role in identifying the small fraction of children with organic causes of constipation. Organic causes of constipation are more likely among young infants, and among infants and children presenting with atypical features or "alarm signs"  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94989" href="/d/graphic/94989.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>The clinical features that are typical for functional constipation are described in this topic review, and features of specific organic causes of constipation are summarized briefly. Other aspects of managing the infant or child with constipation are discussed in the following topic reviews:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5906.html" rel="external">"Constipation in infants and children: Evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5859.html" rel="external">"Functional fecal incontinence in infants and children: Definition, clinical manifestations, and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5873.html" rel="external">"Chronic functional constipation and fecal incontinence in infants, children, and adolescents: Treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5872.html" rel="external">"Recent-onset constipation in infants and children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H342984430"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Constipation affects 10 to 30 percent of children and accounts for an estimated 3 to 5 percent of all visits to pediatricians [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. The peak prevalence is during the preschool years in most reports. There is no consistent predisposition by sex on the prevalence of childhood constipation. Functional constipation is responsible for more than 95 percent of cases of constipation in healthy children one year and older and is particularly common among preschool-aged children [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Older children and adolescents may have unrecognized functional constipation; this may not come to medical attention if they are not comfortable discussing their bowel habits. Long-term follow-up studies have shown that up to 25 percent of children who receive treatment for functional constipation as children still experience symptoms of constipation as adolescents and adults [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>Several studies have reported higher prevalence of constipation in children who come from families with lower socioeconomic status and fewer years of education [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In turn, constipation and fecal incontinence have adverse effects on quality of life and thus represent an important source of health disparity [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. Another study documented disparate rates of surgical interventions for constipation among different groups of children in the United States, suggesting unequal access to these services [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H703999406"><span class="h1">CONTRIBUTING FACTORS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Infants and children</strong> – There are three periods during which the infant and developing child are particularly prone to developing functional constipation [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>After the introduction of cereals and solid food into the diet (age six months to one year)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>During toilet training (age two to three years)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>During the start of school (age three to five years)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">These important developmental milestones can be positive experiences. On the other hand, each of these milestones can convert defecation into an unpleasant experience. That unhappy experience may prompt the child to try to avoid repeating it, leading to behaviors that promote constipation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adolescents</strong> – The pathophysiology of functional constipation in adolescents shows similarities with younger children. In adolescents, eating disorders, school stressors, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may promote or exacerbate the constipation. In patients with anorexia nervosa or bulimia, constipation can result from inadequate food and fluid intake. Fecal incontinence associated with functional constipation is especially distressing in adolescent patients; it is associated with low self-esteem and social isolation and can have a major deleterious impact on quality of life [<a href="#rid7">7,11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If patients with constipation have lower abdominal pain that persists after laxative therapy despite passing regular, soft bowel movements, constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome should be considered as a diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71435" href="/d/graphic/71435.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112.html" rel="external">"Functional abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Management in primary care"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H704003007"><span class="h2">Painful defecation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Painful defecation is a common trigger for stool withholding and contributes to the development and persistence of chronic constipation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55786" href="/d/graphic/55786.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). When the child avoids defecation because of pain, stool accumulates in the rectum and becomes harder or larger, causing even more pain when they are passed. The underlying problem of constipation must be addressed promptly to avoid this escalating cycle.</p><p>Children who withhold stool to avoid defecation because of pain or other negative experiences have a form of functional or behavioral constipation [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The child's response to ignore the urge to defecate is probably a conscious decision initially but later becomes automatic. The only abnormal motor activity in most children with chronic constipation is found in the rectum, which may dilate to such an extent that insufficient pressure is generated to push the stool into the anal canal. Manometric studies have suggested that some constipated children have "dyssynergia" (contraction of the external sphincter when they try to defecate), but some experts consider this finding to be voluntary (ie, the manometric equivalent of withholding) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Other children appear to have poor relaxation of the internal sphincter (which is not under voluntary control), known as internal anal sphincter (IAS) achalasia. The prevalence of this condition and its underlying implications are not well defined. Some patients with this finding respond to periodic treatment with botulinum toxin to help relax the anal sphincter (see <a class="local">'Other causes'</a> below). In selected populations, such as children with severe slow-transit constipation refractory to standard treatment, abnormalities of colonic motility and histology have been reported, suggesting underlying neuromuscular dysfunction [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>Painful defecation frequently precedes chronic fecal impaction and fecal soiling, especially in young toddlers. As an example, a retrospective study reviewed 227 children who presented to a pediatric gastroenterologist with difficult defecation [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Of the 35 percent who were less than three years of age, 86 percent presented with pain, 71 percent with impaction, and 97 percent with severe withholding. The younger children had painful defecation for a mean of 14±9 months before presentation. Of the older children, 85 percent presented with fecal soiling, 57 percent with pain, 73 percent with fecal impaction, and 96 percent exhibited withholding. Sixty-three percent of the children presenting with fecal soiling had a history of painful defecation beginning before three years of age, prior to the development of fecal soiling.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H704003029"><span class="h2">Toilet training issues</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Toilet training is a developmental milestone that affects self-esteem and independence. To master toileting, a toddler must develop the ability and interest in retaining a bowel movement until it can be released into the toilet. This behavior often leads to less frequent defecation and may lead to hard and painful bowel movements, which in turn lead to further voluntary withholding. The problem may be exacerbated if toilet training is too vigorously encouraged before the child is developmentally ready. Power struggles may develop if toilet training is forced on an unready child by a parent or caregiver, potentially leading to various problems, one of which is constipation. Children with hyperactivity disorders, sensory disorders, and/or autism may be at higher risk of having additional difficulties with toileting training, which triggers or exacerbates constipation [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>].</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) emphasizes that parents and caregivers should avoid coercing their children into toilet training and instead watch for signs that the child is developmentally ready [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. Toilet training works best when it is aligned with the child's signs of readiness to progress past each phase. Visits to the health care provider can help parents anticipate and optimally manage the steps in the process. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/611.html" rel="external">"Toilet training"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H704003065"><span class="h2">Dietary considerations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The modern diet has been cited as a contributor to childhood constipation. Unlike previous generations, children today consume large amounts of highly processed food items at the expense of fruit, vegetables, and fiber. Although increasing the intake of fiber is often recommended for acute and chronic constipation, the evidence base for this practice is weak and somewhat conflicting [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>]. While a balanced diet including fruits, vegetables, and fiber is recommended in all children and may be useful in preventing or treating mild constipation, there is little evidence that adding fiber to the diet is an effective treatment for severe constipation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5873.html" rel="external">"Chronic functional constipation and fecal incontinence in infants, children, and adolescents: Treatment", section on 'Dietary changes'</a>.)</p><p>In infants, the addition of cereals to the diet often causes the stools to become more formed and sometimes triggers constipation. This trigger usually can be identified by a focused history. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5872.html" rel="external">"Recent-onset constipation in infants and children", section on 'Transition to solid diet or introduction of cow's milk'</a>.)</p><p>The relationship between cow's milk and constipation is controversial [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Some infants or children do seem to have improvement in constipation when switched from cow's milk to a soy formula [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. An allergic mechanism has been suggested but not established. (See <a class="local">'Cow's milk intolerance'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3395211706"><span class="h2">Predisposing conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) appear to predispose to functional constipation with or without fecal incontinence. In a referral population, nearly 30 percent of children with functional constipation had symptoms of ASD, as determined by screening questionnaires; these children tended to be older and had longer duration of symptoms as compared with children with functional constipation but without ASD symptoms [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. It is likely that the prevalence of ASD is considerably lower in a non-referral or younger population of children with functional constipation.</p><p>Similarly, functional constipation and associated fecal incontinence are particularly common among children with ADHD [<a href="#rid15">15,25</a>]. The mechanism for the association between ADHD and functional constipation is not clear but may include atypical sensory processing or ignoring of sensory stimuli, other factors that interfere with the normal progress of toilet training, or side effects of medications used to treat ADHD.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H704003076"><span class="h2">Familial predisposition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children in some families may be predisposed to developing constipation. In one longitudinal study, a family history of constipation was observed in more than one-half of children with chronic constipation and soiling seen over a seven-year period [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. The reasons for this familial tendency are not clear and may include shared genetic, environmental, and/or dietary factors [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1865482862"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4220146105"><span class="h2">Functional constipation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Functional constipation describes persistently difficult, infrequent, or seemingly incomplete defecation, without evidence of a primary anatomic or biochemical cause [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. This definition is operationalized by the "Rome IV" diagnostic criteria, which require at least two of six symptoms describing stool frequency, hardness, and size; fecal incontinence; or volitional stool retention  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57882" href="/d/graphic/57882.html" rel="external">table 4</a>), with the stipulation that organic causes of constipation are excluded by a thorough evaluation [<a href="#rid30">30,31</a>].</p><p>The extent of the diagnostic evaluation to exclude organic causes is not specifically defined. In most cases, organic causes of constipation can be largely excluded on the basis of a careful history and physical examination. Focused laboratory and radiographic testing should be performed for children with atypical features (warning signs of possible organic constipation) or for those who fail to respond to a systematic and carefully administered intervention program, including disimpaction, frequent and effective use of laxatives, and behavioral management for at least six months. Selection of tests is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5906.html" rel="external">"Constipation in infants and children: Evaluation", section on 'Adjunctive testing for selected patients'</a>.)</p><p>Infant dyschezia is a functional disorder that is a frequent cause of constipation-like symptoms in infants. (See <a class="local">'Infant dyschezia'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H703999947"><span class="h2">Associated symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Fecal incontinence (the preferred term over encopresis or soiling) is now included among the diagnostic criteria for functional constipation. This is because 80 percent of children with fecal incontinence have underlying constipation. Conversely, fecal incontinence ultimately develops in up to 50 percent of children with chronic refractory constipation [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. The likely mechanism is that with chronic rectal distension, the anal canal shortens and the internal anal sphincter dilates. In this state, a transient relaxation of the external anal sphincter releases semisolid stool onto the perianal skin and clothing. Among children with constipation, there are no clear differences in pathophysiology or psychology between those with and without fecal incontinence. This issue is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5859.html" rel="external">"Functional fecal incontinence in infants and children: Definition, clinical manifestations, and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p>Abdominal pain is often associated with functional constipation but is not among the diagnostic criteria. Approximately 90 percent of children presenting with recurrent abdominal pain have a functional etiology such as constipation or irritable bowel syndrome [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. In fact, one study suggests that clinicians tend to over-diagnose constipation and under-diagnose irritable bowel syndrome [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/111.html" rel="external">"Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Approach to the evaluation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3776804400"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1944656120"><span class="h2">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A multinational working team developed criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders known as the "Rome IV" criteria [<a href="#rid30">30,31</a>]. For children and adolescents with developmental age of four years or older, functional constipation is defined by the presence of at least two of the following symptoms occurring at least once per week for at least one month, which are not explained by another medical condition  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57882" href="/d/graphic/57882.html" rel="external">table 4</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Two or fewer defecations per week</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>At least one episode of fecal incontinence per week</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of retentive posturing or excessive volitional stool retention (stool withholding)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of painful or hard bowel movements</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Presence of a large fecal mass in the rectum</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of large-diameter stools that may obstruct the toilet</p><p></p><p>For infants and toddlers, the criteria are modified to reflect age-appropriate toileting skills  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57882" href="/d/graphic/57882.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1028376348"><span class="h2">Exclusion of organic causes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of functional constipation also requires exclusion of organic causes of the symptoms. Organic causes are responsible for fewer than 5 percent of children with constipation [<a href="#rid10">10,33</a>] but are more common among young infants and among infants and children presenting with atypical features or "alarm signs"  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94989" href="/d/graphic/94989.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5906.html" rel="external">"Constipation in infants and children: Evaluation", section on 'Alarm symptoms and signs'</a>.)</p><p>The main causes are listed in the table for infants  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef96472" href="/d/graphic/96472.html" rel="external">table 5</a>) or older children  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94998" href="/d/graphic/94998.html" rel="external">table 6</a>). (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Particular attention should be paid to the following causes, which are relatively common or require urgent diagnosis:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Common organic causes – Cow's milk (or other dietary protein) intolerance, celiac disease, hypothyroidism</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Urgent causes:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Infants – Hirschsprung disease, spinal dysraphism, sacral teratoma, infantile botulism</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>All ages – Cystic fibrosis, lead poisoning, intestinal obstruction</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3632269205"><span class="h2">Recent-onset versus chronic constipation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although a diagnosis of functional constipation requires symptom duration of at least one month, there is no other consensus definition to distinguish types based on duration. However, in clinical practice, it is useful to distinguish between patients with recent-onset constipation compared with longer duration of symptoms or relapsing disease course:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Recent-onset constipation</strong> – We consider constipation to be "recent-onset" if symptoms have been present for eight weeks or less. These children often respond to short-term intervention, such as administration of laxatives for several days or weeks, or a brief behavioral intervention. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5872.html" rel="external">"Recent-onset constipation in infants and children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chronic constipation</strong> – We consider constipation to be chronic if symptoms have been present for three months or more, which may include multiple episodes of symptoms. These children typically require longer treatment with laxatives and more intensive and sustained behavioral support.

Infant dyschezia is a functional disorder, defined as at least 10 minutes of straining and crying before successful or unsuccessful passage of soft stool in an otherwise healthy infant younger than nine months of age [<a href="#rid30">30,35</a>]. The symptom is probably caused by failure to relax the pelvic floor during the defecation effort. In addition, infants also have inadequate abdominal muscle tone to produce a Valsalva maneuver.</p><p>Infant dyschezia generally resolves spontaneously as the infant matures, and reassurance of the parents is appropriate [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].

Infants who experience pain while defecating can learn withholding behavior. This is manifested by stiffening of the body and turning red in the face, which appears very similar to infant dyschezia. Therefore, it is important to evaluate an infant with suspected dyschezia to determine whether the bowel movements are hard and/or if there is any evidence of anal fissures or irritation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H704004324"><span class="h2">Hirschsprung disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hirschsprung disease is an important consideration in newborns and young infants presenting with constipation. Hirschsprung disease is a motor disorder of the colon caused by the congenital absence of ganglion cells in the rectum and distal colon.

Although it is relatively uncommon (approximately 1 in 5000 live births), prompt diagnosis is important to avoid complications, which may be life-threatening. Hirschsprung disease is associated with several congenital abnormalities and syndromes, including Down syndrome and cardiac disease (especially septal defects).

Infrequently, Hirschsprung disease may not be diagnosed until later in infancy or childhood if the disease is milder (eg, "ultrashort-segment" Hirschsprung disease). Such patients typically have a history of chronic constipation and poor weight gain. The physical examination may reveal a tight anal canal and empty ampulla. Very rarely, Hirschsprung disease is diagnosed in adulthood.

Most children with slow-transit constipation have no identifiable underlying disease or pathologic finding. Typical features of patients with refractory slow-transit constipation are symptoms of severe constipation within one year of age, or treatment-resistant encopresis at two to three years of age, and infrequent bowel movements (passing less than one stool a week) despite soft stools, as well as lack of response to optimal standard therapy with laxatives and behavioral intervention [<a href="#rid37">37,38</a>].</p><p>Children with slow-transit constipation are managed in the same way as other children with functional constipation, but they have a worse prognosis for prompt recovery [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].

We suggest early referral to a gastroenterologist for patients with this profile. </p><p>A few children with slow-transit constipation have disorders associated with colonic dysmotility, which include intestinal neuronal dysplasia and intestinal neuronal dysplasia type B. The utility of this histopathologic diagnosis has been limited by inconsistent diagnostic standardization, and it remains unclear if there is a causal relationship between the histologic findings and clinical symptoms [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. Patients with slow-transit constipation who do not respond well to standard therapy may benefit from further motility studies to assess for a colon neuromuscular abnormality.

They were also more likely to have anal fissures and erythema or edema at baseline, evidence of inflammation of the rectal mucosa, and signs of hypersensitivity (such as specific immunoglobulin E [IgE] antibodies to cow's milk antigens). It is possible that constipation in this subset of children is a manifestation of a cow's milk "protein intolerance," which typically manifests during infancy as colitis or enterocolitis.

In other cases, they may be described as an "anteriorly displaced anus" or "ectopic anus," which are terms that describe a rectoperineal fistula rather than a true anus. The anomaly may be overlooked in a newborn because some meconium may be passed through the fistula or vaginal opening.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Occasionally, the possibility of an anteriorly displaced anus arises in an older child during an evaluation for constipation. However, it is important to recognize that an anteriorly displaced anus causes constipation only when the anus is substantially displaced or there is associated anal stenosis [<a href="#rid44">44,45</a>]. There is little evidence that mildly or moderately displaced anus contributes to constipation [<a href="#rid46">46,47</a>].

Much less commonly, fecal incontinence may occur in the absence of constipation, in which case it is termed "nonretentive" fecal incontinence. (See <a class="local">'Associated symptoms'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5859.html" rel="external">"Functional fecal incontinence in infants and children: Definition, clinical manifestations, and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> – The differential diagnosis of functional constipation includes:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Infant dyschezia, which refers to the symptoms of straining and crying before successful or unsuccessful passage of soft stool in an otherwise healthy infant younger than nine months of age, which should be distinguished from other causes of straining  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef96472" href="/d/graphic/96472.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). Reassurance of the parents or caregivers is appropriate; rectal stimulation may be counterproductive, and laxatives are generally unnecessary.

These disorders usually can be distinguished from functional constipation by clinical features in the history or on physical examination  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79830" href="/d/graphic/79830.html" rel="external">table 7</a>).

Signs and symptoms suggestive of Hirschsprung disease include delayed passage of meconium (after 48 hours of life), failure to thrive or delayed growth, vomiting, abdominal distension, a tight anal canal with an empty ampulla, or an explosive expulsion of stool after the digital examination (squirt sign). (See <a class="local">'Hirschsprung disease'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5903.html" rel="external">"Congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Cow's milk may cause constipation in infants and young children, although the mechanism for this association is unclear. The diagnosis is suggested by onset of symptoms that coincide with an increase in cow's milk in the diet and is generally confirmed and treated by substitution of soy or hydrolyzed protein in the formula. (See <a class="local">'Cow's milk intolerance'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Celiac disease occasionally presents with constipation and few other symptoms and is common in most populations.
