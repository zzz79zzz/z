Certain types, including neurofibromas and schwannomas, may occur sporadically or in association with neurofibromatosis (NF).</p><p>This topic review will focus on various benign and malignant neoplasms and benign non-neoplastic tumors of the peripheral nerve. NF type 1 (NF1), <em>NF2</em>-related schwannomatosis (NF2) and schwannomatosis are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2939.html" rel="external">"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1): Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5206.html" rel="external">"<i>NF2</i>-related schwannomatosis (formerly neurofibromatosis type 2)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16350.html" rel="external">"Schwannomatoses related to genetic variants other than <i>NF2</i>"</a>.)</p><p>Nerve sheath tumors affecting the spinal cord are reviewed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5196.html" rel="external">"Intradural nerve sheath tumors"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30352971"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Symptoms and signs of peripheral nerve tumors are caused by direct nerve invasion, involvement of surrounding tissues, or mass effect [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. There are no specific clinical presentations unique or even especially suggestive of a particular nerve tumor, with the exception of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), <em>NF2</em>-related schwannomatosis (NF2) and schwannomatosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2939.html" rel="external">"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1): Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5206.html" rel="external">"<i>NF2</i>-related schwannomatosis (formerly neurofibromatosis type 2)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16350.html" rel="external">"Schwannomatoses related to genetic variants other than <i>NF2</i>"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptoms and signs</strong> – Patients present for evaluation of peripheral nerve tumors because of a soft tissue mass, pain, or focal neurologic findings, approximately in that order of frequency [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The duration and progression of symptoms or signs are important, as most benign tumors have a longer duration and a slow rate of progression, while malignant tumors tend to progress rapidly in size, amount of pain, and neurologic deficit [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Any mass changing its clinical character should be taken seriously, as that is one of the few clinical clues to its potentially malignant nature. In particular, rapidly expanding soft tissue masses in patients with NF are very suspicious for the presence of a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) and should be evaluated promptly [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Family history</strong> – A careful family history is important in the assessment of an underlying neurogenetic disorder, such as NF. A significant minority of peripheral nerve tumors are associated with NF1, NF2, or schwannomatosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Examination</strong> – On examination, peripheral nerve tumors tend to be mobile perpendicular to the axis of the peripheral nerve but fixed along the axis [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Ganglion cysts, lipomas, and lipofibromatous hamartomas are usually easily compressible, while neoplastic tumors are often firm in texture. Pain will occur in the region of the tumor and any nerve the tumor involves, but pain may not be specific enough to discern the particular involved nerve. Neurologic deficits of sensory and motor function correspond to the nerve in which the tumor originates or which it is compressing, and as such will often be most useful in localizing the tumor.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Obtaining a Tinel sign (radiating paresthesia elicited by tapping with a finger or hammer) over a nerve or tumor may also assist in localization to a particular nerve [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30353014"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goal of laboratory evaluation of the patient with a peripheral nerve tumor is to determine the type and location. Imaging is the most useful modality. Electrodiagnostic testing can help to localize involvement of specific nerves or portions of a plexus but is nonspecific for differentiating peripheral nerve tumors. Surgical biopsy is important for tumors that are deep or potentially malignant [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>].</p><p>Genetic testing for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or <em>NF2</em>-related schwannomatosis (NF2) is available but is not helpful in the evaluation of peripheral nerve tumors per se, as the diagnostic criteria for both diseases are clinical and most solitary neurofibromas and schwannomas occur in patients without NF.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30353033"><span class="h2">Imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Imaging is the most valuable tool for evaluation of peripheral nerve tumors [<a href="#rid4">4,6</a>]. Many tumors are first identified by imaging done for symptoms of pain, sensory loss, or weakness.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most helpful imaging modality, especially in denoting the presence of a mass, determining whether the mass is intrinsic or extrinsic to the nerve, and delineating involvement of adjacent structures  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58553" href="/d/graphic/58553.html" rel="external">image 1</a>) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. MRI is less helpful in determining the specific type of the tumor, as there are no pathognomonic signal characteristics for any type of tumor. However, there are signs on neuroimaging that may suggest whether a peripheral nerve sheath tumor is a schwannoma or a neurofibroma based on its relationship to the parent nerve. (See <a class="local">'Neurofibroma'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although not definitive, MRI can sometimes be helpful in determining the malignant nature of a tumor. Rapid growth of a known tumor, inhomogeneous enhancement, hemorrhage, necrosis, and heterogeneous signal intensity suggest, but are not specific for, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). Large tumors exceeding 5 cm, ill-defined margins, invasion of fat planes, and edema around the tumor all raise the possibility of malignancy  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56406" href="/d/graphic/56406.html" rel="external">image 2</a>) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Peripheral nerve ultrasonography, particularly in patients without diagnosis, can be a reasonable initial test in a patient with a suspected peripheral nerve tumor [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Ultrasound is inexpensive, widely accessible, can delineate location of lesion and its relationship to a peripheral nerve, and provides information as to probable diagnosis [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1832.html" rel="external">"Musculoskeletal ultrasonography: Clinical applications", section on 'Peripheral nerves'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Computed tomography (CT) scan is not the best imaging method, as many tumors have signal densities similar to muscle and so are not well defined. However, CT can be useful in demonstrating bony remodeling adjacent to the tumor, such as spinal neural foramina [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>18-F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) may be useful in distinguishing MPNSTs from benign tumors [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p>Metastatic cancer to peripheral nerve is not common, but in that scenario, CT, MRI, and PET scanning take on the additional importance of determining the primary tumor and staging the cancer.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30353054"><span class="h2">Electrodiagnostic testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Electrodiagnostic studies with electromyography and nerve conduction testing are not particularly helpful in the evaluation of peripheral nerve tumors, beyond indicating which nerve, nerves, or portions of a plexus may be involved [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. There are no specific electrodiagnostic findings for any peripheral nerve tumors and no distinction can be made between benign or malignant tumors. However, electrodiagnostic testing may provide some indication of the function of a particular nerve, and as such, may propel the patient and surgeon towards or against surgery.</p><p>More value may arise from intraoperative electrophysiologic monitoring to assist the surgeon in determining what is or is not functional neural tissue. A nonfunctional nerve found preoperatively needs to be verified intraoperatively but might allow the surgeon freer access to removal of the tumor [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30353061"><span class="h2">Biopsy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgical biopsy is important in the evaluation of tumors, especially those that are deep or thought to be malignant, as pathology will determine further surgical options. According to an international consensus statement on MPNSTs in NF, all patients with pain, enlargement of a soft tissue mass, change in texture, or advancement of neurologic deficit should have biopsy to assess for malignancy [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>A pathologist with expertise in peripheral nerve tumors is obviously important, as the differentiation between schwannoma and neurofibroma is key (eg, schwannomas are seen in NF2 and other schwannomatoses, neurofibromas are seen in NF1; neurofibromas can undergo malignant transformation, schwannomas do not) and the determination of malignancy can be difficult [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30353077"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment for peripheral nerve tumors is largely based on surgical removal. Not all patients with a peripheral nerve tumor will need surgery [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Some may be best treated conservatively with observation, such as the following [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Asymptomatic schwannomas or other tumors with no characteristics suspicious for malignancy</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Subcutaneous neurofibromas, dermal neurofibromas, plexiform neurofibromas with low suspicion for malignancy</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Non-neoplastic tumors</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tumors causing minimal symptoms in older adults, the medically impaired, or the debilitated patient</p><p></p><p>For patients with tumors that require treatment, surgery is the primary tool [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Disfigurement, bleeding, pain, neurologic deficit, and suspicion for malignancy are the prime indications for surgical removal [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. For benign tumors, removal of the tumor with minimization of residual neurologic deficit is the goal [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], though that can be impossible given the location of the tumor and intertwining with nerve fascicles, especially if the tumor is nonencapsulated [<a href="#rid1">1,6</a>].</p><p>Treatment of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Treatment of MPNSTs'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30353164"><span class="h1">NOMENCLATURE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The nomenclature of peripheral nerve tumors is confusing, as tumors often have more than one name, different tumors are called the same name, and some tumor cell types are not yet definitively characterized.</p><p>It is no surprise then that there is currently no widely accepted, overarching classification scheme for peripheral nerve tumors. Most authors utilize a system based on the presence or absence of neoplasia, whether the neoplasia is benign or malignant, and the presumed cellular origin of the underlying neoplasia, ie, nerve sheath origin or not  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60755" href="/d/graphic/60755.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30353175"><span class="h1">BENIGN NON-NEOPLASTIC NERVE TUMORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The category of benign non-neoplastic nerve tumors includes neuroma, ganglion cyst, intraneural heterotopic ossification, sarcoid granuloma, inflammatory pseudotumor of nerve, leprosy, hypertrophic neuropathy, lipofibromatous hamartoma, and neuromuscular choristoma.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30353182"><span class="h2">Neuroma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neuromas belong to a class of tumors best called reactive [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Traumatic neuromas occur after nerve injury causing interrupted axons (neurotmesis). Regenerating axons lack an endoneurial tube to follow, which results in a mass of disorganized axons that is often quite painful and tender  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55239" href="/d/graphic/55239.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). Neuromas tend to be small and firm in texture, and require excision for cure and diagnosis.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Morton neuroma is a subject of controversy regarding its nomenclature, pathology, and appropriate treatment. Abnormalities ascribed to Morton neuroma are typically located between the metatarsals of the third and fourth toes or at the bifurcation of the fourth plantar digital nerve  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef134378" href="/d/graphic/134378.html" rel="external">image 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef134924" href="/d/graphic/134924.html" rel="external">image 4</a>). The lesions look like a traumatic neuroma grossly, and are comprised of degenerated and/or demyelinated axons, vascular hyalinization, and fibrosis [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. Clinical manifestations can include pain and tenderness, but similar lesions are common in patients who are asymptomatic. Management of Morton neuroma is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/113052.html" rel="external">"Evaluation, diagnosis, and select management of common causes of forefoot pain in adults", section on 'Interdigital (Morton) neuroma'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Solitary circumscribed neuromas (also known as palisaded encapsulated neuromas) are small, firm, nonpigmented, painless nodules found in proximity to mucocutaneous junctions, usually in the face. They are benign but may be mistaken for a basal cell carcinoma. Surgical removal is curative.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mucosal neuromas are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b, which is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait due to a single mutation in the ret proto-oncogene (<em>RET</em>) [<a href="#rid11">11,16</a>]. Mucosal neuromas present as diffusely enlarged lips, tongue nodules, and thickened eyelids, either diffusely or focally, usually in the first or second decade. Pathologically, mucosal neuromas are comprised by markedly enlarged nerve fibers. There is no specific treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7870.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2", section on 'MEN2B'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30353205"><span class="h2">Ganglion cyst</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ganglion cysts are non-neural benign cystic tumors that usually occur in proximity to joints or tendons. They develop from chronic local mechanical irritation in perineural tissue or extend from joints to enter the epineurium [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The common peroneal nerve is frequently affected, as are the hands and wrists. A mucous cyst is a ganglion occurring at the distal interphalangeal joint, usually in patients between 40 and 70 years old [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>Ganglion cysts are more common in women than men. Pain and neurologic deficits of sensation and strength in the territory of the affected nerve are typical presenting manifestations, arising from either intra- or extraneural compression. Asymptomatic cysts found on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are frequent  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69811" href="/d/graphic/69811.html" rel="external">image 5</a>). Surgical removal or aspiration is indicated if symptoms and signs warrant, but intrafascicular dissection and neurolysis in cysts with intraneural involvement may be required [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30353217"><span class="h2">Intraneural heterotopic ossification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Heterotopic ossification of peripheral nerve has been reported rarely and resembles myositis ossificans pathologically with a central fibroblastic core, an intermediate zone of osteoid production, and a peripheral zone of ossification. Like myositis ossificans, it is thought to occur secondary to local trauma. Pain, paresthesias, and weakness in the distribution of the affected nerve are the presenting complaints [<a href="#rid11">11,18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30353224"><span class="h2">Sarcoid granuloma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Sarcoid granulomas can involve cranial and peripheral nerves, which appear firm and thickened. This can be a focal or multifocal process, causing pain, sensory loss, paresthesias, and weakness. The diagnosis may require nerve biopsy. The mainstay of treatment is glucocorticoids, as with systemic sarcoidosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4834.html" rel="external">"Neurologic sarcoidosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4325.html" rel="external">"Treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis refractory to initial therapy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30353253"><span class="h2">Inflammatory pseudotumor of nerve</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Inflammatory pseudotumor of nerve is another rare disorder [<a href="#rid11">11,19</a>]. The swelling is composed of chronic inflammatory (mostly T lymphocytes) and reactive mesenchymal cells, resulting in segmental fusiform or nodular enlargement. The infiltrate is usually limited to the epineurium. Sensorimotor deficits in the territory of the affected nerve lead to evaluation, and surgery is usually done because of the deficits and the presumed diagnosis of nerve sheath tumor.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30353260"><span class="h2">Leprosy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Leprous neuropathy results from infection with <em>Mycobacterium leprae</em> and is a common cause of neuropathy in underdeveloped countries. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5348.html" rel="external">"Leprosy: Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Neuropathy'</a>.)</p><p>Leprosy has a tuberculoid and lepromatous form, dependent on each patient's immune response. Tuberculoid leprosy involves cutaneous and subcutaneous nerves, with extensive destruction of nerve fibers secondary to the inflammatory response engendered by the infection [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Nerves are often enlarged due to the inflammation and from cold abscesses and fibrosis within the nerve.

On computed tomography (CT), intraneural neurofibromas are well-demarcated masses that are hypodense to muscle [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Contrast enhancement is minimal, if any. Since the neurofibroma is intermixed with tumor components throughout its length, it appears as a fusiform enlargement of the nerve that is inseparable from the parent nerve  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef134383" href="/d/graphic/134383.html" rel="external">image 8</a>). This is in contrast to schwannoma, which is more often eccentric and not centered along the course of the nerve. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), neurofibromas show a low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. They enhance frequently, and usually heterogeneously. On T2 images, the tumors will often show a characteristic central hypodense region, called the target sign, which is presumed due to dense collagen and fibrous tissue in the center  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66568" href="/d/graphic/66568.html" rel="external">image 9</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef134383" href="/d/graphic/134383.html" rel="external">image 8</a>).

However, this is more likely to be accomplished in patients with solitary neurofibromas than patients with NF1. The greater likelihood of pain and neurologic deficits in patients with NF1 is due in part to the occurrence of plexiform neurofibromas in NF1 and to the need to attempt total resection in NF1 tumors because of the risk of malignant deterioration. In a series reporting surgical excision of 123 neurofibromas in 121 patients without NF1, stable or improved motor function and good pain resolution were observed in 90 and 88 percent of patients, respectively [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].

Tumors in the brachial plexus are associated with a relatively high proportion of postoperative morbidity. In one study, removal of neurofibromas involving the brachial plexus in patients without NF1 who had no neurologic deficits resulted in some degree of postoperative weakness in 8 of 31 patients (26 percent) [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Similarly, 28 percent of patients with NF1 who had no preoperative weakness experienced significant postoperative weakness.</p><p>A number of plexiform neurofibromas will degenerate into a more aggressive nodular lesion with increased avidity on 18-F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. These nodular lesions grow more aggressively than the plexiform neurofibromas themselves and degenerate into MPNSTs. Special attention, and occasionally surgery, must be considered for these rapidly changing lesions. (See <a class="local">'Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors'</a> below.)</p><p>An additional type of nodular neurofibroma in patients with NF1 is "atypical neurofibromatous neoplasm with uncertain biologic potential" (ANNUBP). These are tumors with concerning histologic features but that are not definitively malignant. Histologic criteria for ANNUBP include histologic nuclear atypia, hypercellularity, increased mitotic activity (at least one mitosis in 50 high-power fields [HPF] but less than 3 mitoses per 10 HPF), and focal loss of neurofibroma architecture (eg, herringbone and/or fascicular storiform growth patterns) [<a href="#rid36">36,37</a>].

The incidence of MPNSTs in the general population is 0.001 percent.</p><p>MPNSTs, which are classified as malignant soft tissue sarcomas, can arise from pre-existing plexiform neurofibromas or perineuriomas, or normal nerves. They do not arise from schwannomas. MPNSTs also occur as secondary neoplasms 10 to 20 years after radiation therapy (RT), accounting for up to 10 percent of MPNSTs [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The incidence of MPNST in childhood cancer survivors is 40-fold higher than the expected rate in the general population [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. Twenty-two to 50 percent of MPNSTs occur in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), the rest being sporadic [<a href="#rid2">2,52,54</a>].</p><p>The risk of developing an MPNST in a patient with NF1 is between 8 and 13 percent [<a href="#rid55">55</a>], with most, if not all, arising from pre-existing plexiform neurofibromas [<a href="#rid56">56</a>]. In patients with NF1, the presence of an internal plexiform neurofibroma is associated with a 20-fold increased risk of developing an MPNST compared with the risk in those lacking an internal plexiform neurofibroma [<a href="#rid56">56</a>]. MPNSTs tend to present at an earlier age in patients with NF1 (third or fourth decade of life, versus seventh decade in patients who do not have NF1) [<a href="#rid55">55</a>].</p><p>MPNSTs are most commonly found on the extremities and trunk, and less often on the head and neck [<a href="#rid57">57,58</a>]. The clinical picture is characterized by rapid change, whether in pain, size of tumor mass, or progression of neurologic deficit, especially when occurring in a pre-existing peripheral nerve tumor [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In particular, change in tumor size is most predictive of malignancy [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Major nerve trunks (eg, the brachial plexus) are frequent sites of involvement [<a href="#rid52">52</a>], but a nerve of origin is often not evident [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of malignant versus benign tumor requires biopsy, which should be open and involve multiple sections of the tumor [<a href="#rid6">6,52</a>]. Conventional radiographic imaging may help but cannot reliably differentiate between malignant and benign. Ultrasonography of the affected nerve can begin to delineate tumor type, location, and relationship to the underlying nerve [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), signs that are more consistent with MPNST than neurofibroma include large tumor size (&gt;5 cm), heterogeneity on precontrast T1-weighted imaging, intratumoral cystic change, ill-defined margins, lack of a "target" sign, and a perilesional edema-like zone  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56406" href="/d/graphic/56406.html" rel="external">image 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef134392" href="/d/graphic/134392.html" rel="external">image 12</a>) [<a href="#rid7">7,59,60</a>].</p><p>Emerging data suggest that MRI diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is at least as accurate as 18-F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/computed tomography (CT) in differentiating benign from malignant tumors [<a href="#rid61">61</a>].

Microscopically, most MPNSTs are highly cellular, comprised of spindle cells reminiscent of Schwann cells. The cells are mitotically active  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54780" href="/d/graphic/54780.html" rel="external">picture 7</a>). The cells are weakly S100 positive, consistent with dedifferentiation from Schwann cells. Variations include malignant triton tumor (MPNST with rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation), a highly malignant tumor containing embryonic striated muscle components [<a href="#rid63">63,64</a>].</p><p>In all NF1-associated MPNSTs and most sporadic MPNSTs, both NF1 alleles are lost. However, homozygous loss of NF1 is not sufficient to generate an MPNST, and additional genetic hits are necessary, such as mutations in p53 and deletions in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (<em>CDKN2A</em>) [<a href="#rid65">65</a>]. Positive p53 staining is very common in MPNSTs, and intense immunoreactivity to p53 may be an indicator of malignancy [<a href="#rid32">32,66</a>]. In addition, somatic loss-of-function mutations in SUZ12, polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (<em>SUZ12</em>) and embryonic ectoderm development (<em>EED</em>), two genes that encode for subunits of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), have been identified in approximately half of MPNSTs [<a href="#rid67">67,68</a>]. Loss of histone H3K27 dimethylation staining in MPNST is highly specific for PRC2 loss and a diagnostic indicator of malignancy [<a href="#rid69">69</a>]. PRC2 mutations appear to cooperate in MPNST tumorigenesis by amplifying Ras pathway activation, an alteration that may have therapeutic potential [<a href="#rid67">67,68,70</a>].</p><p><em>BRAF</em> V600E mutations are found in a subset of MPNSTs (1 of 13 sporadic MPNSTs in one series, 5 of 25 sporadic and 1 of 37 NF1-associated MPNSTs in another series) [<a href="#rid71">71,72</a>], but this finding does not presently have therapeutic implications.

Because of their rarity and the frequent need for multimodal treatment, the evaluation and management of MPNSTs ideally should be carried out in a center with expertise in the treatment of sarcomas, including surgical, orthopedic, medical, and radiation oncology. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7734.html" rel="external">"Overview of multimodality treatment for primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and superficial trunk", section on 'Importance of multidisciplinary evaluation and management'</a>.)</p><p>For limb primaries, surgical resection alone with a sufficient wide margin to achieve a potentially curative operation may require amputation of the limb proximal to the tumor, or disarticulation of a shoulder or hip, with sacrifice of nerves, nerve trunks, and adjacent soft tissue structures [<a href="#rid6">6,52,73</a>]. Nerve grafting is not appropriate due to the proximal nature of the remaining nerve, the use of adjuvant RT, and the natural history of MPNSTs. At other sites (eg, the head and neck), wide excision may be impossible due to the constraints of the local anatomy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3367.html" rel="external">"Head and neck sarcomas", section on 'Other adult soft tissue sarcomas'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3367.html" rel="external">"Head and neck sarcomas", section on 'Surgical principles'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/109748.html" rel="external">"Surgical resection of primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities", section on 'Sarcoma resection and reconstruction'</a>.)</p><p>Although the rarity of these tumors has precluded any definitive efficacy trials [<a href="#rid4">4</a>], as with other adult-type soft tissue sarcomas, adjunctive RT can provide an opportunity for limb salvage and also improve local control where the attainment of wide excision margins by surgery alone is difficult. Adjunctive RT may be administered preoperatively or postoperatively.

Initial RT or chemoradiotherapy may permit some initially unresectable tumors to undergo later limb-sparing surgery. Where available, isolated limb perfusion, isolated limb infusion, or regional hyperthermia with systemic chemotherapy represent potentially limb-preserving options, but expertise is limited, and these procedures are not in widespread use in the United States.

In various studies, five-year survival ranged from 34 to 64 percent [<a href="#rid2">2,6,52,57,74,75</a>]. The variable outcomes among these reports may be due in part to differences in treatment protocols and to the proportion of NF1-associated MPNSTs, which often present at a later stage with larger tumors than sporadic MPNSTs [<a href="#rid77">77</a>]. A survival meta-analysis of 28 studies published from 1963 through 2011 demonstrated worse survival for NF1-associated tumors compared with sporadic tumors (hazard ratio [HR] 1.39, 95% CI 1.10-1.72); however, in an analysis limited to series published since 2001, the pooled HR was smaller and no longer significant (HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.85-1.66), suggesting that observed differences in outcome between NF1 and sporadic tumors may be lessening over time [<a href="#rid75">75</a>].</p><p>One of the largest studies evaluating MPNSTs was a single-center retrospective review of 175 cases seen over a 25-year period [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. The median age was 44, and one-third of MPNSTs arose in the setting of NF1. The extremities were the most common site (45 percent), followed by the trunk (34 percent) and head and neck (19 percent). At presentation, 84 percent had locoregional disease, while 16 percent had distant metastases. A complete (R0) resection was accomplished in 69 percent of cases, and the majority had adjuvant treatment with RT, chemotherapy, or both. At a median follow-up of 74 months, the local recurrence rate was 22 percent, and the 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival rates were 60 and 45 percent, respectively. On multivariate analysis, higher tumor grade, size ≥5 cm, truncal location, and local recurrence were associated with a significantly worse prognosis. Patients with NF1 presented with larger tumors (median 9.9 versus 6.6 cm for sporadic tumors), and there was a statistically nonsignificant trend toward worse five-year disease-specific survival (54 versus 75 percent for sporadic cases).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30353537"><span class="h1">MALIGNANT NON-NEURAL SHEATH TUMORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The peripheral nervous system is often involved in patients with cancer, most commonly as a result of chemotherapy or radiation therapy (RT).

Another rare manner in which peripheral nerves may be involved is perineural spread, in which neoplastic cells migrate along the endoneurial tubes, with no extension beyond the perineurium.
