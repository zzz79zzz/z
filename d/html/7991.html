All of the available nonselective NSAIDs (nsNSAIDs) generally inhibit both isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX), COX-1 and COX-2, with the exception of the nonacetylated salicylates. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7989.html" rel="external">"NSAIDs (including aspirin): Pharmacology and mechanism of action"</a>.)</p><p>A number of factors can increase the risk of adverse effects due to NSAIDs. These include drug dose, drug-drug interactions, and comorbidities. The latter two factors are more common in older adults, and approximately 14 million Americans 45 and over use various non-aspirin NSAIDs regularly [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States predicts that, with the aging of the population, there will be a significant increase in the prevalence of painful degenerative and inflammatory rheumatic conditions. This will probably lead to a parallel increase in the use of NSAIDs. An increased use of NSAIDs in an aging population will increase the number of adverse events related to NSAID use. It has been estimated that 5 to 7 percent of hospital admissions are related to adverse effects of drugs, and, of these hospitalizations, those that result from gastrointestinal, nervous system, renal, or allergic effects of non-aspirin NSAIDs are responsible for approximately 11 to 12 percent [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p>Given their common mechanisms of action and the effects of the other factors that increase risk of adverse effects, it is difficult to name a "safest" nsNSAID. As an example, many clinicians believe that <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8547" href="/z/d/drug information/8547.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a> is quite safe, which is true when the drug is used at the lowest possible dose. However, increasing the dose of any NSAID is associated with an increased risk of most related toxicities.</p><p>Drug interactions may also be the source of adverse effects. For example, a potentially clinically relevant interaction between <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8547" href="/z/d/drug information/8547.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> referred to as "aspirin resistance" has been observed in ex vivo platelet assays when ibuprofen is administered to healthy controls before aspirin. Similar effects, which also depend upon timing of drug administration, have been demonstrated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9682" href="/z/d/drug information/9682.html" rel="external">naproxen</a> and may occur with other NSAIDs. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7968.html" rel="external">"NSAIDs: Adverse cardiovascular effects", section on 'Aspirin and other antithrombotic agents'</a>.)</p><p>Minimizing toxicity of NSAIDs also depends upon a thorough patient evaluation for those characteristics or comorbidities that enhance their risk of developing NSAID-induced toxicity. As an example, risk factors have been identified for the development of gastroduodenal toxicity, acute renal failure, and adverse cardiovascular effects, such as a history of a gastrointestinal event, reduced renal function, or a history of cardiovascular disease, respectively. (See <a class="local">'Gastrointestinal effects'</a> below and <a class="local">'Renal effects'</a> below and <a class="local">'Cardiovascular effects'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">ACUTE NSAID OVERDOSE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Accidental or intentional ingestion of a single larger-than-recommended dose of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) is typically well tolerated and usually does not cause serious adverse effects. However, such ingestions may be accompanied by the taking of other analgesics, which may have more serious consequences. Among these drugs, salicylates and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> are important ones to consider. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/329.html" rel="external">"Salicylate (aspirin) poisoning: Clinical manifestations and evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/340.html" rel="external">"Acetaminophen (paracetamol) poisoning in adults: Pathophysiology, presentation, and evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/318.html" rel="external">"Acetaminophen (paracetamol) poisoning: Management in adults and children"</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms of acute overdose of NSAIDs are nonspecific, and patients are most often asymptomatic; when symptoms do occur, the most common include nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, blurred vision, and dizziness.</p><p>The clinical and laboratory features, evaluation, and management of an acute NSAID overdose are presented in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/341.html" rel="external">"Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) poisoning"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">GASTROINTESTINAL EFFECTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsNSAIDs) have potentially important gastrointestinal adverse effects, which include dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, and bleeding.

Chronic, as opposed to short-term, use; untreated <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> infection; and use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) may also increase the risk of bleeding or perforation.

These issues and the factors that increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular effects are discussed in detail separately.

The overall risk of clinically evident liver injury has been estimated at only 1 to 8 per 100,000 patient-years of drug use and is due to hepatocellular injury [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with most NSAIDs, usually occurring in the first 6 to 12 weeks of treatment and resolving within 4 to 8 weeks of discontinuation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2647688710"><span class="h2">Clinical spectrum and frequency</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute liver injury is uncommon and not predicted by mild increased aminotransferase levels [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. The net hepatic risk was illustrated in a retrospective study of 625,000 patients who received more than two million prescriptions for NSAIDs and who were evaluated for newly diagnosed acute liver injury [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The following results were noted:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There were 23 cases of acute liver injury over the four-year study period.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The incidence of acute liver injury was 3.7 per 100,000 NSAID users or 1.1 per 100,000 NSAID prescriptions; none of the cases had a fatal outcome.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9967" href="/z/d/drug information/9967.html" rel="external">Sulindac</a> was the only NSAID with a substantially greater risk than that of the overall NSAID group; the incidence of hepatic injury with this drug was 27 per 100,000 prescriptions. However, the liver injury associated with sulindac and the other NSAIDs was generally mild and reversible.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Users of NSAIDs who had rheumatoid arthritis (RA) had a 10-fold increased risk of acute liver injury compared with NSAID-treated patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Concomitant exposure to other hepatotoxic medications probably increased the risk of hepatic injury in patients with RA.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Transient minor increases in liver enzymes were not a useful predictor of diagnosed NSAID-associated acute liver injury.</p><p></p><p>The hepatotoxicity associated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9967" href="/z/d/drug information/9967.html" rel="external">sulindac</a> was further studied in an analysis of reports submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. This report found that sulindac injury involved females more than males and was more prevalent in patients over the age of 50. The majority of events were idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reactions.</p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9348" href="/z/d/drug information/9348.html" rel="external">Diclofenac</a> has been reported to cause clinical hepatitis, including antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity and histologic evidence of chronic active hepatitis [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Introduction of another class of NSAID in many of these patients appeared to be safe. Severe liver injury has been reported but remains very rare [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Possible disease-specific risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It has been suggested that liver function abnormalities due to NSAIDs may be disease-specific. The possible role of the underlying disease was illustrated in a meta-analysis of over 1600 patients. This analysis studied elevations in the serum concentration of aspartate aminotransferase (AST, formerly termed serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) in patients with RA and OA taking placebo, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9348" href="/z/d/drug information/9348.html" rel="external">diclofenac</a> [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The principal determinants of AST concentrations were found to be the baseline AST value, the use of aspirin in patients with RA, and the use of diclofenac in patients with OA. Other significant factors included duration of therapy and, possibly, daily dose. The AST elevations were minimal and were not related to the occurrence of clinical hepatitis.</p><p>In other studies, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> caused elevated serum aminotransferase concentrations in 40 percent of patients with active juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) [<a href="#rid4">4-6,10</a>]. Some of these events had serious hepatic consequences like hepatitis. However, aspirin is used rarely today in JIA. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6400.html" rel="external">"Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Treatment", section on 'Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Laboratory testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hepatotoxicity is rare, and the cost-effectiveness of monitoring serum transaminase levels is uncertain. However, if the aminotransferases are noted to rise to greater than three times the upper limit of normal, if there is a fall in serum albumin (suggestive of a synthetic defect induced by the drug), or if the international normalized ratio (INR) is prolonged, NSAID toxicity should be suspected, and the potentially offending agent should be discontinued.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">ANAPHYLAXIS AND ALLERGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Anaphylaxis to nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsNSAIDs) has been reported and is assumed to be an immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated immunologic reaction. The symptoms of anaphylaxis include (but are not limited to) urticaria, angioedema, generalized pruritus, tachycardia or bradycardia, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea and vomiting, headache, and lightheadedness. Anaphylaxis and other allergic and pseudoallergic reactions in response to NSAIDs are discussed in detail elsewhere.

These include idiosyncratic and rare, but potentially serious, reactions such as neutropenia and, even less often, aplastic anemia. In addition, NSAIDs can increase bleeding risk by several mechanisms: All nonspecific NSAIDs exert direct effects upon platelets to inhibit platelet function by reducing platelet adhesion and aggregation, which can be especially problematic in patients on other antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants, and certain drug interactions by NSAIDs with other agents can also increase bleeding risk.

Exposure to either nsNSAIDs or opioids in the period 61 to 90 days after the fracture was associated with nonunion; however, exposure to either drug class during earlier time periods did not correlate significantly with this complication.

However, concerns had been raised about NSAID use early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic by several European health officials, including the French health minister, who publicly suggested that the use of NSAIDs might worsen the course of a COVID-19 infection [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. As a result, suggestions were made to not use NSAIDs, and instead, use <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> for symptomatic relief of fevers [<a href="#rid54">54</a>]. This suggestion was based upon several relatively small studies of NSAID use and outcomes from pulmonary infections [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]; the prior studies were not in people with COVID-19 and did not control for severity of infection.</p><p>A subsequent well-designed propensity score‐matched cohort study, using a large United Kingdom primary care dataset, studied adult patients aged ≥18 years with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis followed during 2020 [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. Patients prescribed an NSAID (excluding topical preparations) were compared with those prescribed either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9291" href="/z/d/drug information/9291.html" rel="external">codeine</a> or dihydrocodeine. There were 13,202 patients prescribed NSAIDs compared with 12,457 prescribed the comparator drugs. During follow-up, the incidence rates of suspected/confirmed COVID‐19 were 15.4 and 19.9 per 1000 person‐years in the NSAID‐exposed and comparator groups, respectively. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) in the propensity score-matched analyses for primary care consultations with suspected/confirmed COVID‐19 were 0.79 (95% CI 0.57‐1.11) and for subsequent mortality were 0.85 (95% CI 0.61‐1.20), consistent with no increase in risk with NSAID use. Another very large observational study from the United Kingdom also found no association between COVID-19 outcomes and NSAID use [<a href="#rid49">49</a>], as did a nation-wide cohort study from Denmark [<a href="#rid50">50</a>] and meta-analyses from 2021 [<a href="#rid51">51,52</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25"><span class="h1">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, "The Basics" and "Beyond the Basics."

Many of the toxic effects of the NSAIDs are related to their main mode of action, the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Minimizing toxicity of NSAIDs depends upon a thorough patient evaluation for characteristics that enhance the risk of developing NSAID-induced toxicity, such as specific factors that increase risk for acute renal failure or gastrointestinal toxicity. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Accidental or intentional ingestion of a larger-than-recommended dose of an NSAID is typically well tolerated and does not cause serious adverse effects. However, such ingestions may be accompanied by the taking of other analgesics that may have more serious consequences, such as salicylates or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a>. (See <a class="local">'Acute NSAID overdose'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nonselective NSAIDs (nsNSAIDs) have clinically important gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular effects. Adverse gastrointestinal effects include dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, and bleeding. Renal adverse effects include acute renal failure due to renal vasoconstriction, worsening of underlying hypertension, and electrolyte and fluid abnormalities. Additionally, the risk of renal cell cancer may be increased. Cardiovascular effects include interference by some agents with the antiplatelet activity of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>, an effect on cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke, and worsening of heart failure. (See <a class="local">'Gastrointestinal effects'</a> above and <a class="local">'Renal effects'</a> above and <a class="local">'Malignancy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Cardiovascular effects'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Elevations of serum aminotransferases (transaminases) are commonly associated with NSAID use. However, these elevations are generally mild and reversible, and liver failure is quite rare. Reactions may be more common with some NSAIDs (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9967" href="/z/d/drug information/9967.html" rel="external">sulindac</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9348" href="/z/d/drug information/9348.html" rel="external">diclofenac</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>) and in patients on other hepatotoxic medications or with certain disorders, including juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). The potentially offending agent should be discontinued if the aminotransferases rise to greater than three times the upper limit of normal, if there is a fall in serum albumin, or if the prothrombin time is prolonged. (See <a class="local">'Hepatic injury'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pulmonary reactions are uncommon; they include bronchospasm and pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia. Bronchospasm can result from the condition "aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease" (AERD), which appears related to cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 inhibition. Patients with AERD may have concomitant chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis; inflammation affecting the entire respiratory tract may be difficult to distinguish from anaphylaxis in some patients. Anaphylaxis to NSAIDs has also been reported and is assumed to be an immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated immunologic reaction. (See <a class="local">'Pulmonary effects'</a> above and <a class="local">'Anaphylaxis and allergy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>nsNSAIDs have several important hematologic effects. The antiplatelet effects of NSAIDs, which are due to inhibition of COX-1, lead to diminished production of thromboxane A2, resulting in decreased platelet aggregation. NSAIDs should thus be avoided in patients with preexisting platelet defects and should be withheld preoperatively for at least four to five times the drug half-life. Chronic <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> therapy slightly increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Use of nonselective nonsalicylate NSAIDs together with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> may increase the international normalized ratio (INR) and may increase bleeding risk due to the additional antiplatelet effect. Aplastic anemia has been most strongly associated with some of the early NSAIDs (eg, phenylbutazone and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8559" href="/z/d/drug information/8559.html" rel="external">indomethacin</a>); neutropenia is seen in less than 1 percent of patients. (See <a class="local">'Hematologic effects'</a> above and <a class="local">'Antiplatelet effects'</a> above and <a class="local">'Interaction with antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants'</a> above and <a class="local">'Neutropenia and aplastic anemia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Central nervous system (CNS) side effects of NSAIDs include aseptic meningitis, psychosis, and cognitive dysfunction. Tinnitus and hearing loss are common problems, particularly with high doses of salicylates, but can occur with any NSAID. Tinnitus is typically reversible upon cessation of drug therapy and is a good warning sign to identify some of those patients who are developing high blood levels of the drug. (See <a class="local">'Neurologic'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Various skin reactions may develop in association with the use of NSAIDs. Severe, potentially life-threatening reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) are uncommon. Morbilliform rashes and urticaria are also seen. (See <a class="local">'Skin reactions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A small increased risk of nonunion in patients with bone fractures has been reported with the use of nsNSAIDs or COX-2-selective agents. However, a causal relationship has not been proven, and the effect of these drugs on fracture healing in humans is uncertain.
