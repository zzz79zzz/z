         In individuals with normal aortic valves, the effective area of valve opening equals the cross-sectional area of the left ventricular (LV) outflow tract, which is approximately 3.0 to 4.0 cm
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         in adults. As aortic stenosis (AS) develops, a minimal valve gradient is present until the orifice area becomes less than half of normal. The natural history of AS therefore begins with a prolonged period without hemodynamically significant outflow obstruction and without symptoms due to AS. However, even without valve obstruction, the early changes of calcific valve disease (aortic sclerosis) are associated with increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, as discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8123.html" rel="external">
          "Aortic valve sclerosis and pathogenesis of calcific aortic stenosis", section on 'Clinical significance of aortic sclerosis'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Serial hemodynamic examinations in several studies show that progressive valve obstruction occurs in nearly all adults with calcific aortic valve disease once even mild valve obstruction is present, typically defined as an antegrade aortic velocity greater than 2.0 m/s  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81124" href="/z/d/graphic/81124.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Patients remain asymptomatic as aortic velocity increases and valve area decreases until the severity of obstruction results in an inadequate cardiac output with exercise leading to symptom onset. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8165.html" rel="external">
          "Natural history, epidemiology, and prognosis of aortic stenosis", section on 'Risk factors for progression'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In general, symptoms in patients with AS and normal LV systolic function rarely occur until the stenosis is severe, as defined by an antegrade maximum aortic velocity over 4.0 m/s and/or mean transvalvular gradient exceeding 40 mmHg. Typically valve area is 1.0 cm
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         or less but may be larger with mixed stenosis and regurgitation or with a large body size  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95630" href="/z/d/graphic/95630.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). However, many patients do not develop symptoms until even more severe valve obstruction is present, and some patients with less severe AS or with mixed stenosis and regurgitation are symptomatic. Some of these asymptomatic patients with hemodynamically severe AS benefit from aortic valve replacement (AVR) (see
         <a class="local">
          'Risk stratification and indications for valve replacement'
         </a>
         below), but most can be managed conservatively until symptoms supervene. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8164.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aortic stenosis in adults", section on 'Complications'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The only effective treatment for symptomatic severe AS is valve replacement (surgical AVR [SAVR] or transcatheter aortic valve implantation [TAVI]). Choice of therapy in patients with symptomatic severe AS is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83110.html" rel="external">
          "Choice of intervention for severe calcific aortic stenosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Among asymptomatic patients, there are no medical therapies that have been proven to delay progression of the leaflet disease. Although retrospective studies of statin therapy were promising, a large randomized prospective study demonstrated that statin therapy does not prevent disease progression. However, many patients meet criteria for statin therapy based on standard risk factor evaluation and should be treated according to guidelines. In addition, most adults with AS have concurrent cardiac conditions that require therapy, including hypertension, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation (AF), and LV dysfunction.
        </p>
        <p>
         The medical management of patients with asymptomatic AS will be reviewed here. The pathophysiology, natural history, and clinical features of AS, the timing of valve replacement for AS, and the treatment of patients with bicuspid aortic valve are discussed separately. (See

         Serial echocardiography is useful for measurement of hemodynamic severity and monitoring disease progression. Echocardiography also provides information about LV function and associated lesions and is an important part of an integrated approach that includes a detailed history, a careful physical examination, and evaluation of exercise tolerance, in selected cases [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Invasive hemodynamic evaluation is not recommended in asymptomatic patients and is usually unnecessary unless noninvasive testing is inconclusive. Patients should receive education about the expected disease course and symptoms that should be reported such as dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, exertional chest pain, lightheadedness, and syncope. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8165.html" rel="external">
          "Natural history, epidemiology, and prognosis of aortic stenosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         We agree with the 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association valve guideline recommendations for serial echocardiography in patients with AS  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95630" href="/z/d/graphic/95630.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         ) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In patients with stage B mild AS (transvalvular velocity 2 to 2.9 m/s), echocardiography is recommended every three to five years. In patients with stage B moderate AS (transvalvular velocity 3 to 3.9 m/s), echocardiography is recommended every one to two years.
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with mild or greater AS, there is a progressive reduction in aortic valve area that averages 0.1 cm
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         /year and a progressive increase in aortic jet velocity that averages 0.3 m/s per year, with considerable variation between patients in the rate of progression. Risk factors for hemodynamics progression include a smaller valve area, LV hypertrophy, and moderate to severe valve calcification.
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with asymptomatic stage C1 severe AS (transvalvular velocity 4 m/s or higher), echocardiography is recommended every 6 to 12 months. Echocardiography is indicated earlier than the standard interval if there is a change in symptoms or signs suggestive of worsening cardiac status.
        </p>
        <p>
         Symptom status can be assessed by a careful history in most patients, having the patient compare current exercise capacity to exercise capacity in the preceding year. Development of symptomatic severe AS  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95630" href="/z/d/graphic/95630.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ) (with high gradient or low gradient) is an indication for aortic valve replacement, as discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8154.html" rel="external">
          "Indications for valve replacement for high gradient aortic stenosis in adults"

          "Management and prognosis of low gradient aortic stenosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Symptom status may be challenging to evaluate in patients with severe AS because symptom onset may be insidious or attributed to other conditions, such as aging. If symptom status is unclear, or if the clinical history cannot confirm that the patient has had no diminution in exercise capacity, exercise testing is appropriate. Exercise testing may identify findings such as provoked symptoms, impaired exercise capacity (compared with age and sex-matched standards), and blunted blood pressure response to exercise, which are indications for aortic valve replacement, as discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8154.html" rel="external">
          "Indications for valve replacement for high gradient aortic stenosis in adults", section on 'Indications for valve replacement'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Periodic measurement of serum B-type natriuretic peptide also is reasonable in asymptomatic patients with severe AS [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Asymptomatic patients with severe AS have a high rate of developing symptoms during follow-up (67 percent at five years) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ] and a low rate of survival free from valve replacement (56 to 63 percent at two years and 25 to 33 percent at four to five years in two studies) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. Adverse outcomes are more likely with more severe AS, and a markedly elevated peak aortic jet velocity (&gt;5.0 or 5.5 m/s) is an independent predictor of cardiac mortality [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-7

         The initial steps in risk stratification of the patient with asymptomatic AS are to ensure AS severity is measured accurately and that the patient does not have early symptoms. AS severity should be assessed when the patient is normotensive because hypertension can mask the presence of severe AS. Patients with aortic velocity between 3 and 4 m/s should be evaluated for low-gradient severe AS, as discussed separately. (See

         In patients with calcific AS of a trileaflet or bicuspid valve, it has been hypothesized that medical therapy might slow or prevent disease progression. In particular, there has been an association between AS progression and hypercholesterolemia [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ], as well as an association between AS (usually supravalvular) and familial hypercholesterolemia [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         These observations suggest that the valve lesion in calcific AS or aortic valve sclerosis might be similar to atherosclerosis and that progression may be related to known atherosclerotic risk factors [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16

        </p>
        <p>
         Consistent with this hypothesis are the observations that aortic valve calcification and its progression are increased in patients with a serum low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol &gt;130 mg/dL (&gt;3.36 mmol/L) [

Systolic blood pressure was continuously related to the risk of AS with each 20 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure associated with a 41 percent higher risk of AS (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.38-1.45). This is an association study so it does not establish a cause-effect relationship but suggests that further studies are needed to determine whether treatment of hypertension might reduce the risk of AS.

         Patients with a murmur due to aortic valve stenosis (AS) are considered to be at moderate risk for infective endocarditis (IE) and underlying AS is the predisposing factor for endocarditis in 10 to 18 percent of cases in published series. (See

         The risk is highest in those with a congenital bicuspid valve. The magnitude of risk was evaluated in a series of 2401 patients with congenital heart lesions who were followed prospectively; those with AS developed IE at a rate of 0.27 percent per year [

         Hypertension is common in patients with AS and can attenuate some of the physical findings in AS. As an example, the carotid impulse may be brisk due to decreased vascular compliance, even though valve stenosis is present. In addition, there are experimental data suggesting that hypertension can result in underestimation of stenosis severity using pressure gradients or Doppler velocities, with valve area providing a more accurate measure of disease severity [

         Diuretics generally should be avoided, particularly if the LV chamber is small due to concentric hypertrophy. Any further reduction in LV volumes (eg, with a diuretic) in patients with a small, noncompliant, hypertrophied LV could lead to a fall in cardiac output.

         Historically, there was concern that a fixed obstruction at the valve level might blunt the expected rise in cardiac output as afterload is reduced (eg, with a vasodilator), possibly leading to hypotension and decreased coronary perfusion. However, in patients with asymptomatic AS, the valve leaflets are still flexible and the degree of leaflet opening can increase with increases in transvalvular flow rates even when valve obstruction is severe [

         It can be difficult to determine if the symptoms are due to the valve disease or to coexisting coronary disease. There is no absolute value of AS severity that correlates with the presence of symptoms. However, angina is unlikely to be due to valve obstruction when the valve area is greater than 1.2 cm

         Among patients with both severe AS and significant coronary disease, it is difficult to determine which condition contributes to the anginal symptoms. In this setting, surgical intervention for treatment of both conditions is appropriate [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49
         </a>
         ]. Percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting may be considered if the patient is at high risk for surgery, but symptoms will persist if valve obstruction is the cause.

         The marked increase in cardiac output with exercise can, in patients with AS, lead to increases in the valve gradient and LV systolic pressure. The magnitude of this effect varies with the severity of the AS  (

         AF can occur in patients with AS and, in a previously asymptomatic patient, may precipitate overt HF. Because of the noncompliant LV, there is a relative shift of LV filling to the later part of diastole with a greater dependence upon atrial contraction. (See

         Valve replacement is indicated in patients with severe AS who develop symptomatic HF or with asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction, defined as an LV ejection fraction &lt;50 percent  (

        </p>
        <p>
         Some patients with HF due to primary myocardial disease or coronary disease have or develop concurrent AS. If evaluation confirms that AS is only mild to moderate, standard medical treatment of HF is indicated rather than valve replacement. Such therapy includes optimization of volume status and evidence-based medical therapies with careful dose titration, frequent monitoring, and cardiac resynchronization therapy, if appropriate [
         <a href="#rid39">

        <p>
         It has been hypothesized that relief of outflow obstruction might benefit patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with moderate AS based on the concept of afterload reduction. This hypothesis is being tested in a randomized controlled clinical trial. We recommend patients with moderate AS and HFrEF be treated according to current guidelines or enrolled in a clinical trial [

         A potential diagnostic problem is that some patients with severe AS and LV systolic dysfunction have a low or moderate transvalvular pressure gradient. Distinguishing severe AS from pseudosevere AS in this situation is challenging. The pathophysiology and evaluation of patients with low-gradient AS are discussed separately. (See

         Most adults with a bicuspid aortic valve eventually develop AS, with a smaller number developing severe regurgitation; a bicuspid valve accounts for approximately 50 percent of aortic valve replacements in the United States [

Some patients with a bicuspid valve also have an associated aortopathy with an increased risk of progressive dilatation of the aortic root and/or ascending aorta, and an increased risk of aortic dissection. As a result, monitoring of patients with bicuspid AS includes assessment for and monitoring of aortic dilation, if present  (

         The 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on the management of valvular heart disease did not find convincing evidence that medical therapy reduces the rate of aortic dilation in patients with AS or a bicuspid aortic valve [

          Risk stratification
