Although neonatal Graves disease is usually self-limited, it can be severe, even life-threatening, and can have deleterious effects on neural development. Maternal Graves disease is by far the most common cause of neonatal hyperthyroidism. The presence of active Graves disease in a pregnant woman can lead to either hyper- or hypothyroidism in the fetus and neonate, depending on the balance of the maternal stimulatory antibody and antithyroid drug effect [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, babies who will develop neonatal Graves disease are almost always hyperthyroid at birth or within the first week of life. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7884.html" rel="external">"Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">INCIDENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Graves hyperthyroidism is present in approximately 0.2 percent of pregnant women, and neonatal Graves disease occurs in approximately 1 to 5 percent of infants born to these mothers [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. Thus, neonatal Graves hyperthyroidism is expected to occur in approximately 1:25,000 neonates and affects males and females equally.</p><p>The risk of neonatal Graves disease is directly related to the concentration of maternal stimulatory thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TSHR-Ab) during the third trimester of pregnancy. In most women with Graves disease, the TSHR-Ab titer is not sufficient to cause neonatal Graves disease, which explains why this condition occurs only in 1 to 5 percent of pregnancies in women with Graves hyperthyroidism. (See <a class="local">'Pathogenesis and risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS AND RISK FACTORS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Maternal stimulatory thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) receptor antibodies (TSHR-Ab)</strong> – Neonatal (and fetal) Graves hyperthyroidism is caused by the transplacental passage of TSHR-Ab [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In a systematic review, the lowest level of maternal TSHR-Ab leading to neonatal Graves disease was 3.7 times the upper limit of the assay reference range [<a href="#rid7">7</a>] and maternal TSHR-Ab concentrations less than three times the upper limit of normal are very unlikely to cause neonatal Graves disease [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Nearly all cases (&gt;95 percent) of neonatal hyperthyroidism occur when the maternal TSHR-Ab concentration is more than five times the upper limit of the assay reference range [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>]; however, even with maternal TSHR-Ab concentrations in this range, only approximately 25 percent of infants develop neonatal hyperthyroidism [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7884.html" rel="external">"Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Maternal thyroid disease</strong> – Most neonatal Graves disease occurs in the setting of active Graves hyperthyroidism in the mother. Importantly, the disorder also can occur in infants of women with a history of Graves hyperthyroidism treated with thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine in the past [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. After a woman with Graves disease undergoes one of these treatments, the risk of having an infant affected by neonatal Graves disease falls over time, in conjunction with decreases in TSHR-Ab levels. In one study, the incidence of neonatal Graves disease was 8.8 percent for newborns who were conceived between 6 to 12 months after maternal radioactive iodine treatment, compared with 5.5 percent for those conceived between 12 and 18 months and 3.6 percent for those conceived between 18 and 24 months after maternal radioactive iodine [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The risk of neonatal Graves disease is low five years after radioactive iodine, but some mothers still have persistent TSHR-Ab elevation and will deliver babies with neonatal Graves disease [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. After thyroidectomy, TSHR-Ab concentrations decline steadily, with a half-life of approximately 90 days [<a href="#rid13">13</a>] and, in over one-half of patients, TSHR-Ab titers fall below three times the upper limit of the reference range within one year after thyroidectomy [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. In contrast, after radioactive iodine treatment, TSHR-Ab concentrations rise over the first six months, then begin to decline [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. After radioactive iodine treatment, the estimated median time for TSHR-Ab concentrations to fall below three times the upper limit of the reference range is 22 months. Neonatal Graves disease caused by a stimulatory TSHR-Ab has also been reported in a baby born to a woman with hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto thyroiditis [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4100809716"><span class="h2">Symptoms of hyperthyroidism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism in neonates are those of hyperthyroidism in general plus some features unique to neonates.

In a report of six infants born to mothers with Graves disease treated with antithyroid drugs during pregnancy, symptoms and signs of congenital hyperthyroidism developed between days 10 and 20 of life [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. In a larger study of 96 neonates born to mothers with Graves disease, most had a "subclinical" course with high serum free thyroxine (fT4) levels peaking at five days of age; after 14 days of age, fT4 levels normalized, although serum TSH remained suppressed for up to three months [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p></p><p>Neonatal Graves hyperthyroidism resolves spontaneously in 3 to 12 weeks as the maternal TSHR-Ab is metabolized and disappears from the infant's circulation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neonatal Graves disease is diagnosed in a newborn infant with elevated free thyroxine (fT4) and total triiodothyronine (T3) and low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), typically measured in a baby born to a mother with Graves disease. These values should be interpreted in the context of the infant's age because the normal range for these values is higher during the first few days and weeks of life compared with values in older infants  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72215" href="/z/d/graphic/72215.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5840.html" rel="external">"Thyroid physiology and screening in preterm infants"</a>.)</p><p>Once the diagnosis of neonatal Graves disease is made, treatment should be initiated, as outlined below. (See <a class="local">'Neonatal Graves disease'</a> below.)</p><p>A summary of the pathways to diagnosis is presented in the algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108929" href="/z/d/graphic/108929.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>), which reflects recommendations in a literature-based review [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The steps in diagnosing neonatal Graves disease depend on how the infant comes to medical attention:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1958984712"><span class="h2">Maternal Graves disease during pregnancy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many cases of neonatal Graves disease are suspected based on a history of maternal Graves disease and are recognized during pregnancy.

Fetal or neonatal hyperthyroidism is relatively unlikely if the maternal TSHR-Ab value is less than three times the upper limit of the assay reference range. (See <a class="local">'Pathogenesis and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If the maternal TSHR-Ab is positive, the infant is at risk for developing neonatal Graves disease, particularly if the value is greater than five times the upper limit of the assay reference range. In this case, the infant should be evaluated at birth and monitored during the first few weeks of life, as outlined below.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If a mother with positive TSHR-Ab has active Graves disease and is treated to euthyroidism with an antithyroid drug during pregnancy, the newborn will be either euthyroid or have transient hypothyroidism after birth, then may become euthyroid or hyperthyroid as the antithyroid drug is metabolized and excreted during the first week or life.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If the maternal TSHR-Ab is negative, neonatal Graves disease is unlikely; these cases can be followed clinically, with measurement of thyroid function only if symptoms or signs of hyperthyroidism develop.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Two methods are available for measuring TSHR-Ab. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) is a functional bioassay, measuring production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in cultured thyroid follicular cells, confirming the presence of a stimulating antibody. Alternative TSHR-Ab tests use competitive protein binding methodology, abbreviated as "TR-Ab" or "TBII" (thyrotropin-binding inhibitory immunoglobulin). This test shows that there is an antibody that competes with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) binding to its receptor, but it does not provide information about whether it is a stimulating or blocking antibody. Although TR-Ab assays do not indicate biologic activity, women with Graves disease usually have stimulatory antibodies and the activity of TR-Ab can be inferred from the functional thyroid status of the patient as long as this is not obscured by the use of antithyroid drugs.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fetal ultrasonography</strong> – Serial in utero ultrasonography with measurement of fetal thyroid size may help determine which neonates are likely to manifest neonatal hyperthyroidism [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. In a report of 20 pregnant women with Graves disease treated with an antithyroid drug, the fetal thyroid gland was enlarged in five pregnancies. In these five patients, the maternal antithyroid medication dose was decreased, resulting in a reduction of the fetal thyroid gland to a normal size in three cases, but in the other two cases, the gland remained enlarged. These latter two infants both developed neonatal Graves disease [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Thus, care must be taken because fetal goiter may be a feature of in utero hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Another study using ultrasonography reported that a hyperthyroid fetus was more likely than a hypothyroid fetus to have a goiter with central vascularization, along with other findings including fetal tachycardia, increased fetal movement, and advanced bone maturity [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H164748070"><span class="h3">Fetal thyroid dysfunction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>High maternal serum thyrotropin receptor antibody (TSHR-Ab) concentrations may cause fetal hyperthyroidism, which is characterized by fetal hyperactivity, tachycardia (&gt;160 beats/min) after 22 weeks gestation, advanced bone maturation, and a goiter. If these abnormalities are present, corrective therapy (eg, cautious administration of an antithyroid drug to the mother) may be indicated [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. In addition to the adverse hypermetabolic effects, fetal hyperthyroidism may accelerate fetal central nervous system maturation, causing disorganization of brain development and related intellectual disability. The diagnosis and treatment of fetal hyperthyroidism are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7884.html" rel="external">"Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Treatment", section on 'Fetal or neonatal hyperthyroidism'</a>.)</p><p>Maternal antithyroid drug treatment may also result in fetal goiter and hypothyroidism [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Such cases may be managed by decreasing the maternal antithyroid dose (if this can be done safely) or by intraamniotic injections of thyroid hormone [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7884.html" rel="external">"Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Treatment", section on 'Fetal or neonatal hyperthyroidism'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4167794876"><span class="h3">Cord blood</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For infants born to mothers with known positive TSHR-Ab, we suggest measuring TSHR-Ab, TSH, fT4, and total T3 in cord blood or soon thereafter. Infants with abnormal results require serial laboratory monitoring after birth, whereas those with normal results can be followed clinically. Infants whose TSHR-Ab status is unknown should be undergo serial laboratory monitoring until negative TSHR-Ab is confirmed.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>TSHR-Ab</strong> – Measurement of TSHR-Ab in cord blood helps to predict the risk of neonatal Graves disease in the infant. In a report of 68 pregnant women with a history of Graves disease, 33 had positive TSHR-Ab. Of those with positive TSHR-Ab, 73 percent (27 of 33) had infants with positive TSHR-Ab on cord blood assays and 26 percent (7 of 27) of those infants went on to develop neonatal Graves disease [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. None of the 35 babies born to mothers with negative TSHR-Ab developed Graves disease. Therefore, infants in whom TSHR-Ab is negative in cord blood do not require routine monitoring of thyroid function but, rather, can be followed clinically, with measurement of thyroid function only if symptoms or signs of hyperthyroidism develop.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other tests</strong> – If the mother is known to have positive TSHR-Ab and is or was recently treated with an antithyroid drug, thyroid function tests (TSH, fT4, and total T3) in cord blood will show the effects on balance of the stimulating antibody and antithyroid drug in utero [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. A cord blood TSH &lt;2 mU/L is associated with significant risk of neonatal hyperthyroidism, but normal cord blood TSH does not exclude the later development of neonatal hyperthyroidism after the antithyroid drug is cleared [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2218308609"><span class="h3">Testing of the neonate</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If the mother has a history of Graves disease but the maternal TSHR-Ab status is unknown, the infant's thyroid function should be assessed by measuring TSHR-Ab, serum fT4, total T3, and TSH at birth or soon thereafter. If the mother has a significantly elevated stimulatory TSHR-Ab level and was not treated with an antithyroid drug during pregnancy, hyperthyroidism usually will be present in the affected infant on initial testing. In cases where the mother was treated with an antithyroid drug up to delivery, thyroid function tests on the first day of life may be normal or may even show hypothyroidism. The risk of neonatal hypothyroidism at birth appears to be higher if the mother was treated with a daily dose of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12592" href="/z/d/drug information/12592.html" rel="external">methimazole</a> greater than 10 mg/day or of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12745" href="/z/d/drug information/12745.html" rel="external">propylthiouracil</a> greater than 150 mg/day [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p>Thyroid function tests should be repeated at three to five days of life and again at 10 to 14 days of life in infants whose TSHR-Ab status is positive or unknown.

This is thought to be secondary to prenatal exposure of the hypothalamus and pituitary to high serum thyroid hormone concentrations during a critical stage of development. Although the neonatal Graves disease usually is transient, there is evidence that insufficient antithyroid drug treatment during pregnancy increases the risk of permanent central hypothyroidism, drawing attention to the importance of careful monitoring of maternal thyroid function and appropriate antithyroid drug dosing during pregnancy [<a href="#rid45">45</a>].
