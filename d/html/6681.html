In most uncomplicated pregnancies, platelet counts remain within the normal range (150,000 to 450,000/microL). Platelet counts are slightly lower in twin compared with singleton pregnancies [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The normal changes in platelet counts during pregnancy were illustrated in a series of 7351 individuals at the Oklahoma University Medical Center for whom data were available on platelet counts during pregnancy and at delivery from 2011 to 2014 [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. This represented approximately one-half of the deliveries at this center. Only one pregnancy from each person was included. Findings were as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mean platelet counts in uncomplicated singleton pregnancies decreased progressively throughout pregnancy and increased after delivery. Platelet counts in the first trimester were already significantly lower than platelet counts of nonpregnant people, which came from data in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Nonpregnant – 273,000/microL</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>First trimester – 251,000/microL</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Second trimester – 230,000/microL</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Third trimester – 225,000/microL</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Delivery – 217,000/microL</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Postpartum (approximately seven weeks) – 264,000/microL</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Mean platelet counts in uncomplicated twin pregnancies were lower, with a similar pattern (first, second, third trimester and delivery: 240,000, 221,000, 217,000, and 202,000/microL, respectively); however, there were fewer than 100 twin pregnancies. These findings are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118497" href="/d/graphic/118497.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>At delivery, the distribution of platelet counts in uncomplicated singleton pregnancies was as follows:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>≥150,000/microL – 4115 (90 percent)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>125,000 to 149,000 – 293 (6.4 percent)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>100,000 to 124,000 – 126 (2.7 percent)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>80,000 to 99,000 – 27 (0.6 percent)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>60,000 to 79,000 – 4 (0.1 percent)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>&lt;60,000 – 0</p><p></p><p>These data suggest that mild decreases in platelet count occur during all uncomplicated pregnancies. The mechanism may involve pooling of platelets in the splenic and placental circulation (see <a class="local">'Gestational thrombocytopenia (GT)'</a> below). Platelet counts &lt;100,000/microL occur in &lt;1 percent of uncomplicated pregnancies [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Therefore:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Platelet counts &lt;100,000/microL should be investigated for an etiology other than gestational thrombocytopenia (GT; ie, platelet counts &lt;100,000/microL should not be attributed to GT unless alternative etiologies have been excluded).

Examples of other factors that would suggest the need for additional evaluation include thrombocytopenia prior to pregnancy or other diagnoses such as preeclampsia [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2945717795"><span class="h1">LIST OF CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The causes of thrombocytopenia during pregnancy vary with the duration of gestation, from early in the first trimester through delivery, the severity of thrombocytopenia, and the patient's clinical status [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. </p><p>GT and other causes of thrombocytopenia in pregnant patients are discussed in detail on the following sections, and selected causes other than GT are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118572" href="/d/graphic/118572.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2143458424"><span class="h2">Gestational thrombocytopenia (GT)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Gestational thrombocytopenia (GT), also called incidental thrombocytopenia of pregnancy, is a self-limited condition that requires no additional evaluation or treatment [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>]. GT accounts for the vast majority of cases of thrombocytopenia discovered during pregnancy, and almost all cases of thrombocytopenia in uncomplicated pregnancies. GT may occur during the first trimester, but it becomes more common as gestation progresses, with the highest frequency at the time of delivery, when the frequency is 5 to 10 percent [<a href="#rid1">1,3,7,8</a>].</p><p>GT is typically characterized by the following [<a href="#rid1">1,9</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Most common at delivery, but can occur at any time during pregnancy.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mild thrombocytopenia.

The diagnosis of GT is accepted if the person has mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count 100,000 to 150,000/microL), especially during late pregnancy and at delivery, with no other associated findings on CBC or physical examination. In our experience, platelet counts below 100,000/microL are extremely unlikely to be due to GT [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The likelihood of GT decreases dramatically with lower platelet counts, as illustrated in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118571" href="/d/graphic/118571.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p>GT resolves postpartum, but in some instances, the return to a normal platelet count requires more than six weeks. A normal prepregnancy platelet count is helpful but not always available. A history of mild thrombocytopenia during a previous pregnancy supports the diagnosis of GT because the risk of recurrent GT is 14-fold greater among individuals who have had previous GT than among those who have not had previous GT [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>GT requires no treatment and no change of normal prenatal care and management of delivery. No diagnostic testing is necessary because a platelet count &gt;100,000/microL causes no risk for the mother or the fetus.</p><p>The mechanism(s) of GT has not been documented, but it may be assumed to be a physiologic adaptation of pregnancy related to the increased plasma volume, pooling or consumption of platelets in the placenta, or other physiologic changes that occur in uncomplicated pregnancies [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The placenta has many vascular characteristics in common with the spleen, a major site of physiologic platelet sequestration. An analysis of placental histology following 40 scheduled cesarean deliveries found that platelets were present in many areas in the perivillous fibrinoid  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef121676" href="/d/graphic/121676.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>), supporting the concept that platelet sequestration and consumption in the placenta plays a role in GT [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3586240276"><span class="h2">Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) occurs in approximately 1 to 3 in 10,000 pregnancies; platelet counts &lt;50,000/microL only affect a subset of these [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. This is approximately 10-fold greater than the incidence of ITP in the general population, estimated to be 3 in 100,000 adults [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The increased frequency of ITP diagnosed during pregnancy may reflect more frequent CBC testing during pregnancy, the increased incidence of autoimmune disorders in females, and possibly decreased platelet counts due to the GT [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6676.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>ITP may occur during any trimester, or the diagnosis may be known prior to the pregnancy. The severity of thrombocytopenia is variable, and the platelet count will decrease during the pregnancy, as it does in all pregnancies as part of normal physiology. (See <a class="local">'Definition and incidence'</a> above.)</p><p>For individuals with a prior history of ITP, more severe thrombocytopenia during pregnancy has been reported and attributed to the greater severity of the ITP [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. However platelet counts of individuals with ITP decrease at the same rate as in uncomplicated pregnancies, and their platelet counts are 15 to 20 percent lower at delivery, similar to uncomplicated pregnancies [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Therefore, a decreased platelet count during pregnancy may not be related to greater severity of the ITP.</p><p>As in nonpregnant individuals, the risk of bleeding is greater with platelet counts &lt;20,000 to 30,000/microL, although there is no absolute platelet count threshold above which bleeding does not occur. This was illustrated in a long-term study involving 119 pregnancies in 92 individuals over the course of 11 years [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Most pregnancies were uneventful, but there was moderate bleeding in 21 patients (18 percent; described as epistaxis or mucous membrane bleeding) and severe bleeding in 4 patients (3 percent; described as hematuria or gastrointestinal). Most deliveries were vaginal, and one-fourth of the infants had thrombocytopenia. (See <a class="local">'Neonatal testing'</a> below.)</p><p>A 2023 report described the course of 131 pregnant patients with ITP compared with 131 nonpregnant females with ITP who were matched by history of splenectomy, ITP status, and duration of disease and found no increased risk of bleeding in the pregnant versus the nonpregnant group [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of ITP is based only on the exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia. Therefore, in a pregnant patient with mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count 100,000 to 150,000/microL), GT and ITP cannot be distinguished. The diagnosis of GT is much more likely than ITP in such patients because the frequency of GT is 100-fold greater than the frequency of ITP during pregnancy.

Causes of DIC in pregnancy include placental abruption, retained dead fetus, amniotic fluid embolism, septic abortion, and others. Patients may have severe hemorrhage and/or diffuse oozing.

As in nonpregnant patients, the clinical assessment is vital to the diagnosis, because results of ADAMTS13 activity testing often are not immediately available. In contrast to severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, moderately reduced ADAMTS13 activity (eg, activity between 10 and 50 percent) can be seen in many systemic disorders and is not specific for (or indicative of) TTP.

The only other common cause to consider may be ITP; however, ITP with mild thrombocytopenia requires no treatment and therefore the management is observation, as for GT.</p><p>Platelet counts &lt;100,000/microL should be investigated for an etiology other than GT. Other, uncommon causes of isolated thrombocytopenia include conditions that may have preceded the pregnancy or developed during the pregnancy but remained clinically silent, such as SLE, inherited thrombocytopenia, bone marrow disorders such as myelodysplasia, HIV, liver disease, hypersplenism, nutrient deficiencies (eg, vitamin B12, folate, copper), and type 2 von Willebrand disease (VWD). These conditions account for &lt;1 percent of cases. (See <a class="local">'Other causes of thrombocytopenia'</a> above.)</p><p>Evaluation for these conditions includes a personal and family history for bleeding disorders; review of the complete blood count (CBC) for other cytopenias and morphologic abnormalities in white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.</p><p>Pseudothrombocytopenia due to in vitro platelet clumping can be misinterpreted as true thrombocytopenia. Pseudothrombocytopenia should be excluded by reviewing the blood smear and, if necessary, repeating the platelet count using a tube containing citrate or heparin rather than EDTA as the anticoagulant. This and other testing for causes of thrombocytopenia not directly related to pregnancy are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6680.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to thrombocytopenia in adults"</a>.)</p><p>HIV testing is appropriate for all patients if not done already.

Both of these conditions are diagnosed by excluding other causes of thrombocytopenia; there are no laboratory tests for either condition. GT can present at any time during pregnancy, but because CBCs are more likely to be performed later in the pregnancy, GT is more often recognized near term or at delivery. GT resolves after delivery, but it may require more than six weeks. ITP is often present before, during, and after the pregnancy, and the degree of thrombocytopenia is variable. If the platelet count drops below 100,000/microL, then ITP becomes the more likely diagnosis. If the history and/or examination suggest a cause other than GT or ITP, appropriate testing should be obtained. (See <a class="local">'List of causes'</a> above.)</p><p>After delivery, GT will resolve and ITP typically will persist, allowing a presumptive diagnosis to be made in most cases. The value of this is that patients with GT do not require any additional monitoring until or unless they become pregnant again. GT typically recurs with subsequent pregnancies, so it should be anticipated. If thrombocytopenia persists after pregnancy (eg, at the six-week follow-up), then ITP becomes the likely diagnosis. A less common condition such as an inherited platelet disorder may also be responsible. The evaluation, differential diagnosis, and management of ITP are discussed in detail separately.

If we are confident in the diagnosis of GT (if previous pregnancies were associated with maternal thrombocytopenia that resolved after delivery), then we do not routinely obtain a neonatal platelet count. If the diagnosis of GT versus ITP is unclear, it may be reasonable to obtain a neonatal platelet count.</p><p>The overall risk of thrombocytopenia in infants born to patients with ITP has been estimated to be in the range of 10 to 15 percent; severe thrombocytopenia is possible but much less common. In the series of 119 pregnancies associated with maternal ITP, 31 of 109 infants (28 percent) had platelet counts &lt;150,000/microL [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Of these, six (6 percent) had counts &lt;20,000/microL, five had counts between 20,000 and 50,000, and the remainder had counts &gt;50,000/microL. One infant had an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) that was not clearly due to thrombocytopenia; the infant was born at 29 weeks of a twin gestation, and the platelet count nadir was 135,000/microL on the day after delivery. There were two fetal deaths, one unrelated to thrombocytopenia and one a stillbirth at 27 weeks associated with extensive fetal hemorrhage and severe maternal thrombocytopenia. Smaller series have found similar rates of thrombocytopenia and similar platelet count distributions [<a href="#rid61">61-69</a>].</p><p>There does not appear to be a strong correlation between maternal platelet count and neonatal platelet count in ITP [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Risk factors for neonatal thrombocytopenia include a previous history of neonatal thrombocytopenia, prior splenectomy, severe thrombocytopenia (&lt;50,000/microL) at some point during the pregnancy, and possibly maternal platelet count &lt;100,000/microL at the time of delivery [<a href="#rid14">14,61,64,65,70,71</a>]. There is no evidence that ITP therapy for the mother raises the fetal platelet count.

Platelet count testing by scalp blood sampling or cordocentesis is not recommended because these procedures are associated with adverse events and have not been demonstrated to improve outcomes. Percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling carries an increased risk of fetal hemorrhage that is considered to be greater than the risk of severe neonatal ICH from thrombocytopenia (approximately 2 versus 1 percent) [<a href="#rid6">6,14,35,61,72</a>]. Fetal scalp blood sampling has been abandoned because it is technically difficult and frequently results in spuriously low platelet counts [<a href="#rid6">6,35,38,61</a>].</p><p>Based on our experience, if the neonate's platelet count is &lt;150,000/microL, a repeat platelet count the next day is appropriate to be confident that the platelet count is stable or increasing. The neonatal platelet count may decrease up to several days after birth (typical nadir at day 2 to 5 postpartum) [<a href="#rid63">63</a>]. The mechanism is thought to involve passage of maternal antiplatelet antibodies to the fetal circulation, with gradual acquisition of infant splenic function within the first few days after birth leading to destruction of antibody-sensitized platelets.

Mild thrombocytopenia (100,000 to 149,000/microL) is usually due to gestational thrombocytopenia (GT) and does not require further evaluation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118571" href="/d/graphic/118571.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Definition and incidence'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>GT</strong> – GT is a physiologic condition that requires no evaluation or treatment. It is the most common cause of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy and is the presumptive diagnosis with a platelet count of 100,000 to 149,000/microL, provided there are no other abnormal findings. It is a diagnosis of exclusion. GT affects 5 to 10 percent of pregnancies; only 1 percent of these have a platelet count &lt;100,000/microL  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118571" href="/d/graphic/118571.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).
