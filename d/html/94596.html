         A medication error is any mistake in the intended use of a medication (eg, wrong medication, wrong dose, or infusion of the wrong medication into the wrong place). The perioperative period is a high-risk setting for such errors [
         <a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/prevention-of-perioperative-medication-errors/abstract/1-6">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic focuses on prevention of medication errors in the perioperative setting. Recommendations to prevent such errors and other adverse medication events in other areas of the hospital (eg, inpatient wards, intensive care units, emergency department) and after hospital discharge are discussed in a separate topic.

         The intraoperative setting is unique because a single anesthesia clinician performs all of these tasks [

          9

          Types of errors
         </strong>
         – In a prospective observational study of 3,671 intraoperative medication administrations, the most common types of intravenous (IV) medication errors were incorrect dosing, medication labeling error, and failure to act [
         <a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/prevention-of-perioperative-medication-errors/abstract/2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Failure to act is an error of omission, in that the intended medication is not administered (eg, failure to administer perioperative antibiotics, or re-dose an antibiotic when indicated) [
         <a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/prevention-of-perioperative-medication-errors/abstract/10,11">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. Incorrect dose was the most frequent medication error associated with significant harm resulting in a lawsuit in the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Closed Claims Project database, while a syringe or ampule swap was the second-most common error [
         <a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/prevention-of-perioperative-medication-errors/abstract/12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Incorrect dose has also been the most frequently reported error type in pediatric patients, while incorrect medication, including syringe swap, was the second-most common error [
         <a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/prevention-of-perioperative-medication-errors/abstract/13-15">
          13-15
         </a>
         ]. Even among experienced anesthesiology personnel, medication calculation errors are common [
         <a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/prevention-of-perioperative-medication-errors/abstract/16">
          16
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Another example is the challenges inherent in mixing medications into a single syringe (eg, pharmaceutical incompatibilities or different pharmacokinetic behavior of the mixed agents [
         <a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/prevention-of-perioperative-medication-errors/abstract/17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Clinicians should be aware of potential physical incompatibilities of the various medications they use. For example,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="105866" href="/z/d/drug information/105866.html" rel="external">
          sugammadex

          18,19
         </a>
         ]. Thus, intravenous (IV) lines must be adequately flushed between administration of bolus doses of an agent, and a separate IV line is necessary for continuous infusion of medications that are incompatible with other agents.

          Risk factors
         </strong>
         – Absence of a medication label or improper medication labeling is the most frequently cited risk for perioperative medication error [

          2,20

          2,13

          Incidence

          2,10

         Infusion of a medication or gas using the wrong route can also occur, and these errors are particularly likely to cause patient harm (see
         <a class="local">
          'Errors resulting in adverse medication events'
         </a>
         below). Wrong route errors occur because catheters are placed in various body sites (eg, IV, intrathecal, intra-arterial, gastrointestinal), and the Luer connection is ubiquitous. It is possible to accidentally administer IV medications or solutions into the intrathecal space with potentially devastating consequences, or vice versa [

         ]. In one review of neuraxial versus intravenous misconnection covering a 20-year period, 133 case studies and 42 unique drugs were found, with the most commonly reported events involved administration of an epidural medication via an intravenous catheter (29.2 percent of events) or administration of an intravenous medication via an epidural catheter (27.7 percent) [

Patient deaths were reported due to the erroneous administration of chemotherapies (n=16), muscle relaxants (n=4), local anesthetics (n=4), opioids (n=1), and antifibrinolytics (n=1). Severe outcomes, including paraplegia, paraparesis, spinal cord injury, and seizures were reported with the following medications:

         An adverse medication event is patient harm or injury due to a clinical intervention related to a specific medication, regardless of whether any errors in selection or processing of the medication occurred. An example of an adverse medication event due to error is a patient with a known medication allergy who receives that medication and develops a reaction. An example of an adverse medication event with no error is a patient with no known allergies who receives a new medication and develops a first-time allergic reaction.

         A medication error may or may not involve an adverse event  (

         ). For example, forgetting to administer a perioperative antibiotic may or may not lead to a postoperative patient infection. Cases where the error does not lead to patient harm are termed "near-misses" or errors with a

          Voluntary self-reporting
         </strong>
         – Self-reporting systems rely on those involved in an event to initiate an event report that provides detailed information. Such self-reporting may be confidential (identity of the reporter is known but legal protection is provided) or anonymous (reporter cannot be identified and follow-up may be more difficult).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Numerous national anesthesia-incident reporting systems exist, including ones in the United States, Australia/New Zealand, Switzerland, and Germany, and are being instituted in many more countries.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Although valuable to highlight rare but lethal or high-harm events, self-reporting is subject to underreporting and recall bias. Compared with chart review and direct observation, self-reporting only captures a fraction of events and may not reliably identify serious events [
         <a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/prevention-of-perioperative-medication-errors/abstract/2,37,38">
          2,37,38
         </a>
         ]. Also, self-reporting provides the numerator (number of errors occurring), but not the denominator (number of events vulnerable to such an error), and a medication error rate cannot be determined.

          Facilitated self-reporting

         – Facilitated self-reporting systems prompt providers to report safety events after every anesthetic, even if there were no incidents [

          13,39

         ]. These reports provide a numerator for identified errors, as well as a denominator (number of anesthetics included in the facilitated reporting system), thereby allowing calculation of the error rate per anesthetic. Limitations include inability to capture errors that were not recognized by the provider (eg, omission of antibiotic redosing, failure to appreciate and treat hypotension).

         An important preoperative step to avoid medication errors is medication reconciliation (verification of which medications are prescribed and whether the patient is taking each of these appropriately) [
         <a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/prevention-of-perioperative-medication-errors/abstract/43">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although not limited to operating room settings, a 2021 systematic review noted that medication reconciliation was the most common type of intervention studied in hospitals, resulting in likely reductions in adverse drug events (odds ratio [OR] 0.38, 95% CI 0.18-0.80; three studies, 1336 participants), and possible reductions in medication errors (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.17-1.74; three studies, 379 participants) compared with no medication reconciliation [
         <a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/prevention-of-perioperative-medication-errors/abstract/44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. In particular, multimodal medication reconciliation interventions increased discrepancy resolutions compared with usual care (relative risk [RR] 2.14, 95% CI 1.81-2.53; one study, 487 participants).
        </p>
        <p>
         Notably, accurate medication reconciliation can be difficult and time consuming (45 to 90 minutes) [
         <a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/prevention-of-perioperative-medication-errors/abstract/45,46">
          45,46
         </a>
         ]. One study noted that 25 percent of high-risk inpatients had at least one medication error associated with poor medication reconciliation during hospital admission. The most common errors were omissions of chronically administered medications [
         <a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/prevention-of-perioperative-medication-errors/abstract/47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. Even when a medication list is accurate, outpatient medications are typically replaced by inpatient medications, a process that may generate errors. Another study noted failure to continue an appropriate home medication in 50 percent of inpatients and administration of an incorrect dose in 20 percent [
         <a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/prevention-of-perioperative-medication-errors/abstract/48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. In a study of patients undergoing spinal surgery, 73 medication reconciliation errors were found in 149 patients, resulting in 36 percent of these patients not receiving correct doses of at least one medication while in the hospital [
         <a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/prevention-of-perioperative-medication-errors/abstract/49">
          49
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In the perioperative setting, professional society guidelines for managing preoperative administration of certain medications may change or be updated (eg, anticoagulants, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, beta blockers) (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4814.html" rel="external">
          "Perioperative medication management"
         </a>
         ). Clinician responsibility for perioperative medication reconciliation may shift among the patient's primary care doctor, surgeon, and preoperative anesthesia care team members, which can be confusing if communication regarding medications is not consistent. For this reason, patients should receive clear written instructions if medications are to be withheld preoperatively or if any substitutions are made. Even with such instructions, patient-related errors are not uncommon (eg, incorrect times for discontinuation of a medication). For example, in one study, failure to discontinue anticoagulants resulted in case cancellation in 19 percent of patients receiving those agents [
         <a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/prevention-of-perioperative-medication-errors/abstract/49">
          49
         </a>
         ]. Thus, a second medication reconciliation is necessary in the immediate preoperative period [

         Medication use in the perioperative setting presents particular patient safety challenges because it usually bypasses standard safety checks, such as computerized physician order entry (CPOE) with clinical decision support, pharmacy approval of medications, and redundant nursing checks prior to medication administration (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16300.html" rel="external">
          "Prevention of adverse drug events in hospitals"
         </a>
         ). As noted above, the operating room (OR) is the only setting within the hospital where a single clinician is responsible for medication selection, dispensing, preparing/diluting, administering, documenting, and monitoring after a medication is given [
         <a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/prevention-of-perioperative-medication-errors/abstract/9">

         <a class="local">
          'Perioperative processes for medication use'
         </a>
         above). The absence of electronic or multiple-provider double checks during the complex perioperative medication use process may contribute to errors. Also, rapid changes in intraoperative patient condition often create a need for unanticipated administration of several medications in a brief period of time. For these reasons, medication errors are the most frequently cited critical incidents in anesthetic care [

          52-56
         </a>
         ]. These are based on standardization, as well as elimination of look-alike medication vials and labels, pharmacy solutions, technology solutions, and improvements in institutional culture. These strategies are supported by expert opinion, although there are few data regarding interventions to prevent anesthesia-related medication errors [

         There have been only two randomized controlled trials to test potential interventions. In the first, Merry and his colleagues showed that their multifaceted medication safety system, which involves medication barcode scanning, computerized visual and auditory read-back of medication names, and a standardized medication cart organization, reduced medication error rates from 11 to 9 percent of medication administrations [

          10

         ]. The second randomized controlled study was conducted to test the results of this first study in a simulation setting. In the simulation setting, the authors found a greater reduction of error rates (from 11 to 6 percent) using their medication safety system than in the real-world setting (11 to 9 percent) [

         The American Society for Testing and Material (ASTM) has created a standard for color-coding user-applied medication labels for different classes of medications in the OR (ASTM D4774-06 Standard Specification for User Applied Drug Labels in Anesthesiology) [

         ]. Labels are blue for opioids, fluorescent red for neuromuscular blockers, yellow for induction agents, orange for tranquilizers, violet for vasopressors, and green for anticholinergics. Used as a supplemental tool for labeling, rather than as a substitute for clear lettering, this tool is particularly useful to prevent accidental swaps between medication classes [

          69

         For medical gas cylinders, there is an international color-coding system that differs from colors used in the United States. For example, the international standard color is white for an oxygen tank (green in the United States) and black and white for an air tank (yellow in the United States). The international color for suction tubing is yellow (white in the United States) [

         A standardized process should exist for confirming medications and allergies during intraoperative and postoperative handoffs. A poor handoff process coupled with a documentation error can be particularly dangerous. For example, if a medication was not documented in the AIMS and not reviewed during the handoff, it may be re-administered after the handoff, resulting in an overdose. All medications should be reviewed during intraoperative care handoffs between anesthesia clinicians, and postoperative handoffs in the post-anesthesia care recovery unit or intensive care unit.

         CPOE systems are common on hospital wards and outpatient clinics where providers receive helpful information and/or alerts electronically based on each medication order they write. More errors are prevented when clinical decision support tools are fully implemented and meaningfully used (without bypassing critical functionality), typically after adequate training, support, and familiarity over time [

        <p>
         However, CPOE is not typically used in OR settings due to unique medication administration processes and rapid changes in patient condition. This absence of clinical decision support and alerts for drug-drug interactions or allergies may lead to higher frequency and severity of medication errors. Development of clinical decision support systems that integrate intraoperative medication administration, real-time vital signs, and the patient's electronic medical record would support both workflow efficiency and decision-making in real time for anesthesia providers [

While certain medication vials may be designated as multiuse or multidose by the manufacturer, using a vial of medication multiple times can lead to problems, even if used in the same patient or on the same day. Hazards associated with this practice include failing to properly disinfect rubber stoppers, failing to ensure use of new needles and syringes for every step, injecting air into the vial before removal of the medication, reinjecting small amounts of medication back into the vial during removal of additional medication, storing medications at improper temperatures, and using vials after their expiration date [

         The traditional view is that quality problems and errors are failings on the part of individual providers, reflecting inadequate knowledge or skill levels. A systems approach assumes that most errors reflect predictable human failings in the context of poorly-designed systems, such as expected lapses in human vigilance during long work hours or predictable mistakes during cognitively complex situations [

          Establishing a just culture

         – A "just culture" of safety encourages reporting of medication errors in order to identify and correct vulnerabilities within the institution.

This encourages self-reporting of medication errors, as well as near-misses and potential vulnerabilities. Team discussions of lessons learned improves medication safety [

         During the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 or nCoV) pandemic, regional surges in critically ill patients has resulted in shortages of some medications needed for intubation and mechanical ventilation of COVID-19 patients in perioperative and intensive care settings in some institutions. In these institutions, decisions whether to discard unused and unopened medications that might be contaminated balance the need to avoid waste of medications in critically short supply. The goal is to avoid the need for use of less familiar alternative medications that may not be as effective or may have more adverse side effects, thereby introducing additional patient safety risks. Strategies to minimize waste of intraoperative medications that are in short supply include:

         Use of medications in the perioperative setting is unique because a single anesthesiologist or other member of the anesthesia care team selects, dispenses, prepares, administers, documents, and subsequently monitors medication effects. Typically, there is no point at which a mandated double-check occurs for either the selected vial or syringe containing the medication or for the administered dose. (See

         The most common types of perioperative intravenous (IV) medication errors involve wrong dose, labeling errors, and failure to act errors. Wrong dose and inadvertent syringe or vial swaps are the most likely errors to lead to significant patient harm. Wrong route errors with infusion of the wrong medication or gas into the wrong place can also occur. Observational studies demonstrate error rates between 5 to 11 percent of all medications administered. (See
