         Hearing loss in infancy can lead to delayed language development, difficulties with behavior and psychosocial interactions, and poor academic achievement. Early detection of hearing loss facilitates early intervention, which is associated with improved language, cognitive, behavioral, and academic outcomes.

         Screening for hearing loss in the newborn will be reviewed here. The etiology, evaluation, and management of hearing impairment in children are discussed separately. (See

          Conductive loss
         </strong>
         is caused by abnormalities of the outer or middle ear, which limits the amount of external sound that gains access to the inner ear (cochlea and vestibular apparatus). Cochlear function remains normal because the inner ear develops separately from the external and middle ears. Conductive hearing loss may be either transient (middle ear fluid) or permanent (anatomical). Transient conductive hearing loss is a frequent cause of a false-positive neonatal screen [

          Sensorineural hearing loss
         </strong>
         (SNHL) results from malfunction of inner ear structures, including the outer and inner hair cells of the cochlea and the eighth cranial nerve components of the auditory neural pathway.

         <strong>
          Auditory neuropathy
         </strong>
         (AN) is a hearing disorder that affects the neural processing of auditory stimuli and may involve the eighth cranial nerve, auditory brain stem, or cerebral cortex. Sound enters the inner ear (cochlea and outer hair cells) normally, but the transmission of signals from the inner hair cells of the cochlea to the auditory nerve/pathway is either absent or severely distorted. Screening for hearing loss using otoacoustic emissions will not detect patients with AN, as their outer hair cells function normally. (See

          Mixed hearing loss

         The extent of hearing loss is defined by measuring the hearing threshold in decibels (dB) at various frequencies. Normal hearing has a threshold of -10 to 15 dB.

In the United States, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a rate of permanent hearing loss of 1.7 per 1000 infants screened for hearing loss, with an overall screening rate of 98.4 percent for all newborns, excluding infant deaths and parental refusal [

         The prevalence of moderate, severe, and profound bilateral permanent hearing loss is estimated at 1 in 900 to 2500 newborns [

         Infants cared for in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which includes neonatal level II, III, and IV care units, are at greater risk of hearing loss compared with healthy term infants [

In particular, sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and auditory neuropathy (AN) are much more common with reported rates of 16.7 and 5.6 per 1000 infants, respectively among infants cared for in a NICU compared with an estimated incidence of 0.06 per 1000 infants among a healthy newborn population [

         Screening newborns for hearing loss leads to earlier detection and intervention in patients with congenital hearing impairment. Early intervention can significantly improve language acquisition and educational achievement in affected patients [

         The available evidence demonstrates that screening newborns detects hearing loss at an earlier age than relying solely on identifying clinical signs of hearing loss [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20-25
         </a>
         ]. This is because caregivers and clinicians are often not able to detect hearing loss in infants until there are signs of delayed speech and language development.
        </p>
        <p>
         This point was best illustrated by a clinical trial carried out in the 1990s at four hospitals in England [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20,25
         </a>
         ]. Over a three-year period, the hospitals alternated between six-month periods of screening all newborns and periods of no screening. Among the 25,609 infants born during screening periods, 27 were found to have bilateral permanent hearing loss (incidence 105 per 100,000 live born infants) and among the 28,172 infants born during periods without screening, 26 were found to have bilateral permanent hearing loss (incidence 92 per 100,000 live born infants). Compared with infants with hearing loss who were born during periods without screening, those born during screening periods were more likely to have the hearing loss confirmed before age 10 months (59 versus 38 percent) and to start intervention before age 10 months (56 versus 27 percent; odds ratio 2.4, 95% CI 1.0-6.0).

          What the test measures
         </strong>
         – AABR measures the summation of action potentials from the eighth cranial nerve (cochlear nerve) to the inferior colliculus of the midbrain in response to a click stimulus. It can detect both sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and auditory neuropathy (AN). Other names for this test include the screening ABR (SABR), and screening brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER). Approximately 4 percent of infants screened with AABR are referred for further audiologic evaluation, which uses a diagnostic ABR including an evaluation by an audiologist skilled in assessing infants and young children [

         <strong>
          Technique
         </strong>
         – The AABR utilizes click or chirp stimuli presented at 35 dB. Three surface electrodes placed on the forehead, nape, and mastoid or shoulder detect waveform recordings generated by the ABR to the stimuli. In the screening AABR, the morphology and latency of the waveforms are compared with normal neonatal templates, and a pass or fail reading is generated, and the examiner does not need to interpret the waveforms if visibly accessible. AABR screening typically requires 4 to 15 minutes for testing, although newer AABR screening equipment can complete testing in an infant in 4 to 8 minutes in ideal conditions.

          AABR versus ABR
         </strong>
         – It is important to note that an automated ABR (AABR) is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         the same as a diagnostic ABR. AABR is a screening tool with an automated pass/fail response. By contrast, diagnostic ABR provides quantitative data (eg, waveforms) that must be interpreted by a trained audiologist, thereby determining the degree and the site of the hearing loss. As an example, delayed or absent waves suggest a neurologic or cochlear deficit. Many neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) now complete the diagnostic ABR prior to discharge for infants who fail the screening AABR. Additional detail regarding ABR are provided separately. (See

          What the test measures
         </strong>
         – OAE testing measures the presence or absence of sound waves (ie, OAEs) generated by the cochlear outer hair cells of the inner ear in response to sound stimuli. A microphone at the external ear canal detects these low-intensity OAEs. Since OAE evaluates hearing from the middle ear to the outer hair cells of the inner ear, it is used to screen for SNHL but cannot detect AN.

         <strong>
          Technique
         </strong>
         – The apparatus for OAE screening consists of a miniature microphone placed into the infant's outer ear canal. The microphone produces a stimulus (clicks or tones) and detects sound waves as they arise from the cochlea. The device also measures the signal-to-noise ratio to ensure accuracy. OAE screening generally requires approximately one to two minutes per ear in ideal testing conditions.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         OAEs are classified by the stimuli used to produce the cochlear basal membrane vibrations. The tests most commonly used for clinical purposes are transient OAEs (TOAEs) and distortion product OAEs (DPOAEs).

         <strong>
          Test time
         </strong>
         – OAE tends to require less patient preparation time and a shorter test time than AABR [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. AABR may also present time constraints because infants need to be asleep or quiet awake when tested. In contrast, OAE can be performed when the infant is awake, feeding, or sucking on a pacifier [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. Response time, however, is much quicker for OAE if the infant is sleeping or quiet awake.

         <strong>
          Interference
         </strong>
         – OAE is sensitive to background noise, and physiological noise generated by the infant [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. It may be difficult to obtain OAE responses at low frequencies due to physiological noise, myogenic noise, or poor acoustics. This noise interference is greater when the recorded frequency is below 1500 Hertz (Hz). Thus, screening with OAE can be improved by programming protocol parameters to include select high frequencies, which are more important for understanding speech [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30-32
         </a>
         ]. These protocol changes should be implemented by an audiologist with a specialized skill set in pediatrics. OAE, unlike AABR, is not subject to muscle artifact [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29,33
         </a>
         ]. AABR can also be complicated by electrical artifacts [

         <strong>
          False-positive results
         </strong>
         – During the first three days of life, there is an increased false-positive rate with OAE compared with AABR, most commonly due to transient conductive hearing loss caused by vernix occluding the external ear canal or middle ear fluid (due to amniotic fluid). [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33-36
         </a>
         ]. In several reports, 19 to 25 percent of newborns with abnormal OAE screening during the first three days after birth had subsequent normal hearing in follow-up testing [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35-38
         </a>
         ]. In one study, cleaning of vernix increased the pass rates from 59 to 69 percent [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ].

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         It is important to recognize that the pass threshold is higher for OAE than for AABR, resulting in a higher fail rate. Both methods will miss minimal and mild hearing loss.

          Tympanic membrane mobility
         </strong>
         – OAE requires normal middle ear function. Thus, decreased tympanic membrane mobility can reduce screening pass rates with this technique [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. The magnitude of this problem was illustrated in a series of 200 infants, in which the pass rate in the 23 percent of infants with decreased tympanic membrane mobility was lower with OAE than AABR (33 versus 95 percent, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36

          Auditory neuropathy
         </strong>
         – Infants at risk for developing AN include those with severe hyperbilirubinemia, prematurity, perinatal asphyxia, craniofacial abnormalities, and others who are admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). AABR will detect the hearing loss in infants with AN, but OAE will not. Therefore screening for AN with OAE may lead to a false-negative result [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29,39
         </a>
         ]. Thus, AABR should always be used to screen hearing in infants who are at risk for AN (eg, infants with hypoxia, prematurity, hyperbilirubinemia, neurologic impairment and all infants who require ≥5 days of NICU care).

         <strong>
          Relative costs
         </strong>
         – Although the actual screening cost is lower for OAE compared with AABR, the overall cost of screening and audiologic evaluation may be lower with AABR because of the lower referral rate for diagnostic audiologic assessment, although this varies by location. One study evaluated screening programs initiated at two sites, one using automated ABR administered by neonatal nurses and the other using OAE performed by master's level audiologists [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. Less time was needed for testing with OAE than with AABR (5 versus 13 minutes), but the rate of referral for further testing was higher with OAE (15 versus 4 percent). Although the costs before discharge were similar for the two programs, the increased referral rate with OAE increased the overall cost per infant screened.

Of note, many of the same risk factors (congenital infection, hyperbilirubinemia, perinatal asphyxia) are associated with both sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and auditory neuropathy (AN). In contrast, craniofacial abnormalities, are most often associated with permanent conductive loss due to abnormalities of the pinna, including microtia and atresia of the ear canal. As a result, a comprehensive diagnostic audiology assessment by an audiologist skilled in assessing young infants and children is required to guarantee the most optimal evaluation and treatment including amplification for the infant.

         Prior to universal NHS, the main approach to identifying infants with a permanent hearing loss was to selectively test newborns with risk factors for hearing loss (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74313" href="/z/d/graphic/74313.html" rel="external">
          table 3

         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Selective screening is no longer recommended because the available evidence suggests that this approach misses or delays detection of hearing loss in a significant number of patients. Thus, universal NHS is the preferred approach. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Rationale for screening'

        <p>
         A targeted screening program using the risk factors discussed above (

         A single-stage NHS utilizes one screening test, either OAE or AABR, which detects 80 to 95 percent of ears with hearing impairment. With either single test, there is a high false-positive rate resulting in a substantial number of infants with normal hearing referred for audiologic assessment, thereby increasing the overall cost of universal NHS. Referral for audiologic evaluation is generally required for 4 percent of infants screened with AABR [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59,60
         </a>
         ] and between 5 to 21 percent of infants screened with OAE [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23,47
         </a>
         ]. The prevalence of moderate to severe hearing loss is estimated to be one case for every 900 to 2500 newborn infants. Thus, for one case of significant hearing loss, the number of infants with normal hearing referred for audiologic evaluation after a single-stage screen would range from 40 to 500 patients. As a result, most birthing hospitals in the United States use two-stage protocols.

         <a href="#rid61">
          61

         <a href="#rid62">
          62,63
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Data from studies utilizing a two-stage NHS reported that approximately 900 to 1400 infants would need to be screened to identify one case of bilateral hearing loss [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20,64
         </a>
         ]. It is estimated that one of every 45 infants from the newborn nursery referred for audiologic evaluation by a two-stage NHS would have moderate to profound bilateral permanent hearing loss [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the two-stage screening may miss infants with hearing loss, because it inaccurately assumes that all infants who fail the initial screen but pass the second have normal hearing [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61,65,66
         </a>
         ]. In addition, the screening devices currently available have thresholds of approximately 35 decibels (dB) and will miss mild hearing loss, which will delay diagnosis of hearing loss. Because of this finding, continued surveillance of hearing skills and language development as described in the AAP periodicity schedule is recommended by the JCIH and AAP.

         In the newborn nursery setting (neonatal level of care 1), we suggest performing a two-stage rather than one-stage newborn hearing screen (NHS) primarily to reduce the number of infants with normal hearing who would be referred for further audiologic assessment (

         OAE is the preferred over AABR for initial test for the following reasons [

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         For hospitals using a one-stage NHS, we suggest screening with AABR since it results in a lower false-positive rate and lower referral rate for audiologic assessment compared with OAE, and it can identify infants with AN [
         <a href="#rid39">

        </p>
        <p>
         For infants who do not pass the NHS, we suggest referral for formal audiology be made prior to discharge to home. If evaluation by a skilled pediatric audiologist is not possible, the infant can be rescreened after they are discharged, but follow-up should be no later than three months of age. (See
         <a class="local">

        </p>
        <p>
         Infants in the newborn nursery who pass the hearing screen but have a risk factor for hearing loss should be closely monitored and referred for further audiology assessment depending on the nature of the risk factor and parent or provider concerns. At-risk infants should have at least one reassessment by 9 months of age [
         <a href="#rid27">

         Infants cared for in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for &gt;5 days are at increased risk for hearing loss, primarily due to sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and AN. Thus, infants admitted to the NICU should be screened using AABR rather than OAE since the latter does not detect AN (

         Targeted screening for CMV in newborns who fail the NHS has been proposed as a strategy to identify and potentially treat infants with CMV-related hearing loss. This approach is based on the rationale that CMV is the most common infectious cause of congenital or early-onset hearing loss and there is a potential treatment.

         For a screening program to be successful, it is imperative that all infants who fail the initial screening undergo formal audiologic evaluation by three months of age [
         <a href="#rid27">

        <p>
         In the United States, despite high rates of initial NHS, losses to follow-up and failure to document audiologic outcomes have remained problematic. Approximately 25 to 30 percent of infants who fail the NHS are lost to follow-up [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56,89-92
         </a>
         ]. Reasons for failure of follow-up cited in the available reports were family/caregivers unresponsiveness, inability to contact, or unknown. In addition, new challenges for screening and follow-up occurred with the onset of the COVID pandemic.

         Targeting these challenges, especially for at-risk groups, may improve return rates for further audiologic evaluation. For example, in Massachusetts and Colorado, NHS programs actively follow-up with families/caregivers and providers, resulting in rates of loss to follow-up that are fairly low (approximately 6 percent). Participation of other programs or services can also be used to effectively target follow-up [

          Prevalence of neonatal hearing loss
         </strong>
         ‒ Clinically significant hearing loss occurs in 1 to 3 newborns per 1000 live births. Infants cared for in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) are at increased risk for hearing loss, primarily due to sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and auditory neuropathy (AN). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Epidemiology'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Universal screening
         </strong>
         ‒ We recommend universal hearing screening in all newborns rather than targeted or selective testing (ie, testing only at-risk infants or those with clinical concerns for hearing loss) (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">
          Grade 1B
         </a>
         ). Universal newborn screening results in earlier identification of infants with hearing loss, earlier intervention, and possibly better language and developmental outcomes by school age compared with selective testing. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Universal screening'
         </a>
         above and

         <strong>
          Screening tests
         </strong>
         ‒ Two electrophysiologic techniques, automated auditory brainstem responses (AABR) and otoacoustic emissions (OAE), are routinely used as screening tests. Both tests are portable, automated, and inexpensive, making them well suited to newborn screening. However, OAE does not detect AN, and therefor AABR is used for screening in infants who are at risk for AN (eg, preterm neonates). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Screening tests for hearing'
         </a>
         above and

         <strong>
          One- versus two-stage protocol
         </strong>
         ‒ Protocols used for newborn hearing screening may be one-stage (ie, utilizing a single screening test [AABR or OAE]) or two-stage (ie, utilizing two screening tests or repeating the same test). In the two-stage approach, only patients who fail the initial test receive a second screening test, and only patients who fail both tests are referred for audiologic assessment (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115420" href="/z/d/graphic/115420.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         and

          algorithm 2
         </a>
         ). We suggest a two-stage rather than one-stage protocol (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). At many birthing centers, OAE is the initial test in healthy term infants because of lower cost and ease of administration. This is followed by AABR if the OAE is abnormal. Infants admitted to the NICU are screened using AABR because they are at risk for AN, which is not detected by OAE. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Protocols'
