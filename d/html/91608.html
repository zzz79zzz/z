In the CT suite, radiation exposure poses an additional hazard. In the MRI suite, the anesthesiologist must manage unique hazards due to the strong magnetic field, radiofrequency energy, and loud acoustic noise, as well as use specialized MRI safe equipment for anesthetic delivery and monitoring.</p><p>This topic will review anesthetic management of adults and children undergoing MRI or CT procedures.

The MRI suite is typically remote from the main OR location, which poses general challenges for anesthetic management, including transport of some monitors and pharmacologic agents [<a href="#rid1">1-6</a>]. Details are discussed in a separate topic.

For this reason, members of the care team (eg, radiologists, anesthesiologists, scanning equipment technicians, subspecialized nursing personnel) should discuss the sequence of events that will occur in a pre-procedure briefing [<a href="#rid3">3,5,6</a>]. Issues include how and where anesthesia will be induced (eg, in the imaging room itself or in a separate induction room), how the patient will be transported to the imaging room and positioned, specific requirements for the imaging procedure (eg, periods of apnea for cardiac imaging), procedures for possible emergencies, and where the patient will recover from anesthesia. Additional goals for the briefing include verification of availability and proper functioning of all necessary anesthetic and monitoring equipment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15077.html" rel="external">"Patient safety in the operating room", section on 'Timeouts and briefing in the operating room'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H714467334"><span class="h2">Environmental risks and challenges</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Anesthetic management of adults or children undergoing MRI procedures poses unique risks for both patients and anesthesia care providers [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>]. MRI uses a strong magnetic field to orient atoms to the field's north-to-south poles, and then uses radiofrequency pulses to change the orientation of the nuclei of specific atoms. As the nuclei return to their ground state, they radiate radiofrequency energy, which is then analyzed to create the image. The strong magnetic field, radiofrequency pulses with associated electromagnetic interference (EMI), and loud acoustic noise are potentially hazardous [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113084.html" rel="external">"Patient evaluation for metallic or electrical implants, devices, or foreign bodies before magnetic resonance imaging", section on 'Patient safety concerns'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1347213014"><span class="h3">Magnetic field</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The strong static magnetic field may cause even heavy objects (eg, oxygen or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10086" href="/z/d/drug information/10086.html" rel="external">nitrous oxide</a> tanks) to become accidental projectiles into the bore of the scanner [<a href="#rid4">4,5,7</a>]. This magnetic field is constantly present, even when a patient is not being actively scanned. Thus, the anesthesia gas machine, monitors, intravenous (IV) infusion pumps, and all other anesthetic equipment must be MRI safe. The outermost line on the floor of an MRI suite is the 5 Gauss line. This is the point at which pacemakers, implantable cardiac defibrillators, and other medical devices may be affected by the magnetic field. The field strength increases rapidly as one gets closer to the magnet. Stretchers, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and crash carts used for advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) are <strong>not</strong> MRI compatible [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Equipment'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113084.html" rel="external">"Patient evaluation for metallic or electrical implants, devices, or foreign bodies before magnetic resonance imaging", section on 'Safety zones'</a>.)</p><p>Some anesthesiologists will not be able to safely enter the MRI suite. For example, those with a pacemaker (PM), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), or implanted insulin pump cannot provide anesthetic care in this setting. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113084.html" rel="external">"Patient evaluation for metallic or electrical implants, devices, or foreign bodies before magnetic resonance imaging", section on 'Assessing implants, devices, or foreign bodies for MRI'</a>.)</p><p>When possible, the anesthesiologist should remain at least 0.5 to 1 m from the bore of the scanner and should move slowly when it is necessary to be near the bore. Movement of a mannequin head faster than 1 m/second induced electric fields/current densities above recommended levels [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Rapid patient motion in the strong magnetic field near the MRI scanner produces an electrical current within the body, which may cause symptoms such as nausea, vertigo, headache, light flashes, loss of proprioception, or a metallic taste. The anesthesiologist may experience similar symptoms (typically dizziness or headaches) with rapid head movement in or near the magnet bore [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H44343619"><span class="h3">Radiofrequency energy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Radiofrequency energy can cause tissue or device heating and can also induce current in conductors such as (ECG) leads, equipment cables, or fluid-filled tubing [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Skin or other tissue burns can occur [<a href="#rid3">3,5</a>], or in rare cases, a fire [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Therefore, MRI compatible ECG leads are used, and equipment cables and IV tubing are not positioned directly on the patient's skin. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94592.html" rel="external">"Fire safety in the operating room", section on 'Fire on the patient'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23687543"><span class="h3">Electromagnetic interference</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The strong magnetic field and radiofrequency energy may cause artifacts that limit clinical interpretation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) or pressure waveforms [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Electrocardiogram (ECG)</strong> – The magnetic field can produce artifactual changes in the ECG waveform. To eliminate the use of long conductors, MR-safe monitors use either wireless transmitters or fiberoptic cables for the ECG and pulse oximeter, with communication to a central monitoring station that sends the waveforms to a remote display unit. However, the ECG waveform may be affected by interference from several sources. For example, when the patient's upper body is in the scanner, the ECG is subject to interference from a phenomenon called hydromagnetics, whereby the strong magnetic field produces a current in blood as it flows through the ascending aorta and aortic arch. This results in artifactual alterations of the ST segment of the ECG. Although most monitors designed for use in the MRI suite incorporate one or more preprogrammed filters to improve the waveform, residual artifacts may persist.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Also, during periods of pulsating radiofrequency energy, the magnetic field may generate electromagnetic interference (EMI) that affects the entire waveform of the ECG. Thus, clinical interpretation of the ECG may be difficult while the patient is in the scanner, despite availability of ECG leads that are shielded to mitigate this effect as much as possible.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pressure waveforms</strong> – Other standard monitor features such as waveform filters that are typically helpful for optimizing arterial or other pressure waveform analysis may be absent or inadequate in MRI safe/compatible monitor models.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1851145763"><span class="h3">Loud acoustic noise</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Loud acoustic noise is generated during the pulses of energy required for imaging because the gradient coils vibrate loudly in the strong magnetic field  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82585" href="/z/d/graphic/82585.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Although a sound level of 40 decibels (dB) is generally an acceptable limit in an operating room, an MRI scanner can generate noise levels as high as 125 dB (approximately as loud as a chainsaw) during fast pulsed imaging sequences, especially with stronger static fields.</p><p>Since this noise may cause hearing damage, earplugs should be inserted into the patient's ears. Medical personnel can also experience hearing loss due to the loud acoustic noise. Hearing protectors should be worn by the anesthesiologist if he or she is in the room while the patient is being scanned. These should attenuate the noise level by up to 10 to 60 dB, which may also impair the ability to hear alarms on monitoring and other equipment and may make communication with other medical personnel difficult.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H200910916"><span class="h3">Emergency quench</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A rare occurrence is an unexpected magnet quench (defined as loss of magnet superconductivity with sudden boil-off of cryogenic [-269°C] liquid helium), or a controlled quench performed to remove the patient from the bore [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. The magnet is only deliberately quenched in the event of a truly life-threatening emergency, such as a patient or staff member being pinned against the scanner by a ferromagnetic object. (In most cases, if a magnetic object is stuck to the scanner but nobody is in danger, the magnet is ramped down slowly without being quenched and the piece of equipment is removed.) In the event of a quench, the quench duct should carry the helium out of the building in which the MRI is installed. If not properly vented, the large quantity of gaseous helium released during a quench can result in rapid, complete displacement of air inside the MRI suite, possibly causing hypoxia in the patient and MRI personnel [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Although the patient and all staff are evacuated from the scanner room as quickly as possible during a quench, entrance or exit from the suite may not be possible for several seconds due to high pressure against the doors that is generated by the escaping gases.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3468988252"><span class="h2">Preparation: Special considerations for MRI procedures</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3389126941"><span class="h3">Equipment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>MRI-compatible monitors may be unfamiliar and significantly different from typical operating room (OR) monitors. Available MRI safe/conditional monitors, gas machines, and IV infusion pumps are typically used only in MRI suites and may be unfamiliar to anesthesia personnel who do not work in these areas often [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Preparation should include a review of the user manual for unfamiliar equipment. The anesthesiologist should also verify that the monitor used in the MRI suite offers the necessary capabilities for safe patient care (eg, the ability to monitor invasive blood pressure in a critically ill patient).</p><p>Anesthesia technicians (assistants who transport and restock all equipment and supplies) should be available during preparation of equipment as well as during the scanning procedure. All assistants working in the MRI suite should receive specialized training in patient and personal safety in this environment, as well as the types of special equipment and supplies that may be needed [<a href="#rid3">3-6</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Environmental risks and challenges'</a> above.)</p><p>Monitoring equipment is classified as "MR safe," "MR unsafe," or "MR conditional" [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113084.html" rel="external">"Patient evaluation for metallic or electrical implants, devices, or foreign bodies before magnetic resonance imaging", section on 'Assessing implants, devices, or foreign bodies for MRI'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>MR safe</strong> – MR safe equipment poses no known hazards in any MRI environment. Magnetic field and radiofrequency energy produced by the scanner can cause heating in the conductive components of these monitors, placing the patient at risk for burns or fire [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Thus, MRI safe equipment (eg, ECG leads, pulse oximeter probes, blood pressure cuffs and cables) should be used. Also, wires, equipment cables, and oxygen or intravenous tubing are padded, and placement directly on the patient's skin is avoided. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94592.html" rel="external">"Fire safety in the operating room", section on 'Fire on the patient'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>MR conditional</strong> – MR conditional equipment poses no known hazard in a specified MR imaging environment with specified conditions of use. For example, some anesthesia machines such as the General Electric Aestiva 5 anesthesia machine may be used in field strengths of up to 300 Gauss; the Dräger Fabius MRI machine may be used in field strengths of up to 400 Gauss; while the BleaseGenius MRI machine may be used up to the 1000-Gauss line. Equipment labels denote the conditions (eg, maximum strength of the magnetic field, spatial gradient, time rate of change of the magnetic field [dB/dt], radiofrequency [RF] fields) under which the equipment was tested.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>MR unsafe</strong> – MR unsafe items are known to pose hazards in all MR environments. For example, cardiac defibrillators and standard gas cylinders (eg, oxygen, air, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10086" href="/z/d/drug information/10086.html" rel="external">nitrous oxide</a>) may become large dangerous projectiles flying unexpectedly into the bore. Even if secured in place, some types of equipment are damaged by proximity to the extremely strong magnetic field. Even if an oxygen tank is MR safe or conditional, the carrier in which it is transported may be ferromagnetic. All gas delivery equipment should be tested or verified to be safe before being brought into zone IV. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113084.html" rel="external">"Patient evaluation for metallic or electrical implants, devices, or foreign bodies before magnetic resonance imaging", section on 'Safety zones'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Preparation for MRI procedures includes ensuring that all monitors, equipment, and the anesthesia machine itself are MRI safe/compatible [<a href="#rid3">3-6</a>]. If the patient's airway is to be managed near the scanner, it is also necessary to use MRI-safe/compatible laryngoscope handles, blades, stylets, and stethoscopes.</p><p>In institutions without MRI-safe/conditional pumps infusion pumps for administration of IV agents to maintain general anesthesia, specially designed lengths or extensions or multiple lengths of IV tubing are used to connect the patient in the MRI suite to IV infusion pumps located further away in the MRI control room.</p><p>Long circuit tubing for the anesthesia machine circuit and the sampling catheter for monitoring respiratory gases (eg, end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> and expired inhaled anesthetic concentrations) may be needed [<a href="#rid3">3,5</a>]. These extended tubing lengths are necessary because the distances between the patient and the anesthesia gas machine and/or infusion pumps for IV drugs may be 6 to 10 feet or sometimes more, depending on the layout of the imaging suite.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1177075906"><span class="h3">Positioning in the MRI suite</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The strong, static magnetic field is generated by a superconducting electromagnet and is present at all times. Thus, positioning of the anesthesia machine, monitors, and other equipment within the MRI suite is carefully planned before, during, and after an imaging study. Collaboration with the MRI technologist is necessary to determine and demarcate the optimal and safe locations for movable anesthesia equipment in relation to the magnet [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p>The patient's position in the scanner depends upon the specific imaging requirements. During brain imaging, the patient is usually positioned with their head in the scanner and arms tucked at the sides,<strong> </strong>although positioning will vary for the specific scanning purposes. For example, lower extremity scans can be done with only the extremity in the scanner; for breast imaging, the patient is typically prone, with arms over the head. Consideration should be given to nerve injuries (ie, stretch of brachial plexus) that may occur in certain positions, particularly for patients under general anesthesia [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>Typically, the anesthesiologist monitors the patient from a control room. If possible, configuration of the MRI suite setup allows the anesthesiologist to maintain an unobstructed view of the patient, anesthesia machine, and monitors, either by direct observation or on a video monitor. In some cases, IV infusion pumps that are not MRI safe are also located in the control room near the anesthesiologist, with long extension tubing connecting the pump to the patient's IV catheter. (See <a class="local">'Anesthetic management of adult patients'</a> below.)</p><p>Final configuration of the patient area should allow the anesthesiologist to view both the patient and the anesthesia machine and monitors during the procedure, either by direct observation or on a video monitor.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2474011861"><span class="h3">Minimizing potential delays in cardiopulmonary resuscitation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may be delayed (defined as longer than two minutes after cardiac arrest). Delays occur due to the need for removal of the patient from the scanner, transfer to a stretcher, and relocation to a nearby location out of zone IV that is fully stocked with resuscitation equipment [<a href="#rid3">3,5</a>]. In the MRI suite, the powerful magnet can draw heavy equipment such as a defibrillator into the bore of the scanner, so the patient must be moved to an area just outside of the suite. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113084.html" rel="external">"Patient evaluation for metallic or electrical implants, devices, or foreign bodies before magnetic resonance imaging", section on 'Safety zones'</a>.)</p><p>Safety precautions that address these challenges include availability of MR-safe-conditional laryngoscopes and other airway equipment in the MRI suite to avoid inadvertent entry of MR-unsafe devices into zone IV near the scanner [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113084.html" rel="external">"Patient evaluation for metallic or electrical implants, devices, or foreign bodies before magnetic resonance imaging", section on 'Safety zones'</a>.)</p><p>Furthermore, multidisciplinary team responses to airway and other emergencies such as cardiac arrest should be rehearsed, along with prearranged communication protocols to summon additional anesthesia personnel in an emergency [<a href="#rid5">5,12</a>].
