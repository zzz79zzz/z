Breast cancer is a heterogeneous, phenotypically diverse disease composed of several biologic subtypes that have distinct behavior and response to therapy. Hormone receptor-positive (ie, estrogen [ER] and/or progesterone [PR] receptor-positive) breast cancers comprise the most common types of breast cancer, accounting for 75 percent of all cases.</p><p>This topic will review adjuvant endocrine therapy for non-metastatic, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer occurring in postmenopausal women. Other topics, including the adjuvant treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in premenopausal women and adjuvant treatment of hormone receptor-negative breast cancer, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer, male breast cancer, and triple-negative breast cancer, are covered separately. In addition, a discussion on the role of osteoclast inhibitors in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer is covered separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/120706.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/737.html" rel="external">"Overview of the treatment of newly diagnosed, invasive, non-metastatic breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/788.html" rel="external">"Selection and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/773.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant systemic therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14227.html" rel="external">"ER/PR negative, HER2-negative (triple-negative) breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/779.html" rel="external">"Breast cancer in men"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/757.html" rel="external">"Overview of the approach to early breast cancer in older women"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/776.html" rel="external">"Use of osteoclast inhibitors in early breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H631834246"><span class="h1">DEFINITION OF MENOPAUSE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>National Comprehensive Cancer Network defines menopause as the permanent cessation of menses, with a profound and permanent decrease in ovarian estrogen synthesis [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Because the endocrine options for treatment depend on whether or not a woman is in menopause, defining menopausal status is important. For women with breast cancer who were premenopausal at diagnosis, particularly those treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, amenorrhea is not a reliable indicator of menstrual status. We agree with the guidelines from the NCCN, which suggest that any of the following are reasonable criteria for menopause [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prior bilateral oophorectomy.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age ≥60 years.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age &lt;60 with amenorrhea for ≥12 months in the absence of prior chemotherapy, receipt of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/z/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10164" href="/z/d/drug information/10164.html" rel="external">toremifene</a>, or ovarian suppression, and estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the postmenopausal range.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age &lt;60 years: chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea for ≥12 months and estradiol and FSH in the postmenopausal range on serial measurements.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age &lt;60 years: chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea for ≥12 months and estradiol and FSH in the postmenopausal range on serial measurements.</p><p></p><p>Menopausal status cannot be determined in those receiving ovarian function suppression.</p><p>The approach to premenopausal women with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/120706.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer", section on 'Patients who became amenorrheic during chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H658246"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For women with estrogen receptor- or progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer, we recommend adjuvant endocrine therapy. Pathologic criteria for assigning hormone receptor status are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/747.html" rel="external">"Hormone receptors in breast cancer: Clinical utility and guideline recommendations to improve test accuracy", section on 'Interpretation of ER and PR tests'</a>.)</p><p>Although the risk of recurrence and therefore the absolute likelihood of benefit is higher for those with larger or higher-risk tumors, we recommend this treatment for those with hormone receptor-positive breast cancers regardless of size. This approach is supported by the consistent improvements in rates of recurrence, second breast cancers, and survival that have been observed in clinical trials enrolling patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors of any size.</p><p>Importantly, nearly all postmenopausal women who are candidates for endocrine therapy should be offered treatment, regardless of age. While the odds of having associated medical comorbidities increase with age, and these may predispose older women to increased toxicities related to treatment, the benefits of adjuvant endocrine therapy on reducing the risks of recurrence and death from breast cancer have been consistently demonstrated. Therefore, patients at risk for treatment-related toxicities due to adjuvant endocrine therapy should be managed appropriately, with care coordinated between their oncology team and primary care clinician. However, careful discussion with those patients is warranted if they have multiple comorbidities that may increase their risk of major toxicities, such as pre-existing history of thrombosis or cerebrovascular disease or osteoporosis and fractures refractory to skeletal modifying agents, and especially if their prognosis is particularly good.

As a class, the AIs have consistently been shown to improve outcomes for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer compared with tamoxifen, both during and after treatment. (See <a class="local">'Versus tamoxifen'</a> below.)</p><p>Therefore, an AI is the preferred adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women, although <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/z/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a> is an acceptable alternative for women who are intolerant of AIs.

AIs are inactive in women with intact ovarian function, including those who experienced therapy-induced amenorrhea, and hence ovarian suppression/ablation must be used in premenopausal women receiving AIs.

While breast cancer outcomes were better for letrozole compared with tamoxifen monotherapy, there was no significant difference in either disease-free or overall survival (OS) between the sequential therapies and letrozole monotherapy. Moreover, efficacy of monotherapy with letrozole versus tamoxifen for contralateral breast cancer varied over time (0 to 5-, 5 to 10-, and &gt;10-year hazard ratios [HRs] 0.62, 0.47, and 1.35, respectively) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p>These data are consistent with the observation that the highest risk for recurrence is within the first few years after initial diagnosis, and that the more effective treatment strategy, aromatase inhibition, is preferable to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/z/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a> during that time. However, once patients have remained disease free for a few years, switching to tamoxifen is similarly effective to continuation of AI treatment, and there may be a longer carry-over effect with tamoxifen than an AI in terms of protection against contralateral breast cancer.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H495689908"><span class="h4">Comparison between AIs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evidence suggests similar clinical outcomes and tolerability between the aromatase inhibitors (AIs).

Individual patients may tolerate one of these agents better than another, and it is reasonable to switch to an alternative AI if the initial AI is poorly tolerated and other strategies of managing side effects have been ineffective [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Side effects'</a> below.)</p><p>In the FATA-GIM3 trial, over 1800 women were randomly assigned to oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8780" href="/z/d/drug information/8780.html" rel="external">anastrozole</a> (1 mg per day), <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8920" href="/z/d/drug information/8920.html" rel="external">exemestane</a> (25 mg per day), or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10064" href="/z/d/drug information/10064.html" rel="external">letrozole</a> (2.5 mg per day) for five years [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 90 percent with anastrozole (95% CI 87.9-91.7), 88 percent with exemestane (95% CI 85.8-89.9), and 89 percent with letrozole (95% CI 87.3-91.1). Gastrointestinal side effects were more common with exemestane than with letrozole, and hypercholesterolemia was more frequent with anastrozole and letrozole than with exemestane. All other side effects were similar between the agents. Treatment was interrupted due to toxicity in approximately 7 percent of patients on each of these treatment arms.</p><p>Trials have also been conducted to assess the following specific comparisons, again showing similar outcomes between agents:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Exemestane</strong><strong> versus </strong><strong>anastrozole</strong> – In the NCIC-CTG MA.27 study, over 7500 women were randomly assigned to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8920" href="/z/d/drug information/8920.html" rel="external">exemestane</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8780" href="/z/d/drug information/8780.html" rel="external">anastrozole</a> [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. With a median follow-up of four years, there was no difference in the event-free survival or OS rate.

These symptoms may be severe in almost one-third of patients [<a href="#rid16">16</a>], and may be responsible for treatment discontinuation in 10 to 20 percent of patients [<a href="#rid15">15-18</a>]. Recognizing that there are few studies to inform the approach for patients with AIMSS, we suggest the following strategies, typically sequentially, although depending on patient preferences and severity of symptoms, this might not always be the case:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Exercise and NSAIDs</strong> – The initial strategy for managing AIMSS includes exercise and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In the HOPE trial, 121 postmenopausal women with AI-associated arthralgias were randomly assigned to an exercise regimen or to usual care [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. The exercise regimen consisted of twice-weekly supervised resistance and strength training plus moderate aerobic exercise for 150 minutes per week. Patients undergoing the exercise regimen had reduction in their worst pain score (20 versus 1 percent average score reduction, respectively) and pain severity (21 versus 0 percent reduction) compared with usual care. They also experienced more weight loss and improvement in their exercise capacity. In addition, a dose-response relationship between exercise and symptom severity was identified. Compared with women who attended fewer than 80 percent of the exercise sessions, those who attended 80 percent or more experienced a greater reduction in their worst pain score (25 versus 14 percent, respectively).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Beyond exercise, the primary treatment for AIMSS often begins with the administration of NSAIDS because these agents are a mainstay of treatment for pain.

In the SWOG S1202 trial, among 299 patients with stage I to III disease on AIs, those randomized to duloxetine (30 mg daily for 1 week, then 60 mg daily for 11 weeks, then 30 mg daily for 1 week) experienced improvement in joint pain through the 12 weeks of treatment relative to placebo, though results between the groups were similar at 24 weeks [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Duloxetine was relatively well tolerated; the most common AEs were grade 1 or 2 fatigue (32 percent), xerostomia (24 percent), nausea (30 percent), and headache (21 percent).

Those with many positive nodes were at an annual risk of distant recurrence of nearly 3 percent per year; for those with one to three positive nodes, the annual risk was approximately 2 percent; for those with negative nodes but T2 or greater lesions, the risk was approximately 1 percent per year; and women with node-negative and smaller tumors experienced an annual risk of approximately 0.5 to 1.0 percent.</p><p>In a population-based study using the Danish Breast Cancer Group database, very similar findings were observed among approximately 20,000 patients who were survivors 10 years after diagnosis.

However, the overall risk in the Danish study was slightly lower than that reported by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG), perhaps because the EBCTCG study included only patients who went on clinical trials, whereas the Danish study included all patients diagnosed with breast cancer in that country. Furthermore, the Danish study began analysis in women who had reached 10 years without recurrence, whereas the EBCTCG study began its analysis at five years. Finally, the Danish investigators accounted for competing causes of death, which was not done in the EBCTCG. Regardless, as in the EBCTCG, high lymph node burden, large tumor size, and ER positivity were the most important factors associated with risk of late recurrence, and are consistent with the concern that patients with ER-positive breast cancer remain at risk for late distant recurrence as long as they are alive.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1706281998"><span class="h2">Selection of patients for extended therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer are treated for a minimum of five years with adjuvant endocrine therapy, some data suggest that longer durations of endocrine therapy improve disease-free survival (DFS), if not overall survival (OS). Extended adjuvant endocrine therapy beyond five years is an option for all patients with a prior history of invasive, ER-positive breast cancer, but some patients may be more likely to derive benefit than others. For women with larger tumors or node-positive disease, we suggest extended endocrine treatment. For women with smaller, node-negative tumors, the benefits are less clear and, for some, may not outweigh the risk of toxicities. A patient-by-patient decision must be made that includes risk of both ongoing symptomatic side effects and life-taking, -threatening, or -changing toxicities, such as thrombosis and endometrial cancer (both with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/z/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a>), or fracture (with aromatase inhibitors [AIs]).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Is there a role for gene expression analyses in patient selection for extended endocrine therapy?</strong> – We do not routinely use gene expression analyses to make decisions about extended endocrine therapy, especially in patients who originally had a high anatomic stage based on number of lymph nodes (&gt;3) and size (&gt;5 cm) of tumor and/or if they had high-grade cancers.

Indeed, there is at least one peer-reviewed published study suggesting that each of the available assays (OncotypeDX, Endopredict, ProSigna, and the BCI) identify a group of patients with such a favorable prognosis. However, each of these studies were conducted as a "prospective retrospective" investigation, using specimens from patients who participated in previously performed clinical trials, and are subject to the various biases and confounding issues built into such strategies [<a href="#rid53">53</a>].

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

Estrogen receptor (ER)- and/or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive breast cancers comprise the most common type of breast cancer, accounting for 75 percent of all breast cancers. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indication for endocrine therapy</strong> – For most patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, we recommend adjuvant endocrine therapy (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_1" rel="external">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Choice of endocrine therapy</strong> – For postmenopausal women with non-metastatic, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, we suggest an aromatase inhibitor (AI) rather than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/z/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a> as adjuvant endocrine treatment (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_4" rel="external">Grade 2A</a>). While AIs are associated with improved outcomes compared with tamoxifen, both agents reduce recurrences and new primary breast cancers, and some women may tolerate the risks and toxicities of tamoxifen better than an AI. For women who wish to discontinue an AI, it would be reasonable to switch to tamoxifen. (See <a class="local">'AIs as preferred therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Incorporation of </strong><strong>abemaciclib</strong><strong> for high-risk disease</strong> – For patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, node-positive breast cancer at high risk<strong> </strong>of recurrence, we suggest the addition of adjuvant <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="115098" href="/z/d/drug information/115098.html" rel="external">abemaciclib</a> to endocrine therapy (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>), but note that it is also acceptable not to administer this additional treatment, given the toxicity (notably, diarrhea) and only short-term supporting data. High-risk criteria are discussed above. (See <a class="local">'Incorporation of targeted therapies for select patients'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Of note, there are no data on outcomes in women with breast cancer susceptibility gene 1/<em>2 (BRCA1/2</em>) mutations, and for such patients, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="98761" href="/z/d/drug information/98761.html" rel="external">olaparib</a> is the preferred approach in addition to endocrine therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/788.html" rel="external">"Selection and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer", section on 'BRCA carriers with high-risk disease'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Duration of endocrine treatment</strong> – For women receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy, we recommend at least a five-year course of treatment (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_1" rel="external">Grade 1A</a>). If there has been no disease recurrence at that point, consideration should be given regarding extended endocrine therapy, weighing risk of recurrence against side effects and risks for serious adverse events (AEs; eg, thrombosis and endometrial cancer with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/z/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a>; or fracture with AIs).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For women with higher-risk disease (eg, stage II or stage III disease), we suggest extended endocrine treatment (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>), although we recognize that some patients with poor tolerance may choose not to pursue extended treatment. For patients with high-risk disease, a total duration between 7 and 10 years is appropriate, with preference for the higher end of this range, if treatment is well tolerated. Those who have been treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/z/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a> only may have a higher likelihood of benefit.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For women with smaller, node-negative tumors (ie, stage I disease), it is not clear that there is a sufficiently high risk of late recurrence to justify the side effects and risks of extended endocrine therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Women who wish to avoid side effects may reasonably stop endocrine therapy after five years.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Women who are tolerating endocrine treatment well and wish to decrease their likelihood of new breast cancers or recurrences may reasonably choose extended endocrine therapy. If extended endocrine therapy is chosen in patients with low-risk cancers, an additional two years of treatment is appropriate (for a total of seven years of treatment). The benefits of a total of 10 versus 7 years of endocrine therapy are small, if any, in women with low-risk cancers, and the risks of AEs persist. (See <a class="local">'Duration of endocrine treatment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Timing of endocrine treatment</strong> – For patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, we initiate endocrine therapy <strong>after</strong> chemotherapy has completed (ie, sequentially) rather than concurrently with chemotherapy, in order to minimize toxicities. For women receiving adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) for breast cancer, endocrine therapy may be initiated concurrently with RT or sequentially, following the completion of RT.
