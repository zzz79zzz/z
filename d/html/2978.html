         Bladder cancer is the most common malignancy involving the urinary system. Urothelial (formerly called transitional cell) carcinoma is the predominant histologic type in the United States and Europe, where it accounts for approximately 90 percent of all bladder cancers. In other areas of the world, non-urothelial carcinomas are more frequent. Less commonly, urothelial cancers can arise in the renal pelvis, ureter, or urethra. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2957.html" rel="external">
          "Epidemiology and risk factors of urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma of the bladder", section on 'Epidemiology'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The spectrum of urothelial bladder cancer at presentation includes non-muscle invasive, muscle invasive, and metastatic disease. The extent of disease reflects its natural history and determines treatment and prognosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic provides an overview of the initial approach to and management of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. More detailed discussions of specific issues are found in associated topics, as indicated below.

        <p>
         The management of urothelial tumors arising at other sites is discussed separately, as are other types of bladder cancer:

         Patients with bladder cancer typically present with gross or microscopic hematuria, although irritative and obstructive voiding symptoms (frequency, urgency, dysuria, nocturia) can be the initial presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
         In individuals over the age of 40 years, the presence of otherwise unexplained microscopic or gross hematuria requires evaluation of the bladder and upper urinary tract in order to rule out urinary tract malignancy. A full evaluation of the entire urinary tract is indicated in such patients, unless there is clear evidence of glomerular bleeding or urinary tract infection. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2989.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of bladder cancer", section on 'Clinical presentation'

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Cystoscopy is the gold standard for the initial diagnosis of bladder cancer. Cystoscopy is combined with urine cytology, which may detect lesions that might be missed at cystoscopy or lesions of the upper urinary tract (ureter, renal pelvis). The use of approved voided urine biomarkers may also provide additional diagnostic information. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2968.html" rel="external">
          "Urine biomarkers for the detection of urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma of the bladder"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The initial cystoscopy is typically done in an outpatient setting with a flexible cystoscope. Enhanced endoscopic imaging techniques, including narrow-band imaging and fluorescence cystoscopy (FC), may help identify more papillary tumors and carcinoma in situ lesions, and use of FC is associated with a modest reduction in recurrence of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Patients with visible tumors are either biopsied or resected transurethrally to establish the histopathologic diagnosis and provide an initial assessment of the depth of invasion (mucosa, submucosa, muscularis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef133156" href="/z/d/graphic/133156.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         )).
        </p>
        <p>
         Site-directed biopsies are indicated in patients with high-grade cancers and any suspicious erythematous and/or flat lesions. Biopsy of normal-appearing urothelium and prostatic urethra is indicated in patients with a positive urine cytology and no visually apparent tumor within the bladder. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2996.html" rel="external">
          "Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer", section on 'Transurethral resection'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The bladder is the source of a positive cytology in approximately 80 percent of patients. Selective catheterization of the ureters/renal pelvis with urine specimens for cytology from the upper tract is required to identify the source of a positive cytology in the absence of an identifiable bladder lesion.

         Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) combined with pelvic examination under anesthesia is the initial step in the staging evaluation and is required in order to assess the histologic grade and depth of invasion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Imaging of the upper urinary tract by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with intravenous contrast. MRI may also be used to stage primary bladder cancer. Vesical Imaging Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) is a validated scoring system that is useful for distinguishing between cancers confined to the detrusor muscle and those that are locally advanced (detrusor muscle penetration) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Retrograde ureteropyelography performed at the time of TURBT is indicated to rule out a second primary lesion, even for patients with an established diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.
        </p>
        <p>
         When the initial evaluation identifies muscle-invasive disease, cross-sectional imaging with CT or MRI and laboratory evaluation is indicated to assess the extent of pelvic disease and exclude the presence of distant metastases [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. A positive positron emission tomography (PET) scan has a high predictive value for metastatic disease, and fused PET-CT imaging is being used for cancer staging  (

          image 1
         </a>
         ). Of note, technique and reporting experience are still evolving, and specificity is suboptimal. A negative PET scan does not preclude the presence of occult metastatic disease [

         For patients with disease limited to the bladder, the depth of invasion of the primary tumor is the most important prognostic variable in determining the risk of recurrence or progression  (

         In addition to depth of invasion, tumors are classified based upon the degree of differentiation. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Society of Urologic Pathologists (ISUP) have established a consensus system for urothelial (transitional cell) neoplasms in which urothelial cancer is classified as low grade or high grade based upon the degree of nuclear anaplasia and architectural abnormalities [

         Low-grade tumors infrequently progress to a more aggressive phenotype, whereas high-grade tumors have a more aggressive natural history. With rare exception, muscle invasive (T2) urothelial cancer is high grade.

         For patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, the risk of recurrence and/or disseminated disease after initial treatment is used to guide therapy  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112017" href="/z/d/graphic/112017.html" rel="external">

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Conservative management may allow the preservation of a functional bladder based upon transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), potentially combined with adjuvant intravesical therapy. However, this approach must be balanced against the risk of recurrence or progression. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Transurethral resection'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with low-risk disease are usually managed by TURBT alone plus a single dose of perioperative intravesical chemotherapy given in the operating room or within a few hours of tumor resection [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. The chemotherapy is typically retained for one hour. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with intermediate- or high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder tumors, intravesical therapy is generally recommended to decrease the risk of recurrence or progression to muscle invasive disease and the potential need for cystectomy. (See

        <p>
         Following initial TURBT with or without intravesical therapy, careful surveillance for recurrent or second primary tumors of the urinary tract is required for both low- and high-risk patients. (See

         The initial treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder tumors is a complete TURBT. Some patients with low-grade tumors may require two or more resections in order to remove all visible papillary disease. Perioperative single-dose intravesical chemotherapy (usually with

        </p>

         Patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer should undergo a repeat cystoscopy and may require reresection of areas of high-grade urothelial cancer prior to initiation of

         (BCG) therapy. Repeat resection is important, both to eliminate any visible residual disease and to eliminate the risk of understaging. All of the guidelines are consistent with this as a standard of care for patients with high-grade T1 tumors, and this is an option for patients with high-grade Ta tumors. Biopsies of normal-appearing mucosa adjacent and remote to the tumor should be done to determine whether CIS is present. Enhanced endoscopic imaging with narrow band imaging or fluorescence cystoscopy helps detect additional papillary tumors and CIS lesions. (See

         Induction (weekly for six weeks) intravesical therapy is indicated in patients with intermediate- and high-risk disease. This approach facilitates delivery of high local concentrations of a therapeutic agent within the bladder, potentially destroying viable tumor cells that remain following TURBT to prevent tumor implantation, as well as treating residual flat papillary lesions or CIS. This is generally followed by maintenance therapy, and the duration of maintenance therapy is based upon risk stratification. (See

         Intravesical therapy utilizes large molecular weight compounds, thus limiting transmucosal absorption and systemic toxicity. However, the risk of disseminated infection with BCG or systemic toxicity from chemotherapy is increased in patients who have had extensive transurethral resection with residual denuded mucosal surfaces. Intravesical therapy may be initiated two to three weeks postoperatively and no later than four weeks after completing TURBT, allowing the bladder to heal and resolution of surgery-related lower urinary tract symptoms.

         For patients with intermediate-risk disease, intravesical therapy with either BCG or chemotherapy is an option. Alternatives to BCG include several chemotherapy agents, such as

         Careful follow-up is required for all patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Second primary tumors can develop in the urothelium anywhere along the genitourinary tract, including the renal pelvis, ureters, and urethra, as well as the bladder. Subsequent surveillance should include a careful program of cystoscopy beginning three months after the initial treatment. Cytology is obtained at the time of surveillance cystoscopy for patients with high-grade and high-risk or intermediate-risk disease. (See

         Radical cystectomy entails removal of the bladder, adjacent organs, and regional lymph nodes. In males, radical cystectomy generally includes removal of the prostate and seminal vesicles as well as the urinary bladder. In females, organ preservation of the uterus, cervix, and ovaries is possible in many patients due to infrequent tumor involvement of these organs. (See

         Bladder preservation approaches require careful surveillance following therapy for evidence of local recurrence and for detection of new urothelial cancers. For patients who fail to achieve a complete response and for those who subsequently relapse with muscle-invasive disease, salvage cystectomy is indicated.

         Most patients with bladder cancer would prefer to keep their native bladder, if at all possible. However, the primary goal of treatment is cure of the cancer, and bladder preservation is a secondary consideration, particularly in the younger and more robust patients.

         A "radical" TURBT has been used in selected patients with small primary tumors (≤T1b, clinical stage T2, no carcinoma in situ, and located in an area of the bladder amenable to deep resection into perivesical fat [not in the dome or high posterior wall]) [

         Partial cystectomy is an alternative option for patients with similar tumor characteristics, with the exception that the dome and posterior wall are ideal locations, though both procedures are indicated in a small subset of patients. Partial cystectomy is the treatment of choice for urachal adenocarcinomas.

         Patient selection is important. For the patient with a history of multiple TURBTs, chemoradiation approaches may result in a patient who is highly symptomatic with significant bladder symptoms and discomfort due to posttreatment inflammation, antecedent scarring, and local damage. (See

         For patients treated with cystectomy, we perform laboratory evaluations (ie, urine cytology, liver and renal function tests, and electrolytes) every three months for the first year, every six months for the second and third years, and then annually up to year 5. After year 5, these assessments should be performed as clinically indicated. Metabolic abnormalities, including electrolyte abnormalities and acidosis, are common, and patients with chronic kidney disease and obstructive uropathy may be at increased risk. Chronic acidosis is a risk factor for osteopenia and osteoporosis, so regular electrolyte monitoring may identify at-risk patients for pharmacologic intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, computed tomography (CT) imaging (chest, abdomen, and pelvis) is reasonably performed every six months for the first three years, then annually to year 5, and then only as clinically indicated. The interval between imaging evaluations may vary depending on whether or not lymph nodes were involved at surgery. If node positive, then scans every three to six months are reasonable; if node negative, scans may be extended to 6- to 12-month intervals. Our approach is consistent with consensus guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), which support a range in frequency of recommended imaging intervals [
