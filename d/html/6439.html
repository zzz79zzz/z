The diagnosis and management of common causes of ear pain are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6009.html" rel="external">"Acute otitis media in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5959.html" rel="external">"Acute otitis media in children: Treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5966.html" rel="external">"Otitis media with effusion (serous otitis media) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/87008.html" rel="external">"Otitis media with effusion (serous otitis media) in children: Management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6866.html" rel="external">"External otitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16516.html" rel="external">"External otitis: Treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3029199810"><span class="h1">BACKGROUND</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ear pain (or otalgia) ranks as one of the leading complaints among children evaluated in the primary care or emergency setting. Most patients will have one of three common diagnoses (acute otitis media [AOM], otitis media with effusion [OME]), or otitis externa, which are generally not serious. The rare cases of more serious disease associated with ear pain usually result from extension of ear infection to adjacent anatomic structures (eg, mastoiditis, meningitis, malignant otitis externa, venous sinus thrombosis). Basilar skull fracture or epidural hematoma after head trauma may also present with ear pain.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The differential diagnosis of ear pain can be categorized by the anatomic site from which the pain originates  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60554" href="/z/d/graphic/60554.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Patients with primary otalgia have pain originating from the ear itself. Secondary otalgia is referred pain, originating in another anatomic site but causing the sensation of arising from the ear.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Auricle</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">Contusion (auricular hematoma)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Blunt trauma to the external ear may result in contusions of the auricle. Physical findings may include swelling, ecchymosis, and tenderness overlying the auricle. Lacerations to the ear may also occur. Care should be taken to evaluate for lacerations involving the perichondrium or cartilage itself, which will require a layered repair and present an increased risk of infection.</p><p>Auricular hematomas are localized collections of subperichondrial blood that typically result either from blunt impact or from friction, as commonly occurs during wrestling [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Shearing of the perichondrium away from the underlying cartilage results in rupture of the subperichondrial blood vessels. The hematomas are typically found in the anterior superior part of the auricle and present as a fluctuant, purple or red, mildly tender mass. Hematoma drainage followed by careful pressure bandaging of the auricle to prevent reaccumulation of the hematoma is essential to optimal cosmetic outcome.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3080695560"><span class="h3">Infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Infections that involve the auricle include: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cellulitis</strong> – Cellulitis of the auricle frequently develops after trauma, an insect bite, or an ear piercing. Patients present with fairly rapid onset and progression of pain, redness, swelling, tenderness, and induration. In some cases, the swollen auricle will appear to protrude outward.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Perichondritis</strong> – Perichondritis is an infection of the perichondrium, the thin fascial layer surrounding the auricular cartilage  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67879" href="/z/d/graphic/67879.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). Perichondritis may result from blunt trauma or from piercings. Infection involving the cartilage can lead to permanent deformity of the ear, so perichondritis must be recognized and treated promptly. With perichondritis, the cartilaginous portion of the ear is red, swollen, and tender; but the ear lobe, which contains no cartilage, may be spared. Often, there is a focal area of fluctuance, indicating subperichondrial abscess that requires drainage. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3148.html" rel="external">"Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections of the eye, ear, urinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, and central nervous system", section on 'Perichondritis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Herpes zoster oticus (Ramsay Hunt syndrome)</strong> – Herpes zoster oticus describes a reactivation of the varicella (chickenpox) virus after prior varicella infection that involves the skin of the external ear. Burning pain, hyperesthesia, and pruritus may precede the onset of vesicular lesions, making early diagnosis a challenge [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Vesicular lesions may be seen on the pinna or in the ear canal. Associated inner ear dysfunction (hearing loss or vertigo) or facial weakness (Ramsay Hunt syndrome) may occur. This syndrome is rare in young children, especially in the era of universal varicella vaccination, but it may be seen occasionally in adolescents. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8327.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of herpes zoster", section on 'Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus)'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Allergic angioedema</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Allergic swelling of the external ear may result from local allergic reactions to insect bites or from contact dermatitis (as with poison ivy). There is usually prominent pruritus and little (if any) pain, induration, or tenderness. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8105.html" rel="external">"An overview of angioedema: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3561800415"><span class="h3">Juvenile spring eruption (polymorphous light eruption)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with this form of sun reaction present with bullae, redness, and itch or sometimes pain on the superior aspect of the auricles, which is symmetric and bilateral  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55229 graphicRef68969" href="/z/d/graphic/55229.html" rel="external">picture 2A-B</a>). There may also be inflamed, itchy plaques on the face or dorsal hands. This condition typically presents early in the sunny season of the year. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6623.html" rel="external">"Polymorphous light eruption", section on 'Juvenile spring eruption (polymorphous light eruption variant)'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Environmental injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Frostbite or sunburn can also cause redness, swelling, and pain of the auricle. Typically, there will be a history of environmental exposure to suggest the diagnosis. Often, there will be bilateral ear involvement, which is atypical of most infections or local allergic reactions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/179.html" rel="external">"Frostbite: Emergency care and prevention", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6624.html" rel="external">"Sunburn", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Ear canal</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Otitis externa</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Otitis externa refers to diffuse infection of the external ear canal, typically caused by <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, or occasionally other gram-negative rods. Otitis externa usually results from the introduction of water into the ear canal as a result of swimming. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6866.html" rel="external">"External otitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_patient" href="/z/d/html/3998.html" rel="external">"Patient education: External otitis (including swimmer's ear) (Beyond the Basics)"</a>.)</p><p>The cardinal symptom of acute otitis externa is pain and tenderness localized to the auditory meatus [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. There may also be pain with jaw movement, a feeling of fullness in the ear, itching of the ear canal, or discharge from the canal. Fever is uncommon. On physical examination, most patients have tenderness of the tragus and pain with otoscopy. The ear canal may appear swollen, red, or macerated. A thick and sometimes malodorous discharge may be present. The tympanic membrane (TM) may appear red, but in cases of isolated otitis externa, there should be no fluid behind the TM.</p><p>Fungal otitis externa (caused by <em>Aspergillus</em> or <em>Candida</em>) can occur, especially if the normal bacterial milieu of the ear canal has been eradicated by extensive use of topical antimicrobial agents. Fungal otitis externa is characterized by itch more than pain. White, flaky debris may be seen in the ear canal. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6866.html" rel="external">"External otitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Otomycosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h3">Malignant otitis externa</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Malignant otitis externa occurs when infection spreads from the ear canal to the surrounding bones of the skull base [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. This condition is quite rare in pediatrics but may occur in patients with immunocompromise. Patients with malignant otitis externa typically have a more intense and deep-seated ear pain, systemic signs of toxicity or fever, and possibly tenderness of the temporal bone or facial nerve palsy. The diagnosis is suggested by elevated inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] or C-reactive protein [CRP]) and confirmed by cranial imaging (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) indicating osteomyelitis of the skull base. <em>P. aeruginosa</em> is the usual pathogen. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3413.html" rel="external">"Malignant (necrotizing) external otitis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Contact dermatitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Use of topical antimicrobial or analgesic drops may result in contact dermatitis of the external ear. A pink-red, confluent, slightly bumpy rash may be noted in the ear canal, in the concha, or on the surrounding skin. Itch is more prominent than pain, and discharge is uncommon. Atopic dermatitis (eczema) of the ear canal may cause similar findings. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1731.html" rel="external">"Allergic contact dermatitis in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1729.html" rel="external">"Atopic dermatitis (eczema): Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h3">Furuncle</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Furunculosis is a localized skin infection involving one or more hair follicles of the outer ear canal, typically caused by <em>S. aureus</em>. Patients with furunculosis have focal pain and a red, swollen, tender mass in the external canal. There is typically no swelling of the pinna, ear discharge, fever, or adjacent adenopathy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/110529.html" rel="external">"Cellulitis and skin abscess: Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Skin abscess'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h3">Foreign body</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Foreign bodies in the ear canal usually present with a suggestive history, but sometimes, ear pain or hearing loss may be the chief complaint. Foreign bodies that have been present for some length of time may be obscured by surrounding cerumen, granulation tissue, or pus; thereby making the diagnosis more challenging. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83464.html" rel="external">"Foreign bodies of the outer ear (pinna [auricle] and external auditory canal): Diagnosis and management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h3">Cerumen impaction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cerumen impaction itself is a fairly common cause of ear discomfort, though intense pain is uncommon. Often, patients complain of ear fullness or hearing impairment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6841.html" rel="external">"Cerumen"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h3">Tumor</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Rarely, tumors of the external auditory canal can occur and may present with ear pain. Rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphoma, and eosinophilic granuloma have been reported. These cases may involve a granulomatous mass in the external auditory canal and bloody or serosanguineous discharge. Patients that appear to have a relapsing or unremitting case of otitis externa or perforated otitis media should be evaluated for the possibility of a tumor in the ear canal. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7728.html" rel="external">"Rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood and adolescence: Clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and staging", section on 'Head and neck'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8385.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h2">Middle and inner ear</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18"><span class="h3">Acute otitis media</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute otitis media (AOM) remains the most common illness diagnosed by pediatricians. In AOM, ear pain, which at times can be quite severe, is typically felt deep within the ear. Often, the pain is worse when the patient is supine. Nasal congestion and cough typically precede the ear pain by several days. Fever occurs in some cases. In younger patients, nonspecific symptoms such as fussiness or irritability, disturbed sleep, and poor feeding may predominate. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6009.html" rel="external">"Acute otitis media in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>On otoscopic examination, patients with AOM have evidence of middle ear effusion with a TM that is bulging or has decreased mobility. Bulging of the TM is the most specific sign of AOM [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The TM may appear cloudy or opaque, with a white, yellow, or occasionally green color reflecting pus behind the TM. An air fluid level may be seen, though this is more common with otitis media with effusion (OME). In some cases, the TM may have focal bullae. The TM usually also has focal or diffuse areas of redness, injection, or hemorrhage, which should be distinguished from the milder pink flush often seen with fever or crying. The external ear examination is typically normal, with no redness or tenderness and no adjacent lymphadenopathy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6009.html" rel="external">"Acute otitis media in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Myringitis refers to inflammation of the TM with or without associated middle ear fluid. In cases of isolated myringitis, redness or bullae of the TM may be noted in the absence of apparent fluid in the middle ear. Myringitis may be caused by trauma or infection. Bacterial pathogens are most commonly implicated, but viruses may play a role. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6009.html" rel="external">"Acute otitis media in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Bullous myringitis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19"><span class="h3">Complications of acute otitis media</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6021.html" rel="external">"Acute otitis media in children: Epidemiology, microbiology, and complications", section on 'Complications and sequelae'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Spontaneous rupture of the tympanic membrane</strong> – Suppurative TM perforation is a common complication of AOM, resulting from the accumulation of pus under pressure in the middle ear. Typically, the patient reports ear pain followed by otorrhea, which may be quite copious. After the TM has ruptured, the patient may experience a relief of pain. On physical examination, a thin, watery, and sometimes foul-smelling fluid is usually observed. In many cases, it may be impossible to visualize the TM. Purulent otorrhea may also be seen in patients who have otitis media in the setting of prior tympanostomy tube placement. In these patients, pathogens may include the typical middle ear bacteria or <em>S. aureus</em> or <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, which presumably migrate inward from the external ear.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mastoiditis</strong> – Mastoiditis occurs when the mastoid air cells, which connect directly to the middle ear space, become infected as a result of adjacent AOM. Diagnostic findings include ear pain, swelling, tenderness, and redness over the mastoid region; protrusion of the ear; and fever. Findings of AOM are often present. Imaging is not necessary to diagnose mastoiditis but may be warranted to confirm the diagnosis in atypical cases, to determine the stage (ie, acute mastoiditis with periostitis versus coalescent mastoiditis), or to evaluate for complications. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6062.html" rel="external">"Acute mastoiditis in children: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Facial palsy</strong> – Dysfunction of cranial nerve VII is a rare complication of AOM probably resulting from inflammation or stretching of the nerve as it passes through the middle ear space [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. On physical examination, limited ability to close the ipsilateral eye, limited ability to raise the eyebrows, flattening of the nasolabial fold, and asymmetric smile may be noted. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6217.html" rel="external">"Facial nerve palsy in children", section on 'Otitis media'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inner ear infection</strong> – Labyrinthitis or petrositis are also rare complications of AOM resulting from contiguous spread of infection. Sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, or vertigo may occur. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6465.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with acute ataxia", section on 'Labyrinthitis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Involvement of contiguous structures</strong> – AOM rarely seeds contiguous structures, such as the meninges and/or the brain, causing brain, epidural, or subdural abscess or meningitis [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Fever, headache, meningismus, ill appearance, altered mental status or focal neurologic findings may result. Alternatively, the infection may remain confined to the middle ear, but inflammatory mediators incite a thrombosis of the adjacent sigmoid and/or lateral sinuses ("otitic hydrocephalus"). Diagnosis is confirmed by brain imaging (brain abscess, venous sinus thrombosis) or lumbar puncture (meningitis) [<a href="#rid6">6,8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20"><span class="h3">Otitis media with effusion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>OME refers to fluid in the middle ear space without acute inflammation. Middle ear fluid typically accumulates as a result of Eustachian tube dysfunction, which itself usually results from nasal infection or allergy. Some patients with OME are asymptomatic, but others have mild ear pain. Feelings of ear fullness or decreased hearing are common. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5966.html" rel="external">"Otitis media with effusion (serous otitis media) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>The hallmark of OME on physical examination is poor or absent mobility of the TM. Bulging of the TM is uncommon and typically indicates an alternative diagnosis of AOM. The TM may be mildly full, in neutral position, or even retracted, indicating negative pressure in the middle ear space. The TM may appear amber and translucent (indicating true serous fluid) or mildly white or yellow and cloudy. Occasionally, the TM may have a blue color. In some cases of clear, colorless effusions, the presence of bubbles (indicating air trapped within the fluid collection) may be the only sign of effusion. Redness of the TM is not expected.

Eustachian tube dysfunction is a preliminary step in the pathophysiology of AOM or OME, as failure of the Eustachian tube to open leads to negative pressure and inability of the middle ear to clear accumulated fluid and bacteria. Even in the absence of AOM or OME, Eustachian tube dysfunction may lead to ear discomfort as a result of the development of negative pressure in the middle ear space. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14608.html" rel="external">"Eustachian tube dysfunction", section on 'Pathophysiology of Eustachian tube dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with Eustachian tube dysfunction may present with ear pain; subjective sensation of ear fullness or hearing loss; a popping sensation associated with chewing, yawning, or swallowing; or tinnitus. Often, but not always, there will be an accompanying history of preceding nasal congestion, typically associated with upper respiratory infection or allergic rhinitis. Physical examination findings may be normal or may reveal focal or extensive retraction of the TM. Injection or diffuse redness of the TM may be evident as well. Abnormalities of pneumatic otoscopy will often be demonstrated. In cases of negative pressure leading to a retracted TM, there will be poor or absent mobility with application of positive pressure.

Follow-up questions should determine the presence of altered mental status, headache, nausea, vomiting, focal neurologic complaints, or seizures, all of which may suggest intracranial injury. The clinician should also inquire about bloody or clear otorrhea, which may indicate traumatic disruption of the tympanic membrane (TM) and an associated basilar skull fracture.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fever</strong> – Fever is common in minor illnesses, such as uncomplicated otitis media and upper respiratory infection with associated otitis media with effusion (OME). However, fever may indicate complications, such as mastoiditis, meningitis, brain abscess, or malignant otitis externa. In cases with fever, the clinician should ask follow-up questions regarding the presence of headache, neck stiffness, nausea and vomiting, altered mental status, or severe toxicity, which may indicate more serious infections.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nasal congestion</strong> – Most cases of middle ear disease (acute otitis media [AOM] or OME) follow from preceding nasal allergy, infection, or obstruction. In cases with no history of preceding nasal symptoms, middle ear disease becomes substantially less likely [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>].

Cellulitis causes pain, tenderness, and induration, in contrast to local allergic reactions (as with insect bites or poison ivy) or juvenile spring eruption, which typically cause pruritus but little or no pain and tenderness. Fever is sometimes present with cellulitis but is not a feature of allergic reactions. In some instances, the redness and swelling is caused by a retained earring. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83464.html" rel="external">"Foreign bodies of the outer ear (pinna [auricle] and external auditory canal): Diagnosis and management", section on 'Foreign bodies of the pinna (auricle)'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8099.html" rel="external">"An overview of angioedema: Pathogenesis and causes"</a>.)</p><p>Rare cases of perichondritis can be distinguished from cellulitis by the sparing of the ear lobe (which has no cartilage) or by the presence of focal subperichondrial abscesses.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3148.html" rel="external">"Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections of the eye, ear, urinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, and central nervous system", section on 'Perichondritis'</a>.)</p><p>Other causes of redness and swelling of the auricle include sunburn and frostbite, which in most cases will be evident from the history and will frequently involve both ears symmetrically. Minor redness of the ear, especially in the concha, may be seen in cases of otitis externa (see below). However, most cases of simple otitis externa do not lead to swelling or diffuse redness of the auricle. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/179.html" rel="external">"Frostbite: Emergency care and prevention", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6624.html" rel="external">"Sunburn", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with vesicular lesions in the ear canal and pinna, especially with pruritus or burning discomfort to the region, likely have herpes zoster oticus. In some cases, the pruritus, pain, or sensory abnormalities may precede the development of visible skin lesions by several days, so clinicians should consider the diagnosis in older children with hyperesthetic ear discomfort and no visible lesions.

In mastoiditis, the inflammation of the mastoid region behind the ear leads the auricle to protrude outward. Typically, however, the tissue of the auricle itself is normal, with no redness, swelling, or tenderness. Examination of the middle ear and the mastoid region will provide additional clues to the diagnosis.

Patients with a focal area of redness, swelling, and pain in the ear canal likely have furunculosis. Patients with more severe or deep-seated pain, often with fever and usually with a history of immunocompromise, should be evaluated for the rare diagnosis of malignant otitis externa [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. If malignant otitis externa is suspected, a complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), CT scan of the head, and otolaryngology consultation are warranted.

In cases of otitis media associated with facial nerve or inner ear dysfunction, otolaryngology consultation should be pursued to consider possible surgical intervention.
