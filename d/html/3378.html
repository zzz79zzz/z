HPV infection has been etiologically linked with condyloma acuminatum, squamous intraepithelial lesions, and anogenital malignancy, including cervical, vaginal, vulval, penile, and anal carcinoma. </p><p>Many patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, particularly those arising in the base of the tongue and in the tonsillar region, do not have the traditional risk factors associated with head and neck cancers (eg, smoking, smokeless tobacco, alcohol consumption). Epidemiologic and molecular studies have identified the HPV 16 genotype of HPV as a causative agent in many of these patients [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Other high-risk HPV genotypes, such as HPV 18, 31, or 33, are also causative but are less common. These high-risk HPV infections may also rarely cause cancers at other head and neck sites. </p><p>The epidemiology, staging, and clinical presentations of HPV infection in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharyngeal and nonoropharyngeal regions are presented here. Other risk factors for head and neck cancer and the treatment approach to HPV associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3390.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and risk factors for head and neck cancer", section on 'Risk factors'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/115014.html" rel="external">"Treatment of human papillomavirus associated oropharyngeal cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2128117224"><span class="h1">BIOLOGY OF HPV</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HPV are small deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses that are widely distributed in vertebrates. These viruses contain an 8 kilobase long, double-stranded, circular DNA genome. The papillomavirus genome comprises early and late genes that encode early proteins E1-E7 and late proteins L1-L2. The early proteins are nonstructural proteins involved in replication and transcription of the genome (E1-E5) or in host cell tumoral transformation (E6 and E7), whereas L1 and L2 are the structural capsid proteins of the virion.</p><p>The HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes encode proteins consisting of approximately 151 and 98 amino acids, respectively. These genes are largely responsible for the onset and persistence of the malignant process in both head and neck and anogenital cancers. </p><p>The molecular profiles of HPV associated tumors are distinct from those of non-HPV associated cancers. The absence of genetic or epigenetic alterations in the p53 and pRb pathways in HPV associated head and neck cancers is in sharp contrast to what is observed in non-HPV associated head and neck cancer. In the typical non-HPV associated squamous cell carcinomas, p53 mutations are very frequent, along with decreased levels of p16 and increased levels of pRb. By contrast, HPV associated carcinomas are associated with wild-type p53, down regulation of pRb, and upregulation of p16. These differences in gene expression suggest that HPV associated and non-HPV associated head and neck cancers represent distinct entities.</p><p>The virology of HPV and its role in the molecular pathogenesis of malignancy are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8031.html" rel="external">"Virology of human papillomavirus infections and the link to cancer", section on 'Molecular pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13763970"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22893603"><span class="h2">HPV associated cancers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that there has been a decrease in the incidence of laryngeal, hypopharyngeal, and oral cavity cancers beginning in the late 1980s [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. This decline has been associated with the current decrease in smoking, which is the primary risk factor for these cancers.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3839246369"><span class="h3">Oropharyngeal carcinoma</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H224345256"><span class="h4">Incidence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Despite the decrease in tobacco use, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer initially remained constant and then began to rise [<a href="#rid1">1,3,4</a>]. Multiple lines of evidence linked the increase in oropharyngeal cancer to HPV related cancers arising in the base of the tongue and the tonsillar region. </p><p>This association is primarily with HPV 16, which is known to be carcinogenic at other sites [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Initial cohort studies suggested that approximately 50 percent of oropharyngeal cancers were attributable to HPV, while subsequent studies suggest that HPV accounts for 70 to 80 percent of cases in North America and Europe [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Analyses of worldwide cancer statistics from 1983 to 2002 have found a significant increase in the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer in males in developed countries, with disease occurring at younger ages, consistent with a role for HPV [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. </p><p>The timing between exposure to HPV and the development of oropharyngeal cancer probably exceeds 10 years [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. As an example, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort (EPIC) identified 638 individuals with head and neck cancer, for whom plasma samples had been obtained an average of six years prior to diagnosis [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Among the 135 patients with oropharyngeal cancer, antibodies against the E6 antigen were present in 35 percent, in contrast to 0.6 percent of controls. The prevalence of antibodies against E6 was not elevated in patients with other cancers.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H861482549"><span class="h4">Prevalence of HPV infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Oncogenic oral HPV infection is detectable in the majority of patients with HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer, but the incidence of such HPV infection in long-term sexual partners is not increased beyond that seen in the general population.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the general population, a cross-sectional study of males and females aged 14 to 69 years found that the overall prevalence of HPV DNA in oral exfoliated cells was 6.9 percent, and the prevalence of HPV 16 was 1 percent [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. HPV prevalence was approximately three-fold more common in males compared with females (10.1 versus 3.6 percent), consistent with the observed sex distribution for HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study analyzed oral rinse samples for the presence of HPV in patients with HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer and their long-term sexual partners [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. In the 164 patients with oropharyngeal cancer, oral HPV was detected in 65 percent of cases, and an oncogenic HPV strain was identified in 61 percent; 88 of 100 positive for oncogenic HPV had HPV 16. Among the 93 partners available for testing, the overall incidence of HPV infection was 4 percent, and only one had the oncogenic HPV 16. These findings suggest that most partners effectively clear any active infection to which they are exposed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The presence of HPV 16 in the oral cavity has been associated with the subsequent development of oropharyngeal carcinoma. In a case control study of 132 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, mouthwash samples were available from prior prospective collection, obtained a median of 3.9 years prior to the diagnosis of cancer and analyzed for HPV. HPV was identified in 5 of 25 patients (20 percent) who subsequently developed oropharyngeal carcinoma versus 1 of 75 matched controls without cancer (odds ratio [OR] 22.4, 95% CI 1.8-276.7) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3735797819"><span class="h3">Nonoropharyngeal carcinoma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prevalence of HPV infection in nonoropharyngeal sites of head and neck cancer (eg, the hypopharynx, larynx, and oral cavity) is less than that seen in oropharyngeal sites of disease, as demonstrated in observational studies [<a href="#rid14">14-17</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A meta-analysis identified 148 studies, including 12,163 cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The HPV prevalence rates in oropharyngeal, oral cavity, and laryngeal cancers were 46, 24, and 22 percent, respectively, and the prevalence rates of HPV 16 positivity were 41, 15, and 13 percent, respectively.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In one observational study from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) of over 24,000 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (approximately 60 percent oropharyngeal and 40 percent nonoropharyngeal), 63 percent of oropharyngeal cancers were HPV associated, whereas the rates of HPV positivity among oral cavity, laryngeal, and hypopharyngeal cancers were 11, 11, and 17 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p>The prognosis of patients with HPV associated nonoropharyngeal carcinoma is discussed separately. (See <a class="local">'Nonoropharyngeal carcinoma'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H769820056"><span class="h2">HPV vaccination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A nine-valent HPV vaccine is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of HPV associated head and neck cancers, including oropharyngeal cancers, among other indications [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Further details on indications for and administration of HPV vaccinations are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8325.html" rel="external">"Human papillomavirus vaccination"</a>.)</p><p>HPV vaccination has been associated with a decrease in the subsequent prevalence of oral HPV infection [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. As an example, in a population-based study from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2627 males and females aged 18 to 33 years were analyzed for the presence or absence of HPV in oral washes a mean of four years after vaccination [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Based on self-report, 18 percent of the study population had received one or more doses of vaccine. The prevalence of oral infection with HPV types 16, 18, 6, or 11 was 0.11 percent in those who had received vaccine versus 1.61 percent in those who had not been vaccinated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8325.html" rel="external">"Human papillomavirus vaccination", section on 'Oral disease'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H418308675"><span class="h1">CONFIRMING HPV 16 POSITIVITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for p16 is highly sensitive for HPV associated tumors, and we routinely use it as a surrogate for HPV status. If decision-making hinges on HPV status, this diagnosis can be confirmed with either in situ hybridization or polymerase chain reaction (PCR), both of which detect the presence of HPV DNA [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Rare cases of HPV associated lesions arising in the head and neck that are high-grade neuroendocrine tumors (small cell carcinomas) have been described [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3375.html" rel="external">"Pathology of head and neck neoplasms"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4882.html" rel="external">"Extrapulmonary small cell cancer"</a>.)</p><p>Although the gold standard for assessing HPV infection in patients with HPV associated head and neck cancer is in situ hybridization or PCR to detect HPV DNA, several biomarkers may serve as surrogates for HPV status or be useful in further refining the risk associated with HPV infection. Common biomarkers commonly used in clinic include IHC to detect p16 expression and/or real-time PCR (RT-PCR) to measure HPV 16 viral load [<a href="#rid1">1,23,24</a>].</p><p>The p16 protein functions as a tumor suppressor by binding to the cyclin D1 CDK4/CDK6 complex, preventing phosphorylation of the Rb protein. The p16 protein is overexpressed in HPV associated cancers.</p><p>Either HPV status or p16 status can be used as a marker of HPV infection, depending on availability in the treating institution [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. In one study, tumor samples from over 300 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were assessed for both p16 (strong and diffuse, nuclear and cytoplasmic staining in at least 70 percent of tumor cells) and HPV (by in situ hybridization). Ten percent of those positive by p16 were negative for HPV, and 7 percent of those negative for p16 were positive for HPV [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p>The sensitivity of immunostaining for p16 may be lower on fine needle aspirate samples. In one study of 142 cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma that tested positive for HPV by real-time PCR on fine needle aspirate samples, only 33 percent of paired p16 stains met standard thresholds for positivity (had strong and diffuse, nuclear and cytoplasmic staining in at least 70 percent of tumor cells) [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p>The p16 IHC assay is an effective surrogate marker for HPV DNA or RNA status that is associated with improved overall survival (OS) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Testing for both p16 expression and HPV DNA or RNA status may also provide additional information on prognosis [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>]. As an example, in one multicenter observational cohort study, 7654 patients with oropharyngeal tumors were evaluated for both p16 expression and HPV DNA or RNA status. Tumors that were positive for both tests were associated with better OS (five-year OS 81 percent) compared with tumors that had discordant test results (five-year OS 55 percent for those positive for p16 expression and negative for HPV by DNA/RNA; five-year OS 53 percent for those negative for p16 expression and positive for HPV by DNA/RNA) and tumors that were negative for both tests (five-year OS 40 percent for non-HPV associated disease) [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H418308789"><span class="h1">OROPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Oropharyngeal cancer associated with HPV has important differences in its staging and clinicopathologic features compared with oropharyngeal cancer not associated with HPV. These differences have potentially important implications for prognosis and therapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H659582967"><span class="h2">Staging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the eight edition (2017) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC)/American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), separate staging systems were established for HPV associated and non-HPV associated oropharyngeal carcinomas  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110640 graphicRef110641" href="/d/graphic/110640.html" rel="external">table 1A-B</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110659 graphicRef110628" href="/d/graphic/110659.html" rel="external">table 2A-B</a>) [<a href="#rid31">31,32</a>]. The TNM system for HPV associated disease uses p16 positivity as a surrogate for HPV. The previous seventh edition did not distinguish between HPV associated and non-HPV associated disease. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2373414698"><span class="h2">HPV associated versus non-HPV associated staging systems</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The separation of the HPV associated staging system  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110640 graphicRef110641" href="/d/graphic/110640.html" rel="external">table 1A-B</a>) from the non-HPV associated staging system  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110659 graphicRef110628" href="/d/graphic/110659.html" rel="external">table 2A-B</a>) for oropharyngeal carcinoma is based on differences in the outcome of patients with HPV associated disease compared with those with non-HPV associated disease treated in a similar manner. The staging systems reflect the different biology of the two cancers. This approach was based on an alternative staging system that was developed and validated by ICON-S [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. </p><p>The ICON-S study included 1907 patients with HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer (by p16 staining or in situ hybridization) and 696 with non-HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer. The patients with HPV associated disease were divided into a training cohort of 661 patients at one site to develop a new staging system and 1246 at six other centers to validate these results.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In an analysis from this database, the prognostic utility of the UICC/AJCC 2010 TNM system was applicable only to those with non-HPV associated disease:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with HPV associated disease, there were no statistically significant differences in overall survival for patients with stage I, II, III, and IVA disease (five-year rates 88, 82, 84, and 81 percent, respectively), although it was significantly lower for those with stage IVB disease (60 percent). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In contrast, for the 696 patients with non-HPV associated disease, prognosis worsened with increasing stage of disease.

The most extensive data come from an analysis by the International Collaboration on Oropharyngeal Cancer Network for Staging (ICON-S), which included data from 1907 patients with HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer and 696 with non-HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Age at diagnosis</strong> – Patients with HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer are relatively younger than patients with non-HPV associated disease [<a href="#rid5">5-7,33-35</a>], although the incidence is increasing in older adults [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. In the ICON-S database, the median age for those with HPV associated disease was 57 years versus 61 years in those with non-HPV associated disease [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. This difference in patient age, along with differences in comorbidity due to the decreased incidence of tobacco and alcohol excess, has major implications for the ability to tolerate treatment, which can in turn affect the prognosis. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sex</strong> – There is a heavy preponderance of male patients in those with HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer. In the ICON-S database, 84 percent of patients were male; among those with non-HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer, 76 percent were male [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The male:female ratio has been somewhat less in other studies, although male sex still predominates.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anatomic location</strong> – HPV associated tumors predominantly arise in the tonsillar region, the base of the tongue, or soft palate [<a href="#rid37">37</a>], although a small percentage of tumors at other sites are also HPV associated. Why the oropharynx is more susceptible than other head and neck sites to HPV transformation is unclear. Like uterine cervix, the oropharynx offers easy access for infection. The tonsils contain deep invaginations of the mucosal surface believed to favor the capture and processing of antigens, which may facilitate viral access to basal cells.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Exposures</strong> –<strong> </strong>In contrast to patients with non-HPV associated disease, patients with HPV associated disease are less likely to smoke tobacco or drink alcohol. However, a greater number of sexual partners and/or higher frequency of oral sex may increase the risk of developing HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer [<a href="#rid5">5,38</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Risk subgroup identification'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Presenting signs</strong> – The most common presenting sign for HPV related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is an asymptomatic neck mass typically related to cervical lymph node involvement, rather than other signs or symptoms related to the primary tumor in the oropharynx [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Further details of other signs and symptoms related to oropharyngeal tumors are discussed separately.

The decrease in second malignancies included a history of prior tumors, synchronous lesions, and metachronous second primary lesions (11 versus 20, 1 versus 9, and 6 versus 13 percent, respectively).
