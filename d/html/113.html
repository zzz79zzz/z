Gender development and the continuum of gender are discussed separately.

Formation of sexual identify among youth often is fluid; some youth experiment with same-gender sexual contacts as part of healthy adolescent development. Heterosexual youth may experiment with same-gender sexual partners. Gay or lesbian youth may have different-gender sexual partners. Either group may abstain from sexual activity altogether. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90691.html" rel="external">"Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and other sexual minoritized youth: Epidemiology and health concerns", section on 'Developmental perspective'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1726874219"><span class="h1">PARADIGM OF SEXUALITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Human sexuality is an essential part of human development and the human experience. Developing sexuality encompasses complex interactions between gender and sexuality  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50053" href="/z/d/graphic/50053.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). It involves interactions between chromosomes, anatomy, hormones, and physiology; psychology; interpersonal relationships; and sociocultural influences [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].

Sexual curiosity and exploration may lead to initiating sexual experimentation with masturbation or early sexual activity with same- or different-gender sexual partners.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Middle adolescence (ages 15 to 18)</strong> – Middle adolescents complete the physical changes of puberty. Middle and late adolescents might have patterns of romantic relationships characterized by serial monogamy or having several partners at once and over brief periods of time. Middle adolescents can begin to imagine the consequences of their actions but still may not fully understand them and, because of this, engage in risk-taking behaviors such as substance use and unprotected sexual activity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Late adolescence (ages 18 and up)</strong> – Late adolescents have more mature social skills, empathy, and an understanding of risks and consequences that help them develop more intimate and serious relationships. They have a more mature understanding and enjoyment of their physical self, gender role, sexual orientation, and sexual behaviors. They can participate in a variety of intimate and social relationships (romantic partners, friends, family, professional colleagues) with a broader sense of connection and purpose in the community.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H213552393"><span class="h2">Development of sexuality</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Sexual development occurs in the context of many other aspects of identity formation and human development. One of the tasks for healthy adolescent development is the acquisition of a mature and responsible sexual identity including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An understanding of their particular interests and behaviors.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An understanding of which activities promote positive sexual experiences for themselves and others.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Active expression of sexual behaviors with themselves and others.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The capacity for meaningful intimate (romantic, sexual, other) relationships (eg, choosing caring and respectful partners, understanding the role of consent and body autonomy, informed decision-making about prevention of sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy, and engaging in sex that is pleasurable and life affirming).</p><p></p><p>Adolescents or young adults who are mature and healthy in their sexuality are able to [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identify and live according to their values; take responsibility for their behavior.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Practice effective decision-making; develop critical-thinking skills.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Affirm that human development includes sexual development, which may or may not include sexual experience or reproduction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Seek further information about sexuality and reproduction as needed and make informed choices about family options and relationships.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Interact with all genders in respectful and appropriate ways.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Affirm their gender identity and sexual orientation and respect the gender identities and sexual orientations of others.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Appreciate their body and enjoy their sexuality throughout life, expressing their sexuality in ways that are congruent with their values.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Express love and intimacy in appropriate ways.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Develop and maintain meaningful relationships, avoiding exploitative or manipulative relationships.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Exhibit skills and communication that enhance personal relationships with family, peers, and romantic partners.</p><p></p><p>Development of sexuality may be more complicated for sexual minoritized persons (eg, lesbian, gay, bisexual) and gender-diverse youth. The individual youth is the best person to describe and define their sexual and gender identity and behaviors. Many youth refuse categorization, self-identifying with more diffuse terminology regarding gender and sexuality (eg, gender queer, queer, pansexual, fluid). What matters for most youth is that the provider asks about their personal perspective, experience, and what terminology best suits their needs.</p><p>Problems may arise for adolescents who encounter conflict between their emerging sexuality and the approach to sexuality that is imposed by families, peers, culture, and society as a whole. Role modeling, sex education, and other information for developing adolescents often has a heterosexual and cisgender focus; being gay, lesbian, bisexual, or gender diverse may be considered a social or religious taboo. These issues are discussed separately.
