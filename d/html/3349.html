While episodic tension-type headache (TTH) is the most frequent headache type in population-based studies, migraine is the most common headache diagnosis in patients presenting to both primary care and most specialty physicians.</p><p>Cluster headache typically leads to significant disability and most of these patients will come to medical attention. However, cluster headache remains an uncommon diagnosis in primary care settings because of overall low prevalence in the general population (&lt;1 percent).</p><p>The epidemiology of these headaches is reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3348.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults", section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3326.html" rel="external">"Cluster headache: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3357.html" rel="external">"Tension-type headache in adults: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Clinicians can easily become familiar with the most common primary headache disorders and how to distinguish them, as summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68064" href="/z/d/graphic/68064.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1294899476"><span class="h2">Migraine</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Migraine is a disorder of recurrent attacks. The headache of migraine is often but not always unilateral and tends to have a throbbing or pulsatile quality. Accompanying features may include nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia, or osmophobia during attacks  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50876" href="/z/d/graphic/50876.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3348.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Migraine trigger factors  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57424" href="/z/d/graphic/57424.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) may include stress, changes in estrogen levels, visual stimuli, weather changes, nitrates, fasting, wine, sleep disturbances, and aspartame, among others. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3348.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults", section on 'Precipitating and exacerbating factors'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1294899532"><span class="h2">Tension-type headache</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The typical presentation of a TTH attack is that of a mild to moderate intensity, bilateral, nonthrobbing headache without other associated features  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79672" href="/z/d/graphic/79672.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). Discomfort may also frequently involve the neck and jaw. Pure TTH is a rather featureless headache. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3357.html" rel="external">"Tension-type headache in adults: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1294899586"><span class="h2">Cluster headache</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cluster headache is the most common subtype of the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65541" href="/z/d/graphic/65541.html" rel="external">table 5</a>), a group of primary headaches which involve unilateral, often severe headache attacks and ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80843" href="/z/d/graphic/80843.html" rel="external">table 6</a>). Unilateral autonomic symptoms are ipsilateral to the pain and may include ptosis, miosis, lacrimation, conjunctival injection, rhinorrhea, periorbital edema, facial sweating, and nasal congestion. Restlessness can also be a typical feature of a cluster headache attack. Attacks usually last 15 to 180 minutes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3326.html" rel="external">"Cluster headache: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>Cluster headache may sometimes be confused with a life-threatening headache since the pain from a cluster headache can reach full intensity within minutes. However, cluster headache is transient and recurrent, with episodes resolving spontaneously within three hours.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1639554284"><span class="h2">Secondary headache</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A headache caused by an identifiable underlying condition is termed a secondary headache [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Clinicians who evaluate patients with headache should be alert to signs that suggest a serious underlying disorder [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Danger signs'</a> below.)</p><p>In the Brazilian primary care study, 39 percent of patients presenting with headache had a headache that was due to a systemic disorder (most commonly fever, acute hypertension, and sinusitis), and 5 percent had a headache that was due to a neurologic disorder (most commonly posttraumatic headache, headaches secondary to cervical spine disease, and expansive intracranial processes) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The appropriate evaluation of headache complaints includes the following [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rule out serious underlying pathology and look for other secondary causes of headache  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107496" href="/z/d/graphic/107496.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef141075" href="/z/d/graphic/141075.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef141069" href="/z/d/graphic/141069.html" rel="external">table 7</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Determine the type of primary headache using the patient history as the primary diagnostic tool  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68064" href="/z/d/graphic/68064.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). There may be overlap in symptoms, particularly between migraine and tension-type headache (TTH) and between migraine and some secondary causes of headache such as sinus disease. A headache diary can be helpful in further clarifying the headache diagnosis, the frequency of headache, potential triggers, and the disability from the headache [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p>A systematic case history is the single most important factor in establishing a headache diagnosis and determining the future work-up and treatment plan.

Likewise, danger signs (ie, red flags) should prompt further evaluation, as discussed in the sections below. (See <a class="local">'Danger signs'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H880515100"><span class="h4">Features suggesting migraine</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common headache syndromes frequently present with characteristic symptoms  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68064" href="/z/d/graphic/68064.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). However, there may be considerable symptom overlap; one population-based survey found that less than one-half of patients who complained of headaches that met criteria for migraine were properly diagnosed [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Migraine symptoms may also overlap with other causes of headache. As an example, a significant number of patients with migraine may have nasal symptoms that suggest sinus disease [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]; in addition, a study of primary care patients with recurrent sinus headache found that 90 percent experienced attacks that met the International Headache Society criteria for migraine [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Sinus symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>Given these pitfalls, a number of diagnostic instruments have been proposed, mainly to assist with the diagnosis of migraine, the most common primary headache syndrome in patients presenting to primary care physicians. One such instrument (ID Migraine) preselects eligible subjects as those who had two or more headaches in the previous three months and indicated either that they might want to speak with a health care professional about their headaches or that they experienced a headache that limited their ability to work, study, or enjoy life [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The screen employs three questions:</p><p>During the last three months, did you have the following with your headaches?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>P</strong>hotophobia – Did light bother you (a lot more than when you do not have headaches)?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>I</strong>ncapacity – Did your headaches limit your ability to work, study, or do what you needed to do for at least one day?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>N</strong>ausea – Did you feel nauseated or sick to your stomach?</p><p></p><p>The mnemonic <strong>PIN</strong> is a reminder of the questions used in the ID Migraine screen that can help identify migraine.
