While nonoperative management is acceptable in the short term for oligosymptomatic groin hernias, the majority will require surgery due to progression of symptoms or concern for incarceration or strangulation [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Worldwide, 20 million patients undergo groin hernia repair every year [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. A number of surgical options exist, including open suture (tissue) repair, open mesh repair, and laparoscopic mesh repair. Robotic, also referred to as robotic assisted laparoscopic (RAL), repair has evolved as another surgical approach. The first reported robotic inguinal hernia repairs were described in 2007 by urologists who repaired inguinal hernias at the time of robotic prostatectomy [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Since that time, robotic groin hernia repair has grown steadily; as an example, the use of robotic surgery for inguinal hernia repair increased from 0.7 to 28.8 percent from 2012 through 2018 according to data from the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. In a retrospective review of United States Medicare claims, the use of robotics for groin hernia repair increased from 2 percent in 2010 to 3.9 percent in 2017. Patients undergoing robotic surgery were older and had more comorbidities than those undergoing laparoscopic surgery, suggesting that robotics is being used in more challenging clinical situations [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>The indications, contraindications, techniques, and outcomes of robotic groin hernia repair are discussed here. The clinical features and diagnosis of a groin hernia, the technical details of performing an open or laparoscopic groin hernia repair and how to choose between the two techniques, the complications of groin hernia repair, and the treatment of recurrent groin hernias in adults are discussed in other topics:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3686.html" rel="external">"Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis of inguinal and femoral hernias in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3687.html" rel="external">"Overview of treatment for inguinal and femoral hernia in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3690.html" rel="external">"Open surgical repair of inguinal and femoral hernia in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3692.html" rel="external">"Laparoscopic inguinal and femoral hernia repair in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89384.html" rel="external">"Complications of inguinal and femoral hernia repair"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15099.html" rel="external">"Recurrent inguinal and femoral hernia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2103456138"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1833561539"><span class="h2">Primary hernia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, groin hernias should be repaired when they are clinically apparent (ie, noted on clinical examination) <strong>and</strong> causing patient symptoms, including discomfort, pain, or affecting activities of daily living. For asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic hernias, surgical repair, as opposed to expectant management (eg, watchful waiting or initial nonoperative management), should be based upon shared decision making between the patient and their health care provider. The indications for surgical repair of groin hernias are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3687.html" rel="external">"Overview of treatment for inguinal and femoral hernia in adults", section on 'Inguinal hernia'</a>.) </p><p>Rates of recurrence are similar between the open and laparoscopic approaches [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. Surgeons should choose the approach with which they are most comfortable and most experienced. For surgeons who are equally facile with both open and minimally invasive repairs, a minimally invasive approach should be considered, particularly for patients with obesity, patients at increased risk for surgical site infection (eg, diabetic patients, immunocompromised patients, smokers), and patients with recurrence from a prior open repair, bilateral hernias, or femoral/obturator hernias [<a href="#rid7">7,9</a>]. In women with groin hernias, a minimally invasive approach may be preferred because of the higher rates of femoral hernias, which may be missed during an open repair. Given the added costs associated with minimally invasive repair, consideration should be given to open mesh repair for low-risk patients undergoing the initial repair of a unilateral groin hernia. While the risk is small, minimally invasive groin hernia repair carries a risk of vascular and visceral injury that is less common when using an open approach [<a href="#rid7">7,10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3687.html" rel="external">"Overview of treatment for inguinal and femoral hernia in adults", section on 'Inguinal hernia'</a>.)</p><p>Given the data currently available of all minimally invasive groin hernia repairs being equal, the choice between laparoscopic and robotic repair should be made based upon surgeon expertise, availability of equipment, and surgeon/patient preference (again, shared decision making). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H309996147"><span class="h2">Occult contralateral hernia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Occult groin hernias are hernias only seen on radiographic imaging or noted at the time of operation but not apparent on clinical examination. An occult contralateral hernia may be identified at the time of robotic or laparoscopic unilateral groin hernia. Approximately 16 percent of patients undergoing robotic inguinal hernia repair were found to have an incidental contralateral inguinal hernia [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. </p><p>At this time, some surgeons routinely repair a contralateral occult hernia if identified, and others repair only symptomatic hernias. We believe that either approach is acceptable, so long as the patient is involved in the decision-making process up front. (See <a class="local">'Preoperative preparation'</a> below.)</p><p>There is limited evidence as to whether occult groin hernias should be repaired at the time of initial operation. The advantages of repairing an incidentally diagnosed occult contralateral groin hernia are to prevent hernia-related symptoms in the future and reduce resource utilization through fewer hospital visits, operations, and less time away from work. The disadvantages of this approach include the potential complications associated with groin hernia surgery, such as chronic groin pain. It is unclear how often contralateral occult hernias become symptomatic, but it is known that up to 25 percent of hernias repaired using a minimally invasive technique develop chronic pain [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3631185947"><span class="h1">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The only absolute contraindication for robotic groin hernia surgery is patient intolerance to general anesthesia and/or pneumoperitoneum. While an open groin hernia repair can be performed under local anesthesia with sedation, robotic repair requires general anesthesia in order to establish pneumoperitoneum. Patients with certain cardiopulmonary conditions may not tolerate pneumoperitoneum.</p><p>Relative contraindications for robotic groin hernia surgery are related to anatomical factors of the hernia or comorbid conditions of the patient and include (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3687.html" rel="external">"Overview of treatment for inguinal and femoral hernia in adults", section on 'Noncandidates for laparoscopic repair'</a>): </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prior pelvic surgery. The level of surgeon experience should be taken into account before undertaking robotic groin hernia repair in patients who have a history of pelvic surgery, including prostatectomy, bladder surgery, kidney transplantation, and a prior laparoscopic or robotic groin hernia repair. With the robotic approach, the abdominal wall and hernia defect are approached posteriorly (dorsum) with placement of mesh in the preperitoneal/transversalis fascial space. Such tissue planes are more likely to have been obliterated or made inaccessible by prior pelvic surgery. A history of pelvic radiation is similarly a relative contraindication for robotic groin hernia repair for the same reason. For less experienced surgeons, it may be more prudent to perform the surgery from an open anterior (ventral) approach in patients with prior pelvic surgery or radiation, where the tissue planes are less likely to be scarred or damaged.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cirrhosis with collateral circulation and/or ascites. While cirrhosis in itself in not necessarily a contraindication to minimally invasive approach, violation of the peritoneum should be avoided in patients with ascites. In addition, among patients with periumbilical collateral circulation (eg, caput medusa), there may be an increased risk for bleeding with port placement. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Large scrotal hernias defined as &gt;3 cm. Hernias that significantly extend into the scrotum can be challenging to repair. This contraindication is applicable to both totally extraperitoneal (TEP) and transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair, although some surgeons believe TAPP repair is more amenable to minimally invasive repair of large scrotal hernias due to the increased working space and improved maneuverability. Risks include conversion to open, injury to cord structures, and an incomplete hernia sac dissection. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Strangulated or incarcerated hernias. We suggest open repair of strangulated or acutely incarcerated groin hernias. In these cases where contamination is likely, minimally invasive repair with synthetic mesh has not yet been proven to be safe. In addition, while a minimally invasive approach may be appropriate depending on level of surgeon comfort, not all hospitals can accommodate robotic surgery for emergency cases. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H215938423"><span class="h1">PREOPERATIVE PREPARATION</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Obtain informed consent that stipulates whether or not to repair a contralateral occult groin hernia if identified. (See <a class="local">'Occult contralateral hernia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prophylactic antibiotics should be administered prior to skin incision  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65369" href="/d/graphic/65369.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4043.html" rel="external">"Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>How to decompress the bladder is at the surgeon's discretion. While the patient can simply be asked to void right before the start of straightforward cases, consideration should be given to placement of a Foley catheter when a higher level of complexity is anticipated (such as scrotal hernias or cases where part of the bladder is within the hernia sac). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3692.html" rel="external">"Laparoscopic inguinal and femoral hernia repair in adults", section on 'Preoperative evaluation and preparation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In order to reduce operating room costs for robotic cases, attention should be paid to eliminating all unnecessary disposable equipment. For example, disposable trocars, the suction-irrigator, and the vessel sealer should be available but only opened on a case-by-case basis. Likewise, robotic groin hernia repair can easily be performed with three robotic instruments (scissors connected to monopolar cautery, needle driver, and grasper) and, in some experienced hands, only two (scissored needle driver and grasper), thereby limiting the charges associated with the use of each robotic instrument. (See <a class="local">'Cost'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H687334583"><span class="h1">SURGICAL TECHNIQUES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In minimally invasive groin hernia surgery approached either laparoscopically or robotically, placement of mesh is an essential step. While repair of the defect using sutures only may be feasible in certain cases, this technique is not widely adopted or accepted. Two different laparoscopic approaches are available for repair of groin hernias, including the totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair and the transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair. The TAPP hernia repair is the technique most commonly utilized in conjunction with the robot; robotic TEP repairs are currently being explored as a possible alternative approach to groin hernia repair. (See <a class="local">'Total extraperitoneal (TEP) robotic groin hernia repair'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1599603657"><span class="h2">Our standard technique</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our technique of robotic TAPP groin hernia repair is presented in detail below  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef121187" href="/d/graphic/121187.html" rel="external">movie 1</a>). Variants to the standard technique and other controversial issues are discussed in the following section. (See <a class="local">'Variant techniques and special considerations'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient positioning – Patients should be positioned supine with both arms thoroughly padded and tucked at the sides. Following port placement, Trendelenburg positioning will provide enhanced access to the inguinal spaces. Depending on room setup, angling of the bed may facilitate docking of the robot. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Initial abdominal entry may be accomplished either by Veress needle, direct Hasson open cutdown, or optical trocar. Selection of entry technique is dependent upon surgeon preference. Our preference is entry in the upper quadrant with an optical trocar. Insufflation of the abdominal cavity and visualization of the peritoneal space upon introduction of a laparoscope confirm adequate initial port placement. Pneumoperitoneum should be maintained at 15 mmHg but can be decreased later in the case to facilitate closure of the hernia defect or peritoneal flap.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Port placement – Traditional port placement includes one periumbilical port and one port on either side, spaced at least 5 to 10 cm apart and 15 to 20 cm from the operative field  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121186" href="/d/graphic/121186.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Our preference is to place all ports off midline to minimize risk for port site hernias. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Docking of the robot – Positioning of the robotic system depends on room setup and the type of platform being utilized. Side docking in parallel or perpendicular is generally used  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef121180" href="/d/graphic/121180.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). However, the robot can also be docked in between the legs with the patient in lithotomy position if the room is more amenable to this setup. Docking from either the right or left side of the patient allows for bilateral access and should be chosen based on room setup rather than laterality of the hernia. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identification of hernia defect – Inspect bilateral inguinal and femoral orifices for defects. One advantage of robotic groin hernia repair is the ability to visually confirm the presence of a hernia before initiating repair.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Opening of peritoneum/transversalis fascia – The peritoneum/transversalis fascia is opened using scissors or electrocautery from the anterior superior iliac spine to the median umbilical ligament below the arcuate line or about 7 cm cephalad to the pubis  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef121187" href="/d/graphic/121187.html" rel="external">movie 1</a>). Care should be taken to identify the inferior epigastric vessels and avoid injury. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identification of Cooper's ligament – Medial dissection within this space will expose Cooper's ligament. This dissection should continue inferiorly between Cooper's ligament and the bladder to create enough space for mesh placement. In addition, the space between Cooper's ligament and the iliac vein should also be exposed in order to rule out a femoral hernia  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70359" href="/d/graphic/70359.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). For large direct defects, extend the dissection to the contralateral Cooper's ligament in order to create enough space for adequate mesh coverage. Care should be taken to avoid the corona mortis if identified. This is a venous or arterial connection between the obturator and external iliac or inferior epigastric vessels. It is typically located behind the superior pubic ramus in the retropubic space and is present in about 50 percent of people [<a href="#rid1">1,13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dissection of the hernia sac off of the cord structures – For indirect hernias, careful dissection of the hernia sac, typically anterior medial, off of the cord structures is undertaken. Compete dissection of the peritoneum is essential to avoid recurrence and folding of the inferior edge of the mesh. Care should be taken to identify and preserve the vas deferens  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70359" href="/d/graphic/70359.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Cord lipomas, typically lateral, should be completely reduced, even if they initially appear small. In women, division of the round ligament is acceptable and may facilitate mesh placement. However, if this is undertaken, the round ligament should be divided at the level of the peritoneum to avoid injury to the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve. In addition, care should be taken to ensure hemostasis as the artery of Sampson runs just underneath the round ligament. It should also be noted that concerns have been raised about uterine prolapse as a long-term complication of bilateral round ligament division during inguinal or femoral herniorrhaphy. However, this concern is theoretical and has not been studied. Both authors prefer to preserve the round ligament but will divide it if this optimizes the dissection or facilitates mesh placement.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For large direct inguinal hernia defects (&gt;3 cm in size), our preference is to close the defect with running a 2-0 barbed suture, which can also be used to secure the mesh [<a href="#rid14">14-16</a>]. However, this is controversial. In order to facilitate closure of the hernia defect, surgeons have the option of reducing the insufflation pressure to 8 to 10 mmHg. (See <a class="local">'Primary closure of direct defect'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Confirm a critical view of the myopectineal orifice  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef121182" href="/d/graphic/121182.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). The components of this critical view include [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Cooper's ligament, 2 cm inferior to the ligament, and the area between Cooper's and the iliac vein. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Peritoneum cleared off of the cord structures to the psoas muscle; ensure that there is no tugging of the cord when the peritoneal flap is lifted and no remaining tail of an indirect sac. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Reduction of cord lipomas if applicable. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lateral dissection of the peritoneum to the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) with space sufficient to accommodate a piece of mesh at least 10 x 15 cm.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Document clearance of the myopectineal orifice in the operative note.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Placement of mesh – Mesh should adequately cover all hernia defects with medial overlap of the pubic tubercle and Cooper's ligament, lateral coverage to the ASIS, and a posterior (dorsal) edge that is in line with the widely dissected peritoneal reflection. A piece of mesh at least 10 x 15 cm in size is required. However, use of a larger piece (16 x 20 cm) should be considered in patients with large direct defects or multiple defects. One author of this topic prefers self-fixating mesh because placement is faster and does not require suture fixation.

Care should be taken to avoid placement of sutures or tacks particularly below the iliopubic tract, due to the risk of nerve entrapment (ie, triangle of pain  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70359" href="/d/graphic/70359.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>)). </p><p>To date, no clinical trials on mesh fixation during robotic groin hernia repair have been published. A systematic review on fixation of mesh for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair demonstrated no differences in recurrence or surgical site infection [<a href="#rid21">21-24</a>] regardless of technique. Trials that looked at different mesh fixation techniques and the development of chronic pain or quality of life have been equivocal, and, therefore, no conclusions or recommendations have been made. However, the HerniaSurge group cautions against nonfixation for larger medial defects (direct hernia defects &gt;3 cm), citing the high recurrence risk and lack of data on this specific subgroup of inguinal hernias [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].

Any time there is concern for bowel injury, a diligent effort should be undertaken to identify the area of concern, to definitively prove or disprove injury, and to repair any injury if needed. The bowel injury can be identified and repaired through an open, laparoscopic, or robotic approach based upon surgeon experience and comfort. </p><p>If a bowel injury occurs, the resulting contamination will raise concern about the risks associated with placement of mesh. No high-quality evidence is available to guide the decision making; however, considerations in this case include the approach to repair (no repair, open repair, laparoscopic repair, or robotic repair) and repair technique (suture repair, synthetic mesh, or biologic/bioabsorbable mesh). The most conservative options would include no repair (ie, repair bowel injury and return another day to repair the groin hernia) or open suture repair. The most aggressive options would include laparoscopic or robotic repair with mesh. The decision should be based upon the injury, degree of contamination, complexity of the hernia, and surgeon comfort in this setting. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1629129233"><span class="h1">EVOLVING TECHNIQUES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1944262544"><span class="h2">Total extraperitoneal (TEP) robotic groin hernia repair</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The TEP technique is often employed for laparoscopic repairs and is now being adapted for robotic surgery. In this approach, the repair is completed without entering the peritoneal cavity. In brief, the TEP repair involves the use of a balloon dissector to open the preperitoneal space, insufflation to maintain this space, identification of the anatomical landmarks described above, and, lastly, placement of a large piece of mesh. Inadvertent tears in the peritoneum will require repair in order to maintain adequate working space and may require conversion to a transperitoneal approach. Laparoscopically, this approach is associated with a lengthy learning curve. However, robotic surgery may alleviate this issue somewhat as it allows for wristed movements and improved visualization.

The use of robotic repair increased from 0.24 percent in 2008 to 19.6 percent in 2019, commensurate with a decrease in complication rate (20.8 percent in 2008 to 3.5 percent in 2019) and a decrease in operative time, suggesting that utilization and outcomes may improve with progression along the learning curve.</p><p></p><p>In other comparative studies with open or laparoscopic repairs, robotic groin hernia surgery is generally associated with longer or similar operating room time; similar length of hospital stay; and similar 30 day complications, readmissions, and office visits  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121183" href="/d/graphic/121183.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). A retrospective analysis looked at recurrence rates for laparoscopic versus robotic repairs over an eight-year period and found lower recurrences (0.8 versus 2.9 percent, p = 0.013) and a longer recurrence-free time (99.7 versus 97.6 months) for robotic repairs [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Prospective data on the clinically important outcomes of long-term hernia recurrence rate and post-herniorrhaphy neuralgia rate are not yet available.
