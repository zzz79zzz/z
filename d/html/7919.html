Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) is a common transfusion reaction in which pulmonary edema develops primarily due to volume excess or circulatory overload. </p><p>TACO typically occurs in patients who receive a large volume of a transfused product over a short period of time, especially those with underlying cardiovascular or kidney disease. It is important to report suspected cases of TACO to the transfusion service as a transfusion reaction. (See <a class="local">'Reporting'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic reviews the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, management, and prevention of TACO.</p><p>A general approach to a suspected transfusion reaction, as well as other specific reactions, are presented in detail separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>General approach – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/95132.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with a suspected acute transfusion reaction"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7926.html" rel="external">"Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hemolytic reactions – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7932.html" rel="external">"Hemolytic transfusion reactions"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Febrile nonhemolytic reactions (FNHTR) – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7947.html" rel="external">"Immunologic transfusion reactions", section on 'Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Immunologic/allergic reactions – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7947.html" rel="external">"Immunologic transfusion reactions"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sepsis – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3805.html" rel="external">"Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Air embolism – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8263.html" rel="external">"Air embolism"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (ta-GVHD) – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7928.html" rel="external">"Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Transfusional iron overload – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7157.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with suspected iron overload", section on 'Transfusional iron overload'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H211553305"><span class="h1">DEFINITION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Guidelines for the evaluation of transfusion reactions including TACO have been published by the International Society for Blood Transfusion (ISBT), the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) of the British Society for Haematology, and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Biovigilance Network. However, there is no uniformly accepted set of diagnostic criteria for TACO [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>].</p><p>Most classification schemes require the development of a set of signs and symptoms to occur within 12 hours of transfusion. The ISBT and Biovigilance Network in the United States allow for symptoms up to 12 hours after the end of the transfusion [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. The exact number and set of signs and symptoms varies between definitions. </p><p>Criteria from the Biovigilance Network in the United States were revised in 2021 and include the following definitions [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Definitive TACO</strong> – New onset or exacerbation of three or more of the following within 12 hours of the end of a transfusion without another explanation:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Respiratory distress (acute or worsening)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Evidence of pulmonary edema on examination or radiographs</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Elevated brain natriuretic protein (BNP) or N-terminal pro-hormone BNP (NT-pro BNP)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Other unexplained cardiovascular changes (elevated central venous pressure)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Probable TACO</strong> – Findings as above, with transfusion as a likely contributor but the individual received other fluids as well or has a history of cardiac disease that could explain the findings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Possible TACO</strong> – Findings as above but preexisting cardiac disease is a more likely explanation than the transfusion.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3033979829"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H171684383"><span class="h2">Risk factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>TACO is a form of circulatory volume overload that can occur in any individual and with transfusion of any blood component (eg, red blood cells [RBCs], platelets, plasma components such as Fresh Frozen Plasma [FFP], Cryoprecipitate). </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient-related risk factors</strong> – Patient risk factors include pre-existing cardiac and possibly kidney dysfunction [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Small stature, low body weight, extremes of age (eg, &lt;3 years, &gt;60 years), and hypoalbuminemia have also been suggested as TACO risk factors [<a href="#rid4">4-7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The contribution of patient factors was illustrated in a 2014 retrospective Medicare database review of over 2 million transfusion admissions that included 1340 cases of TACO [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The following patient characteristics were associated with a greater odds ratio (OR) for TACO after adjustment for confounding variables:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Age – OR 2.08 for age ≥85 years (compared with the reference population age 65 to 69)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>History of heart failure – OR 1.61</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Female sex – OR 1.40</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>White race – OR 1.38</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>History of chronic pulmonary disease – OR 1.19</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Transfusion rate and volume</strong> – The volume transfused and rate of administration correlate with the risk of TACO, making TACO less likely with Cryoprecipitate than with FFP [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The risk of TACO in the above study also correlated with the number of units of blood products transfused [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Two to four units – OR 2.00</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Five to nine units – OR 3.10</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>More than nine units – OR 3.55</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2205057343"><span class="h2">Etiology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The etiology of TACO is likely multifactorial, with the majority of patients who experience TACO often receiving large quantities of fluid prior to the transfusion (eg, hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients). In a small study evaluating N-terminal pro-hormone BNP (NT-pro BNP), 94 percent of patients with TACO had a significantly elevated NT-pro-BNP even prior to the blood transfusion [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>In a 2013 case-control study involving 83 patients with TACO in the medical intensive care unit (ICU), positive fluid balance, larger amount of plasma transfused, and faster blood product infusion rate were associated with an increased likelihood of TACO [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. This informs prevention strategies including slower rates of infusion and diuresis. (See <a class="local">'Prevention'</a> below.)</p><p>In 2019, an animal model study suggested that TACO might be a "two hit" transfusion reaction, with the first hit being volume incompliance (from cardiac or kidney disease) and the second hit being a blood transfusion [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In the study, TACO, characterized by an increase in pulmonary hydrostatic pressure, developed only in volume-incompliant animals following RBC transfusion, not crystalloid infusion. Identifying ways in which the impact of RBCs differs from other fluids, and whether this difference holds as well for platelet and plasma components, may further elucidate TACO pathophysiology. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4119079486"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The true frequency of TACO is difficult to assess due to the lack of a highly sensitive and specific clinical parameter or laboratory test. In addition, under-reporting of TACO is likely, as mild respiratory distress that resolves with diuresis may not be reported to the transfusion medicine service or blood bank [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>Overall, TACO is estimated to occur in 1 percent or more of transfused individuals. The frequency appears to be higher in hospitalized patients, especially those in the intensive care unit (ICU). </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Any transfusions</strong> – A single-center study evaluating transfusion reaction reports found the prevalence of TACO to be 0.2 percent (102 cases of TACO in 56,208 transfused patients) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inpatient transfusions</strong> – In the 2014 retrospective claims-based study of Medicare inpatients mentioned above (see <a class="local">'Risk factors'</a> above), the rate of TACO was 0.6 percent (1340 cases from among 2,147,038 inpatient transfusions), equivalent to an overall rate of 62.4 per 100,000 hospital stays [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ICU transfusions</strong> – Rates of TACO are highest in the most acutely ill patients. In a study of TACO in a medical ICU, TACO was observed in 51 of 901 patients who received a transfusion (6 percent) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Perioperative</strong> – Perioperative series have reported rates in the range of 1 to 4 percent [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. </p><p></p><p>Rates of TACO do not appear to vary with the sex of the transfusion recipient, although this has not been studied rigorously and the rate was slightly higher in females than males in the study discussed above [<a href="#rid6">6,14</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Pathophysiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>TACO has been reported to be a major contributing factor in mortality from transfusion [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. A study from the Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) reporting system in the United Kingdom suggests that either the incidence of TACO, or, more likely, the recognition and reporting of TACO, has been increasing over time [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. From 2007 to 2022, reports of TACO increased steadily. In 2022 in the United Kingdom, TACO was the most common transfusion reaction associated with mortality (eight cases) and major morbidity (25 cases) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. </p><p>Other data indicate that patients with TACO have extended lengths of stay in hospitals and intensive care units [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Data from the United States have demonstrated TACO to be the most common cause of death from a transfusion; in 2021, TACO accounted for 36 percent of deaths, versus 16 percent from TRALI and lower percentages from other transfusion reactions [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/95132.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with a suspected acute transfusion reaction", section on 'Frequency of reactions'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/95132.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with a suspected acute transfusion reaction", section on 'Mortality'</a>.)</p><p>The under-reporting of TACO was demonstrated in an analysis that compared a retrospective review of passively reported TACO cases over an eight-year period at a tertiary hospital with a one-month active surveillance period at the same institution [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. By passive reporting, the prevalence of TACO was 1 in 1566 plasma transfusions (0.06 percent); in comparison, by active surveillance, TACO occurred in 4 of 84 patients (4.8 percent), none of which were reported to the blood bank.</p><p>Compared with other transfusion reactions, TACO is less common than allergic and febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR) but more common than anaphylaxis, acute hemolytic transfusion reactions (AHTR), or transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). In a 2014 report from Ireland, TACO accounted for 221 of 1071 serious transfusion reactions (21 percent) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Other studies have found a similar proportion of transfusion reactions attributed to TACO [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. In a 2014 report from Canada that focused exclusively on transfusion reactions associated with respiratory distress, TACO accounted for 26 of 83 reactions (31 percent) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>Relative frequencies of TACO and other transfusion reactions are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/95132.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with a suspected acute transfusion reaction", section on 'Frequency of reactions'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27658912"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The possibility of TACO should be considered in any patient who has new or worsening respiratory distress during or within 12 hours of completing a transfusion [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The typical presentation of TACO includes respiratory distress (dyspnea, orthopnea) in a patient with known or unknown underlying heart failure who is receiving a transfusion, especially in the setting of positive fluid balance. The severity is variable, from mild dyspnea to acute respiratory decompensation. Headache is common and seizures have been reported.</p><p>Typically, symptoms occur after a significant proportion of the blood component or multiple units have been infused, up to (but usually sooner than) 12 hours following completion of the infusion.</p><p>Findings on examination may include hypoxia and/or hypertension, tachycardia, a wide pulse pressure, and/or jugular venous distension. The cardiac examination may show an S3 heart sound, and the lung examination often reveals rales and/or wheezing.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1913736136"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSTIC TESTING</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4076756032"><span class="h2">Monitoring</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Individuals receiving a transfusion are monitored periodically and instructed to report any concerning symptoms including respiratory distress.</p><p>Signs and symptoms include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute respiratory distress, dyspnea, or tachypnea</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tachycardia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased blood pressure</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute or worsening pulmonary edema</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Evidence of positive fluid balance</p><p></p><p>Additional monitoring may be appropriate in patients considered at higher than average risk of TACO (eg, in an intensive care unit, having a history of heart failure or kidney disease, older adults, those with a small blood volume, and those receiving large transfusion volumes). It may be helpful to develop local risk profile assessment tools or algorithms to use in the pre-transfusion assessment to identify high-risk patients.</p><p>Depending on the patient's risk profile, some combination or all of the following clinical parameters may be monitored:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pulse oximetry</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cardiopulmonary examination for elevated jugular venous pressure, heart sounds, rales or wheezing</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fluid balance, if fluid intake and output measurements are available</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Central venous pressure or pulmonary artery pressure, if a central venous or pulmonary artery catheter is in place</p><p></p><p>The frequency of monitoring depends on the patient's underlying condition, the number of blood components transfused, and the rapidity of infusion.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H918286530"><span class="h2">Evaluation and diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>TACO should be suspected in a patient who develops respiratory distress, hypoxia, or hypertension while receiving a transfusion or in the post-transfusion period. The physical examination should focus on the cardiovascular and pulmonary examination, as well as assessment for other possible causes of dyspnea (eg, evidence of deep vein thrombosis, findings of anaphylaxis). </p><p>Due to the lack of a definitive diagnostic test, clinical judgment is required to make the diagnosis, especially since many of the patients with suspected TACO may have complex medical conditions.</p><p>In patients with signs and symptoms of TACO, oxygenation status should be assessed using pulse oximetry and/or arterial blood gas analysis, especially if pulse oximetry shows oxygenation to be low or declining. Chest imaging (usually by radiography) is likely to be helpful and should be obtained to confirm pulmonary edema and eliminate other causes of respiratory distress (eg, transfusion-related acute lung injury [TRALI], pneumothorax) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Typical findings on chest radiography in TACO include pulmonary edema and in some cases cardiomegaly. Echocardiography is not routinely performed, but if done would be expected to show abnormal systolic and/or diastolic function.</p><p>Additional testing may include brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP), although this is not required for diagnosis. BNP and NT-proBNP, which has a much longer half-life than BNP, are elevated in TACO and other forms of heart failure. This information may be helpful when combined with other clinical information, but by itself it is not particularly sensitive or specific for TACO (sensitivity and specificity in the 80 to 90 percent range) [<a href="#rid8">8,22-24</a>]. In selected patients, echocardiography may be helpful in determining underlying cardiac abnormalities.</p><p>Often the evaluation is focused on distinguishing TACO from TRALI, a transfusion reaction caused by immune mediators such as anti-leukocyte antibodies in the transfused component rather than the volume load. In some cases, the distinction between TACO and TRALI is relatively obvious; in others it may be difficult and require the use of multiple types of information as shown in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86939" href="/d/graphic/86939.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Often it is difficult to distinguish TACO from TRALI until several days after the transfusion reaction and after the response to diuretics has been evaluated. TACO and TRALI can occur simultaneously in some patients. Additional guidance on distinguishing TACO from TRALI should be sought from the transfusion medicine service or blood bank.

Patients with TRALI typically become symptomatic during the transfusion or within six hours of completing the transfusion. Unlike TACO, the risk of TRALI is not related to the volume of the transfusion. TRALI may occur closer in time to the initiation of the transfusion (before significant volume is infused) and presenting features may include hypotension, fever, and transient leukopenia. TRALI is not associated with an elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N terminal Pro-BNP (NT Pro-BNP), central venous pressure, or pulmonary artery wedge pressure. In TRALI, the ratio of protein in the edema fluid to plasma is high, reflecting an exudate rather than a transudate. A key distinguishing feature between TRALI and TACO is that TACO symptoms improve with diuresis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86939" href="/d/graphic/86939.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Thus, sometimes the diagnosis cannot be confirmed until a few days after the transfusion.

Like TACO, these reactions may present with dyspnea, hypoxemia, and an abnormal lung examination. Unlike TACO, anaphylactic transfusion reactions may occur closer in time to the initiation of the transfusion (before significant volume is infused), and anaphylaxis is not associated with an elevated N terminal Pro-BNP (NT Pro-BNP), central venous pressure, or pulmonary artery wedge pressure.

It is defined as new onset dyspnea within 12 hours of transfusion, with specific criteria listed above. Risk factors include pre-existing cardiac and possibly kidney dysfunction, extremes of age, small stature, low body weight, greater number of units transfused, and faster rate of infusion. (See <a class="local">'Definition'</a> above and <a class="local">'Pathophysiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Incidence</strong> – The true frequency of TACO is difficult to assess; under-reporting is likely. TACO is estimated to occur in 1 percent or more of transfused individuals overall, and at greater frequency in individuals in the intensive care unit (ICU). TACO is more common than anaphylaxis, acute hemolytic transfusion reactions (AHTR), or transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). TACO is the most common cause of death from a transfusion. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical features</strong> – The possibility of TACO should be considered in any patient who has respiratory distress (dyspnea, orthopnea) or hypertension during or within 12 hours after the end of a transfusion, especially in individuals with underlying heart disease, in the setting of positive fluid balance, and in the ICU. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – Individuals receiving a transfusion are monitored periodically and instructed to report any concerning symptoms including respiratory distress; additional monitoring may be appropriate in those at higher risk of TACO. If a patient develops respiratory distress, the examination focuses on cardiovascular and pulmonary findings and assessment for other possible causes of dyspnea. Oxygenation status should be assessed, and chest imaging is usually indicated. TACO can cause hypoxia, jugular venous distention, pulmonary rales, an S3 gallop, pulmonary edema on chest imaging, and elevated BNP or NT-BNP.
