Most GBC is found incidentally in patients undergoing exploration for cholelithiasis; a tumor will be found in 1 to 2 percent of such cases [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>].</p><p>Surgery is the only potentially curative therapy for GBC. However, even after complete resection, outcomes are poor, particularly for T3 and/or node-positive disease. High rates of both local and distant recurrence have prompted interest in adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15097.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of gallbladder cancer", section on 'Outcomes'</a>.)</p><p>A high percentage of GBCs are initially unsuspected and detected at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy for presumed cholecystitis. The next step for these patients (before adjuvant therapy) is additional surgery to remove lymph nodes and the segments of liver above the gallbladder. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15097.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of gallbladder cancer", section on 'Gallbladder cancer diagnosed during gallbladder surgery'</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will cover adjuvant treatment for localized, resected GBC. The epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnostic evaluation, surgical treatment, and treatment for locally advanced unresectable and metastatic GBC are covered separately, as is adjuvant treatment after resection of cholangiocarcinoma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2491.html" rel="external">"Gallbladder cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15097.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of gallbladder cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2499.html" rel="external">"Treatment of advanced, unresectable gallbladder cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2467.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy for localized cholangiocarcinoma"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">PROGNOSIS AND PATTERNS OF SPREAD</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>GBC is an aggressive cancer; among resected patients, five-year overall survival rates are from 5 to 32 percent [<a href="#rid5">5-12</a>], although higher rates (45 to 50 percent) are reported in some contemporary reports of patients with incidentally found GBC after extended reresection [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. The poor prognosis associated with most cases of GBC is related to the advanced stage at diagnosis, which is due both to the vagueness and nonspecificity of symptoms and the anatomic position of the gallbladder [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Locoregionally, GBC frequently extends directly to adjacent structures such as the liver, stomach, duodenum, pancreas, colon, omentum, or abdominal wall. Peritoneal carcinomatosis involving the upper abdomen may complicate the disease in patients with transmural or serosal penetration.</p><p>Recurrences develop in 35 to 67 percent of patients [<a href="#rid6">6,7,13,16</a>], and outcomes are significantly worse among those who recur [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>The risk of recurrence is not constant over time, with up to two-thirds of all recurrences occurring in the first 12 months, and the majority of the remainder within 24 months. As a result, while overall survival usually decreases over time, the longer an individual has survived since treatment, the greater the chance of additional survival. This "conditional survival" may be a more accurate estimate of long-term survival:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In one analysis of 1071 patients undergoing curative intent therapy for a GBC ≥T1b from 2000 to 2018 at multiple international centers, at a median follow-up of 24.5 months, five-year relapse-free survival (RFS) was 47 percent for the entire population, while it was 71 percent for those who were recurrence-free at 12 months, and 87 percent for those without recurrence at 24 months [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In another report of 312 patients undergoing potentially curative surgical resection for GBC, with a median follow-up of 29 months, three-year overall survival was 41 percent for the entire cohort, but three-year conditional overall survival increased to 49 percent for those patients who were still alive at one year postsurgery, and to 62 percent among those who were still alive at two years [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p>These data might be used to inform the post-treatment-surveillance strategy. (See <a class="local">'Post-treatment surveillance'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H293337668"><span class="h2">Prognostic factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The main prognostic factors are tumor invasion depth as indicated by the pathologic tumor (T) stage, lymph node metastases, serum levels of the tumor marker cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), status of the surgical margins, tumor grade, and presence of lymphovascular and perineural invasion [<a href="#rid5">5,18-21</a>].</p><p>T stage has a major impact on prognosis. The current (eighth) edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) staging criteria contains several changes to both T and nodal (N) staging compared with the earlier 2010 edition  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110890" href="/z/d/graphic/110890.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. The most important are the subdivision of T2 disease into two categories based upon whether the tumor has arisen on the peritoneal or the hepatic side of the gallbladder, and a change from location-based definitions to a number-based N category assessment. Observed survival rates from a multicenter series of 437 cases of gallbladder cancer (GBC), stratified according to stage using the eighth edition staging criteria, are depicted in the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110891" href="/z/d/graphic/110891.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2491.html" rel="external">"Gallbladder cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'TNM staging system'</a>.)</p><p>The risk of both lymphatic and distant metastases increases as T stage increases. As an example, in one report of 410 patients presenting for therapy of GBC with or without a prior operation elsewhere, lymph node metastases were present in 33, 58, and 69 percent of those with T2, T3, or T4 primary tumors; the corresponding rates for peritoneal and/or liver metastases were 16, 42, and 79 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. An important point is that the T staging for GBC differs from that of other sites in the gastrointestinal tract; while a T2 designation at other sites, such as the colon, indicates invasion of the muscular layer, this is classified as T1b disease for GBC  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110890" href="/z/d/graphic/110890.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2491.html" rel="external">"Gallbladder cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'TNM staging system'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1521999"><span class="h2">Patterns of disease recurrence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Following resection of GBC, disease recurrence can be locoregional, distant, or both. In contrast to patients who have margin-positive resections, in whom locoregional recurrences predominate, the pattern of disease recurrence following complete resection of GBC is predominantly distant [<a href="#rid6">6,25,26</a>], though locoregional recurrences also occur [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a series of 97 patients undergoing surgery for GBC (90 percent of whom had a margin-negative resection), isolated locoregional disease as the first site of failure occurred in 15 percent of cases, while an initial recurrence involving a distant site, with or without concomitant locoregional recurrence, occurred in 85 percent [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In another retrospective review of 166 patients undergoing surgical resection with curative intent for GBC, 53 had a tumor recurrence [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The main patterns of recurrence were:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Retroperitoneal lymph nodes (28 percent)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Intrahepatic (22 percent)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Locoregional recurrence (hilum, bilioenteric anastomosis, hepatic resection margin; 20.9 percent)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Peritoneum, lung, bone, and abdominal wall (totaling 15 percent)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Other distant lymph nodes (14 percent)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h1">ADJUVANT THERAPY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H508185490"><span class="h2">Indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is a paucity of high-quality evidence to support adjuvant treatment in gallbladder cancer (GBC), and patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials evaluating new strategies. One such trial, <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT01313377%3Fterm%3Dadjuvant%2Btherapy%2Band%2Bgallbladder%2Bcancer%26rank%3D2&amp;token=JzvOkKob7lfNFdo7Yq2kG7pkR7b%2Fy2DX%2BFmM8Of%2FUzJleMRM7obm9Ks8kXnVZ%2FrrYY5v%2FthPQTXfVjN%2BuAsjn0YbBt2ftjaUWaEMt6ZhiyCOIp%2BydbABjQT5zwT3AvJ99yCCOm%2BvRpCafvXNsbMSlg%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=2525" target="_blank">ACTICCA-1</a>, is open to accrual in Europe, and eligible patients should be encouraged to enroll. If protocol participation is not available or is declined, we suggest adjuvant therapy for patients with completely resected muscle-invasive (≥T1b  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110890" href="/z/d/graphic/110890.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)), node-positive, or margin-positive GBC. Although guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) suggest adjuvant therapy for <strong>all </strong>patients with resected GBC, we would not offer therapy to a patient with a resected T1a, node-negative tumor, given that these patients were not eligible for either the BILCAP or the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) trials. This approach is consistent with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2273503641"><span class="h2">Choice of regimen</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is no consensus as to the optimal adjuvant approach. Given the high rate of distant recurrence, especially after a complete resection, and the results of the phase III BILCAP trial, we prefer six months of postoperative chemotherapy alone with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8839" href="/z/d/drug information/8839.html" rel="external">capecitabine</a> monotherapy for most patients. If capecitabine is chosen, we would start treatment with no more than a 1500 mg total dose twice daily. An alternative approach combining concomitant fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy with four months of systemic chemotherapy is also acceptable, particularly for patients with margin-positive disease. In this situation, the choice of chemotherapy can be either capecitabine monotherapy or capecitabine plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8487" href="/z/d/drug information/8487.html" rel="external">gemcitabine</a> (eg, as was used in SWOG S0809  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107377" href="/z/d/graphic/107377.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]). For patients who receive both adjuvant chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy, the optimal way to integrate chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy is uncertain. In general, it is preferable to start with chemotherapy first, based on the rationale that this approach may avoid radiation therapy (RT) for patients who are destined to develop early distant metastases and will not benefit from it.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4055863693"><span class="h2">Benefits</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are few adequately powered randomized trials of adjuvant therapy to guide clinicians treating patients with GBC. The lack of definitive prospective trials makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions as to the benefit of any adjuvant strategy. Nevertheless, several retrospective series and analyses from population-based databases, including the National Cancer Database (NCDB) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, support benefit for adjuvant therapy. Given these findings and the poor prognosis of patients with resected GBC, especially those with ≥T2N0 disease, adjuvant therapy is routinely recommended to patients with resected GBC at many institutions. The following sections will review the available data on adjuvant therapy for a variety of adjuvant therapy strategies.</p><p>The benefits of adjuvant therapy following curative-intent surgery for biliary tract cancer (intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts as well as GBC) were addressed in a meta-analysis that included a single randomized trial of chemotherapy alone [<a href="#rid29">29</a>], two SEER registry analyses, and 17 retrospective institutional series, altogether totaling 6712 patients, of whom 1797 received some form of adjuvant therapy [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. To be eligible, studies had to include patients who had curative-intent surgery alone (defined as negative [R0] or microscopically positive [R1] margins) as a control group. There were eight studies of RT plus chemotherapy, three of chemotherapy alone, and nine of RT alone. Only five of the trials were conducted in GBC (one of which was the randomized trial of chemotherapy discussed above [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]), and four studied external beam RT, two with concomitant chemoradiotherapy.</p><p>The following results were noted:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Compared with surgery alone, the improvement in five-year survival with any adjuvant therapy was not statistically significant (pooled odds ratio [OR] for death 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-1.01). The results were similar when GBC and bile duct cancer were analyzed independently. However, the survival benefit from adjuvant therapy was statistically significant when data from the two large registry series (n = 1233 patients) were excluded (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.39-0.72).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The benefits of adjuvant therapy were modality dependent; in a combined analysis of GBC and bile duct cancers, there was a significant survival benefit for chemotherapy (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.23-0.66) and chemoradiotherapy (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38-0.99) but not RT alone (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.67-1.43).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with node-positive and margin-positive disease derived the clearest survival benefit from adjuvant therapy:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pooled data confirmed a statistically significant overall survival advantage for any adjuvant therapy in node-positive disease (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30-0.80). The majority of these patients (77 percent) had received chemotherapy alone, while the remainder underwent chemoradiotherapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Similarly, a significant benefit for any adjuvant therapy was shown for patients with margin-positive disease (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19-0.68).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Nearly two-thirds of the treated R1 patients (63 percent) had received RT alone as a component of adjuvant therapy, while the majority of R0 studies used chemoradiotherapy, and most included node-positive patients. Following R1 resection, there was a statistically significant benefit from adjuvant RT (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14-0.81), while after R0 resection, adjuvant RT alone was associated with a trend toward worse overall survival (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.88-1.79). However, most of the patients with R0 disease were node positive and received a combination of chemotherapy and RT, so the comparison is not well matched.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There were only limited data to address the benefit of chemotherapy in patients with node-negative disease. In an exploratory analysis, the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy was of a greater magnitude in studies in which at least 50 percent of the patients had node-positive disease, R1 disease, or both than it was in studies that did not include many patients with node-positive or R1 disease.</p><p></p><p>While this analysis supports the benefit of adjuvant therapy for high-risk subgroups with GBC, it is based predominantly on retrospective data. Further, it does not resolve the question as to the best treatment strategy (ie, chemoradiotherapy versus chemotherapy alone) for high-risk patients or adequately address the benefit of adjuvant therapy for patients with low-risk (ie, node-negative) disease. Randomized trials remain needed in this area. (See <a class="local">'Chemotherapy alone versus chemoradiotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1845434484"><span class="h3">Benefit of individual strategies</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2494282493"><span class="h4">Chemotherapy alone</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pattern of disease recurrence in completely resected GBC, in which the majority of patients have distant failure as a component of initial disease recurrence, suggests that chemotherapy might be a more rational adjuvant treatment strategy than RT with or without concurrent chemotherapy. (See <a class="local">'Patterns of disease recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p>However, the available data are inconclusive as to the benefit of chemotherapy in patients with resected GBC. Although most (but not all [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]) retrospective single-institution series and population-based database analyses have suggested some degree of benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy [<a href="#rid32">32-37</a>] results from prospective randomized trials have been discordant, and the small number of patients with GBC enrolled in each of these trials compromises interpretation of most of the studies:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Positive trials</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>BILCAP trial</strong> – In the largest adjuvant chemotherapy trial, the phase III BILCAP trial, 447 patients with completely resected cholangiocarcinoma or muscle-invasive (ie, T1b or higher) GBC (n = 79, 18 percent) were randomly assigned to eight cycles of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8839" href="/z/d/drug information/8839.html" rel="external">capecitabine</a> (1250 mg/m<sup>2</sup> twice daily on days 1 to 14 every 21 days) or placebo [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].

In contrast to patients who have margin-positive resections, in whom locoregional recurrences predominate, the pattern of disease recurrence following complete resection of GBC is both distant and local. (See <a class="local">'Prognosis and patterns of spread'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The benefit of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) or concomitant chemoradiotherapy after resection of GBC has not been tested in randomized controlled trials. However, impressions of a survival advantage have been reported in many retrospective reports in which either RT alone or chemoradiotherapy (generally with a concomitant fluoropyrimidine) was administered. (See <a class="local">'Chemoradiotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The available data from randomized trials are inconclusive as to the benefit of chemotherapy in patients with resected GBC. However, at least two trials have demonstrated a potentially clinically meaningful, albeit statistically insignificant, survival benefit. (See <a class="local">'Chemotherapy alone'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In a meta-analysis derived mainly from retrospective reports, patients with node-positive and margin-positive disease seem to derive the clearest survival benefit from any form of adjuvant therapy. (See <a class="local">'Benefits'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Despite the paucity of high-quality evidence to support benefit, we suggest adjuvant therapy for all patients with completely resected muscle-invasive (≥T1b), node-positive, or margin-positive GBC (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Although guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology suggest adjuvant therapy for <strong>all </strong>patients with resected GBC, we would not offer therapy to a patient with a resected T1a, node-negative tumor, given that these patients were not eligible for either the BILCAP or the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) trials. This approach is consistent with National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> above and <a class="local">'Guidelines from expert groups'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">There is no consensus as to the optimal adjuvant approach. Given the high rate of distant recurrence, especially after a complete resection, and the results of the phase III BILCAP trial, we prefer six months of postoperative chemotherapy alone with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8839" href="/z/d/drug information/8839.html" rel="external">capecitabine</a> monotherapy for most patients. If capecitabine is chosen, we would start treatment with no more than a 1500 mg total dose twice daily. (See <a class="local">'Chemotherapy alone'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">An alternative approach combining concomitant fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy with four months of systemic chemotherapy is also acceptable, particularly for patients with margin-positive disease. In this situation, the choice of chemotherapy can be either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8839" href="/z/d/drug information/8839.html" rel="external">capecitabine</a> monotherapy or capecitabine plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8487" href="/z/d/drug information/8487.html" rel="external">gemcitabine</a> (eg, as was used in SWOG S0809  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107377" href="/z/d/graphic/107377.html" rel="external">table 2</a>)). (See <a class="local">'Chemoradiotherapy'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/85683.html" rel="external">"Treatment protocols for hepatobiliary cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For patients who receive chemoradiotherapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy, the optimal way to integrate chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy is uncertain. In general, it is preferable to start with chemotherapy first, to complete three to four months of systemic exposure, based on the rationale that this approach will avoid RT for patients who are destined to develop early distant metastases and may not need it.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There are no data to support aggressive post-treatment surveillance. We monitor patients closely with liver function tests and tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA] and cancer antigen 19-9 [CA 19-9]) every three to four months for the first two years after surgery, followed by every six months for one more year. We perform reimaging only as clinically indicated.
