         The morbidity and mortality associated with HIV have been substantially decreased with the use of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART). For most individuals with HIV who are treated with potent ART, AIDS has been transformed into a chronic disease. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13980.html" rel="external">

         With increased longevity, both AIDS-related and non-AIDS-related malignancies have become an important cause of illness among individuals infected with HIV. The specific malignancies associated with an increased incidence in people infected with HIV are reviewed elsewhere. (See

         Systemic therapy of malignancy in patients infected with HIV may present challenges because of the overlapping toxicities and potential drug-drug interactions between anticancer and antiretroviral agents. Avoiding unexpected toxicity or lack of therapeutic effectiveness requires close collaboration between the infectious disease expert managing the antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infection and the medical oncologist treating the cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
         Optimal management of HIV infection involves treatment with combinations of antiretroviral medications. However, advanced malignancy can pose an immediate threat to health and survival, and this may require that antineoplastic treatment take priority over ART [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. As the agents utilized to treat both cancer and HIV infection evolve, we are able to optimally treat both HIV and the malignancy.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are significant risks associated with stopping ART, as was demonstrated when intermittent ART was found to be inferior to constant dosing. Dose modifications or the use of alternative medications for either the ART or the anticancer treatment may be required to balance the competing treatment needs. Newer-generation antiretroviral drug classes (eg, integrase inhibitors) have a decreased risk of drug-drug interactions with anticancer agents. (See
         <a class="local">

         Chemotherapy can be associated with a wide range of toxicities. If a patient being treated with antiretroviral agents for HIV infection develops malignancy and the proposed anticancer treatment regimen has the potential for serious overlapping toxicity, the following options exist (in decreasing order of preference):

         Bone marrow suppression, especially neutropenia, is a frequent and important complication in patients with untreated or advanced HIV infection. In particular,

          zidovudine

         , which is used for pediatric patients as well as treatment-experienced patients in resource-limited settings who have failed initial therapy, is associated with severe neutropenia in approximately 8 percent of patients with advanced AIDS, and it should be avoided, if possible, in patients about to receive marrow-toxic chemotherapy [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Boosted protease inhibitors or integrase inhibitors may also potentiate neutropenia in the setting of cancer [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Furthermore, drug-drug interactions, either at the level of enzymatic metabolism or drug efflux transporters, could increase the exposure of hematopoietic stem cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Even targeted agents not commonly associated with myelotoxicity may have bone marrow suppression as a more common side effect when combined with ART [

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Since most cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens are associated with neutropenia, and since these agents have a narrow therapeutic index, combinations of chemotherapy with

          zidovudine
         </a>
         should be avoided, and an alternative NRTI or integrase inhibitors should be prescribed. If zidovudine use cannot be avoided, less myelosuppressive chemotherapy should be administered, if feasible, and the patient should be monitored closely for neutropenia.

         Measurements of serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase are useful when assessing liver function in HIV patients on these antiretroviral agents, and they should be done more frequently in such patients.

         Newer-generation antiretroviral drugs (eg, integrase inhibitors and entry inhibitors) have a decreased propensity for drug-drug interactions with anticancer agents. Additionally, drug interactions between monoclonal antibodies and antiretroviral drugs are unlikely due to pharmacokinetics [

         Some less commonly used antiretroviral agents that are a component of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) can act as substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoenzyme system, which consists of a number of hepatic enzymes responsible for clearing a wide range of toxins from the body. Both antiretroviral and anticancer drugs may affect different isoenzymes and result in agent-specific drug interactions.

         Since there are often limited data available from clinical trials, potential interactions are often based on information about the pharmacokinetic pathways for specific drugs. For various standard combination chemotherapy regimens, each drug in the regimen should be assessed for drug interaction potential. In complex regimens, it may be difficult to modify the dose since the dose of each drug in the original combination took into account not only the pharmacokinetics, but also the pharmacodynamics of all agents.
        </p>
        <p>
         The metabolic pathways involved for individual drugs vary significantly and make it difficult to generalize interactions based on drug class. Interactions may fall into one of two general categories:

          Drugs that inhibit elimination

         – Drugs that inhibit a route of elimination may cause the substrate drug to increase to a potentially supratherapeutic or toxic level, resulting in the need to decrease the dose of the substrate. As an example, an antiretroviral agent may increase the concentration or bioavailability of the anticancer agent by inhibiting or acting as a substrate for a specific isoenzyme that is responsible for the metabolism and clearance of that anticancer agent. This may result in increased toxicity because of the narrow therapeutic index normally associated with these drugs.

         </strong>
         – Drugs that induce a route of elimination may cause the substrate drug to decrease to a potentially subtherapeutic level. As an example, the metabolism and clearance of the anticancer agent may be increased by induction of the relevant CYP450 isoenzyme by an antiretroviral agent, thus resulting in decreased efficacy and the potential need to increase the dose of the anticancer agent [

         At the current time, there is no guidance on dose adjustment of either potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) or chemotherapy in order to minimize drug interactions. The AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC), a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-supported clinical trials group, is conducting prospective clinical trials with molecularly targeted agents in patients on potent ART, and it has completed such a trial with

        <p>
         The importance of a partnership between oncologists and specialists in infectious diseases to manage these patients and to discuss strategies using combinations of drugs cannot be overemphasized. As life expectancy for patients with HIV increases, and as more patients develop malignancies (whether HIV related or not), understanding the potential interactions between cancer chemotherapy agents and antiretroviral drugs will grow in importance.

         In general, for patients receiving systemic cancer therapy, an antiretroviral regimen is modified rather than discontinued completely if it is necessary to minimize toxicity and/or drug-drug interactions. This is especially valid given the changing landscape of anticancer therapy which includes checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy and molecularly targeted agents in additional to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Molecularly targeted agents tend to be administered orally on a chronic basis and, thus, are not conducive to a temporary interruption of ART, which should be avoided under most circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, ART that includes an unboosted integrase inhibitor plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), is generally well tolerated and has a low potential for drug-drug interactions. Most patients can also be switched to a newer regimen. However, if a patient requires ART containing a boosted protease inhibitor and has no other treatment options, such treatment may be discontinued in patients who are to receive high-dose chemotherapy as preparation for autologous bone marrow transplantation.

         Most patients starting a modern ART regimen (eg, an unboosted integrase inhibitor plus two NRTIs) are able to concurrently initiate chemotherapy with a low risk of drug-drug interactions. This approach has been associated with improved reconstitution of the immune system, with fewer opportunistic infections, better chemotherapy tolerance, and improved oncologic outcomes.

          Cancer in patients infected with HIV
         </strong>
         – The development of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the treatment of HIV infection has transformed AIDS into a chronic disease for most individuals infected with the disease. With increased longevity, both AIDS-related and non-AIDS-related malignancies have become an increasingly important cause of illness among individuals infected with HIV. (See
