(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5781.html" rel="external">"Overview of risk factors for development of atherosclerosis and early cardiovascular disease in childhood"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16972.html" rel="external">"Dyslipidemia in children and adolescents: Definition, screening, and diagnosis", section on 'Rationale for lipid screening'</a>.)</p><p>Evidence establishing the long-term effectiveness of lipid-lowering interventions in children comes largely from studies in children with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a group at high risk for morbidity and early mortality. Lipid-lowering therapy in children with FH decelerates the atherosclerosis process, as assessed by subclinical vascular findings (eg, carotid intima-media thickness). Long-term outcome data on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are not available for the general pediatric population; however, it is reasonable to assume, based on evidence from adult studies and limited pediatric data, that timely intervention to address dyslipidemia in childhood may decelerate the atherosclerotic process, which would prevent or delay the onset of ASCVD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/121831.html" rel="external">"Familial hypercholesterolemia in children"</a>.)</p><p>The practice of initiating interventions for pediatric dyslipidemia during childhood is supported by several organizations, including the American Heart Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Lipid Association, the National Cholesterol Education Program, and an expert panel sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [<a href="#rid1">1-5</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Society guideline links'</a> below.)   </p><p>Because evidence is lacking to directly link drug treatment with a reduction in ASCVD, some question the risk-benefit of pharmacologic therapy in children with dyslipidemia [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].

We agree with the risk stratification schema established by the American Heart Association, which categorizes these conditions and risk factors as "high-risk," "moderate-risk," or "at-risk," as summarized in the table and algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef105366" href="/z/d/graphic/105366.html" rel="external">table 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54963" href="/z/d/graphic/54963.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1,7</a>]. Children initially categorized in the at-risk or moderate-risk tier, based on their primary diagnosis, should be moved to a higher tier if they have additional risk factors  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54963" href="/z/d/graphic/54963.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Children with isolated hypercholesterolemia without other ASCVD risk factors or underlying conditions are generally considered "at-risk."
