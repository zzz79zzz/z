This results in increased work of breathing and/or reduced minute ventilation, as well as a predisposition to hypoxemia from intrinsic lung disease, lung atelectasis, or both. Hypoxemia due to preoperative atelectasis generally worsens in the perioperative setting due to hyperoxygenation and loss of muscle tone, which can exacerbate the condition [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].

Organic exposures most frequently result in an acute granulomatous hypersensitivity reaction (hypersensitivity pneumonitis), whereas inorganic agents have several different presentations. Acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis can typically be effectively treated with anti-inflammatory agents; longstanding environmental exposure-related disease most typically results in lung fibrosis.

Other lung diseases that may be associated with progressive fibrosis include non-specific interstitial pneumonitis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and ILDs associated with autoimmune diseases. Progressive fibrotic lung diseases share a predisposition to "acute exacerbations," whereby lung injury results in marked worsening of disease over days to weeks with only partial recovery. Thoracoabdominal surgery and mechanical ventilation are potential risk factors for these exacerbations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/110885.html" rel="external">"Acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis", section on 'Pathophysiology and risk factors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Granulomatous ILD </strong>– Granulomatous ILDs include sarcoidosis and rare granulomatous disorders (berylliosis, granulomatous-lymphocytic ILD). Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease that has protean manifestations in multiple organ systems, but it is most frequently found in the lung and intrathoracic lymph nodes. Many patients are asymptomatic with no or minimal lung disease, but others develop significant pulmonary symptoms, granulomatous inflammation, and lung scarring. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">Prednisone</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a>, and other anti-inflammatory therapies are effective at controlling active pulmonary disease in most symptomatic patients.

The pathology arises due to a reversible inflammatory and fibroproliferative process in the alveolar (not interstitial) space that does not disrupt the underlying lung architecture. Because of this, treatment with anti-inflammatory agents is generally effective at restoring normal pulmonary function. However, many patients develop disease recurrence and may require extended anti-inflammatory therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4332.html" rel="external">"Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Connective tissue disease-associated ILD</strong> – Several connected tissue diseases are highly predisposed to development of ILD, including rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis, Sjögren syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Treatment with anti-inflammatory agents active in the lung is often effective, but progressive fibrotic changes develop in a significant minority over time. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4362.html" rel="external">"Interstitial lung disease in rheumatoid arthritis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4377.html" rel="external">"Overview of pulmonary complications of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4304.html" rel="external">"Interstitial lung disease in dermatomyositis and polymyositis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4301.html" rel="external">"Interstitial lung disease associated with Sjögren's disease: Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4681.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Any intrinsic restrictive lung disease may also result in development of group 3 pulmonary hypertension (PH).
