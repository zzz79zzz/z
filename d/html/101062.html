         A variety of laryngeal procedures may be performed to improve respiratory function or phonation, or to resect diseased tissue. Anesthetic concerns specific to these procedures include potential difficulty with airway management, sharing the airway with the surgeon, the effects of preoperative treatment for laryngeal pathology (particularly radiation for cancer), and the patient comorbidities that predispose to laryngeal disease. Laryngeal surgery requires especially close coordination with the surgeon, whether the procedure is minor or more complex.

         This topic will discuss general principles of anesthetic management for laryngeal procedures, and management for some common procedures.

         The larynx is comprised of a cartilaginous skeleton, muscles (extrinsic and intrinsic), and a mucosal lining. The main functions of the larynx involve phonation, maintenance or airway patency and protection, and generation of Valsalva. The anatomy of the larynx, including the cartilages, vocal folds (cords), muscles, and nerve supply are discussed in detail separately  (

        </p>
        <p>
         Anatomic changes related to cancer of the larynx or nearby structures, or to cancer treatment, can increase complexity and difficulty with airway management. The fat filled spaces anterior and posterior to the epiglottis and lateral to the vocal folds, if involved with tumor, can decrease tissue compliance, narrow the airway, change the axial alignment of intubation path, and increase difficulty with passage of an endotracheal tube (ETT). In addition, radiation damage, inflammation, or mass effect on lymphatic or venous drainage can cause laryngeal edema, resulting in tissue friability and airway narrowing. Lymphatic drainage of the larynx is discussed separately. (See

         All patients should have a preanesthesia airway assessment, with the goal of identifying possible difficulty with airway management and risk factors for aspiration during anesthesia. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91218.html" rel="external">
          "Airway management for induction of general anesthesia", section on 'Airway assessment'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Difficulty with airway management is more common for patients who undergo head and neck procedures, particularly for cancer, than for many other surgical patients. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94228.html" rel="external">
          "Anesthesia for head and neck surgery", section on 'Incidence of airway difficulty'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Difficulty with airway management in patients with laryngeal cancer varies, and may depend on the stage and the location of the cancer. Early laryngeal cancer (eg, carcinoma in situ, stages T1 and T2) primarily consists of soft tissue pathology, and passing an endotracheal tube (ETT) through the tumor site is usually not difficult. As an example, early glottic cancer may impair vocal fold mobility, but the vocal fold is not usually fixed or obstructive [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. However, in more advanced cancer with damage of the underlying cartilage, the airway lumen may be narrowed and tissue compliance may be decreased, such that passing an ETT can be difficult or impossible. Thus, in patients with advanced cancer, the plan for airway management should be discussed with the surgeon, including the appropriate size of an ETT and the possibility of awake intubation or tracheostomy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Surgical considerations and team planning'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The 2022 Practice Guidelines for Management of the Difficult Airway from the American Society of Anesthesiologists lists 15 items that can be used to predict airway difficulty, including facial features, anatomical metrics, and ratios  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef135105" href="/z/d/graphic/135105.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Some commonly assessed features and non-reassuring findings are shown in a table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108981" href="/z/d/graphic/108981.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). These fundamental tools are essential for routine use, but are insufficient for patients who undergo laryngeal procedures. Many patients will also undergo awake transnasal flexible laryngoscopy as part of preoperative evaluation to assess the view of the glottis, the maximal airway capacity at the disease site, axial alignment of the airway, presence and position of obstructive lesions, condition of the mucosa and edema, and vocal fold motion. For patients with laryngeal cancer, repeat flexible laryngoscopy should be performed on the day of surgery in selected cases, as lesions can progress and change quickly  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef127087" href="/z/d/graphic/127087.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with laryngeal pathology, airway-related imaging or stroboscopy (which assesses vocal fold motion) may help identify the potential problems with airway management mentioned above, and should be reviewed as part of perioperative airway assessment. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can identify masses, anatomic distortion, and evidence of tissue edema. However, the limits of radiographic studies for evaluation of the laryngeal airway should be appreciated. A study performed a few weeks prior to surgery may not reflect the airway condition at the time of the procedure for rapidly progressing disease. In addition, CT cannot be used to evaluate vocal fold mobility unless multiple images are acquired at various stages of the respiratory cycle, and CT studies do not reliably estimate the maximal lumen of the airway. Virtual endoscopy [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ], airway ultrasound, and cone beam CT [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5

         ] are emerging technologies for airway evaluation whose clinical applications have not been established.

         Radiation therapy (RT) is commonly used as the primary therapy for laryngeal cancer. Many patients undergoing cancer surgery have been previously treated with RT, which can cause acute and long-term consequences, including laryngeal edema  (

         Mumbling or difficulty swallowing are often signs of laryngeal edema or significant mucositis in upper aerodigestive tract, and may predict difficulty with airway management.

         Neck RT can also cause acute or chronic baroreflex dysfunction (or rarely, baroreflex failure), which is more common in patients with bilateral neck radiation and those who have completed a full course of treatment [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. While most patients with impaired baroreflexes remain asymptomatic during routine activity [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ], they may exhibit labile blood pressure and heart rate during anesthesia [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. The incidence of baroreflex dysfunction after RT is unknown. Although routine preoperative screening for impaired baroreflex sensitivity is impractical and unnecessary, repeat episodes of orthostatic hypotension in a patient who have undergone neck RT may suggest baroreflex dysfunction and should raise the concern for possible hemodynamic instability during the perioperative period.

         Endotracheal intubation is performed for many laryngeal procedures; a cuffed endotracheal tube (ETT) secures the airway, facilitates mechanical ventilation, prevents leakage of anesthetic gases or oxygen from the trachea into the airway, and prevents soiling of the lungs with blood or debris. However, the ETT may interfere with visualization and dissection of the laryngeal lesion. During intubation it is important to avoid traumatizing laryngeal lesions.
        </p>
        <p>
         After intubation, the ETT should be positioned according to the surgeon's preference to facilitate introduction of surgical instruments. It must be securely taped to the lower jaw or the corner of the mouth to avoid outward displacement of the ETT when the mouth is opened and the neck is extended for laryngeal suspension. This is particularly important because immediate access to the airway will be difficult or impossible once the head of the operating table is turned 90 or 180 degrees away from the anesthesiologist. The anesthesia breathing circuit should be configured to allow unrestricted surgical access.

         In general, the smallest ETT capable of supporting appropriate ventilation is used. In most cases, a 5 or 5.5 mm inner diameter (ID) microlaryngeal tube is adequate to meet respiratory and surgical needs. However, the cuff of 5 or 5.5 mm ID tube may not adequately seal the adult tracheal lumen without overinflating the cuff. Thus, cuff pressure should be checked after a seal is achieved with one of these small ETTs, and if necessary, the tube should be replaced with a slightly larger one.

         Laser-resistant ETTs are used for laryngeal laser surgery to reduce the risk of airway fire. The selection of the laser-resistant ETT should be based on the type of laser used for the procedure. Laser-resistant tubes vary with respect to their materials, the portions of the tube that are laser resistant, the relative size, and the type of laser for which they may be used. Laser-resistant ETTs have larger external diameters for a given internal diameter because of the laser resistant coating or materials.

         ). The second, distal cuff provides a backup gas seal if the proximal cuff is damaged. The proximal ETT cuff should be placed well below the vocal folds to minimize the chance of damage, while taking care to avoid endobronchial intubation, and both cuffs should be inflated. The cuff position should be rechecked after the patient is positioned for surgery, since neck extension can move the tube closer to the vocal folds. As a practical matter, there are no depth markings on the Laser-Flex ETT, so the ETT position is difficult to assess. The author marks the tube at 23 cm from the tip prior to use. The tube is then passed through the vocal cords and advance to the point at which the 23 cm mark is at the teeth, and withdrawn as necessary to achieve bilateral breath sounds. After the suspension laryngoscope is in place, the cuff position below the glottis opening is confirmed visually.

         The "tubeless" ventilation techniques, including supraglottic or subglottic jet ventilation (JV) and apneic oxygenation (eg, high flow nasal oxygen [HFNO]), may be used for microlaryngeal surgery for various procedures (eg, phonosurgery, resection of laryngeal pathology, removal of a laryngeal foreign body), generally for short or simple procedures. The need for tubeless ventilation is primarily the surgeon's decision. General considerations include the following:

         Low-flow apneic oxygenation technique may also be used in selected cases, such as the patients with a low body weight. In a single institution observational study of 64 adults who underwent microlaryngeal surgery with oxygen provided at 0.5 to 1 L/minute via a 10 French catheter tracheal catheter placed through the glottis, all but two cases were completed using low-flow oxygen without oxygen desaturation, with a mean duration of surgery of 18.7 minutes [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. In two patients the technique was abandoned due to desaturation to ≤92 percent. Compared with a high-flow technique, the advantages of low flow are that it provides a quiet field and reduces field contamination from surgical debris.

         Tubeless techniques should be considered carefully, along with the surgeon, for patients with predicted difficulty with endotracheal intubation, since intubation may be required quickly if adverse airway events occur during surgery, such as aspiration or the inability to oxygenate or ventilate with JV.

         Both low- and high-frequency JV can be used for laryngeal surgery. JV provides a relatively quiet surgical field, with minimal laryngeal motion, without the need to interrupt ventilation. Laryngeal tissue vibration is a concern with supraglottic JV, whereas barotrauma is a concern with subglottic JV. Supraglottic JV via a jet compatible laryngoscope is a commonly used technique. JV is discussed separately. (See

         Transnasal humidified high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) is another technique that allows apneic oxygenation without an airway device in place. For laryngologic surgery, HFNO is typically used for preoxygenation at a flow rate of 30 L/minute. After induction of anesthesia, HFNO is temporarily stopped to confirm the ability to ventilate by face mask, then restarted at 70 L/minute. Airway patency must be meticulously maintained until the surgical laryngoscope is inserted. Since capnography is not possible when using HFNO, transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitoring should be used where available during laryngologic surgery.

         Examples of studies of the use of HFNO for airway management during general anesthesia include the following:

         Experience with HFNO for laryngeal surgery is limited and requires further study. The author usually uses it as part of a combined technique, along with JV backup if necessary. With this technique, the author sets up a JV handle with the pressure regulated at 30 psi, with a 5.5 or 6 mm ID microlaryngeal tube. The surgeon uses a JV compatible laryngoscope. HFNO is used for oxygenation while the surgeon engages and adjusts the laryngoscope, and is continued during surgery as long as the patient remains well oxygenated. If oxygen desaturation occurs, JV is initiated, and if necessary, endotracheal intubation is performed.

         Emergence from anesthesia after laryngeal surgery should include a smooth, rapid awakening and extubation, devoid of coughing, bucking, and straining. Ongoing communication with the surgeon regarding progress and timing of completion of the procedure is important for preparing for anesthetic emergence. The author usually allows recovery of spontaneous ventilation prior to starting emergence, and prefers to extubate when awake and following commands. Planning for extubation and techniques for a smooth extubation are discussed separately. (See

         Patients who undergo laryngeal procedures should be monitored closely for stridor, wheezing, and signs of respiratory obstruction. Postoperative airway obstruction is rare, and most microlaryngeal surgery can be performed on an outpatient basis. Mild post-extubation inspiratory strider may occur as a result of residual anesthesia or opioids; continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) support often resolves stridor while the patient fully awakens.

         Patients with postoperative obstructive local edema or hemorrhage require emergency airway management in the operating room with the surgeon present. Flexible scope intubation is an option for management of a stable airway, whereas tracheostomy may be required for emergency management. (See

It can often be performed with local anesthesia with no or minimal sedation. General anesthesia may be required in select cases to immobilize the surgical field for precision injection, or for patients who are highly anxious.

         Airway and ventilation management for endolaryngeal procedures under general anesthesia are discussed above. (See

         Injection laryngoplasty results in only mild postoperative throat discomfort, and opioids should not be required for analgesia. Therefore, for patients who receive general anesthesia, the author usually administers short-acting agents (eg,

After induction of anesthesia and onset of neuromuscular block, the surgeon engages the suspension laryngoscope and performs the quick procedure. At the end of surgery, mask ventilation is used to support the airway until spontaneous ventilation is adequate. If surgery lasts longer than expected, jet ventilation (JV) may be used to continue oxygenation and ventilation. Placement of a supraglottic airway (SGA) should be avoided, as the SGA can disrupt the injection site.

         When anesthesia is required, mild to moderate sedation is usually sufficient. The procedure typically takes 45 to 90 minutes. Pain is minimal and the anxiety level is moderate during the surgery. The procedure and anesthesia goals should be thoroughly discussed with the patient to reduce emotional distress during voice adjustment. For patients who are particularly anxious, moderate sedation can be administered during tissue dissection, lightened during voice testing, and readministered during skin closure.

         Postoperative pain is minimal after operative laryngoplasty, and is usually well controlled with nonopioid analgesics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be administered only after discussion with the surgeon, due to the possibility of postoperative bleeding. Patient should be instructed to abstain from speech. The risk of postoperative airway obstruction is low since breathing and voice are finely adjusted during the procedure. One single institutional study of 147 patients with type I thyroplasty (vocal fold medialization) reported that the overall postoperative complication was 7 percent. Three percent of patients developed postoperative airway compromise, but none of them needed surgical intervention or tracheal intubation [

         Acute onset of bilateral vocal cord paralysis often results in respiratory distress. The patient may be intubated for immediate airway control while a care plan is developed. In some cases, a tracheostomy is performed prior to a definitive surgical procedure. Although a temporary or permanent tracheostomy is often performed for bilateral vocal fold paralysis, conservative management with steroid administration or surgical interventions such as endoscopic laser cordectomy or laser arytenoidectomy may also be used in selected cases.

        <p>
         Intubation is not typically difficult in patients with vocal cord paralysis, since the endotracheal tube (ETT) is usually easily passed between flaccid vocal folds. However, effective mask ventilation may be a challenge due to a significantly narrow laryngeal airway. Therefore, if time permits, adequate preoxygenation should be performed before induction of anesthesia, and apneic oxygenation during laryngoscopy should be considered. (See

         Hemorrhage is the most common postoperative complication after microlaryngeal surgery for cancer, with a reported incidence 5 to 8 percent. Risk factors for postoperative hemorrhage include advanced cancer pathology and a large area of tumor resection [

         Postextubation airway obstruction is a significant concern after TORS. In some centers, extubation is routinely delayed until the first postoperative day, particularly for procedures that last longer than three or four hours. Prolonged surgical retraction and tissue manipulation can cause airway edema, and resection of a relatively large tissue surface may increase the risk of postoperative airway bleeding. In select cases, a prophylactic tracheostomy is performed.

         When a tracheostomy is not indicated, the author usually extubates the trachea at the end of surgery, as long as he and the surgeon agree that there is appropriate hemostasis and no evidence of excessive airway edema. We often place a nasal airway prior to extubation in patients with history of OSA or a large BMI, elevate the head of the bed to 15 to 30 degrees, and extubate the patient fully awake. We have emergency airway equipment immediately available during extubation (including videolaryngoscope), and have the surgeon present for extubation in case an emergency surgical airway is required.

         Conservation laryngeal procedures (eg, vertical or horizontal [or supraglottic] hemilaryngectomy, near-total laryngectomy, supracricoid partial laryngectomy) are performed to maximally preserve laryngeal function and avoid a permanent tracheostomy.

         – A total laryngectomy involves en bloc removal of the larynx together with the hyoid bone, thyroid cartilage, and cricoid cartilage. A permanent tracheostoma is formed at the end of surgery. Microvascular free-flap reconstructive surgery is usually performed to repair the large tissue defect. At the author’s institution, total laryngectomy lasts two and one-half to three hours, with approximate blood loss of 100 to 200 ml, and 1500 to 2000 mL intravenous crystalloid administration.

         Total laryngectomy requires general endotracheal anesthesia, with induction and initial airway management as appropriate for patient factors.

         We place an arterial catheter preoperatively for continuous hemodynamic monitoring and to facilitate prompt treatment of hypotension and bradycardia. Patients who undergo these procedures are chronically hypovolemic due to dysphagia. Those who have been treated with radiation therapy (RT) may also be at risk for baroreflex dysfunction, which can cause an exaggerated vagal response with stimulation of the distributions of the glossopharyngeal or vagal nerves, or the carotid baroreceptor [

         The goals for hemodynamic management during free flap reconstruction are to optimize perfusion to the transferred tissue while avoiding the local and systemic adverse effects of fluid overload. We aim for euvolemia with respect to fluid administration, and administer vasoactive agents judiciously based on patient factors and clinical assessment. General anesthetics tend to induce hypotension, which is often counteracted with a combination of fluid administration and vasoactive drugs. Whether to use vasopressors, specifically vasoconstricting drugs, is controversial. The best available evidence suggests that intraoperative use of vasopressors does not increase the risk of flap failure or complications in patients who undergo head and neck surgery. A 2019 meta-analysis of 12 studies (one randomized controlled trial, 11 observational studies) including approximately 8000 patients who underwent free flap surgery reported a lower incidence of flap failure in patients who received vasopressors, compared with those who did not (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.5-0.99) [

         Prior neck radiation therapy (RT) can cause tissue fibrosis and edema, which may increase difficulty with airway management. Patients who have received RT are often malnourished and hypovolemic, and are predisposed to hypotension on induction of anesthesia. Neck radiation can also cause baroreflex dysfunction and may predispose patients to hemodynamic instability during anesthesia. (See

          Transoral robotic surgery (TORS)
         </strong>
         – These are long procedures associated with a high risk of postoperative respiratory obstruction. In some centers, extubation is delayed until the day after surgery. The author extubates patients at the end of the case if there is no evidence of airway edema, with the surgeon and emergency airway equipment in the operating room in case an emergency airway is required, and routinely monitors end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         ) in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). (See

         Patients who undergo total laryngectomy are often hypovolemic, and are at risk for hypotension during induction of anesthesia. (See
         <a class="local">

         The goals for hemodynamic management during free flap reconstruction for laryngectomy are to optimize perfusion to the transferred tissue, while avoiding the local and systemic adverse effects of fluid overload. The best available evidence suggests that administration of vasoactive agents does not increase the risk of flap failure or complications. We administer intravenous fluid to achieve euvolemia, and administer vasoactive agents judiciously based on patient factors and clinical assessment. (See
         <a class="local">
