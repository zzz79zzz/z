         Upper respiratory infection (URI) is the most frequent human illness and the most common infection in childhood; infants and preschoolers have six to eight URIs per year [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         ]. Thus, children commonly present for surgery and anesthesia with a current or recent URI, with potential for increased risk for perioperative respiratory adverse events.

         This topic will discuss the preoperative assessment of children with a current or recent URI, as well as intraoperative anesthesia management. Diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and complications of URIs in children are discussed separately. (See

         The term "upper respiratory infection" (URI) may be used to describe a variety of infections. For the purposes of this topic, URI is meant to refer to a constellation of signs and symptoms otherwise called "the common cold," an acute viral infection of the upper respiratory tract involving, to variable degrees, sneezing, nasal congestion and discharge (rhinorrhea), sore throat, cough, low-grade fever, headache, and malaise.

         Multiple studies have shown that children who undergo general anesthesia with a current or recent URI are at increased risk of perioperative respiratory adverse events (PRAEs), mostly related to airway hyperreactivity, though most of these events are mild and easily managed [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-8
         </a>
         ]. Perioperative respiratory events increase admission rates and costs and prolong hospitalizations [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ], but long-term consequences of brief oxygen desaturations have not be demonstrated [
         <a href="#rid10">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         PRAEs include laryngospasm, bronchospasm, atelectasis, coughing, airway obstruction, hypoxia, stridor, and breathholding. Though most PRAEs are easily managed, more significant events can occur. According to data from the Pediatric Perioperative Cardiac Arrest Registry, after cardiovascular causes, respiratory events were the second-most common cause of perioperative cardiac arrests in children, with laryngospasm being the most likely cause for respiratory-induced cardiac arrests [

         Airway hyperreactivity, which increases the risk of laryngospasm and bronchospasm, decreases over time with a URI, though the literature on the time course of resolution is inconsistent. While some studies have shown increased airway reactivity for up to four weeks after the URI [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3,6,8
         </a>
         ], one study found no increase in PRAEs in children with rhinorrhea two to four weeks prior to anesthesia [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13

         Evidence for increased risk of PRAEs in children with URIs comes from prospective and retrospective observational studies, most of which excluded patients who were obviously ill with purulent rhinitis, productive cough, fever, and malaise. Examples include the following:

         A prospective observational study included approximately 9300 children who underwent general anesthesia for elective, urgent, and emergent procedures in one institution, including those with active URIs [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The relative risk for a PRAE doubled in patients who had an active URI or had a URI in the two weeks preceding the anesthetic. A URI two to four weeks prior lowered the risk for PRAEs.

         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Other risk factors that increased the incidence of PRAEs in children with active URIs include a history of reactive airway disease, surgical procedure on the airway, a history of prematurity, exposure to second-hand cigarette smoke, nasal congestion or copious secretions, and endotracheal intubation. Patients were excluded if they had severe URIs, lower respiratory infection, evidence of bacterial infection, and at the discretion of the anesthesiologist.

          8

There was a tendency toward adverse events if peak URI symptoms had occurred in the four weeks prior to anesthesia. A low-grade fever was associated with a lower rate of postoperative respiratory complications. Anesthesia was postponed at the discretion of the anesthesiologist, such that exclusion criteria with regard to URI symptoms are unclear.

         URI may increase the risk of PRAEs during procedural sedation as well. In a prospective multicenter database study including approximately 83,500 children who underwent procedural sedation reported increases in the incidence of airway-related adverse events and airway interventions in children with recent URIs, and further increases in children with current URIs [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. An airway adverse event (eg, cough, laryngospasm, desaturation, apnea &gt;15 seconds) occurred in approximately 6 percent of children without a URI, 9 percent of children with a recent URI, 15 percent of children with a current URI with clear secretions, and 22 percent of children with a current URI with thick secretions.

         </span>
         The choice of airway device may affect the risk of PRAEs in children without a URI. In general, increasing airway stimulation is associated with higher risk of at least some PRAEs (ie, mask ventilation &lt; supraglottic airway &lt; endotracheal intubation). A meta-analysis of 16 randomized controlled studies including 1240 children &lt;12 years of age that compared laryngeal mask airways (LMAs) with ETT for anesthesia reported increased cough and postoperative sore throat with ETT, but no difference in the incidence of bronchospasm or laryngospasm on emergence [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The effect of the choice of airway device on the risk of PRAEs in small infants is unclear; many studies comparing LMAs with ETT have either excluded infants or did not specify patient ages. In one single center study, 180 infants &lt;1 year of age were randomly assigned to LMA or ETT for airway management for general anesthesia [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. LMAs were associated with a lower risk of all perioperative PRAEs than ETTs (18 versus 53 percent) and a lower risk of laryngospasm and bronchospasm (4 versus 19 percent). However, it may not be possible to generalize the results of this study, as the incidence of PRAE was unusually high, criteria for extubation were not specified, the anesthetic techniques were not standardized, and all patients were cared for by attending pediatric anesthesia specialists. Therefore, further study is required before basing the choice of airway device for infants on the risk of PRAEs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many pediatric anesthesiologists, including this author, routinely use an ETT rather than a supraglottic airway for small infants. SGAs may not seal well in infants, and tend to become dislodged. Infants desaturate quickly, and there is less time to react to problems with the airway device. In addition, the infant's airway may not be easily accessible, and it can be difficult to rescue a malpositioned SGA or replace it with an endotracheal tube. We extubate most patients with ETT awake, to avoid the chance of laryngospasm on emergence. (See

It helps in identifying where on the spectrum of perioperative risk a particular patient lies. If this risk is acceptable, the decision to proceed or postpone still needs to be made based on local resources and individual experience.

         Most decisions regarding the anesthetic plan for children with a URI can be made based on history and physical examination, if not by history alone. Signs and symptoms that should be elicited include fever, clear or green nasal secretions, wet or dry cough, wheezing, changes in respiratory pattern, shortness of breath, anorexia, malaise, and/or changes in playfulness and physical activity. The disease course of sick contacts in the patient's family can help predict the course of the illness.
        </p>
        <p>
         Simply asking the parents or caregivers whether a child is sick is an important part of preoperative evaluation. A case-control study of 123 children who developed perioperative laryngospasm found that laryngospasm was twice as likely in patients with an active URI, as defined by the parents, compared with those without an active URI [
         <a href="#rid25">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Most often, a patient with a significant URI who is scheduled for an elective procedure can be advised to postpone the procedure during a preoperative screening phone call the day before the anesthetic. Postponement before the patient even reaches the healthcare facility avoids unnecessary fasting, interruption of the operating room schedule, economic hardship, and inconvenience for the patient and family. At our institution, the nurses who make the preoperative phone calls are authorized to cancel elective cases at the time of the phone call if symptoms of URI are present.

         Patients should be examined for obvious signs of a URI such as nasal discharge, repeated coughing, a sick appearance, and/or fever. The chest should be auscultated for wheezing, crackles, or rhonchi as signs of lower respiratory infection. Inspection of the throat can help in making a more specific diagnosis (eg, patients with coxsackie infections who present with herpangina).

         Preoperative laboratory and radiologic evaluation are rarely necessary or helpful for otherwise healthy children with a URI. The need for testing should be individualized based on patient comorbidities and the surgical procedure. For example, for ex-premature infants who need elective procedures, it may be helpful to rule out a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, as RSV infection at the time of anesthesia has been associated with increased risk of unplanned postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) admission and increased length of hospital stay [

         During the COVID-19 pandemic, preoperative evaluation should include COVID-19 screening or testing for patients who are not known to have COVID-19, and for all patients, risk assessment related to COVID-19. Risk assessment includes both the likelihood of perioperative morbidity and mortality, and also the risk of spread of the virus to care providers and other patients.

         Timing of elective surgery for a child with current or recent URI symptoms remains controversial. Although clinical practice varies widely, a survey of approximately 200 pediatric anesthesiologists reported that those with more clinical experience were more conservative compared with anesthesiologists with less experience [

         Laryngospasm is the sustained closure of the vocal cords by constriction of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx. It can make ventilation difficult or impossible and can quickly lead to hypoxemia and bradycardia, as well as significant morbidity or mortality. The risk of laryngospasm increases with airway instrumentation and/or unnecessary stimulation during a light level of anesthesia, as well as with copious airway secretions. Blood and secretions should be suctioned from the airway before lightening the level of anesthesia.

         Laryngospasm must be treated immediately. Management of laryngospasm starts with application of continuous positive airway pressure with 100 percent oxygen and deepened anesthesia. If ventilation is not possible, a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) should be administered to relax the laryngeal muscles and allow mask ventilation. Risk factors, prevention, and management of intraoperative laryngospasm in children are discussed more fully separately  (

         </span>
         Laryngospasm and other perioperative respiratory adverse events (PRAEs) can occur during emergence from anesthesia and at extubation. In many cases, the airway device can be removed either "deep," while the patient is still deeply anesthetized, or awake. Deep extubation can result in smoother emergence without the irritation of the airway device in place. We usually extubate patients with upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) deep unless there is a contraindication, such as blood or secretions in the airway (eg, during ear, nose, and throat procedures) or previous difficulty with mask ventilation or intubation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Literature on the risk of PRAEs related to the timing of extubation is inconsistent. One prospective study of approximately 1100 anesthetized children with and without current or recent URIs found that the depth of anesthesia at the time of removal of either an endotracheal tube (ETT) or a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) had no effect on the incidence of PRAEs [

         Adverse respiratory events can occur intraoperatively or during the postoperative period. Laryngospasm is almost exclusively an intraoperative event and rarely occurs once the patient completely regains consciousness. However, oxygen desaturation, bronchospasm, and cough can occur in the recovery room and later in the postoperative course. (See

         Upper respiratory infection (URI) is a common illness, and children often present for anesthesia with a current or recent URI. Children with current or recent URIs are at increased risk for perioperative respiratory adverse events (PRAEs) including laryngospasm, bronchospasm, oxygen desaturation, cough, and breath-holding, though most of these events are mild and easily treated.

         When possible, we minimize airway instrumentation for patients with a current or recent URI. We prefer facemask to the use of a supraglottic airway (SGA) and SGA placement to endotracheal intubation. (See

          'Airway management'

         Intraoperative laryngospasm can quickly lead to hypoxia and bradycardia and can result in morbidity and mortality. The risk of laryngospasm increases with airway instrumentation, especially under light levels of anesthesia, and with the presence of airway secretions. Treatment of laryngospasm includes continuous positive airway pressure with 100 percent oxygen and, if necessary, administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA)  (

         Laryngospasm, bronchospasm, and other PRAEs can occur at the time of emergence from anesthesia and extubation. We prefer to remove airway devices under deep levels of anesthesia to minimize airway stimulation under light anesthesia. (See
