This is particularly true when the needs and wishes of the adolescent conflict with the opinions and preferences of the parents [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The laws governing consent and confidentiality in adolescent health care vary from country to country; within the United States, they vary from state to state. The specific provisions of consent laws and confidentiality laws also vary and are not identical to each other. The information in this topic focuses on consent in adolescent health care in the United States.</p><p>Clinicians who treat adolescents must be aware of the federal and state laws related to adolescent consent and confidentiality. The circumstances in which adolescents may consent for their own care and in which confidentiality is protected vary from state to state depending upon the adolescent's status as a minor or adult, the service involved, and the provider's level of concern regarding harm to the patient or others.</p><p>The basic laws governing consent for health care are state laws; clinicians who treat adolescents need to be aware of the laws in their state. Confidentiality provisions are found in both state and federal law. Clinicians who treat adolescents also must be aware of the guidelines governing federal and state funding sources for particular services, particularly when funding source guidelines contain specific requirements related to confidentiality. They should also be familiar with the consent and confidentiality policies of the facility in which they practice, and they must be aware of potential ways in which confidentiality can be compromised (eg, record keeping, billing statements, insurance claims).</p><p>After a review of important aspects of minor status and the definitions of consent, notification, and judicial bypass, this topic will discuss how minor status affects the ability to consent to medical services and the different types of medical services for which minors are able to give their own consent. Confidentiality, a closely related but separate concept, is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106.html" rel="external">"Confidentiality in adolescent health care"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">MINOR STATUS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Whether an adolescent patient is able to provide consent for medical care and services often depends upon their status as a minor or adult. Various categories of minors – unemancipated, emancipated, medically emancipated, or mature minors – may be able to give their own consent depending upon the specific circumstances. The laws governing minor status vary from state to state [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].

Most states have statutes or court cases that specify the circumstances under which a minor can be considered emancipated from their parents before the age of majority. This may or may not require obtaining a formal court declaration of emancipation. The most common means of attaining emancipation are marriage, military service, or living separately from parents and managing one's own financial affairs [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p>In most cases, legal emancipation enables the minor to establish a personal residence and enter into legally binding contracts. It relieves the emancipated minor's parents from legal liability for contracts entered into by the minor [<a href="#rid4">4,6</a>]. Emancipation also generally enables a minor to consent for medical care. Proof of emancipation is not generally required for an emancipated minor to give consent for medical treatment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Medical emancipation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Medical emancipation is not a specific legal status. However, as a concept, and in practical terms, it is recognized to some degree in all states. If a minor is considered "medically emancipated," they would be allowed to consent for medical care, either generally for all care or for specific services as outlined below [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. The medically emancipated minor maintains minority status in other domains (eg, they cannot enter into most legally binding contracts). Medically emancipated minors may be financially responsible for the medical care for which they give their own consent depending on state law. (See <a class="local">'Consent for specific services'</a> below.)</p><p>The following minors are often considered medically emancipated and allowed to consent for medical care generally based upon their status, but not every state has recognized all of these categories [<a href="#rid4">4,9</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Minors who are married or were married at one time</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Minors who have a child (may consent for child, and sometimes for self)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Minors who have reached a specific age (eg, 15 years)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>High school graduates</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Minors living away from home without parental permission/financial support</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Homeless minors and runaways</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mature minors</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Mature minor</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>"Mature minor" is a category of minor status that is recognized in some states as an exception to the rules requiring parental consent for medical care [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. The mature minor doctrine, which was originally created by courts and has been incorporated into statutes in a few states, allows mature minors to consent to routine, nonemergency care, especially when the risk of treatment is considered to be low [<a href="#rid7">7,12</a>].</p><p>Mature minor status varies by state but is typically defined by [<a href="#rid11">11,13,14</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Being at least 14 years old; by the age of 14, most adolescents have cognitive skills and medical decision-making capacities similar to those of adults [<a href="#rid4">4,15</a>]. Individual states may require a different minimal age for mature minors in their statutes or court decisions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ability to understand the risks and benefits of the proposed treatment (based on the clinician's judgment).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ability to provide the same level of informed consent as an adult (based on the clinician's judgment) and actually giving consent.</p><p></p><p>Several factors must be considered when a clinician is assessing an adolescent patient for maturity. These include chronologic age; the risk, necessity, and benefit of the proposed treatment; and the adolescent's emotional and cognitive capacity for understanding the treatment information [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>Although the following factors may not be legally required to conclude that a minor is mature under the mature minor doctrine, when considering the adolescent's emotional and cognitive capacity for understanding the treatment information, it is important for the clinician to consider [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What kinds of decisions has the adolescent made in the past?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is the adolescent impulsive or developmentally delayed?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Does the adolescent have significant emotional issues that might impair judgment?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Does the adolescent have the ability to learn from past mistakes?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>How does the adolescent perceive the problem?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Does the adolescent have the means (transportation, financial means, etc) or access to the means required to complete the management plan?</p><p></p><p>When a clinician makes the determination that a minor adolescent does not meet the criteria for "mature minor" status, the adolescent should be informed that their parents must be involved in the decision-making process [<a href="#rid17">17</a>] unless there is another clear legal basis on which the adolescent can provide their own consent. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106.html" rel="external">"Confidentiality in adolescent health care"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">CONSENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Definition and implications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinician has a legal and an ethical duty to obtain informed consent when providing treatment [<a href="#rid8">8,14</a>]. Those who treat or perform procedures on a patient without consent may be liable for battery, negligence, or malpractice [<a href="#rid4">4,8</a>].</p><p>The provision of informed consent implies that the patient voluntarily agrees to medical care with a full understanding of their condition, the nature of the proposed treatment, the risks and benefits of the proposed treatment, available alternative treatments, and the risks of foregoing treatment [<a href="#rid16">16,17,19,20</a>].</p><p>Clinicians are often uncertain whether they can be held legally responsible if they provide care based on the consent of a minor. If a minor is authorized by law to provide consent, there is little likelihood that a clinician would be held liable based on a failure to obtain parental consent [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2375112339"><span class="h2">Relationship to confidentiality</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinicians must be aware of the ways in which obtaining consent or providing parental notification, as required by federal or state law, federal or state funding sources, or an individual facility's policies, affect patient confidentiality in various circumstances. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106.html" rel="external">"Confidentiality in adolescent health care"</a>.)</p><p>Although it is important for clinicians to respect their adolescent patients' privacy, it is also important to encourage the adolescent to talk with their parents about issues that affect health [<a href="#rid11">11,21-23</a>]. Many adolescents willingly inform their parents regarding their health care decisions [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Parental support can help to ensure that the adolescent's health care needs are met [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. However, mandatory parental consent or notification may have an adverse effect on some families, particularly those with a history of family violence (child abuse, sexual abuse, domestic violence) [<a href="#rid22">22,25</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Who gives consent?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Consent for medical care of minors may be provided by a number of parties (including the minor themself), depending upon the status of the minor and the state laws regarding consent for specific services, as outlined below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Minors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If the patient is an unemancipated minor, consent for medical treatment usually is provided by the parents or legal guardian.

The remaining states have no relevant, explicit policy or case law. Interestingly, some states allow a minor to consent for their child's medical care but not for their own [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].

Two states (Texas and Utah) specifically prohibit the use of state funds for contraception without parental notification. A small number of other states allow for, but do not require, notification by the provider under certain circumstances (eg, if it is necessary to protect the health of the minor) [<a href="#rid4">4,33</a>]; such notification would not be permissible if the services are paid for by Title X or Medicaid.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h2">Sexually transmitted infections</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All states and the District of Columbia allow minors to consent for diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STI). However, some states require that a minor be at least 12 or 14 years old before being allowed to consent [<a href="#rid27">27,34</a>]. The majority of states include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing and treatment as part of this service. Some states allow clinicians to inform parents their minor is seeking STI services, but only one state (Iowa) requires notification (specifically in the case of a positive HIV test) [<a href="#rid6">6,9,27,34,35</a>].

The remaining states have no relevant policy or case law. In such states, a pregnant minor may be able to consent for prenatal care under the mature minor doctrine unless they are unable to give informed consent. Among the states that explicitly permit minors to consent, less than one-third permit a clinician to inform the minor's parents under certain circumstances (eg, if it is necessary to protect the health of the minor) [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].

However, under these decisions, when states do have such a requirement, an alternative must also be in place that allows minors to obtain an abortion without first going to their parents if they are mature enough to make their own decision or the abortion is in their best interest. This procedure is most commonly a "judicial bypass," discussed below [<a href="#rid4">4,38</a>].</p><p>State laws regulating abortion in the United States are in flux (eg, in May 2022, Oklahoma banned abortion) [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. Most states that permit abortion require some parental involvement in a minor's decision to have an abortion (27 require parental consent, and 10 require parental notification but not consent) [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. Most of these states permit a minor to obtain an abortion in a medical emergency and some in cases of abuse, assault, incest, or neglect.

Judicial bypass is a process by which a minor petitions the court to allow for an abortion to take place without notifying the minor's parent(s), either because they are mature enough to give their own consent or because an abortion without parental involvement would be in their best interests. Each state has its own guidelines for this process. States may allow for a court-appointed lawyer for free, and a time limit is provided for the decision to be handed down by the court. Some organizations, such as <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.plannedparenthood.org%2F&amp;token=xXI%2By9QNEPjV52%2B%2BDeHAeZ9SXc2ukqt22nAmmnoIhbmjKCcbIKeiWKTXDj94bQ%2F4&amp;TOPIC_ID=105" target="_blank">Planned Parenthood</a>, help minors through this process by providing either guidance or a lawyer.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22"><span class="h2">Drug or alcohol care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Nearly all states allow minors to consent for services related to counseling or treatment for substance abuse, and many of these permit, but do not require, parental notification [<a href="#rid17">17,40</a>]. When minors and parents disagree about treatment for substance abuse, some states defer to the minor and some to the parent, but the majority do not specify whether the minor's or the parent's decision is controlling [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p>Parents may not be aware that adolescents can provide consent for the treatment of drug or alcohol dependency [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. In a survey of the parents of adolescents from one Midwestern state, only 13 percent of parents knew their state law permitted adolescents to consent for treatment of drug or alcohol dependency; 23 percent thought such a law was bad, 52 percent thought it was good, and 24 percent thought it was neither [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>When considering whether to notify parents in the states where parental notification is permitted, clinicians must consider whether the adolescent is capable of providing informed consent and whether parental involvement would affect treatment positively or negatively [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. In most cases, effective treatment is difficult without family participation [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23"><span class="h3">Parent-requested drug testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Parents sometimes request that a drug test be performed on a minor child or adolescent without the knowledge of the minor. The decision of whether the clinician should obtain the consent of the minor before testing is often left to clinician discretion.</p><p>When a parent requests testing without the minor's consent, it is of utmost importance to spend time with the parent(s) to [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Understand why they think the test is necessary.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Help the parent(s) understand the limitations of drug testing and more appropriate methods of detecting substance use. A negative drug screen does not exclude substance use; many drugs that are cleared quickly from the body may not be detected on a spot test. A positive test may be falsely positive [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. Drug testing provides no information about the pattern of use, dependence, or mental or physical impairments that may result from drug use. Problem drug use is more likely to be detected through a careful history: changes in friends, grades, school attendance, social patterns, sleep, weight, and appetite.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Help the parent(s) understand the potential harms of such testing (eg, erosion of trust between the minor and their parents or health care provider) [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. Because minors are legally able to consent for drug or alcohol treatment, it may be better to allow the health care provider to explore the possibility of substance use within the privacy of the provider-patient relationship.</p><p></p><p>The provider also should interview the adolescent alone, ideally after obtaining the parents' consent to share their concerns with the adolescent [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Adolescents often consent to testing when their parents' concerns are shared with them. If testing is to occur, it is essential the provider develops a plan with the parents and adolescent before the test results are obtained.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics advises that only in rare exceptions should such tests be performed without the consent of the older adolescent [<a href="#rid41">41,42</a>].

Health care providers should verify the laws governing immunization in the state in which they practice [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. By federal law, however, all vaccine providers must give patients, or their parents or legal representatives, the appropriate Vaccine Information Statement whenever a vaccination is given.</p><p>Even in states that require parental consent for immunizations, minors may be allowed to consent to the administration of hepatitis B vaccine and possibly the human papillomavirus vaccine because these vaccines prevent sexually transmitted infections [<a href="#rid1">1,13</a>].
