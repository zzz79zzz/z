Airway management for pregnant patients may be complicated by the physiologic and anatomic changes of pregnancy, increased risk of gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration, and the need to consider both maternal and fetal consequences during airway management. Airway management for more broad patient populations, and other aspects of anesthetic management for obstetric patients are discussed separately. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91218.html" rel="external">"Airway management for induction of general anesthesia"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90615.html" rel="external">"Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4480.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for cesarean delivery"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6775.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for nonobstetric surgery during pregnancy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14530973"><span class="h1">INCIDENCE AND CONSEQUENCES OF AIRWAY PROBLEMS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3231095423"><span class="h2">Incidence of difficult airway</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Difficult intubation has been reported in 0.45 to 5.7 percent of intubations in pregnant women [<a href="#rid1">1-6</a>]. Although a similar proportion of the general surgical population (5.8 percent) has difficult intubations [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], the consequences of difficult intubation can be greater in the obstetric population.</p><p>While pregnancy is associated with established risk factors for difficult and failed intubation (eg, obesity, airway edema, emergency procedures), a systematic review of the literature suggested that difficult intubation rates are similar in obstetric and non-obstetric populations [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>].</p><p>Failed intubation rates may be higher in obstetric patients. Several observational studies of obstetric patients have reported failed intubation rates of 0.18 to 0.56 percent [<a href="#rid4">4-6,10-18</a>]. In contrast, in a retrospective study of 13,380 surgical patients, only 0.045 percent had failed intubation [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. </p><p>A two year prospective survey of cases from 2008 to 2010 from the United Kingdom Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) reported a failed obstetric intubation rate of 1 in 224 (0.45 percent; 95% CI 0.36-0.56 percent) in obstetric patients over 20 weeks gestation who required general anesthesia [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In a case control study of patients from this survey, index cases had a higher incidence of hypoxemia (SpO<sub>2 </sub>&lt;90 percent) compared with controls (71 versus 2 percent), and a lower nadir SpO<sub>2 </sub>(40 versus 84 percent). The absolute rate of aspiration was higher in patients with failed intubation, but the difference was not statistically significant and numbers were small. A second UKOSS survey of cases from 2016 to 2019 reported a very low rate of gastric aspiration in patients who received general anesthesia (1.9 per 10,000 cases [95% CI 0.9-3.6]) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. </p><p>A more contemporary multicenter analysis of more than 14,000 general anesthetics for cesarean delivery at 45 centers from 2004 to 2019 yielded difficult and failed intubation rates of 2.0 (1 in 49) and 0.12 (1 in 808) percent, respectively [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Risk factors for difficult intubation included increased body mass index, Mallampati score III or IV, short thyromental distance, limited mouth opening or jaw protrusion, and limited cervical spine mobility. A diminishing rate of difficult intubation and relatively low failure rate over the study period may reflect increased use of video laryngoscopy and prioritization of neuraxial techniques. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1952740343"><span class="h2">Risk factors for difficult airway</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pregnancy-specific risk factors for difficulty with airway management are unclear. Whereas Mallampati scores have been shown to increase over the course of pregnancy and during labor, it is not clear that the incidence of difficult intubation increases as well. </p><p>At the very least, predictors of difficulty with airway management in general patient populations likely apply to pregnant patients as well. Importantly, obesity and emergency surgery are risk factors for difficulty with all aspects of airway management. Compared with normal-weight women, the parturient with severe obesity is at increased risk of cesarean delivery, emergency cesarean delivery, failed epidural, and difficult intubation (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/433.html" rel="external">"Obesity in pregnancy: Complications and maternal management"</a>). In a prospective study of parturients over 300 pounds (136.4 kg), 6 of 17 women who required general anesthesia had difficult intubations, four of which were unanticipated [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H95478368"><span class="h2">Maternal mortality</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Anesthesia-related mortality in obstetric patients is most often due to respiratory events. Respiratory problems occur not just during induction of general anesthesia, but also at emergence and recovery, or in relation to regional anesthetic complications (eg, high spinal anesthesia) [<a href="#rid22">22-24</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In an analysis comparing anesthesia-related maternal deaths related to delivery in the United States from 1991 to 1996 with those from 1997 to 2002, while cesarean fatality rates under general anesthesia fell (from 16.8 to 6.5 per million) and those under regional anesthesia rose (from 2.5 to 3.8 per million), respiratory issues remained prominent [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Overall, the leading causes of anesthesia-related pregnancy deaths for 1991 to 2002 were induction problems or intubation failure (23 percent), respiratory failure (20 percent), and high spinal or epidural block (16 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the state of Michigan from 1985 to 2003, 8 of 855 pregnancy-associated deaths were anesthesia-related, and seven were anesthesia-contributing; none of these occurred at induction of general anesthesia, but five resulted from hypoventilation or airway obstruction during emergence, extubation, or recovery [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths and Morbidity in the United Kingdom publishes reports on a triennial basis. The report for 2006 to 2008 attributed seven deaths directly to anesthesia; of these, two deaths were from failure to ventilate the lungs upon induction of anesthesia, and two resulted from postoperative airway complications: opioid-induced respiratory arrest during patient-controlled analgesia and aspiration following extubation [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. In the Confidential Enquiries review for 2009 to 2012, one of the four anesthesia-related deaths was from intraoperative bronchospasm and another was from post-extubation hypoventilation [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. In the Confidential Enquiries review for 2013 to 2015, one of the two anesthesia-related deaths was due to aspiration during induction of anesthesia in a patient with a small bowel obstruction who was to undergo a combined cesarean delivery and general surgical procedure [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A review of the literature on obstetric-failed intubations from 1970 to 2015 found that the incidence of failed intubation at cesarean delivery remained the same over the time period studied, at 0.23 percent, with one death per 90 failed intubations [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Maternal deaths were the result of aspiration, hypoxemia due to airway obstruction, or esophageal intubation.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1048196086"><span class="h2">Malpractice claims</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Difficult or failed airway management is a source of liability for anesthesia clinicians. The incidence of malpractice claims related to airway difficulty is unknown. The Anesthesia Closed Claims Project provides information about maternal injury claims, but the data are limited by lack of a uniform definition of standard of care among experts who participate in the claim settlement and by the absence of a denominator population for evaluating the incidence of complications.</p><p>A 2005 Closed Claims Analysis identified 179 claims for difficult airway management between 1985 and 1999, 9 of which occurred during cesarean delivery [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. No specific information about those 9 patients was provided. </p><p>A subsequent study of closed claims related to difficult airway management from 2000 to 2012 reported 97 claims, including 4 from obstetric patients who were difficult to intubate at induction of anesthesia [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. All four patients were obese and two had preeclampsia; the study did not report whether difficulty with airway management was anticipated.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H588503118"><span class="h1">ANATOMIC AND PHYSIOLOGIC CHANGES OF PREGNANCY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ante- and intrapartum anatomic and physiologic changes of the airway, gastrointestinal system, and respiratory function can increase the risk for a difficult intubation, as well as the risk of complications when airway difficulty occurs. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Airway changes</strong> – Pregnancy weight gain and increased breast size can make optimal head and neck positioning difficult and can decrease the space available to open the mandible and place the laryngoscope blade. The use of a short laryngoscope handle can be helpful. The need to maintain a tilted body position for left uterine displacement may also impede optimal positioning for airway management.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">As gestation advances, the oropharyngeal diameter appears to narrow, possibly due to oropharyngeal edema from fluid retention [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. In a study that used the modified Mallampati classification  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75229" href="/d/graphic/75229.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) to evaluate maternal airways, the number of patients with Mallampati class 4 airways increased by 34 percent between 12 and 38 weeks of gestation, and the increase correlated significantly with weight gain [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. However, it is unclear whether the increase in Mallampati scores with advancing gestation also increases the risk of difficult intubation. In a single center review of over 100,000 deliveries of ≥20 weeks gestation over approximately 20 years, advancing gestational age was not a predictor of airway difficulty, though the number of reported events was small [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Hyperemia and growth of nasal polyps increase the risk of bleeding with placement of nasal airways or nasal fiberoptic intubation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91218.html" rel="external">"Airway management for induction of general anesthesia", section on 'Airway examination'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4788.html" rel="external">"Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Dyspnea and other physiologic respiratory changes", section on 'Physiologic pulmonary changes in pregnancy'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Labor and delivery itself can also have adverse effects on the airway  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87272" href="/d/graphic/87272.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). In studies evaluating airway changes between the onset and the end of labor, significant decreases in oral volume and pharyngeal area and volume were observed, and the modified Mallampati classification increased by one grade in 33 percent of parturients and by two grades in 5 percent of parturients [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. The airway changes that occur during labor persist into the postpartum period, and should be considered when general anesthesia is used for surgery after delivery. In one study, worsening Mallampati class occurred during labor, was not predicted by longer duration of labor or greater volume of fluids administered, and had not fully returned to baseline at 48 hours postpartum [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. In a single center review of difficult and failed intubation during anesthesia for over 100,000 deliveries, the two failed intubations occurred in patients who underwent postpartum tubal ligation [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Airway changes during labor may be more severe in patients with preeclampsia. In one single center prospective cohort study, sonographic airway measurements and Mallampati scoring were used to evaluate airway changes in preeclamptic and non-preeclamptic parturients during and after labor [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. The Mallampati score increased from prelabor to post-labor in women with and without preeclampsia, and those with preeclampsia had more prominent tissue thickness at the hyoid level throughout labor. Even when not in labor, patients with preeclampsia may have greater upper airway narrowing and heightened airway reactivity compared with non-preeclamptic parturients [<a href="#rid34">34,35</a>]. In a registry study of more than 400 cases of general anesthesia for cesarean delivery, induction hypoxemia (SpO2 &lt;90%) occurred twice as often (19 versus 9%) in women with hypertension, likely reflecting increased airway and pulmonary edema [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gastrointestinal changes</strong> – The obstetric patient is at increased risk of aspiration of gastric contents due to hormonal and anatomic changes in pregnancy, including lower esophageal sphincter incompetence with associated gastroesophageal reflux, low gastric pH, and distortion of the gastric anatomy due to the enlarging uterus [<a href="#rid37">37</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/407.html" rel="external">"Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Gastrointestinal tract"</a>). Gastric emptying is normal during pregnancy [<a href="#rid38">38</a>], but is delayed by labor and by administration of parenteral or neuraxial opioids for labor analgesia [<a href="#rid39">39-41</a>]. In a patient with a full stomach without protective airway reflexes (ie, after induction of anesthesia), difficulties in airway management prolong the period of risk for aspiration.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Respiratory changes</strong> – Increased metabolic oxygen consumption combined with a progressive decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC) during gestation render pregnant patients less tolerant of apnea; there is a shorter time between onset of apnea and development of hypoxemia when general anesthesia is induced. This shortens the available time to respond to airway difficulty. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4788.html" rel="external">"Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Dyspnea and other physiologic respiratory changes", section on 'Physiologic pulmonary changes in pregnancy'</a> and <a class="local">'Preoxygenation and apneic oxygenation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3061274049"><span class="h1">PLANNING THE APPROACH TO AIRWAY MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For elective surgery, similar to nonpregnant patients, airway management in pregnant patients is part of the overall plan for anesthesia. However, general anesthesia in the peripartum period is often performed for emergency surgery. Whenever possible, pregnant patients with risk factors for difficulty with airway management should have antenatal anesthesia consultation, to allow advance planning for labor analgesia and airway management for possible cesarean delivery, even if vaginal delivery is expected. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4480.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for cesarean delivery", section on 'Preoperative assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Ideally, the airway of every patient on the labor floor should be evaluated soon after admission. If a patient has a potentially difficult airway, specific plans should be formulated for airway management, should it become necessary, and the entire care team (anesthesiologist, obstetrician, nursing staff) made aware. For most patients with predicted difficulty with airway management, neuraxial analgesia should be established early to avoid the need for general anesthesia and airway management for possible cesarean delivery. (See <a class="local">'Use regional anesthesia'</a> below.) </p><p>The widespread use of neuraxial techniques during labor and cesarean deliveries has significantly reduced the use of general anesthesia for delivery [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. Due to the infrequent occurrence of difficult and failed airway, all personnel working on obstetric units should regularly review the difficult airway algorithms (see <a class="local">'Management of the difficult airway'</a> below); simulator training and drills can serve to improve and maintain skills [<a href="#rid43">43</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3274968149"><span class="h2">Recognition of the difficult airway</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bedside tests to predict difficulty with airway management in the general population are shown in tables, and are discussed separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108981" href="/d/graphic/108981.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94434" href="/d/graphic/94434.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94436" href="/d/graphic/94436.html" rel="external">table 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94433" href="/d/graphic/94433.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91218.html" rel="external">"Airway management for induction of general anesthesia", section on 'Prediction of the difficult airway'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90615.html" rel="external">"Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults", section on 'Recognition of the difficult airway'</a>.)</p><p>Similar to non-pregnant patients, the ability to predict airway difficulty is limited in pregnant patients. As an example, in a prospective study of airway evaluation using five predictors of difficult intubation prior to emergency cesarean delivery, the majority (79 percent) of difficult intubations were missed [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. Similarly, in a review of failed obstetric intubations over 45 years, two-thirds were not predicted to be difficult [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Despite the lack of sensitivity, at the very least, preoperative airway assessment forces the clinician to think about potential difficulty with airway management.</p><p>The airway can worsen during the course of labor, so patients should be re-examined prior to airway management if significant time has elapsed since the initial airway evaluation. In particular, the size of the tongue and uvula should be noted for women in prolonged labor or who are pre-eclamptic  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87272" href="/d/graphic/87272.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1354307184"><span class="h2">Use regional anesthesia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For both elective and emergency cesarean delivery, one reason that neuraxial anesthesia may be preferred is to avoid the need to manage the airway. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4480.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for cesarean delivery", section on 'General versus neuraxial anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p>Patients at high risk of a cesarean delivery may benefit from having a functional epidural in place in the event an anesthetic is required urgently. Particularly for patients with possible difficult airways, or those in whom rapid neuraxial placement may be difficult (eg, obesity), it is prudent to place an epidural, and verify that it is functional, before there is urgent need for it. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/101803.html" rel="external">"Neuraxial analgesia for labor and delivery (including instrumental delivery)", section on 'Preparation for surgical anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p>Most urgent cesarean deliveries may be performed under neuraxial anesthesia; when a labor epidural is in place, it can be quickly dosed for surgical delivery.
