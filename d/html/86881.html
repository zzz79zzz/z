Initial antimicrobial therapy should provide broad-spectrum coverage tailored to host factors, such as age and underlying medical conditions, and be administered as soon as possible after presentation at doses appropriate for patients with life-threatening infections. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/85767.html" rel="external">"Septic shock in children in resource-abundant settings: Rapid recognition and initial resuscitation (first hour)", section on 'Empiric antibiotic therapy'</a>.) </p><p>Subsequent antimicrobial treatment should be optimized based upon results of culture and/or highly accurate means of pathogen detection (eg, polymerase chain reaction or other assays) in collaboration with an infectious disease specialist.</p><p>Source control (physical measures undertaken to eradicate a focus of infection, to eliminate ongoing microbial contamination, and to render a site inhospitable to microbial growth and invasion) should be undertaken when possible, because localized foci of infection (ie, abscess) may not respond to antibiotics alone  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59769" href="/d/graphic/59769.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends that source-control intervention be implemented as soon possible after a diagnosis of an infection amenable to a source-control procedure is made [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. As examples, potentially infected foreign bodies should be removed and abscesses, infected fluid collections, or infected tissues should be percutaneously or surgically drained and/or debrided (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7662.html" rel="external">"Necrotizing soft tissue infections", section on 'Treatment'</a>). If an indwelling intravascular access device is suspected or confirmed to be the source of sepsis or septic shock, it should be removed after other vascular access has been established if the pathogen is unlikely to be effectively treated with antibiotics alone [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. </p><p>A careful history and physical examination often yield clues to the source of sepsis and help guide subsequent microbiologic evaluation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59769" href="/d/graphic/59769.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Gram stain of suspicious fluids may give early clues to the etiology of infection while cultures are incubating. In addition to cultures of specific sites, aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures should be drawn. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2133.html" rel="external">"Detection of bacteremia: Blood cultures and other diagnostic tests"</a>.)</p><p>Additional investigations targeted to the suspected source(s) should be obtained based upon specific physical findings as soon as possible, ideally within the first 6 to 12 hours. Studies may include imaging (eg, computed tomography and/or ultrasonography) or sample acquisition (eg, bronchoalveolar lavage, aspirating fluid collections or joints, abscess drainage, or thoracentesis). It should be noted that benefits of interventional procedures must be balanced with potential risk for unstable patients.</p><p>If invasive fungal<em> </em>infection is suspected, serologic assays for 1,3 beta-D-glucan and galactomannan testing or other nonculture methods (eg, in-house polymerase chain reaction testing), if available, may provide early evidence of fungal infections and support empiric antifungal therapy, although evidence is limited in children. These assays are discussed separately. However, appropriate cultures or biopsy of infected tissue are still necessary to confirm the presence of fungal infection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5976.html" rel="external">"Candidemia and invasive candidiasis in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Nonculture methods'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15717.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis", section on 'Galactomannan antigen detection'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15717.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis", section on 'Beta-D-glucan assay'</a>.)</p><p>Empiric antifungal coverage under the guidance of a pediatric infectious disease specialist is warranted in selected high-risk patients, such as children with immunosuppressive conditions or on parenteral nutrition.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H627387"><span class="h2">Continue respiratory support</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Oxygenation should be monitored using continuous pulse oximetry. Based upon trials of oxygen delivery in adults, children with septic shock and hypoxemia should be treated with supplemental oxygen, as needed, to maintain oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) at 94 to 96 percent (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1622.html" rel="external">"Adverse effects of supplemental oxygen"</a>). Otherwise, patients who can maintain pulse oximetry in this range in room air do not warrant supplemental oxygen unless they have severe anemia (eg, hemoglobin &lt;7 gm/dL [hematocrit 21 percent]).</p><p>In patients with continued shock, worsening hypoxemia, or progression to PARDS, advanced airway support (ie, noninvasive or invasive ventilation) is frequently needed. A trial of noninvasive mechanical ventilation (over invasive mechanical ventilation) in children with hypoxemia and normal mentation/ability to protect their airway who do not have overt respiratory failure <strong>and </strong>who are responding to initial resuscitation is reasonable [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. However, for children with high metabolic demand from refractory shock, typically indicated by progressive lactic acidemia and end-organ dysfunction, early intubation and mechanical ventilation prior to overt hypoxemic or hypercarbic respiratory failure can help to mitigate deficits in systemic oxygen delivery [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Mechanical ventilation should be performed with the following goals in mind [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Keep plateau pressure ≤30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Keep tidal volume under 10 mL/kg ideal body weight.

This is especially important for children who do not improve with initial fluid resuscitation or develop signs of fluid overload, for whom direct assessment of cardiac function can more accurately gauge physiologic derangements than physical examination alone [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. As an example, in one case series of 48 children who remained in septic shock despite at least 40 mL/kg of fluid, 33 percent had persistent hypovolemia and 40 percent had myocardial dysfunction. Serial monitoring detected clinically important changes, including late development of myocardial dysfunction, that allowed for more refined titration of fluids, inotropes, and vasopressors over time [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>In addition, the clinician should determine the need for invasive monitoring via intra-arterial and central venous cannulas:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intra-arterial cannula placement</strong> – Noninvasive blood pressure measurement is acceptable in patients who have markedly improved or had total reversal of septic shock. Efforts to obtain intra-arterial access should <strong>not</strong> interfere with the resuscitation of septic shock. However, automated blood pressures overestimate systolic blood pressure relative to intra-arterial or Doppler ultrasound measurements in hypotensive children and underestimate systolic blood pressure among hypertensive patients [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Thus, insertion of an intra-arterial catheter is suggested if blood pressure is labile or if restoration of arterial perfusion pressures is expected to be a protracted process. Procedures for obtaining intra-arterial access in children are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6327.html" rel="external">"Arterial puncture and cannulation in children", section on 'Arterial cannulation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Central venous access</strong> – Central venous access is indicated for patients with fluid-resistant septic shock because these patients frequently are dependent upon uninterrupted vasoactive medication administration to prevent further decompensation. If they also have poor perfusion, then they are at a greatly increased risk of extravasation and significant local tissue damage from peripherally administered vasoactive medications. Furthermore, central venous access permits monitoring of central venous pressures and ScvO<sub>2</sub> in these unstable patients, which helps guide ongoing therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Central venous access is also appropriate in patients who have reversal of shock after initiation of vasoactive drugs, although patients who rapidly improve after receiving vasoactive medications and those in whom a rapid weaning of support is expected may not require central venous line placement.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the absence of elevated intra-abdominal pressure, the correlation between femoral vein pressure and central venous pressure is good, though absolute values may differ slightly [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. Changes in ScvO<sub>2</sub>, which provide reliable information regarding tissue oxygenation, should also be frequently monitored [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. If direct measure of ScvO<sub>2</sub> is not available, limited evidence suggests that a capillary refill time ≤2 seconds is associated with a ScvO<sub>2</sub> ≥70 percent. However, capillary refill time can be brisk despite significant myocardial dysfunction in children with septic shock. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6397.html" rel="external">"Shock in children in resource-abundant settings: Initial management", section on 'Clinical and physiologic targets'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18270347"><span class="h2">Continue fluid administration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The need for aggressive administration of fluids to optimize tissue perfusion and to achieve physiologic goals typically continues beyond the first hour of care in children with septic shock treated in health care systems with access to intensive care (either locally or via interhospital transport). The volume per bolus and types of fluid are as for the resuscitation period. Fluid input and output should be carefully monitored on an hourly basis  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef128375" href="/d/graphic/128375.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/85767.html" rel="external">"Septic shock in children in resource-abundant settings: Rapid recognition and initial resuscitation (first hour)", section on 'Fluid resuscitation'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with persistent poor perfusion or hypotension, boluses of fluids should continue until hemodynamic improvement is noted or evidence of cardiac insufficiency/fluid overload (eg, pulmonary edema, hepatomegaly, enlarged heart, or gallop cardiac rhythm) occurs. Serial bedside cardiac ultrasound or echocardiography can also help to identify patients who remain hypovolemic. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18272996"><span class="h3">Fluid overload</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Fluid overload frequently occurs in children with septic shock. Observational studies in critically ill children, including children with sepsis who received renal replacement therapies, indicate that more than 10 percent fluid overload is associated with mortality [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. However, the evidence is not sufficient to determine whether or not fluid overload has an independent deleterious effect on survival. Non-survivors may have had more severe septic shock, and therefore required greater amount of fluid and were more likely to develop renal insufficiency.</p><p>Patients with septic shock with insufficient urine output and evidence of fluid overload despite fluid restriction and diuretic therapy may warrant renal replacement therapy (RRT; eg, continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis). The decision to initiate RRT should be made in collaboration with a pediatric nephrologist, whenever available. If RRT is used, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests against high-volume hemofiltration over standard hemofiltration in children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction.
