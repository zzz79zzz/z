         Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rapidly progressive, life-threatening syndrome of excessive immune activation. Prompt initiation of treatment for HLH is essential for the survival of affected patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         The treatment and prognosis of patients with HLH and the macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), a form of HLH in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and other rheumatologic conditions, will be discussed here. The genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis of HLH are presented separately. (See

         HLH is a progressive syndrome of unchecked immune activation and tissue damage. If left untreated, patients with HLH survive for only a few months, due to progressive multi-organ failure. In 1994, the Histiocyte Society organized the first treatment protocol for HLH (HLH-94), which dramatically increased this survival rate to 54 percent with a median follow-up of six years [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Often, the greatest barrier to treatment and a successful outcome for individuals with HLH is a delay in diagnosis. Several aspects of the clinical presentation of HLH contribute to this delay, including the rarity of the syndrome, the variable clinical presentation, and the lack of specificity of the clinical and laboratory findings. Diagnostic criteria for HLH are based upon those used in the major HLH studies, and therefore may be too stringent to capture all patients with HLH. Thus, treatment is appropriate for some who do not meet the strict diagnostic criteria but for whom there is a high degree of clinical suspicion for HLH. Any patient with suspected HLH should be seen by a hematologist, and those who are acutely ill should be transferred emergently to a facility where they can receive HLH therapy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/87499.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis", section on 'Evaluation and diagnostic testing'
         </a>
         and
         <a class="local">
          'Hematologist referral and pretreatment testing'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The goal of therapy for patients with HLH is to suppress life-threatening inflammation by destroying immune cells. Induction therapy based on the HLH-94 protocol consists of a series of weekly treatments with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">
          dexamethasone

         and
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8430" href="/z/d/drug information/8430.html" rel="external">

          hydrocortisone
         </a>
         are given to those with central nervous system disease. After induction, patients who are recovering are weaned off therapy, while those who are not improving are continued on therapy as a bridge to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). HCT will be required in those with an HLH gene mutation, central nervous system disease, or disease relapse.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2004, a new HLH protocol was initiated (HLH-2004). The major modifications were to use
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9217" href="/z/d/drug information/9217.html" rel="external">
          cyclosporine
         </a>
         earlier (ie, during the induction phase of therapy), and to add
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8535" href="/z/d/drug information/8535.html" rel="external">
          hydrocortisone
         </a>
         to the intrathecal
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/z/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">
          methotrexate
         </a>
         . Until the results of this trial are available, we prefer to treat patients with a regimen based on the HLH-94 protocol. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial HLH-specific therapy'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no one parameter that drives the decision to start HLH-specific therapy. If a patient is clinically stable and the ferritin is consistently below 10,000 ng/mL or rises from 1000 to 3000 ng/mL with only slightly elevated D-dimer and liver enzymes, this author would not start treatment. However, if those two parameters became progressively more abnormal, early initiation of at least
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">
          dexamethasone
         </a>
         treatment may halt the inflammation. Importantly, treatment should not be withheld while awaiting results of genetic or specialized immunologic testing. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Hematologist referral and pretreatment testing'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">
          'Acutely ill or deteriorating patients'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The appearance of hemophagocytosis on serial bone marrow studies is not necessarily a sign of disease worsening. For patients who also have a triggering infection or rheumatologic condition, treatment of the triggering condition should be initiated simultaneously with HLH-specific chemotherapy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Infection'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">
          'MAS/Rheumatologic conditions'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         When HLH is triggered by an acute infection or other condition (eg, rheumatologic condition), treatment of the trigger is appropriate because this may remove the stimulus for immune activation. Patients who are less acutely ill and stable may be able to tolerate treatment of the triggering condition alone without HLH-specific therapy; this strategy may allow some patients to avoid potentially toxic therapy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinically stable patients'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a form of HLH associated with juvenile inflammatory arthritis (JIA) and other rheumatologic conditions. Patients with MAS represent a subset of those with HLH for whom successful therapy of the underlying condition may produce a good response and allow the patient to avoid HLH-specific therapy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/87499.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis", section on 'Rheumatologic disorders/MAS'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with malignancy-induced HLH require control of the HLH followed by treatment of the underlying malignancy. Unless the malignancy can be cured and the stimulus for HLH permanently eliminated, we perform hematopoietic cell transplant. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial HLH-specific therapy'
         </a>

         Rapid treatment of HLH is essential, especially for those who are acutely ill or clinically deteriorating. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Acutely ill or deteriorating patients'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         If a clinician with experience using the agents required for the HLH-94 protocol is not available, transfer to another facility should be initiated immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite the significant improvement in survival with the HLH-94 protocol, mortality with HLH remains high. Thus, clinicians are encouraged to enroll patients in clinical trials testing HLH therapies or other clinical or research questions. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial HLH-specific therapy'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>

         We perform the following pre-therapy testing in all patients:

         HLA typing and search for an HCT donor – Patients with HLH gene mutations, hematologic malignancy, relapsing symptoms on or off therapy, and/or central nervous system disease will require HCT. Because the response to therapy is not known at the time therapy is started, all patients and appropriate family members should undergo HLA typing to facilitate identification of an HCT donor. Early initiation of HLA typing and selection of a donor shortens the pretransplantation interval, potentially improving the likelihood of survival [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. If siblings are considered as potential donors, they should be tested for HLH gene mutations as well, to confirm that the donor does not have undiagnosed HLH. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant'

         Disease markers – It is important to be able to monitor disease response to therapy because treatment may need to be escalated if the patient is not improving. The distinction between chemotherapy toxicity and worsening disease may be difficult to make clinically. We do baseline immunologic studies (eg, soluble IL-2 receptor alpha [sCD25], soluble hemoglobin-haptoglobin scavenger receptor [sCD163]) as well as other markers of disease activity (eg, complete blood count, ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, liver function tests).

         Patients who are clinically stable and have a condition responsible for triggering HLH (eg, infection, rheumatologic condition) may respond to treatment of the triggering condition alone. The major triggering conditions are infection, rheumatologic conditions, and lymphoid malignancies. A search for these conditions can be undertaken in clinically stable patients, provided that the patient's status does not deteriorate. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/87499.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Deterioration during the search or therapy for the underlying condition is an indication to start HLH-specific therapy immediately. (See

          'Infection'

        <p>
         For patients with hematologic malignancies, HLH should be treated with HLH-specific therapy, followed by appropriate chemotherapy for the malignancy; often hematopoietic cell transplant will also be required. (See

         Infection should be diagnosed rapidly, and empiric antibiotic, antifungal, antiviral, or antiparasitic therapy should be initiated depending on the suspected organism(s). Thus, an extensive list of infectious agents should be tested for including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6), parvovirus,
         <em>

         When active EBV infection is identified by finding &gt;10,000 copies of EBV/mcg cellular DNA, we treat with

          Leishmania

         Patients who are clinically stable and respond rapidly (eg, within two to three days) to treatment of the infection may be able to avoid HLH-specific chemotherapy. However, initiation of HLH-specific therapy for severely ill patients should not be delayed while awaiting resolution of a system infection.

         Some patients with an underlying condition that causes immunosuppression or disrupts immune homeostasis will respond to disease-specific therapy. We have had success treating the triggering condition alone and deferring HLH-specific therapy in patients with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS; ie, HLH associated with a rheumatologic condition). (See

        </p>
        <p>
         If a patient with a rheumatologic condition is stable enough to delay HLH-specific therapy, we treat with a course of corticosteroids and/or other therapy for the underlying condition. For patients with MAS, increased immunosuppression for the underlying rheumatologic disorder is often effective without the need for HLH-specific therapy.

         Patients with HLH who have deteriorating organ function (eg, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, or neurologic) should be treated immediately with HLH-specific treatment. Treatment should not be delayed while awaiting genetic or specialized immunologic testing. (See

        <p>
         With such patients, there is typically concordance between clinical findings and laboratory abnormalities (eg, rising serum ferritin, D-dimer, liver enzyme, sCD25, or sCD163 levels). The following patient scenarios illustrate our approach to determining whether patients are ill enough to need HLH-specific therapy (see

         Among patients who are acutely ill or deteriorating, we suggest HLH-specific therapy based on the HLH-94 protocol or enrollment in a clinical trial. More than half of patients treated with the HLH-94 regimen achieve five-year survival [

         If the patient is not severely ill (eg, does not have deteriorating cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, or neurologic function), it may be possible to treat the triggering condition with the addition of corticosteroids, and to observe the patient for a response prior to initiating chemotherapy. For those who show clinical improvement upon treatment of the triggering condition, it may be possible to avoid chemotherapy, although this is the rare exception rather than the rule. (See
         <a class="local">

          cyclosporine
         </a>
         starting at week nine (6 mg/kg daily in divided doses; target trough level 200 mcg/L). However, cyclosporine is associated with the development of the posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), and the benefit is unproven. Thus, we do
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         use cyclosporine. However, some hematologists do use cyclosporine in patients who are severely ill, along with aggressive control of blood pressure and close monitoring for PRES. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)'

        </p>
        <p>
         When patients do not show a response to this therapy within two to three weeks (eg, with improvement in clinical status and disease markers), salvage therapy should be considered. If the patient is still febrile and has unchanged hepatomegaly, it is unlikely the laboratory parameters will be improving. Usually patients requiring salvage therapy will have a minor, or no, drop in ferritin levels, D-dimer, or liver enzymes. If the patient has improved clinical function, but unchanged laboratory parameters, the decision of changing to salvage therapy must be highly individualized. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Relapsed or refractory disease'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who initially respond well and then worsen upon tapering of chemotherapy can often be successfully retreated with the original agents. Clinical worsening during induction therapy should also prompt a search for a new or previously untreated associated condition that could affect the patient's clinical status or trigger worsening of the HLH. For distinction between disease worsening versus infection or therapy-related toxicities, following disease markers can be especially helpful. (See
         <a class="local">

         Induction therapy may be delayed in those with an associated condition who are stable enough to attempt therapy of the underlying condition first. (See

         CNS involvement by HLH is associated with a poor prognosis, especially in those who do not have a concurrent CNS infection. Most patients with CNS involvement will require hematopoietic cell transplantation after completing induction therapy. (See

         Patients with HLH are at risk of developing PRES, which presents with headache, altered consciousness, visual disturbances, and/or seizures. PRES is associated with characteristic findings on MRI (vasogenic cerebral edema predominantly in the posterior cerebral hemispheres). There are no specific diagnostic tests. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4835.html" rel="external">
          "Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         PRES is reversible if recognized and treated promptly. If the patient has hypertension, this should be controlled as rapidly as possible. Electrolyte disturbances and fluid overload should be corrected, and infections should be treated.
        </p>
        <p>
         PRES has specifically been associated with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9217" href="/z/d/drug information/9217.html" rel="external">
          cyclosporine
         </a>
         use. If a patient receiving cyclosporine develops PRES, we stop the cyclosporine immediately. We may also withdraw or lower the dose of other cytotoxic agents (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8430" href="/z/d/drug information/8430.html" rel="external">
          etoposide
         </a>
         ). We may reduce the dose of

          dexamethasone
         </a>
         , but this increases the risk of HLH relapse. Intrathecal therapy is postponed until PRES resolves.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is also critical to distinguish whether another cause of neurologic findings is contributing to neurologic deterioration (eg, intracranial hemorrhage, CNS infection). (See

         For the majority of patients, these parameters will identify organ involvement and correlate with the course of the HLH (eg, worsening or responding to therapy). However, it is possible that some of these will worsen due to a new infection or treatment toxicity. Thus, we also monitor disease-specific markers as outlined in the following section.

Some patients continue to have serum ferritin in the 500 to 1000 ng/mL range and liver enzymes two to four times above normal for one to two months, but by three months all laboratory parameters should be normal. A relapse is signaled by fever, organomegaly, and steadily increasing ferritin, D-dimer, and liver enzymes, with falling hemoglobin level and platelet count. (See

         </a>
         . CNS abnormalities that fail to resolve during the initial post-transplantation period can be treated with intrathecal therapy until full donor immune reconstitution occurs. A review of 94 patients with HLH who received reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) found that 8 percent had CNS relapses; CNS relapse was often associated with a low level of donor chimerism [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         For those who had CNS disease, we do a CSF analysis once during the first 100 days after HCT, even if the patient is asymptomatic. We also do contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain to document resolution of abnormalities if these were present. Although there are no data to suggest when HLH abnormalities should be expected to resolve, six months is a reasonable estimate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients are also instructed to seek medical attention rapidly for fever, signs of infection, neurologic changes, and any other concerning symptoms that suggest HLH recurrence.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because case reports have suggested that vaccinations can trigger HLH, we withhold all vaccinations during the first six months following therapy. Once we resume vaccinations, we administer them one at a time rather than giving several in the same visit, to minimize the risk of causing an immunologic event that could trigger HLH recurrence.

         To attain long-term cure of the disease, we suggest hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) in patients with the following underlying conditions, based on their high mortality rate and high risk of relapse [

        </p>
        <p>
         Most HLH-inducing hematologic malignancies are persistent triggers of HLH (likely from persistent antigen presentation) and will continue to induce HLH unless allogeneic HCT is performed [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,10,17-23
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, we suggest HCT following HLH-specific therapy in the setting of a hematologic malignancy that cannot be cured with conventional chemotherapy. However, if one can treat the HLH
         <strong>
          and
         </strong>
         cure the malignancy, and the patient has normal natural killer (NK) cell function, a transplant may not be required.
        </p>
        <p>
         The need for HCT in patients with heterozygous HLH mutations is not known, and we manage these patients on a case-by-case basis guided by their clinical course. Management of siblings who are asymptomatic carriers of biallelic HLH mutations is discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Asymptomatic carriers'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In practice, the indications for HCT apply to almost all young children (eg, less than two years of age). The only situation in which we would
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         perform HCT for a young child is if the HLH was clearly triggered by a viral infection and resolves with specific antiviral therapy; the disease was completely treated by induction therapy; NK cell function was normal following therapy; and laboratory evaluation remained normal for six months.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with HLH have underlying immune defects and organ damage that affect their ability to tolerate HCT. The greater risk of transplant-related morbidity and mortality in this population necessitates that transplantation be done at a center with experience using HCT for HLH if at all possible [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Preparation for allogeneic HCT should be initiated at the time of diagnosis, and should include HLA typing and search for a suitable HCT donor. Genetic studies should also be sent at the time of diagnosis so that the results of these studies are available and can be incorporated into the decision to pursue HCT. The possibility of an occult predisposition or undiagnosed HLH in a sibling donor due to heterozygosity or homozygosity for an HLH gene mutation should be factored into the donor selection process. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/87499.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis", section on 'Genetic testing'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For those who require HCT, therapy should be continued after the initial eight weeks with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8430" href="/z/d/drug information/8430.html" rel="external">

         Remission of HLH prior to transplant is associated with less transplant-associated morbidity, so we try to induce remission in all patients. This must be balanced with the need to initiate HCT as soon as possible due to the risk of disease recurrence and the potential toxicities of a longer duration of

         There are insufficient data to specify the optimal source of hematopoietic cells (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood). Various sources have been used, but none have been compared in a randomized trial due to the rarity of the disease [
         <a href="#rid25">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The most appropriate donor for HCT needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Siblings may be heterozygous or homozygous for HLH mutations, so genetic analysis should be done to ensure that the donor does not have undiagnosed HLH.
        </p>
        <p>
         No trials comparing reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) with myeloablative regimens have been conducted. But two publications provide some insight.
        </p>
        <p>
         Reduced-intensity conditioning for transplant of HLH patients was superior to myeloablative conditioning with 92 percent surviving with the former and only 43 percent with the latter in a single center study [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The two-year overall survival for adult and adolescent HLH patients after allogeneic stem cell transplant was 63 percent from another center [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. All patients with primary HLH survived but the survival for EBV-associated was 64 percent and tumor- or unknown associations 50 percent.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the absence of direct comparative data, we suggest RIC regimens rather than myeloablative regimens in order to reduce the high transplant-associated morbidity and to improve survival [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Support for the use of RIC in patients with HLH undergoing HCT comes from several small series that have shown greater survival with RIC compared with reported survival for myeloablative regimens. Survival rates in the range of 75 to 100 percent have been reported in series of 10 to 30 patients who received RIC regimens [

         Following HCT, patients need to be monitored for disease recurrence, primary loss of the allograft, and HCT complications.

         Monthly monitoring for disease recurrence is similar to that for patients who have completed induction therapy alone. Patients are instructed to seek medical attention rapidly for fever, signs of infection, neurologic changes, and any other concerning symptoms that suggest HLH recurrence. (See

         For those who had CNS involvement, we do a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis once during the first 100 days after HCT, even if the patient is asymptomatic. We also do contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain to document resolution of abnormalities if these were present. Although there are no data to suggest when HLH abnormalities should be expected to resolve, six months is a reasonable estimate. CNS abnormalities that fail to resolve can be treated with intrathecal therapy during the initial post-transplantation period until full donor immune reconstitution occurs. (See

         Loss of the allograft is common after HCT for HLH. An international collaborative study reported that a donor chimerism level of 20 to 30 percent was sufficient to protect against late reactivation [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, we monitor donor engraftment on a weekly basis during the first months after transplant, using appropriate polymorphic markers for genetic differences between the recipient and donor [

         We attempt to increase the donor graft component if chimerism decreases to less than 50 to 60 percent. We first reduce graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, and if this is ineffective, we use donor lymphocyte infusions when possible. (See

         Some patients are intolerant of initial therapy for HLH, while others have disease that is refractory to initial treatment or progresses as induction therapy is being tapered, after having achieved remission, or while awaiting hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Refractory or relapsed (r/r) HLH may be manifest as clinical deterioration (eg, worsening fever, organomegaly, neurologic findings, hepatitis, pancytopenia) or by steadily increasing disease markers (eg, serum ferritin, sCD25, sCD163). It is important to recognize that a new infection or treatment-related toxicity (eg, from chemotherapy or antibiotic-associated thrombocytopenia) may mimic recurrent or progressive disease. (See

Emapalumab was well-tolerated; a serious adverse event attributable to the drug was reported in 7 percent, there were no infusion reactions, and it did not appear to amplify adverse events associated with the underlying r/r HLH. Serum levels of CXCL9, a chemokine that is induced exclusively by interferon gamma, declined in parallel with improvements in clinical and laboratory parameters of HLH.

         was associated with better survival (odds ratio 0.21; 95% CI 0.05-0.94). Other series of adults have also demonstrated a worse prognosis when HLH is associated with malignancy, especially T cell lymphomas (median survival approximately one to two months for those with malignancy, compared with approximately two to four years for those without malignancy) [

         The risk of relapse should be minimized by reducing exposure to triggering conditions if possible. This includes maintaining control of underlying rheumatologic conditions and hematologic malignancies, and preventing infections and other alterations of immune homeostasis. Since recurrences following vaccination have been reported, we avoid vaccination for the first six months after treatment and then administer vaccinations one-at-a-time rather than combining several vaccinations during the same visit [

         We suggest testing siblings for the mutation identified in the affected patient (ie, index case). Families that carry HLH-associated mutations should receive counseling and education regarding risks and outcomes in family members, approaches to preventing acute illness, and birth control. Such evaluation and counseling should take place in a center with substantial experience with management of HLH.

         For asymptomatic carriers (ie, siblings who carry the same biallelic mutation as the index case), a decision regarding pre-emptive allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) versus observation coupled with treatment after HLH develops must be individualized based on the specific mutation, institutional practice, and concerns of the family and/or patient. Preemptive transplantation for certain mutations (eg,
         <em>
          PRF1
         </em>
         ) is associated with superior survival with acceptable toxicity, but the risk-benefit balance is less clear for some other mutations (eg, MUNC18-2 deficiency). Among the factors to be considered are variability in the age of onset, unpredictability of environmental triggers for HLH (eg, infections), the substantial risk of death from HLH even when asymptomatic carriers are carefully monitored, and ethical aspects of subjecting an asymptomatic individual (typically a child) to a procedure associated with significant treatment-related toxicity and risk of death [
         <a href="#rid56">

        </p>
        <p>
         A retrospective international study reported outcomes of 32 asymptomatic carriers who carried the same biallelic genetic defect as their index case sibling; median age of asymptomatic carriers at diagnosis was five months [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ]. Preemptive allogeneic HCT was performed in 16 asymptomatic carriers, and 15 remained alive without HLH after median follow-up of 39 months. Six other asymptomatic carriers did not develop HLH during the period of follow-up, and among 10 asymptomatic carriers who did develop HLH, only six were alive (two deaths from HLH progression and two from treatment-related mortality). Outcomes appeared to vary with the specific mutation. Children with
         <em>
          PRF1
         </em>
         mutations (the most common cause of HLH) were most likely to have onset of HLH early in life and had the closest concordance with the age of onset in the index case sibling; 7 of 11 asymptomatic carriers with
         <em>
          PRF1
         </em>
         mutations developed HLH within one month from diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ]. Conversely, MUNC18-2 deficiency was associated with a milder form of HLH and only one of five asymptomatic carriers experienced HLH during more than three years of follow-up.

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a syndrome of multi-organ failure caused by unchecked macrophage- and lymphocyte-mediated inflammation. Underlying causes include inherited disorders of perforin-mediated cell-killing (primarily in infants/young children) and malignant, infectious, and autoimmune conditions in others.

         HLH is diagnosed using clinical, laboratory, immunologic, and molecular criteria, as described separately. (See

          Clinically-stable
         </strong>
         – For patients with no deterioration of heart, lung, liver, kidney, or neurologic function, we suggest initial empiric treatment for the suspected underlying condition, rather than the HLH-94 protocol. However, patients must be monitored closely and treatment escalated if there is clinical deterioration. (See

         Examples include antimicrobials for triggering infections, glucocorticoids for rheumatologic condition, or antineoplastics for cancers. For the rare adult with homozygous (or compound heterozygous) HLH gene mutations, we proceed to allogeneic HCT, using a graft from an unaffected donor. (See
