In addition, 1 to 5 percent of women with breast cancer have metastatic disease at presentation. Although patients with metastatic breast cancer are unlikely to be cured of their disease, survival has improved over time due to improved options for treatment. As an example, compared with women treated from 1991 to 1992, those treated from 1999 to 2001 had a statistically longer survival (median, 22 versus 15 months) [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>Novel treatment strategies, involving genomics-directed treatment and novel biomarkers (eg, programmed cell death ligand 1 expression for immunotherapy), are evolving. Although more information is needed regarding these approaches in the older population, they should be considered for older women with breast cancer.</p><p>This topic will address issues pertinent to systemic antitumor treatment in older women (typically defined as age &gt;65 years) with metastatic breast cancer. General principles that guide treatment of metastatic breast cancer in all populations, as well as more extensive discussions of endocrine therapy and chemotherapy for metastatic disease, are discussed in detail elsewhere.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/767.html" rel="external">"Overview of the approach to metastatic breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/778.html" rel="external">"Treatment for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83848.html" rel="external">"Endocrine therapy resistant, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2795.html" rel="external">"Assessment of cancer pain"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2815.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management: Role of adjuvant analgesics (coanalgesics)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2814.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2805.html" rel="external">"Radiation therapy for the management of painful bone metastases"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/776.html" rel="external">"Use of osteoclast inhibitors in early breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/775.html" rel="external">"Brain metastases in breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2808.html" rel="external">"Comprehensive geriatric assessment for patients with cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">TREATMENT PRINCIPLES</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>General principles</strong> – Regardless of age, the goals of treatment for metastatic breast cancer are to control the cancer as best as possible, while maintaining the highest functional level and quality of life as possible. We often think of it as balancing the symptoms from the cancer versus the side effects of treatment. The management principles that guide treatment of metastatic breast cancer in older women are, therefore, similar to those used to guide treatment of younger women, with few exceptions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Standard baseline assessment includes assessment of extent of disease, symptoms and/or organ dysfunction due to the disease, molecular and immunophenotypic testing of the cancer, and germline genetic testing (although this may be deferred until after a patient has experienced progression on initial treatment).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Older women have poorer survival rates from metastatic breast cancer than do younger women. The factors that play into this are likely multiple, but documented variation in guideline concordance likely plays a role [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Although evidence-based guidelines specific to older women with metastatic breast cancer are lacking, the framework for approaching an older woman with metastatic breast cancer should be in accordance with existing guidelines.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Endocrine therapy is almost always chosen as the initial treatment of hormone receptor-positive tumors, typically coupled with targeted treatment, as well as in those women with an unknown hormone receptor status. (See <a class="local">'HER2-negative disease'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Chemotherapy should not be withheld solely on the basis of older age. Historically, older women have been less likely to receive chemotherapy despite data showing that age does not modify the survival benefit of chemotherapy for advanced disease [<a href="#rid4">4-9</a>]. In using chemotherapy in older patients, care should be taken in monitoring for toxicity, as dose adjustments are often needed [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. One must also consider comorbid illnesses that might increase the odds of toxicity. Use of a validated model created to predict chemotherapy-related toxicity, such as the Cancer and Aging Research Group tool or the Chemotherapy Risk Assessment Scale for High-Age Patients, can be useful when weighing risks and benefits of therapy with a patient; these models give an estimated prediction of developing severe or fatal toxicity from chemotherapy (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78775" href="/z/d/graphic/78775.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60649" href="/z/d/graphic/60649.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2823.html" rel="external">"Systemic chemotherapy for cancer in older adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>As in the treatment of younger women, older patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer should receive a HER2-directed agent as part of their treatment regimen. (See <a class="local">'HER2-positive disease'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Novel strategies</strong> – Treatment strategies in breast cancer are evolving, utilizing genomics and genomic assays and new markers for treatment response (eg, programmed cell death ligand 1 [PD-L1] expression on immune cells for response to PD-L1 inhibitors; germline breast cancer susceptibility gene <em>[BRCA]1</em> and<em> BRCA2</em> status for response to poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase inhibitors). Although reviews have been written about use of these agents in older patients [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>], more information is needed regarding these treatments in older patients, but they represent cutting-edge strategies and are considered in appropriately selected older adults. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14227.html" rel="external">"ER/PR negative, HER2-negative (triple-negative) breast cancer", section on 'Metastatic disease'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Clinical trial participation should be offered to all patients. In general, persons over the age of 65 are underrepresented in clinical trials, and prospective data to guide treatment in this growing population are a priority [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. In an analysis of breast cancer trials between 1985 and 2012, only 24 percent of participants in metastatic trials were age 65 and older; 13 percent were age 70 and older [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Trends showed that enrollment in trials for early-stage disease increased over time for older women, but decreased in metastatic disease. In addition, few phase I trials have been conducted to establish the safety of newer antineoplastic agents in this potentially vulnerable population [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">HER2-NEGATIVE DISEASE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2724398775"><span class="h2">Hormone receptor-positive disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The approach to hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer is similar in all postmenopausal women regardless of age and should take into consideration the medical status and treatment preferences of the patient [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].

Indications for chemotherapy are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Rapidly progressive or endocrine therapy refractory disease'</a> below.)</p><p>For most patients, a targeted agent is added to endocrine therapy. Endocrine therapy alone may be appropriate for patients with hormone receptor-positive disease who are unlikely to tolerate the addition of a targeted agent. (See <a class="local">'Addition of targeted therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Our approach to selection of an endocrine agent is as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We suggest administering an aromatase inhibitor (AI) in older women because of its benefits relative to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/z/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a>, as well as avoidance of the thromboembolic risks and endometrial thickening/bleeding associated with tamoxifen. However, for women at risk for bone loss, and those unable to tolerate an AI due to toxicity, tamoxifen is a reasonable alternative. There have been multiple trials evaluating the efficacy of AIs compared with tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. These trials have shown superior survival outcomes with AIs when compared with tamoxifen, but much of the data are from younger postmenopausal females.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8784" href="/z/d/drug information/8784.html" rel="external">Fulvestrant</a> as a single agent (500 mg injection) has shown better activity than aromatase inhibition in a randomized trial, in which the median age was 63 years [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. However, some patients may prefer oral therapy to intramuscular injection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Endocrine agents are typically sequenced, such that a patient may start with an AI, and upon progression, proceed with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8784" href="/z/d/drug information/8784.html" rel="external">fulvestrant</a>. After progression on fulvestrant, other endocrine agents, such as selective estrogen receptor modulators, progestational agents, etc, are considered. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/778.html" rel="external">"Treatment for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer", section on 'Alternative front-line options'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1667135090"><span class="h4">Addition of targeted therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several prospective, randomized clinical trials, comparing endocrine therapy alone with endocrine therapy with a targeted agent, which mechanistically works in a different way than modulating endocrine effects on the cancer cells, show that using the combination enhances the benefit compared with endocrine therapy alone. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/778.html" rel="external">"Treatment for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer", section on 'Types of ET and targeted agents'</a>.)</p><p>However, addition of targeted agents can add toxicity. For patients who are likely to tolerate the addition of targeted therapy, several options are available, as discussed in the sections below. Choosing between these options is similar as in younger postmenopausal women, with careful consideration of toxicities. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/778.html" rel="external">"Treatment for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer", section on 'Preferred first-line therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Older adult patients may be more susceptible to toxicities of certain agents. For example, older adult patients may be more susceptible to dehydration due to everolimus-related mucositis, requiring parenteral hydration earlier than a younger patient might.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3123255414"><span class="h5">For tumors with any genotype</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Both cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9078" href="/z/d/drug information/9078.html" rel="external">everolimus</a> combine effectively with AIs. Data regarding these combinations in older women are discussed below.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>CDK 4/6 inhibition</strong> – The combination of a CDK 4/6 inhibitor and an AI appears to be effective and of comparable tolerability in older patients as in younger patients [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. In a pooled analysis of three randomized control trials, the addition of a CDK 4/6 inhibitor to an AI improved progression-free survival (PFS), both in younger and in older adult patients [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The median PFS for those receiving a CDK 4/6 inhibitor and an AI versus an AI alone was 33 versus 19 months for those ≥70 years, and 27 versus 14 months for women &lt;70 years. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 84 percent of those ≥70 years and in 73 percent of patients &lt;70 years. The most common AEs leading to dose reductions or interruptions in patients ≥70 years were neutropenia, diarrhea, and increased creatinine. In particular, older adult patients should be carefully monitored for myelosuppression [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Regarding relative toxicities, dehydration is less of a concern with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="99759" href="/z/d/drug information/99759.html" rel="external">palbociclib</a> than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="115098" href="/z/d/drug information/115098.html" rel="external">abemaciclib</a>, as it is less likely to cause diarrhea.

With regard to all-grade toxicity, in patients 70 years and older, versus patients younger than 70, there were numerically higher rates of decreased appetite, dyspnea, anemia, asthenia, increased creatinine, and urinary tract infection; and lower rates of stomatitis, rash, headache, nail disorders, hypercholesterolemia, and abnormal liver function tests. Rates of grade 3 and 4 toxicity were numerically higher in older adults, with the exception of stomatitis, rash, diarrhea, and headache. Importantly, after adjustment for treatment exposure, in patients 70 years and older, incidence of on-treatment deaths resulting from AEs was numerically higher in everolimus-treated patients (7.7 versus 0 percent), whereas no difference in rates was noted in patients age &lt;70 years (1.3 versus 1.3 percent).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H77719856"><span class="h5">For tumors that have PIK3CA mutations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The alpha isoform specific phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="121400" href="/z/d/drug information/121400.html" rel="external">alpelisib</a> is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8784" href="/z/d/drug information/8784.html" rel="external">fulvestrant</a> in hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha <em>(PIK3CA</em>)-mutated, advanced breast cancer.

All possible endocrine therapies are used as long as there is evidence of clinical benefit with the most recent treatment. The presence of new metastatic lesions, clinical deterioration, or growth of lesions suggests a given treatment is not working. For older women with hormone receptor-positive disease that has progressed despite endocrine therapy, it is appropriate to weigh the risks and benefits of using a chemotherapeutic agent for palliative therapy.
