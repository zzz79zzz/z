         Stridor is an abnormal, high-pitched monophonic sound, produced by turbulent airflow caused by the oscillation of a narrowed airway. Its presence suggests significant obstruction of the large airways at the level of the supraglottis, glottis, subglottis, or trachea. The term is derived from the Latin verb
         <em>
          stridere
         </em>
         , meaning to make a harsh noise or shrill sound, as to creak.
        </p>
        <p>
         The acoustics of stridor may be explained by Bernoulli's principle, which states that as the speed of a moving fluid increases, the pressure within the fluid decreases. When airflow is forced through a narrowed tube, a local area of low pressure creates a vacuum effect distal to the narrowing. The focal area of low pressure distal to a narrowed airway causes the airway walls to collapse and vibrate, generating the high-pitched squeaking sound that is characteristic of stridor [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Stridor is a symptom that prompts evaluation to determine the cause and occasionally requires emergency intervention. The pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and clinical management of stridor will be reviewed here. Related material is found in the following topics:

          Supraglottic area
         </strong>
         – This area includes the nasopharynx, epiglottis, larynx, aryepiglottic folds, and false vocal cords. The walls supporting this region are made of soft tissue and muscles and lack cartilaginous support. Therefore, airway collapse and obstruction can occur easily and progress rapidly in this area.

         <strong>
          Glottic and subglottic area
         </strong>
         – This portion of the airway extends from the vocal cords to the extrathoracic segment of the trachea, just before it enters the thoracic cavity. The glottic area has some cartilaginous support (ie, cricoid cartilage and incomplete tracheal rings), which makes it less vulnerable to collapse than the supraglottic area. The subglottis, surrounded by the cricoid cartilage, is the narrowest part of the trachea. The diameter of the subglottis is 5 to 7 mm at birth and steadily increases to an average diameter on 20 mm in adults. In the narrow airway of an infant, a small decrease in diameter dramatically increases the airway resistance (because resistance is inversely proportional to the radius to the fourth power [r
         <sup>
          4
         </sup>
         ]). As an example, a narrowing by 1 mm in the subglottic area in an infant will decrease the cross-sectional area by approximately 50 percent [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ] and increase airway resistance 16-fold [

        <p>
         Classic diseases that cause obstruction at the extrathoracic level include laryngomalacia, laryngotracheitis (croup), retropharyngeal abscess, epiglottitis, and craniofacial malformations. (See

         The intrathoracic region includes the portion of the trachea that lies within the thoracic cavity, as well as the mainstem bronchi. Compression of the proximal trachea can result in expiratory stridor, whereas compression of the more distal intrathoracic airways tends to cause typical polyphonic wheezing rather than stridor. Congenital disorders are a prominent cause of obstruction at this level (eg, vascular rings and bronchial webs) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         ]. Foreign bodies and compression by enlarged lymph nodes or tumors can also occur at this level [

         Stridor is a high-pitched monophonic sound made during breathing. It is usually inspiratory and best heard over the anterior neck  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114053" href="/z/d/graphic/114053.html" rel="external">
          movie 1
         </a>
         ). These acoustic characteristics of stridor distinguish it from wheezing due to asthma or bronchiolitis, which is usually expiratory and tends to consist of multiple sounds that start and stop at different times and is caused by diffuse airflow limitation of the distal intrathoracic airways.
        </p>
        <p>
         In normal individuals, during inspiration, the extrathoracic pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure and exceeds the intratracheal pressure. This produces some collapse of the airway, which is not clinically relevant. By contrast, in patients with a non-rigid airway obstruction, the increased Bernoulli effect results in a substantial drop in the airway pressure beyond the obstruction, leading to the collapse of the airway walls and worsening obstruction. This in turn limits the airflow and causes turbulence and vibration of the airway walls, thus generating the monophonic squeak characteristic of stridor [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In patients with minor degrees of airway narrowing, the stridor may occur only during activity (eg, crying or exercise).

         <strong>
          intrathoracic
         </strong>
         region is more pronounced on exhalation since intrathoracic pressure rises on expiration and causes airway collapse  (

         (rather than dynamic) central airway obstruction usually produces noise during inspiration and expiration. The stridor may be more evident in either phase of breathing, depending on the effort the child makes on inspiration compared with expiration. Fixed central and upper airway obstructions may sound similar regardless of location in the intra- and extrathoracic locations. Conditions causing fixed airway obstruction include external compression, intraluminal airway masses (eg, hemangioma or foreign body), and mural changes in the airway, such as subglottic stenosis.

         Stridor caused by obstruction at the glottis (vocal cords) may occur during inspiration only, or during both inspiration and expiration, since the shape and size of this part of the airway change little during the process of respiration.

          Viral croup (laryngotracheitis)

         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. It most commonly occurs in children 6 to 36 months of age. It is also seen in younger infants (as young as three months) and in preschool children but is rare beyond age six years. The onset of symptoms is usually gradual, beginning with nasal irritation, congestion, and coryza and progressing to inspiratory and sometimes expiratory stridor. Symptoms generally progress over 12 to 48 hours to include fever, hoarseness, barking cough, and stridor. Croup is usually a mild and self-limited disease but occasionally causes significant respiratory distress and can be life-threatening.

          Spasmodic croup
         </strong>
         – Spasmodic croup is characterized by brief, recurrent episodes of stridor, typically occurring at night. The onset and cessation of symptoms are abrupt, and the duration of symptoms is short, often with symptoms subsiding by the time of presentation for medical attention. Fever is typically absent, but mild upper respiratory tract symptoms (eg, coryza) may be present. Episodes can recur within the same night and for two to four successive evenings. A striking feature of spasmodic croup is its recurrent nature, hence the alternate descriptive term "frequently recurrent croup." There may be a familial predisposition to spasmodic croup, and it may be more common in children with a family history of allergies. Because there is some clinical overlap with atopic diseases, it is sometimes referred to as "allergic croup." (See

         – Bacterial tracheitis (or acute bacterial laryngotracheobronchitis) generally occurs during the first six years of life but may occur at any age. Most patients have prodromal symptoms and signs suggestive of viral respiratory tract infection for one to three days before more severe signs of illness develop, including stridor and respiratory distress, often with cough and a preference to lie flat.

The presentation varies from marked respiratory distress in neonates to intermittent stridor in infants and young children. Because the compression is intrathoracic, the stridor usually is loudest in the expiratory phase.

          Respiratory papillomatosis (RRP)
         </strong>
         – RRP may be caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) type 6 or type 11. It is characterized by papillomatous growth of the epithelium of the airways (larynx and trachea). RRP has a bimodal age distribution and manifests most commonly in children younger than five years (juvenile-onset) or in persons in the fourth decade of life (adult-onset). The larynx is frequently affected. Patients can present with chronic or progressive stridor, hoarseness of voice or weak cry, choking episodes, cough, and wheezing if trachea is also involved. In some cases, upper airway obstruction may be life-threatening and may be the presenting symptom [

          Hypocalcemic laryngeal spasm
         </strong>
         – Laryngeal spasm due to hypocalcemia has been reported as a cause of stridor in pediatric populations. Most reports are in infants with vitamin D deficiency and rickets secondary to dietary insufficiency, but some cases have occurred in the setting of other metabolic and endocrine disorders that lead to severe hypocalcemia, such as renal failure and hypoparathyroidism. The associated stridor can be chronic or intermittent but also may present with acute severe onset [

         The initial evaluation of children with stridor must begin with a rapid assessment to identify patients who need immediate intervention. Key steps are to evaluate upper airway patency, the degree of respiratory effort, and evidence of hypoxemia and fatigue and to monitor closely for the possibility of rapid deterioration. Diagnostic testing may need to be delayed to provide appropriate supportive care. In an acutely ill patient, diagnostic testing should only be performed in a controlled setting and with close supervision by a clinician who can intervene if the patient's respiratory function deteriorates. The rapid assessment and stabilization of such patient is detailed in a separate topic. (See

         For children with stable respiratory status, the next step is a detailed history and physical examination to identify the cause of the stridor. In some cases, additional diagnostic testing, including radiography, pulmonary function testing, or airway visualization, may be required.

For children with a typical presentation of croup, confirmation of a viral cause is not necessary.

         Radiography is not necessary for a child with a typical presentation of croup. However, it can be a useful tool in evaluating a child with severe or atypical features or other suspected causes of stridor, including foreign body aspiration. Prior to obtaining any radiographs, the clinician should evaluate the child and assess the risk of developing complete airway obstruction during the procedure. If any life-threatening situation is suspected, the patient must be accompanied to the radiology suite by appropriate medical personnel with the equipment necessary for airway management, including emergency tracheotomy or cricothyroidotomy. For children with suspected epiglottitis and stable respiratory status, radiography usually can be performed safely with close supervision. If the patient is unstable, an emergency evaluation of the airway in a controlled setting such as the operating room or the intensive care unit is indicated. (See

         Three-dimensional reconstruction of the airway from CT scans may also better define the anatomy of the airways and can be done on request in many institutions. Children with suspected tracheomalacia can be evaluated with studies that show airway dynamics during breathing, including CT scan with airway reconstruction and inspiratory/expiratory imaging, a dynamic airway study, and/or bronchoscopy via laryngeal mask during spontaneous breathing.

         The configuration of the flow-volume loop may help distinguish the site of the airway obstruction, its variability, and its response to bronchodilators.

         For many patients with chronic or intermittent stridor, airway visualization is indicated to evaluate the airway and establish a diagnosis. Rigid laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy are the gold standards for evaluation and diagnosis of subglottic, tracheal, and central airway lesions. The rigid bronchoscope allows the clinician to take biopsy samples and dilate stenosed airways, if necessary. If a foreign body is not suspected, a flexible bronchoscope is usually used and the examination is performed during spontaneous breathing to help identify abnormalities in airway dynamics, including laryngomalacia.

         Stridor is a monophonic, high-pitched sound that is loudest over the anterior neck  (

          movie 1

         ). It is typically inspiratory but occasionally heard on expiration or throughout the respiratory cycle. The sound is caused by narrowing of the upper or central airway. (See

         Stridor originating from the extrathoracic area is more pronounced during inspiration and tends to abate during exhalation. Stridor caused by obstruction at the glottis (vocal cords) may occur during inspiration only or during both inspiration and expiration  (

         ). Critical and fixed airway obstruction typically results in biphasic inspiratory and expiratory stridor. Compression of the proximal trachea can result in expiratory stridor, but most other types of intrathoracic airway compression usually give rise to coarse wheezing rather than stridor. (See

         The most common cause of stridor in children is laryngotracheitis (croup), which tends to have gradual onset of symptoms (hours to days) with associated congestion, hoarseness, and barking cough, with or without fever. (See

         Severe or rapidly progressive symptoms with fever suggest epiglottitis or bacterial tracheitis. These disorders are rare but may be life-threatening. Acute onset of symptoms without fever can occur in spasmodic croup, foreign body aspiration, airway burns, or anaphylaxis  (

         Congenital anomalies can cause stridor through intrinsic or extrinsic obstruction of the upper airway. Most present during the first few weeks of life, but symptoms may be intermittent, and some anomalies such as bronchogenic cysts and laryngeal clefts may present later in infancy or childhood  (

         The initial evaluation of children with stridor must begin with a rapid assessment to identify patients who need intervention or are in danger of imminent decompensation. Key steps are evaluation of upper airway patency, degree of respiratory effort, and effectiveness of respiratory function. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6455.html" rel="external">
          "Emergency evaluation of acute upper airway obstruction in children", section on 'Evaluation'

         Once the clinical history and physical examination narrow the diagnostic possibilities, radiographic studies and/or direct examination of the airway are selected for further evaluation. The diagnosis of laryngotracheitis (croup) is clinical; radiography and laboratory studies usually are not needed for patients with typical features. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical assessment'
