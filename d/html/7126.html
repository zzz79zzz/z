VP has also been called porphyria variegata, South African genetic porphyria, mixed porphyria (an obsolete term also applied to hereditary coproporphyria [HCP]), protocoproporphyria, and porphyria cutanea tarda hereditaria (which likely included some cases of familial porphyria cutanea tarda [PCT]). The spectrum of disease manifestations is broad, ranging from life-threatening neurovisceral attacks and/or chronic photosensitivity and blistering skin lesions to patients who remain asymptomatic throughout their lives.</p><p>It is especially important to make an accurate diagnosis of VP in symptomatic individuals with neurovisceral or cutaneous manifestations to provide appropriate treatment. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The acute neurovisceral attacks can be life threatening and are treated in the same manner as other acute hepatic porphyrias (AHP), which are acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), HCP, and the ultra-rare delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase (ALAD) porphyria. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The skin manifestations are identical to PCT, congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP; especially mild cases), hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP), and HCP. Although these porphyrias are readily differentiated by well-chosen biochemical studies, most VP patients who present with skin manifestations are initially misdiagnosed as having PCT.</p><p></p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of VP will be discussed here.</p><p>Other porphyrias, as well as a general overview, are presented separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Overview</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7101.html" rel="external">"Porphyrias: An overview"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>HCP</strong> (cutaneous and neurovisceral manifestations) – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7100.html" rel="external">"Hereditary coproporphyria"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>AIP</strong> (neurovisceral) – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7096.html" rel="external">"Acute intermittent porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ADP</strong> (neurovisceral) – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7095.html" rel="external">"ALA dehydratase porphyria"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>PCT and HEP</strong> (cutaneous) – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7108.html" rel="external">"Porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>EPP</strong> (cutaneous) – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7125.html" rel="external">"Erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>CEP</strong> (cutaneous) – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7102.html" rel="external">"Congenital erythropoietic porphyria"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6523550"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3291379437"><span class="h2">PPOX gene variants</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>VP is an autosomal dominant condition caused by heterozygosity for a pathogenic variant in the gene protoporphyrinogen oxidase (<em>PPOX; </em><a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fomim.org%2Fentry%2F600923&amp;token=87jLzclRwWxNoI%2BQq5Gg73gqp2loG4lVTCoNJHRsKiReeIUk%2BUmXwS5B5ss6E3Nt&amp;TOPIC_ID=7126" target="_blank">OMIM 600923</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. <em>PPOX</em> encodes the seventh enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef117995" href="/d/graphic/117995.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Over 200 different pathogenic variants in <em>PPOX </em>have been identified following what was probably the initial description of the disease in 1937 [<a href="#rid2">2-6</a>]. Genotype-phenotype relationships have been reported in some smaller studies, but these correlations are less evident in larger studies [<a href="#rid3">3,7</a>].</p><p>In South Africa, about 95 percent of VP cases are due to the R59W missense mutation in <em>PPOX</em> [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. This founder mutation was carried from Holland by one of two immigrants to South Africa who were married in the late 1600s. Initial speculations that King George III of England and others in the royal houses of Europe had VP ("the Royal malady") were subsequently discounted [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> below.)</p><p>PPOX oxidizes protoporphyrinogen IX to protoporphyrin IX  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef117995" href="/d/graphic/117995.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). <em>PPOX</em> pathogenic variants found in VP families abolish or nearly abolish enzymatic activity. Therefore, heterozygotes have approximately 50 percent of normal PPOX activity in all cells, largely reflecting the enzymatic activity produced by the wildtype <em>PPOX</em> gene [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. This reduced enzymatic activity, along with induction of hepatic delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1), cause accumulation of protoporphyrinogen IX within hepatocytes. The excess protoporphyrinogen IX is mostly auto-oxidized to protoporphyrin IX and is found in plasma before excretion in the bile and feces.</p><p>Cutaneous manifestations of VP occur because excess protoporphyrin IX is transported in plasma to the skin, where it becomes photoactivated by light, especially with wavelengths in the range of 380 to 420 nm (the Soret band), which overlaps the intersection of long-wave ultraviolet (UVA) and visible light. This leads to the release of reactive oxygen species that damage skin cells. (See <a class="local">'Cutaneous symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>Neurovisceral symptoms in VP are believed chiefly to be related to accumulation of the earlier heme pathway intermediates delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), as in other acute hepatic porphyrias [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. Excess ALA is considered the most likely cause of neurotoxic effects in this and other acute porphyrias, although heme deficiency in neuronal or vascular tissue is an additional or alternative potential mechanism [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Neurovisceral symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>Elevated ALA and PBG in plasma and urine may result in part from induction of hepatic ALAS1 and also inhibition of hepatic porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) by protoporphyrinogen IX and coproporphyrinogen III, which accumulate in the liver in VP [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. In a chemically-induced porphyria model in rabbits that resembled VP, restoration of PBGD activity by administering PBGD mRNA corrected a number of biochemical abnormalities and suggested that reduced PBGD activity might be more important than reduced PPOX activity in altering heme synthesis in VP [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. </p><p>Elevations in coproporphyrin III as well as protoporphyrin IX may occur because PPOX and coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPOX) are closely associated in the mitochondrial membrane; in VP, this interaction may reduce CPOX activity leading to accumulation of coproporphyrinogen III, which is auto-oxidized to coproporphyrin III [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>Very rarely, an individual may be homozygous or compound heterozygous for <em>PPOX</em> pathogenic variants, either through consanguinity or by inheritance of two different <em>PPOX</em> variants, one from each unrelated parent. At least one of the variant alleles must express some enzymatic activity, as complete loss of PPOX function is incompatible with life. Homozygotes and compound heterozygotes present early in childhood with impaired development and severe cutaneous photosensitivity. (See <a class="local">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H24936245"><span class="h2">Exacerbating factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As described below, cutaneous manifestations of VP result from high plasma porphyrin levels and exposure of the skin to light with wavelengths in the range of 380 to 420 nm (UVA-visible light intersection). These wavelengths, which are not removed when light passes through window glass, photoactivate porphyrins in skin capillaries or cells, with release of activated oxygen species that damage cells. Sunlight and to a lesser extent artificial lights that include these wavelengths can cause skin damage in VP and other cutaneous porphyrias. (See <a class="local">'Cutaneous symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>As with other acute hepatic porphyrias, neurovisceral symptoms in VP can be exacerbated by certain drugs and steroid hormones (especially progesterone), as well as alcohol, cigarette smoke, and fasting or metabolic stress. This occurs through induction of hepatic delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase-1 (ALAS1), the rate-limiting enzyme for heme biosynthesis in the liver, and induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), the latter increasing the demand for heme synthesis in the liver. Both ALAS1 and certain hepatic CYP genes respond to inducing chemicals that are ligands for the pregnane X receptor (PXR) and other nuclear receptors, which then bind to sites in the promoter regions and upregulate expression of genes that encode ALAS1 and CYPs [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Drugs</strong> – A partial listing of potentially unsafe drugs in VP and other acute hepatic porphyrias (AHPs) is included in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57422" href="/d/graphic/57422.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Most of the unsafe agents (barbiturates, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9769" href="/d/drug information/9769.html" rel="external">phenytoin</a>, most other antiepileptics, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9864" href="/d/drug information/9864.html" rel="external">rifampin</a>) induce hepatic ALAS1 and CYPs [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]. Clinicians considering medications in patients with VP should consult frequently updated sources for information regarding medication safety, such as the website of the International Porphyria Network (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fporphyrianet.org%2Fen%2Fcontent%2Fworldwide-network&amp;token=X%2FkgWQO%2B4KXqmczSrewPB%2BSS2cY1JtfO7wcnKyXNc3DQ%2Blj9gyOm%2BNuP4gKT%2FOf64XAkAaxDceuuuinJpus4jw%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=7126" target="_blank">https://porphyrianet.org/en/content/worldwide-network</a>). Of note, the evidence for these listings is often limited and sometimes controversial or even contradictory, and it is useful to consult an expert center for advice, particularly for patients with frequent attacks.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hormones</strong> – Increases in sex hormones at puberty and cyclic progesterone production in ovulating women contribute to the onset of symptoms in some heterozygotes. Oral contraceptives may exacerbate symptoms in acute porphyrias because progestins are inducers of ALAS1 and CYPs, and in VP in particular estrogens may impair hepatobiliary excretion of porphyrins and increase plasma porphyrin levels and photosensitivity. Pregnancy is usually well tolerated, but attacks become more frequent in some pregnant women with acute porphyria.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Alcohol and cigarette smoke</strong> – Alcohol and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in cigarette smoke can induce ALAS1 and CYPs, resulting in the development of acute attacks.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fasting/metabolic stress</strong> – Reduced food intake, for example during crash dieting or after bariatric surgery, can lead to attacks; in this setting, ALAS1 is induced in the liver by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC)-1-alpha, a member of a family of transcription coactivators that plays a central role in the regulation of cellular energy metabolism. PGC-1-alpha is increased by starvation and glucagon and decreased by glucose and insulin. Metabolic stress due to concurrent medical conditions or surgery may also precipitate acute neurovisceral attacks [<a href="#rid21">21-24</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Unknown genes</strong> – As yet-uncharacterized genes are likely to have major influences on disease expression and are under active investigation [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H392936136"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>VP occurs worldwide. The prevalence is not accurately known because many individuals with pathogenic variants in <em>PPOX</em> remain asymptomatic.</p><p>The prevalence of symptomatic VP has been estimated at 0.3 per 100,000 in Europe (approximately 1 in 300,000). Some countries such as Finland may have a higher prevalence of VP (1.3 in 100,000; equivalent to approximately 1 in 77,000) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. By comparison, acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) and porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) are more common, with estimated prevalences of 1 in 5000 to 1 in 25,000, depending on the population.</p><p>The prevalence of VP is high in South Africans of Dutch descent; an incidence as high as 1 in 300 has been reported [<a href="#rid8">8,27,28</a>]. This occurred because a Dutch ancestor carried the <em>PPOX</em> founder mutation R59W and the population expanded greatly while remaining quite isolated for many decades [<a href="#rid29">29-32</a>]. As many as 30,000 individuals in South Africa carry this variant [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See <a class="local">'PPOX gene variants'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H660099"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H657425881"><span class="h2">Typical age and severity of presentation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinical features of VP are variable and may include chronic blistering cutaneous lesions on light-exposed skin and acute neurovisceral attacks of abdominal pain and neuropathic extremity pain and weakness. Skin manifestations are generally chronic and more common than neurovisceral symptoms, which are typically acute and intermittent but may be chronic [<a href="#rid2">2,18,27,33</a>]. Overall, acute attacks are less severe and frequent than in acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), but nonetheless can be severe and life threatening [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p>The typical age of presentation is after puberty, during adolescence or early adulthood. Females are more commonly symptomatic for both skin and neurovisceral symptoms than males [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p>Many individuals with a pathogenic variant in <em>PPOX</em> (eg, as identified by family screening) are entirely asymptomatic throughout life. These individuals are referred to as having latent disease. (See <a class="local">'Genetic testing and counseling'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2260948200"><span class="h2">Cutaneous symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cutaneous manifestations are chronic and are one of the most common manifestations of VP; they are seen in 10 to 50 percent of affected individuals. Many patients with VP have only skin findings without neurovisceral symptoms [<a href="#rid2">2,12,18</a>]. Cutaneous symptoms may be more common in countries such as South Africa where there are longer periods of intense sun exposure than in northern European countries such as Finland [<a href="#rid2">2,18,26,27</a>]. Cutaneous manifestations are much more common in VP than HCP [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p>Skin manifestations result from photodamage causing increased skin fragility and typically include painful vesicles and bullae, erosions or ulcers that often crust over and are slow to heal, scarring, areas of increased or decreased pigmentation and milia [<a href="#rid2">2,26,33</a>]. These changes occur on sun-exposed areas of skin such as the dorsal hands and forearms, legs and feet (if exposed), neck, ears, and face  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108944" href="/d/graphic/108944.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). Hypertrichosis of the face and forearms may occur  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83390" href="/d/graphic/83390.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). These findings are indistinguishable from other cutaneous blistering porphyrias, the most common being porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Sunlight is the strongest source of light-causing photoactivation of porphyrins; however, any source of light that contains wavelengths capable of activating porphyrins (eg, fluorescent lights) may contribute to phototoxicity. Maximum absorption and photoactivation of porphyrins occurs at about 400 nm (a light absorption peak called the Soret band) [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Wavelengths of light in this range can pass through standard window glass and automobile windshields.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H660106"><span class="h2">Neurovisceral symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neurovisceral symptoms are a feature of VP but are less common than cutaneous manifestations [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. When they occur, acute neurovisceral attacks are indistinguishable from those of other acute hepatic porphyrias (AHPs), although on average they may be somewhat milder than in AIP [<a href="#rid2">2,18,26,27,33</a>]. While neurovisceral findings are highly variable, individuals who have recurrent acute attacks often have similar symptoms from one attack to another [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Acute attacks requiring hospitalization have become less frequent, especially among females [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].</p><p>Neurovisceral findings during acute attacks are nonspecific and may include abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation; pain may also occur in the back, chest, and extremities. Abdominal pain can be unremitting for hours or more, poorly localized, and associated with cramping [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. There is often little or no tenderness or other peritoneal signs. However, there may be abdominal distention from intestinal ileus, and bladder paresis with urinary retention. Bowel intussusception has been reported [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p>Additional common autonomic/neuropsychiatric findings during attacks include systemic arterial hypertension, tachycardia, anxiety, disorientation, and agitation. Psychotic features may be present. Some of these findings may reflect autonomic dysfunction and adrenergic stimulation. Motor neuropathy may lead to neuromuscular weakness, and patients are at risk for quadriparesis and respiratory failure.</p><p>Seizures may be a direct neurologic manifestation of porphyria or due to hyponatremia often resulting from the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2384.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and etiology of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)"</a>). Hyponatremia may result in part from vomiting and renal sodium loss.</p><p>During acute attacks, patients may have brown or reddish urine (the term porphyria is derived from the Greek word for the color purple, "porphyrus" [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]).

Skin manifestations are more common than neurovisceral symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – The diagnosis of VP can be made by biochemical or genetic testing (see <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For an acute attack in a previously undiagnosed patient, elevated urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) on a spot urine is sufficient to diagnosis acute porphyria (VP, hereditary coproporphyria [HCP], or acute intermittent porphyria [AIP]) and initiate treatment  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef61709" href="/d/graphic/61709.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Additional testing can distinguish between VP from other porphyrias  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89036" href="/d/graphic/89036.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60572" href="/d/graphic/60572.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).

(See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – Potentially harmful drugs should be discontinued  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57422" href="/d/graphic/57422.html" rel="external">table 1</a>); metabolic stresses should be corrected; pain, nausea, and autonomic symptoms should be treated. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Acute attack (severe</strong>) – Severe attacks are potentially life threatening. For an attack requiring hospitalization, opioids, or other intravenous medication, or accompanied by nausea and vomiting, motor neuropathy, paresis, seizures, agitation, delirium, psychosis, ileus that prevents oral intake, or hyponatremia, we recommend intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8970" href="/d/drug information/8970.html" rel="external">hemin</a> (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>).

(See <a class="local">'Treatment of acute attacks'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Prevention</strong> – For adults with ≥4 attacks per year, we suggest <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="126257" href="/d/drug information/126257.html" rel="external">givosiran</a> (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). Givosiran is a small interfering RNA that reduces <em>ALAS1</em> mRNA and ALA and PBG levels. For attacks that coincide with the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GNRH) analog may be used. Prophylactic <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8970" href="/d/drug information/8970.html" rel="external">hemin</a> is another option.
