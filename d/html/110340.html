Among patients with at least moderate VHD in developed countries, aortic valve stenosis (AS) is most common, followed by mitral regurgitation, then aortic regurgitation and finally mitral stenosis [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>For appropriate diagnosis and management of AS, it is crucial to assess the severity of AS accurately as possible. However, the diagnosis and evaluation of AS are challenging due to a variety of pitfalls.</p><p>The management and prognosis of low gradient AS will be reviewed here. Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of low gradient AS and the clinical presentation and treatment of high gradient severe AS are discussed separately.

Subsequent steps include referral of patients with symptomatic true severe AS to a heart valve team for possible aortic valve replacement, monitoring asymptomatic patients, preventive measures to reduce risk of decompensation, and pharmacologic therapy to treat risk factors in asymptomatic patients and as a temporizing or palliative measure in symptomatic patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H439414276"><span class="h2">Confirmation of AS severity and type</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Key steps in the management of patients with low gradient AS are to confirm the AS severity and type (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8114.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of low gradient severe aortic stenosis", section on 'Diagnosis and evaluation'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the first key test to determine the AS severity by measuring aortic valve area and peak and mean pressure gradients. However, when TTE is not contributive, transesophageal echocardiography should be considered to better visualize the aortic valve, the number of cusps, the degree of calcification, to better measure the LVOT diameter, and thus calculate the aortic valve area. The calcium scoring performed by noninjected computed tomography (CT) scan should be done whenever there is discrepancy between pressure gradients and aortic valve area, in case of classical low flow, low gradient (LFLG) AS or paradoxical LFLG AS.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Confirmation of presence of true severe AS (or pseudosevere AS).

The ESC guidelines also include a weak recommendation similar to the second recommendation. However, these major society guidelines do not provide specific recommendations for valve intervention for other groups of patients with low gradient AS.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1252620113"><span class="h3">Evidence on the impact of aortic valve replacement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following (largely observational) evidence on the impact of aortic valve replacement (surgical in most studies) supports aortic valve replacement for patients with symptomatic severe AS with classical LFLG AS, paradoxical LFLG AS, or NFLG AS. In all studies, the conservative management group likely included patients with severe AS with severe comorbidities, so the benefit of aortic valve replacement was likely overestimated.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25692472"><span class="h4">For classical low flow, low gradient AS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Aortic valve replacement is recommended in most patients with classical LFLG severe AS because observational studies have found that valve replacement is associated with better outcomes than continued medical therapy [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. This was illustrated in a study of 95 patients who did or did not undergo aortic valve replacement [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Using propensity analysis, patients who underwent valve replacement had a significantly greater survival at one (82 versus 41 percent without surgery) and four years (78 versus 15 percent). The main predictor of improved survival was aortic valve replacement. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8154.html" rel="external">"Indications for valve replacement for high gradient aortic stenosis in adults"</a>.)</p><p>However, patients with classical LFLG AS are at high risk for perioperative mortality with surgical aortic valve replacement, particularly when coronary artery disease is present. In a report of 52 patients with an LVEF ≤35 percent (mean 26 percent) and a transvalvular mean gradient of &lt;30 mmHg (mean 23 mmHg), perioperative (30-day) survival was 79 percent, and overall survival at three and five years was 62 and 39 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Survival at five years was much lower in patients with coronary artery disease (29 versus 71 percent). However, among the 30-day survivors, there were significant improvements in functional status and LVEF.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2943171863"><span class="h4">For paradoxical low flow, low gradient AS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with paradoxical LFLG severe AS (LVEF ≥50 percent), a meta-analysis of largely observational studies found a significant survival benefit associated with aortic valve replacement compared with conservative management (hazard ratio [HR] 0.44, 95% CI 0.25-0.77 [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]; despite mixed results in underpowered individual studies [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H963229221"><span class="h4">For normal flow, low gradient AS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with NFLG severe AS, a meta-analysis of largely observational studies found a significant survival benefit associated with aortic valve replacement compared with conservative management (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28-0.83) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Thus, the available evidence favors aortic valve replacement (surgical or transcatheter) in patients with severe NFLG AS. However, a prospective observational study (not included in the above meta-analysis) of 284 patients with symptomatic NFLG severe AS found that a strategy of watchful waiting (with aortic valve replacement performed when mean valve gradient was at least 40 mmHg) yielded no difference in mortality compared with early surgery [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Estimated actuarial eight-year mortality rates were not significantly different at 17.5 percent for the early AVR group and 27.5 for watchful observation group. For 83 propensity-score-matched pairs, the risk of mortality was not significantly different between the two groups (HR 1.13 for early AVR, 95% CI 0.55-2.35).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3913792779"><span class="h3">Evidence on the impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following evidence supports use of TAVI over conservative management in patients with inoperable LG severe AS and as an alternative to surgery in patients with high surgical risk LG severe AS. Of note, patients with LG severe AS generally face higher mortality rates following TAVI compared with patients with high gradient severe AS [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. A meta-analysis including eight studies with a total of 12,589 patients with AS undergoing TAVI found that LG was independently associated with mortality at 12 months; LVEF did not affect this result [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>Similarly, an observational study of outcomes following TAVI found that patients with classical LFLG AS had higher 30-day and mid-term (mean 13-month) mortality rates compared with patients with high gradient AS [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. However, patients with paradoxical LFLG AS had mid-term (mean 13 month) mortality rates similar to those for high gradient AS despite having higher 30 mortality rates [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>In the PARTNER trial of TAVI, both LF and LG were univariate predictors of one-year mortality but in multivariable analysis, LF was an independent predictor of mortality, while LVEF and pressure gradient were not [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].

One-year survival was significantly lower in those patients with a plasma BNP ≥550 pg/mL compared with those with &lt;550 pg/mL (47 versus 97 percent) in the entire cohort and in the 29 patients who underwent surgery (53 versus 92 percent). These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that outcome depends upon the severity of LV dysfunction and HF.
