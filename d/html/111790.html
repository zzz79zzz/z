          OVERVIEW OF FATTY ACID OXIDATION

         Fatty acid beta-oxidation takes place in the mitochondria and provides a major source of energy (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59178" href="/z/d/graphic/59178.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). There are at least 31 enzymes or carriers that participate in FAO. While short- and medium-chain fatty acids, typically &lt;10 carbon units, can enter the mitochondria directly, longer-chain fatty acids &gt;12 carbon units are transported by way of a carnitine shuttle cycle. Within mitochondria, the beta-oxidation cycle forms two-carbon acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and generates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH
         <sup>
          +
         </sup>
         ) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         ), which in turn are transferred to the respiratory chain for oxidative phosphorylation and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation. Acetyl-CoA is used as a substrate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to produce additional reducing equivalents for the electron transport chain and for ketone body and cholesterol synthesis.

         </span>
         FAODs are autosomal-recessive disorders that are fundamentally diseases of energy deficiency. Deranged FAO leads to a triple defect in energy production. First, there is a direct decrease of reducing equivalents for oxidative phosphorylation produced directly by enzymatic reaction of FAO. Second, there is reduced production of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle substrate acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), leading to further reduction of reducing equivalents. Finally, there is a reduction in the production of ketone bodies, a key alternative fuel for brain, heart, muscle, kidney, and other tissues during stress.

         </span>
         FAODs can present at any age, with the most severe forms, such as the long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LCFAODs), presenting in the first few days of life, while medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) usually presents in early childhood. Common presenting signs include hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, liver disease and liver failure, cardiac and skeletal myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and retinal degeneration (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef114663" href="/z/d/graphic/114663.html" rel="external">

         ) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Some patients may present with a Reye-like syndrome. Life-threatening presentations may rapidly occur with minimal fasting in infants but may require 24 to 48 hours of fasting in older individuals. In the most severe forms, death may occur prior to receipt of newborn screening (NBS) results. The accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitine species may be dysrhythmogenic and is associated with cardiac dysfunction [

         Patients with FAODs do not exhibit chronic central nervous system effects unless a severe episode(s) of hypoglycemia or hyperammonemia has previously caused acute, permanent damage. Disease-specific manifestations are reviewed in the topic on individual disorders. (See

         Carriers are typically asymptomatic, although mild biochemical abnormalities may be present.

         Patients with hypoketotic hypoglycemia have low serum glucose levels and low or absent serum beta-hydroxybutyrate levels and urine ketones. Electrolytes and arterial blood gas analysis show a metabolic acidosis as the patient becomes dehydrated. Patients with liver dysfunction have elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and, during a severe crisis, may also have hyperammonemia. Creatine kinase may be elevated in the long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LCFAODs) with myopathy or rhabdomyolysis.

         </span>
         In many resource-abundant countries, most FAODs are detected through newborn screening (NBS) by tandem mass spectrometry, but the specific disorders tested can vary significantly by country, and older patients born before NBS implementation are still being identified clinically. The preferred tests to confirm a diagnosis in an infant with a positive NBS are a plasma acylcarnitine profile and total and free carnitine levels. Recommendations for follow-up diagnostic testing of an abnormal NBS result are provided in the ACT sheet and diagnostic algorithms provided by the
         <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acmg.net%2FACMG%2FMedical-Genetics-Practice-Resources%2FACT_Sheets_and_Algorithms.aspx&amp;token=H9vziSpsm87yoUFFPv9frHSxSV6UmLoXQh6Ah%2FFe646R%2Bz3AqUX9N%2FujOkxX5tcB0C2yBYEUsL%2Bt6IZAiKrwMoFJYxwvSoAJKukz2%2FeawlhFN%2B0w7M8T1lW2DaYUmVHp&amp;TOPIC_ID=111790" target="_blank">
          American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics
         </a>
         . Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing is the most common definitive test and can provide information on final diagnosis (eg, trifunctional protein deficiency [TFPD] versus isolated long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency [LCHADD]) and predicted phenotype. When NBS is not available, early recognition of clinical symptoms is essential and should trigger appropriate testing. Clinical findings that should prompt an evaluation for FAODs include hypoketotic hypoglycemia, Reye-like syndrome (hypoglycemia with hyperammonemia), cardiomyopathy, or recurrent rhabdomyolysis.
        </p>
        <p>
         A false-positive NBS for an FAOD can occur in infants who are carriers for one of the disorders. The positive predictive value (PPV) of NBS varies significantly among NBS laboratories; for example, the PPV for NBS for medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) ranges from 8 to 78 percent [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Additionally, NBS identifies many milder forms of FAOD in infants with lower but still elevated concentrations of diagnostic acylcarnitine species as compared with more severe forms of FAOD. Such infants may continue to have persistent elevations of these acylcarnitines yet remain asymptomatic. Mutation analysis may help predict the risk for clinical disease in this setting. However, long-term follow-up studies are needed to more definitively determine clinical risk and the need for monitoring for later-onset symptoms [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         If variants of uncertain significance are identified on DNA sequencing, enzyme assay in leukocytes, fibroblasts, or hepatocytes may provide additional information on their functional significance. Assessment of the ability of leukocytes or skin fibroblasts to oxidize labeled fatty acids (often called an FAO probe) is available in some clinical laboratories. Urine organic acid analysis may show elevations of long-chain dicarboxylic acids in the long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LCFAODs) or other organic acids in multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), while quantitation of urine acylglycines may show elevated hexanoylglycine in MCADD (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef114663" href="/z/d/graphic/114663.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Urinary dicarboxylic acids and other abnormal metabolites may be present during illness but not when a patient is well. Lack of urinary ketones with fasting or illness due to a defect in ketogenesis is another suggestive, but nonspecific, sign of an FAOD.

         – Hyperinsulinism syndromes are the primary differential in patients who present with hypoketotic hypoglycemia. These disorders can be identified by early-onset fasting hypoglycemia that occurs only a few hours postprandial, in contrast to FAODs, which typically require longer periods of fasting (eg, at least three to four hours postprandial). Hyperinsulinism syndrome can be recognized on testing, demonstrating elevated insulin levels and low free fatty acids, and therapeutic responsiveness to

          Cardiomyopathy

         – Other genetic and acquired cardiomyopathies (dilated or hypertrophic) are in the differential diagnosis in patients who develop cardiomyopathy. Other inborn errors of metabolisms that can cause cardiomyopathy include Pompe disease and other glycogen and lysosomal storage diseases, mitochondrial and respiratory chain disorders, organic acidemias, and congenital disorders of glycosylation [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. These causes of cardiomyopathy can be recognized by additional testing including elevated plasma lactate, elevated excretion of mucopolysaccharides, abnormal urine organic acids, or carbohydrate-deficient transferrin. In addition, white blood cell alpha-glucosidase is deficient in Pompe disease. (See

          Rhabdomyolysis

         – In patients who present with rhabdomyolysis, the differential should include glycogen storage diseases (GSDs), such as McArdle disease (GSD V), and other congenital and acquired myopathies [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10

         Treatment of FAODs involves avoidance of prolonged fasting and maintenance of a constant energy supply during times of catabolism by simple carbohydrates by mouth or intravenously (IV) if the patient is unable to maintain anabolism though oral intake. For those who cannot tolerate oral feeding, IV administration of glucose should be initiated immediately to maintain normal glucose level. Patients are strongly advised to seek medical attention when experiencing illnesses accompanied with symptoms suggestive of metabolic decompensation. (See

Children older than 12 months can fast four hours during the day and at least eight hours at night. If an infant is ill, especially with a fever, or is in a catabolic state due to other physiologic stresses, fasting should be limited to three to four hours with frequent monitoring for clinical symptoms. Preoperative planning for elective surgery should include limiting fasting times as above and providing IV fluids with 10 percent dextrose at 1.5 times maintenance during and after the procedure until adequate oral intake is restored.

         Patient outcomes, including quality of life and survival, have improved with early detection and institution of therapy due to newborn screening (NBS) programs. However, early identification through NBS does not prevent all severe complications and death, and not all disorders are screened in all countries. In addition, available treatments do not completely eliminate disease manifestations, particularly rhabdomyolysis and cardiomyopathy. Symptoms can still be triggered by acute illness or other physiologic stress, resulting in rapid, life-threatening metabolic decompensation. Patients face a lifelong risk of recurrent symptoms and metabolic decompensation during prolonged fasting or increased metabolic stress (eg, prolonged surgery). This lifelong management has redefined the expectations and long-term planning for patients and their caregivers as the changes to daily life are significant [

         A variety of novel therapies have been proposed or investigated for FAODs. Part of the difficulty in treating long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LCFAODs) centers on a lack of complete understanding of the pathophysiologic effects of the deranged energy metabolism. The presence of rhabdomyolysis without hypoglycemia in older patients suggests an effect unrelated to energy deficit. Abnormal signaling from long-chain fatty acid metabolites, secondary carnitine deficiency, generalized mitochondrial dysfunction, and aberrant inflammatory responses are all possible mechanisms and have been demonstrated in patients with very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD) [

         FAODs lead to deficient energy production and produce widely variable clinical presentations ranging from mild hypotonia in adults to sudden death in infants. Common presenting signs include hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, liver disease and liver failure, cardiac and skeletal myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and retinal degeneration. Patients are most at risk during times of fasting or intercurrent illnesses. (See
         <a class="local">

         Most FAODs are detected through newborn screening (NBS) by tandem mass spectrometry in developed countries. The preferred tests to confirm a diagnosis in an infant with a positive NBS are a plasma acylcarnitine profile and total and free carnitine levels. DNA testing is the most common definitive test and can provide information on final diagnosis. Leukocyte, fibroblast, or liver enzyme assays can be used to determine functional significance of unknown variants identified on DNA sequencing. (See

         Treatment of FAODs involves avoidance of prolonged fasting and maintenance of a constant energy supply during times of catabolism. The recommended diet is often restricted in natural fat and carbohydrate or protein supplemented for most FAODs. Patients with long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LCFAODs) are supplemented with medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil or

         is given only if secondary carnitine deficiency is found. (See

         Quality of life and survival in patients with FAODs have improved with early detection and institution of therapy due to NBS programs. However, early identification through NBS does not prevent all severe complications and death, and not all disorders are screened in all countries. In addition, available treatments do not completely eliminate disease manifestations, particularly rhabdomyolysis and cardiomyopathy. Symptoms can still be triggered by acute illness or other physiologic stress, resulting in rapid, life-threatening metabolic decompensation. (See
