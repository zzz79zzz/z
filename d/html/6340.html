It may be idiopathic or associated with underlying pulmonary disease. The prognosis is usually good, although recurrence is frequent.</p><p>Spontaneous pneumothorax in patients from infancy through adolescence will be discussed below. Pneumothorax in newborns or adults, and the placement of chest tubes, are discussed in separate topic reviews. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4995.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary air leak in the newborn"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6706.html" rel="external">"Pneumothorax in adults: Epidemiology and etiology"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/117232.html" rel="external">"Treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7816.html" rel="external">"Thoracostomy tubes and catheters: Indications and tube selection in adults and children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DEFINITION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pneumothorax is defined as a collection of air that is located within the thoracic cage between the visceral and parietal pleura  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72656" href="/d/graphic/72656.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). Air can enter the pleural space through a leak in either pleural surface. It may flow freely within the chest or be loculated by fibrous bands or other tissues. Rarely, air accumulates due to infection with gas-producing bacteria.</p><p>A pneumothorax is characterized as either spontaneous or traumatic. Traumatic pneumothorax is caused by blunt, crush, or penetrating trauma to the chest; by injury from a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure; or as a consequence of mechanical ventilation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6568.html" rel="external">"Thoracic trauma in children: Initial stabilization and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p>Spontaneous pneumothorax, the subject of this topic review, occurs in the absence of any identified trauma. It is subdivided into primary and secondary types  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65455" href="/d/graphic/65455.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Primary spontaneous pneumothorax</strong> (PSP) is diagnosed when a thorough investigation reveals no underlying lung disease that would predispose the individual to air leak.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax</strong> (SSP) occurs as a complication of underlying lung disease, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, necrotizing pneumonia, and interstitial lung disease.</p><p></p><p>The distinction between these types of pneumothorax is not always clear; many individuals with PSP have subtle indications of previously undiagnosed pulmonary disease, such as obstructive airway disease. In addition, apical blebs of unclear etiology have been detected by computed tomography (CT) or at the time of surgery [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The annual incidence of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) in the general population is estimated to be 5 to 10 per 100,000 [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. Among children and adolescents living in the United States, the incidence of PSP has been estimated to be 4 per 100,000 in males and 1.1 per 100,000 in females [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The peak incidence occurs between 16 and 24 years of age [<a href="#rid3">3,5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6706.html" rel="external">"Pneumothorax in adults: Epidemiology and etiology"</a>.)</p><p>The incidence of pneumothorax is relatively high in the newborn period. The reported incidence of pneumothorax in newborns and infants depends upon the setting and method of ascertainment. Small, asymptomatic pneumothoraces probably occur in 1 to 2 percent of live births, whereas symptomatic pneumothoraces occur in approximately 2 in 10,000 live births (0.02 percent). Incidence of PSP is increased among infants that are premature or large; infants with underlying lung disease including meconium aspiration are also at risk for secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4995.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary air leak in the newborn"</a>.)</p><p>There is a strong male predominance for PSP in adults. Spontaneous pneumothorax is approximately three to six times more common in males than females [<a href="#rid1">1,6-8</a>], although women of reproductive age occasionally develop spontaneous pneumothorax triggered by menstruation (catamenial pneumothorax) (see <a class="local">'Mechanisms of pneumothorax'</a> below). There is also a male predominance among adolescents but probably not in younger children [<a href="#rid3">3,5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4789334"><span class="h2">Risk factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>PSP typically affects patients with a tall, thin body habitus. In adults, smoking increases the risk of pneumothorax 22 times in men and 9 times in women, perhaps accounting for the higher incidence of the disorder in adults than children [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Pneumothorax has been reported with marijuana smoking and cocaine inhalation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65455" href="/d/graphic/65455.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p>The majority of pneumothoraces occur at rest. However, in some cases, there is a history of an activity or event unrelated to thoracic trauma but associated with an acute increase in transpulmonary pressure; reported precipitating events include military flying, weight lifting, and Valsalva maneuver [<a href="#rid12">12-14</a>]. Rarely, contact sports such as football or ice hockey can cause pneumothorax through this mechanism (barotrauma) or through blunt chest trauma with pulmonary laceration, but these would be considered a traumatic pneumothorax.</p><p>Familial cases of spontaneous pneumothorax have been described [<a href="#rid15">15-17</a>]. The majority of patients are adolescent or adult males, although newborns may be affected. Autosomal dominant and X-linked recessive inheritance has been proposed. In some cases, the familial predisposition is associated with pulmonary cysts, as in Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Individuals with connective tissue disease (eg, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and arterial tortuosity syndrome) might be at higher risk of developing spontaneous pneumothorax. In other cases, the exact predisposing factor cannot be identified. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6706.html" rel="external">"Pneumothorax in adults: Epidemiology and etiology", section on 'Genetic predisposition'</a>.)</p><p>Underlying pulmonary conditions associated with spontaneous pneumothorax (ie, SSP) are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65455" href="/d/graphic/65455.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. The overall incidence of SSP is similar to PSP [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, the incidence of PSP peaks in adolescence and young adulthood, whereas the peak incidence of SSP occurs at an older age, largely due to the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6691.html" rel="external">"Treatment of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults"</a>). In preadolescent children, rates of PSP and SSP are approximately equal [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">MECHANISMS OF PNEUMOTHORAX</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An air leak through either the visceral pleura or the parietal pleura can cause pneumothorax, but spontaneous pneumothorax occurs exclusively via rupture of the visceral pleura.</p><p>Most cases of alveolar rupture and spontaneous pneumothorax appear to be explained by either acute increase in transpulmonary pressure or defects in visceral pleura. In some cases, there is evidence for both mechanisms (eg, coughing in a patient with lung disease).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute increase in transpulmonary pressure</strong> – Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is thought to be caused by large increases in transpulmonary pressure, which cause alveolar distension. With sufficiently high pressure gradients, an alveolus can rupture. Rapid, large shifts in pressure can occur during spontaneous respiratory efforts, positive-pressure ventilation, Valsalva maneuvers, or when a ball-valve mechanism is created due to airway obstruction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Superficial alveoli can form subpleural blebs that rupture directly into the pleural space. These blebs are usually found in the lung apices, presumably due to the selective ventilation and higher transpulmonary pressures seen in the upper lobes [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Alveoli located more centrally rupture, and then the free air dissects along the perivascular tissue planes, moving medially toward the hilum or peripherally toward the visceral pleural surface. Pneumomediastinum may occur if the alveolar rupture is into the mediastinum  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75787" href="/d/graphic/75787.html" rel="external">image 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6352.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous pneumomediastinum in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Air confined to the interstitial spaces results in pulmonary interstitial emphysema. If pressures are sufficiently high, air can rupture centrally or peripherally from the interstitial space into the pleural space to produce a pneumothorax. Similarly, air under significant pressure can track along tissue planes into the pericardium, abdomen, or subcutaneous tissue, resulting in a pneumopericardium, pneumoperitoneum, or subcutaneous emphysema, respectively  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67176" href="/d/graphic/67176.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Defects in visceral pleura</strong> – In some cases, a pneumothorax develops from direct injury to the visceral pleura due to underlying lung disease; these are considered secondary pneumothoraces. This mechanism may explain pneumothorax associated with infectious processes (such as tuberculosis, necrotizing pneumonia or abscess, <em>Pneumocystis</em> <em>jirovecii</em> [<em>carinii</em>] pneumonia, or infection in cystic fibrosis), connective tissue disease (such as Marfan syndrome or juvenile idiopathic arthritis), metastatic or embolic malignancies, congenital cystic anomalies, and catamenial pneumothorax  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65455" href="/d/graphic/65455.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Air leak associated with infection is probably due to localized inflammation and tissue necrosis that lead to the creation of a connection between the airways and pleural space (bronchopleural fistula), thereby allowing the free passage of gas into the pleural space. With tumors near the pleural surface, infarction and necrosis can lead to air leak by a similar mechanism [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Catamenial pneumothorax</strong> – Catamenial pneumothorax refers to recurrent pneumothoraces that occur perimenstrually in association with thoracic endometriosis. It is rare in adolescents but has been reported [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. In many cases, it is associated with thoracic endometriosis, which occurs when endometrial tissue migrates from the peritoneal cavity into the thoracic cavity through congenital diaphragmatic defects or possibly through microembolization through the pelvic veins. The mechanism for the apparent association with thoracic endometriosis is unclear; it is possible that air leaks through defects left by sloughing of endometrial implants. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6687.html" rel="external">"Clinical features, diagnostic approach, and treatment of adults with thoracic endometriosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC CONSEQUENCES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When pneumothorax occurs, the free passage of air into the pleural space allows equalization of intrapleural and atmospheric pressures, which predisposes to partial lung collapse  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54660" href="/d/graphic/54660.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). A small pneumothorax may be well tolerated and asymptomatic. A large pneumothorax generally causes restrictive changes in lung mechanics with tachypnea and sometimes inspiratory retractions. (See <a class="local">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Invasion of related spaces</strong> – If the air is under pressure, it can track along tissue planes into the pericardium, abdomen, or subcutaneous tissue, resulting in a pneumopericardium, pneumoperitoneum, or subcutaneous emphysema, respectively. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6352.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous pneumomediastinum in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tension pneumothorax</strong> – A tension pneumothorax is caused when air enters the pleural space during inspiration but cannot exit through the same pathway, similar to a one-way valve. This results in air accumulation within the pleural space, generating an intrapleural pressure that is substantially higher than the atmospheric pressure [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The inward elastic recoil of the pulmonary parenchyma causes the involved lung to collapse, while increased intrathoracic pressure causes the mediastinum to shift away from the side of the pneumothorax  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77092" href="/d/graphic/77092.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). Tension pneumothorax is often associated with hypoxemia due to lung collapse, an increased work of breathing due to restrictive lung disease, and in some cases, hemodynamic changes with reduced venous return to the heart [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical presentation of pneumothorax depends upon the volume of air in the pleural space, rapidity of onset, extent of lung collapse, tension within the pleural space, and the patient's age and respiratory reserve. The latter is influenced by the presence of any underlying pulmonary disorder.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Spontaneous pneumothorax most often occurs when patients are at rest or with minimal exertion. Patients with a large pneumothorax usually complain of the sudden onset of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain that is described as sharp or stabbing and may be preceded by a popping sensation. The pain typically is diffuse on the affected side with radiation to the ipsilateral shoulder. A dry or nonproductive cough is occasionally seen in association with pneumothoraces. The pain often resolves spontaneously during the first 24 hours, even if the pneumothorax persists [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The history should investigate potential causes of secondary pneumothorax, such as use of inhaled drugs, undiagnosed asthma, foreign body aspiration, upper or lower respiratory tract infection, and connective tissue diseases  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65455" href="/d/graphic/65455.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The presence of apical blebs supports the diagnosis of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). Otherwise, PSP is largely a diagnosis of exclusion.</p><p>A small pneumothorax may be asymptomatic. It may be detected as an incidental finding on a chest radiograph obtained for another indication.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Characteristic physical findings associated with a large pneumothorax include decreased chest excursion, diminished breath sounds, hyperresonant percussion, and decreased vocal fremitus on the affected side. Other signs of respiratory compromise may include tachypnea, increased work of breathing, and cyanosis.</p><p>Signs suggestive of tension pneumothorax include deviation of the trachea towards the contralateral side. Other signs of tension pneumothorax include tachycardia, hypotension, and cyanosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77092" href="/d/graphic/77092.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). Heart sounds may be diminished and the apical impulse shifted to the contralateral side. Tension pneumothorax is a respiratory emergency and requires urgent decompression. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7816.html" rel="external">"Thoracostomy tubes and catheters: Indications and tube selection in adults and children", section on 'Tension pneumothorax'</a>.)</p><p>Subcutaneous emphysema with crepitation, or abdominal distension due to pneumoperitoneum, is occasionally present as well.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Radiography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of pneumothorax is established by chest radiograph. When possible, the radiograph should be taken in the upright position. A pneumothorax tends to appear larger on an expiratory film and may enhance detection of small pneumothoraces. However, to monitor changes in the size of the pneumothorax over time, only inspiratory films should be compared [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Estimation of size'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Typical imaging features in children</strong> – Anteroposterior and lateral views can confirm the presence of even small volumes of intrapleural air  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51728" href="/d/graphic/51728.html" rel="external">image 3</a>). Characteristic findings are air in the pleural space outlining the visceral pleura (pleural line), hyperlucency, and an attenuation of vascular and lung markings in the lung field on the affected side. Flattening or inversion of the diaphragm may occur on the affected side, and the mediastinum and trachea may shift away from the pneumothorax. Atelectasis due to compression by the pleural gas may be present as well. There is a left-side preponderance in both pediatric and adult patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6378.html" rel="external">"Atelectasis in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Features of tension pneumothorax</strong> – The following are signs of tension pneumothorax on a plain chest film:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Contralateral mediastinal displacement</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Collapse of ipsilateral lung</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Flattening or inversion of ipsilateral diaphragm</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Widening of ipsilateral intercostal spaces</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Flattening of ipsilateral heart border</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hyperlucent ipsilateral thorax</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>CT</strong> – CT scanning is not necessary unless abnormalities are noted on the conventional chest radiograph that require further assessment [<a href="#rid3">3,26</a>]. CT may also be helpful in individuals with conditions that complicate interpretation of the conventional radiograph, such as congenital cystic lung disease (eg, congenital lobar emphysema) or congenital diaphragmatic hernia. In these cases, the lung cysts or loops of bowel filled with air may mimic air in the pleural space. CT of the chest or contrast studies (upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through) usually can distinguish these conditions. Chest CT is also helpful in the detection of small apical blebs  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61782" href="/d/graphic/61782.html" rel="external">image 4</a>) and in assessing chest tube placement when needed [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The clinical significance of apical blebs (&lt;2 cm) discovered on a CT scan is unclear. The frequency of such blebs reported in the literature varies widely, ranging from 28 to 45 percent in children with PSP [<a href="#rid19">19,29,30</a>] and 0 to 15 percent in healthy children and young adults [<a href="#rid29">29,31</a>]. Several studies in children suggest that the presence of apical blebs on CT does not predict recurrence risk [<a href="#rid3">3,30,32</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In our practice, we do not consider small apical blebs to be an indication for surgical intervention in a patient with a first occurrence of PSP. However, we observe patients with apical blebs closely and tend to move more quickly to surgical intervention if the patient does not improve with conservative management.

A clinically practical measure in adults is to define a large pneumothorax as one with ≥3 cm of air between the pleural line and apical chest wall, or ≥2 cm between the entire lateral lung edge and the chest wall on an upright chest radiograph. These measurements correspond to approximately 20 to 30 percent pneumothorax, but the accuracy of these methods is limited by uneven distributions of air, in some cases, and by distortion from digital imaging.

Arterial blood gas measurements should be performed in patients with respiratory distress or low values on pulse oximetry. Pulse oximetry may not be accurate if perfusion is poor, as may occur in patients with tension pneumothorax. Hypoxemia commonly occurs because collapsed and poorly ventilated portions of lung continue to receive significant perfusion. Hypercapnia is unusual in patients without underlying lung disease because adequate alveolar ventilation can be maintained in the contralateral lung [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Acute respiratory alkalosis may be present if pain, anxiety, and/or hypoxemia are substantial.

It is also useful for trauma patients or critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure, including those on mechanical ventilation, for whom rapid diagnosis of pneumothorax can help to avoid serious potential complications such as tension pneumothorax. Several different sonographic signs can be used to detect pneumothorax, particularly lack of lung sliding, which has a sensitivity of 86 to 98 percent and specificity of 97 to 100 percent to detect pneumothorax in adults and children with blunt trauma [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. For critically ill patients in intensive care with nontraumatic pneumothorax, it has been suggested that the absence of lung sliding is much less specific; lung sliding is more difficult to appreciate in this group of patients [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].

However, we avoid oxygen in neonates and also avoid prolonged exposure to high concentrations of oxygen in other patients to avoid toxicity.

If this approach is used, we suggest employing a protocol similar to that used in the study, in which stable patients were observed in the emergency department for at least four hours followed by repeat chest radiograph.

The pneumothorax should be reassessed by chest radiograph in 6 to 12 hours. If the PSP is resolving during the first 12 hours and the patient has no pain or respiratory distress, observation may be continued on an outpatient basis. Younger patients (eg, under 12 years of age) should be observed for longer. Criteria have not been developed to guide how long to observe such a patient and how long to wait before intervention if the pneumothorax persists. However, we would generally place a thoracostomy tube within 24 to 48 hours if the pneumothorax is not improving and earlier if it is increasing in size. All patients with SSP also should be hospitalized for observation and treatment of underlying lung disease.</p><p>This strategy of using observation for children with small PSP is based upon the more extensive experience in adults. Adult patients who are having a first PSP that is small (eg, less than 2 to 3 cm of air between lung and chest wall on the radiograph) and is not enlarging and who have no respiratory distress are generally safely managed with a conservative approach. There is some evidence that such patients are less likely to experience a recurrence if managed conservatively compared with those undergoing chest tube insertion [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. An ambulatory setting may be appropriate for adult patients, as long as serial chest radiographs are obtained and emergency care is available if needed.

A multicenter observational study from Australia and New Zealand provides some information about current management approaches and outcomes in children [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. Among 155 episodes of PSP, conservative management (no aspiration, chest tube, or surgery) was used for 59 percent of small PSPs and 20 percent of large PSPs.

Due to limited evidence for efficacy and concerns for oxygen toxicity, we avoid its use in neonates (except as needed to maintain oxygenation) and typically limit duration of oxygen therapy to &lt;48 (or &lt;72) hours for other patients. When supplemental oxygen therapy is used, it is typically delivered using a nonrebreathing facemask. High flow via nasal cannula should not be used, to minimize positive pressure to the upper airway.</p><p>For patients with underlying obstructive lung disease (causing SSP), high concentrations of oxygen can predispose to reabsorption atelectasis and should be approached with caution.</p><p>Use of supplemental oxygen is based on limited evidence from small studies in adult patients and animal models. Supplemental oxygen appears to increase the rate of reabsorption of air within the pleural space because the increased alveolar oxygen tension creates a steep gradient between the partial pressures of nitrogen in the pleural gas collection and the capillaries. In a small clinical study in adults, administration of 100 percent supplemental oxygen increased the rate of reabsorption fourfold; the beneficial effect of oxygen was most pronounced in patients with large pneumothoraces [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. A separate observational study in adolescents and young adults with PSP also suggested that oxygen therapy probably increases the resolution rate [<a href="#rid42">42</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/117232.html" rel="external">"Treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults", section on 'Observation with or without oxygen'</a>).

Among those treated with VATS, 18 percent had contralateral recurrence.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among 58 children (median age 16.7 years) with PSP managed nonoperatively, the risk of recurrence was 51 percent after one episode and 56 percent after two [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among 27 patients with PSP whose leak initially closed during nonoperative management, 15 had ipsilateral recurrence (55 percent) and 4 had contralateral recurrence (15 percent) [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. Among 20 patients who had persistent air leaks and were treated surgically (either VATS or thoracotomy), 3 had recurrences (15 percent). CT was not helpful in predicting which patients would experience recurrence on the contralateral side.</p><p></p><p>Thus, approximately 50 to 60 percent of pediatric patients with PSP will have a recurrence if managed conservatively (ie, without surgery or pleurodesis) [<a href="#rid3">3,30</a>]. There are insufficient data on pediatric patients to determine if the recurrence risk is similar to or higher than adults with PSP. Surgical pleurodesis greatly decreases the probability of recurrence [<a href="#rid30">30,62,63</a>].</p><p>The recurrence risk for pediatric patients with SSP is unclear but probably depends substantially on the underlying lung disease; patients with cystic fibrosis and pneumothorax have a recurrence rate of 50 to 80 percent if a preventive procedure is not performed [<a href="#rid64">64</a>], whereas a small series reported recurrence in none of seven patients with SSP associated with an acute episode of asthma [<a href="#rid65">65</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H174004707"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

Spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in the absence of any identified trauma. It is subdivided into primary and secondary types  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65455" href="/d/graphic/65455.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is diagnosed when a thorough investigation reveals no underlying lung disease that would predispose the individual to air leak.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP) occurs as a complication of underlying lung disease, such as cystic fibrosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Epidemiology</strong> – The peak incidence of PSP occurs between 16 and 24 years of age, and it is more common in males than females. PSP also occurs in younger children and newborn infants. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical presentation </strong>–<strong> </strong>Spontaneous pneumothorax most often occurs when patients are at rest or with minimal exertion. Patients with a large pneumothorax usually complain of the sudden onset of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain that is described as sharp or stabbing and may be preceded by a popping sensation. The pain typically is diffuse on the affected side with radiation to the ipsilateral shoulder. (See <a class="local">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Findings associated with a large pneumothorax include diminished breath sounds, hyperresonant percussion on the affected side, tachypnea, increased work of breathing, and/or cyanosis. The trachea may be shifted to the contralateral side. Arterial blood gas measurements often reveal hypoxemia. (See <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above and <a class="local">'Blood gas and pulse oximetry'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Imaging</strong> – The diagnosis of pneumothorax is established by chest radiograph. Anteroposterior and lateral views can confirm the presence of even small volumes of intrapleural air  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51728" href="/d/graphic/51728.html" rel="external">image 3</a>). CT of the chest may be helpful for patients with underlying pulmonary conditions or thoracic anomalies. (See <a class="local">'Radiography'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial management</strong> – Management of spontaneous pneumothorax in children requires an individualized approach and careful monitoring of pathophysiologic consequences because estimates of pneumothorax size and clinical outcomes are not well defined for this age group. Our general approach is  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef122990" href="/d/graphic/122990.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Small PSP</strong> – For clinically stable patients with an initial PSP that is small, we suggest observation in hospital rather than intervention to evacuate air from the pleural space (aspiration or tube thoracostomy) (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Longer periods of observation are suggested for younger children and those with underlying lung disease (secondary pneumothorax). (See <a class="local">'Observation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">We suggest that most patients hospitalized with PSP be given supplemental oxygen to enhance absorption of the air in the extrapleural space (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Due to limited evidence for efficacy and concerns for oxygen toxicity, we avoid supplemental oxygen in neonates (except as needed to maintain oxygenation) and typically limit duration of oxygen therapy to &lt;48 hours for other patients. (See <a class="local">'Supplemental oxygen'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Large PSP</strong> – For patients with a large PSP, management depends on patient characteristics (see <a class="local">'Evacuation of the pleural space'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>For patients with a first occurrence of a pneumothorax that is large or for patients with significant dyspnea, hypoxemia, or pain, we suggest evacuation of air from the pleural space, rather than observation (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>For clinically stable patients with PSP and for some patients with underlying lung disease (ie, SSP), aspiration is appropriate. For patients with mild symptoms, conservative management (observation) is a reasonable alternative. (See <a class="local">'Aspiration'</a> above and <a class="local">'Conservative management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Clinically unstable patients with PSP and most patients with SSP require continuous pleural drainage via pigtail catheter or thoracostomy tube. (See <a class="local">'Continuous pleural drainage'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Surgical management</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>No underlying lung disease (PSP)</strong> – For children and adolescents with PSP, we suggest surgical intervention for those with an air leak that fails to resolve after five to seven days with continuous pleural drainage or for those with recurrent PSP (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Indications for surgical intervention'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Underlying lung disease (SSP)</strong> – For children and adolescents with SSP, we suggest surgical intervention for patients with recurrent SSP and for those with underlying lung disease that is severe, progressive, or known to be associated with recurrent pneumothoraces (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). For patients with cystic fibrosis, surgical intervention is not recommended for the first occurrence of pneumothorax but is recommended for any recurrence. (See <a class="local">'Indications for surgical intervention'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When surgical intervention is performed, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with pleurodesis by manual abrasion is our preferred technique for most cases.
