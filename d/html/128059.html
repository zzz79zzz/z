         Screening for cervical cancer and its precursors includes assessing cervical cytology and/or testing for oncogenic subtypes of human papillomavirus (HPV). In patients with abnormal cervical cancer screening results, follow-up with colposcopy and cervical biopsies may result in a diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or cervical cancer.

         Management of cervical cytology and HPV results are reviewed here.

          table 2
         </a>
         ). HPV genotyping refers to testing for individual HPV types, usually HPV 16 or 18, but some tests may also include HPV 45 or intermediate-risk HPV types. HPV 16 and 18 are associated with the highest risk of CIN 3 and cancer [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. HPV 45 is associated with approximately 3.7 percent of cervical cancers and has nearly, but not equal to, the risk of HPV 16 or 18 [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Only assays approved by a regulatory body (eg, the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) should be used for HPV genotyping. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3219.html" rel="external">

         In 2012, the Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST) project of the College of American Pathology and American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) published changes in the terminology used to describe HPV-associated squamous lesions of the anogenital tract [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. In the LAST system, histologic cervical findings are described using the same terminology as cytologic findings and are described in the figure  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60116" href="/z/d/graphic/60116.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). However, in this topic, the CIN terminology will be used because that terminology is used in the ASCCP 2019 risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors. (See

         Management decisions for patients with abnormal screening results are based on a patient's risk of developing CIN 3+ (CIN 3, adenocarcinoma in situ, and cancer) as this threshold reflects a reasonable balance between cancer prevention and the potential harms of overtesting and overtreatment. For less common results, some studies report a lower threshold of risk (ie, CIN 2+ rather than CIN 3+) so that statistical power can be achieved; clinically, these thresholds are equivalent.

         The risk estimates were derived from a study of approximately 1.5 million patients in the Kaiser Permanente Medical Program, a large health care practice in the United States, who were screened with HPV and cervical cytology and followed for over a decade [

          The same current screening results may lead to a different management recommendation for one patient versus another patient, depending on past testing results

         Past HPV history modifies the risk of developing CIN 3+. For example, in an observational study of almost one million patients, one negative HPV result within the past five years compared with no prior HPV result reduced the risk of CIN 3+ at both three and five years by approximately 50 percent (0.04 versus 0.085 percent and 0.06 versus 0.11 percent, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13

         ]. Similarly, a positive HPV result, especially if recurrent or persistent (defined as consecutively positive HPV results at least 12 months apart), can greatly increase a patient's risk of disease. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See

         On the other hand, prior cytology results alone are not as predictive as HPV in the development of CIN 3+ and are therefore not used to modify subsequent management recommendations [

         There are many potential combinations of cervical cytology and HPV results, and some of these combinations are not addressed by guidelines. The aim of this topic is to assist clinicians in interpreting the evidence and guidelines and to help the clinician estimate the patient's risk of cancer, even when results do not conform exactly to the set algorithms and risk estimate tables described above. In these situations, the clinician should manage the patient to the highest risk abnormality as this is the safest, most conservative approach.

         Surveillance is recommended when the immediate risk of CIN 3+ is &lt;4 percent. As discussed above, these recommendations are based on expert committee opinion with the goal of providing a reasonable balance between cancer prevention and the potential harms of overtesting and overtreatment [
         <a href="#rid9">

         </a>
         ]; however, not all cervical cancers can be prevented. Some providers and patients may not be comfortable with the recommended surveillance intervals described below and may opt for more frequent testing. In our practice, we focus on shared decision-making and encourage patients and providers to follow these surveillance protocols whenever possible. When appropriate, medical interpreters and cultural navigators should be included in the conversation in order to increase shared decision-making practices, reduce misunderstandings, and promote screening and management compliance.

          Terminology
         </strong>
         – Screening for cervical cancer includes testing for oncogenic subtypes of human papillomavirus (HPV), cervical cytology, and co-testing with both HPV and cervical cytology. Abnormal squamous cervical cytology findings may be described as atypical squamous cells (ASC), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). Further evaluation of these abnormalities is required to exclude the presence of a precancerous or cancerous condition. (See

          Expedited treatment (immediate risk: &gt;60 percent)
         </strong>
         – For most nonpregnant patients ≥25 years of age in whom the immediate CIN 3+ risk is &gt;60 percent, we suggest expedited treatment with excision (usually in the form of loop electrosurgical excision procedure [LEEP]) rather than deferring treatment until after further diagnostic evaluation with colposcopy (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Typically, these patients require treatment, and colposcopy is unlikely to alter this management. Treatment, however, is associated with potential adverse pregnancy outcomes (eg, preterm delivery); therefore, patients planning future childbearing may reasonably choose colposcopy rather than expedited treatment to minimize these risks if an excisional procedure can be avoided based on colposcopic biopsy results.

         – For most nonpregnant patients ≥25 years of age in whom the immediate CIN 3+ risk is 4 to 24 percent, we proceed with diagnostic evaluation with colposcopy to guide decisions regarding management. Treatment with excision or ablation may be avoided in some patients, and colposcopic biopsies will provide information to help guide clinical decision-making. (See

         –For most nonpregnant patients ≥25 years of age in whom the immediate CIN 3+ risk is &lt;4 percent, long-term surveillance with HPV-based testing is required. These patients have mild abnormalities and do not reach the threshold for evaluation with colposcopy. The frequency of surveillance depends on the five-year risk for CIN 3+ and is detailed in the algorithm  (

          Patients &lt;25 years

         – Patients &lt;25 years old have high spontaneous regression rates of HPV and a relatively low risk of developing cervical cancer as they are among the cohort of patients targeted to receive the HPV vaccine. Therefore, an even more conservative management approach can be applied to this group given that the risk of CIN 3+ is lower than in patients ≥25 years old. (See

          Pregnant patients

         – Pregnant patients are managed similarly to nonpregnant patients with a few major differences: They are not candidates for expedited treatment or endocervical curettage (but gentle sampling of the endocervical canal with a cytobrush may be performed) and in patients undergoing colposcopy, a biopsy should only be performed if cancer is suspected. In our practice, we perform cytology, HPV, and colposcopic evaluation but generally defer these examinations until four weeks postdelivery. (See
