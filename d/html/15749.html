         Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death among females worldwide [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In the United States, up to 5 percent of women diagnosed with breast cancer have metastatic disease at the time of first presentation despite the gains in early detection. In addition, up to 30 percent of women with early-stage, non-metastatic breast cancer at diagnosis will develop distant metastatic disease [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Although metastatic breast cancer is unlikely to be cured, meaningful improvements in survival have been seen, coincident with the introduction of newer systemic therapies [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Available treatment options vary based on whether the tumor is hormone receptor positive (estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive) and whether or not human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is overexpressed (ie, HER2 positive). The treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer is reviewed here. An overview of the approach to metastatic breast cancer, HER2 as a predictive marker, endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer, chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer, and breast cancer in men are reviewed separately. In addition, commonly used chemotherapy treatment regimens in the treatment of breast cancer are also compiled in a separate topic.

         Approximately 20 percent of breast cancers overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a transmembrane glycoprotein epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with tyrosine kinase activity. Historically, overexpression of this receptor was associated with an increased risk of disease recurrence and an overall worse prognosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         A high level of HER2 overexpression, as determined by either 3+ staining by immunohistochemistry for the HER2 protein or evidence of
         <em>
          HER2
         </em>
         gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH ratio ≥2.0 or HER2 copy number ≥6.0), is a strong predictive factor for sensitivity to HER2-targeted agents, and these criteria should be used to select patients for these drugs [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-8
         </a>
         ]. Patients without HER2 overexpression do not appear to benefit from these drugs [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. Recommendations for assessing HER2 status, selection of patients, and HER2 status discordance between the primary tumor and metastases are presented separately. Of note, biopsy of tumor metastases and analysis for HER2 status is recommended. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/780.html" rel="external">
          "HER2 and predicting response to therapy in breast cancer"
         </a>

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Therapies that target HER2 have become important agents in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and have altered the natural course of HER2-positive breast cancer [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Because the use of HER2-directed therapy improves survival for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, we recommend that such patients receive HER2-directed therapy as first- and later-line treatment [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. In a meta-analysis of seven randomized trials, involving 1497 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, the addition of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10101" href="/z/d/drug information/10101.html" rel="external">
          trastuzumab
         </a>
         to treatment improved overall survival (hazard ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.94) [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Trastuzumab extended time to death by between five and eight months. Although it also increased the risk of congestive heart failure (relative risk 3.49, 90% CI 1.88-6.47), cardiotoxicity was reversible with holding treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Multiple HER2-directed agents are available for use in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer, either in the first-line or later-line setting:

          pertuzumab

         may be reasonable, in particular if they do not have visceral disease and could tolerate some initial disease progression without survival consequence. Moreover, if a patient initiates single-agent trastuzumab or trastuzumab plus pertuzumab and progresses on therapy, we add chemotherapy to treatment rather than discontinue trastuzumab. Although this sequential treatment (trastuzumab alone followed by chemotherapy upon disease progression or vice versa) reduces the risk of initial treatment-related toxicity, there are no data confirming that OS is similar with the sequential approach.

        <p>
         We are aware of three published trials randomizing patients to chemotherapy plus

          table 1
         </a>
         ). Together, these results suggest, but do not prove, that the sequential approach (antibody therapy followed by chemotherapy at progression) may not be inferior to the combination strategy. We therefore consider trastuzumab monotherapy or trastuzumab plus

         Women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive breast cancer should receive HER2-directed therapy as a component of their first-line treatment plan. While most patients are treated in the first line with a HER2-directed agent plus chemotherapy, HER2-directed therapy in combination with endocrine therapy is an acceptable alternative for those whose disease is not rapidly progressive or symptomatic, or is not characterized by significant visceral involvement (ie, multiorgan metastases). For such women, endocrine plus HER2-directed therapy may offer a less toxic first-line approach compared with HER2 treatment combined with chemotherapy.

         After achievement of best response to treatment (usually after 6 to 12 months of combined therapy) and for whom cytotoxic chemotherapy has been discontinued, the decision on whether and how long to continue HER2-directed therapy should be individualized because there are no prospective data to inform this issue.

         Anti-HER2-directed therapy can be continued for years in such patients, and in our experience, decades, without disease progression. However, the same can be said for patients who discontinued treatment. While continuation of HER2-directed treatment can increase the risk of cumulative toxicity (especially cardiotoxicity), increase healthcare costs, and may be inconvenient, these considerations must be balanced by the potential benefit of treatment in delaying (or preventing) disease progression.

         For patients with metastatic breast cancer who progress on HER2-directed therapy, we continue HER2-directed agents with subsequent regimens as needed, provided there is no evidence of clinically significant toxicity. The decision to continue HER2-directed treatment, and the choice of subsequent therapy, must be based on an individualized assessment of treatment-related toxicity, prior treatments, and patient preferences.

For example, in this trial, one patient who received T-DM1 experienced a grade 4 gastrointestinal bleeding event despite having a normal platelet count. Based on these findings, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) revised the label for T-DM1 in July 2014 to highlight this increased risk of bleeding with recommendations for careful follow-up for patients during treatment with T-DM1 [

         Taking all of these data into consideration, treatment of patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive disease could conceivably include combinations of available endocrine therapies with one or more of the approved HER2-targeted agents and with CDK 4/6 inhibitors. Our practice is to adjust the combination of targeted therapies for disease control, keeping in mind that based on PERTAIN, ALTERNATIVE, and monarcHER the one constant appears to be the benefit of continuing

          Introduction

         – Approximately 20 percent of breast cancers overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a transmembrane glycoprotein epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with tyrosine kinase activity.

          HER2 and predicting response to therapy

         – A high level of HER2 overexpression, as determined by either 3+ staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the HER2 protein or evidence of

          HER2
         </em>
         gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH ratio ≥2.0 or HER2 copy number ≥6.0), is a strong predictive factor for sensitivity to HER2-targeted agents, and these criteria should be used to select patients for these drugs. Patients without HER2 overexpression do not appear to benefit from these drugs. (See

          Monitoring therapy
