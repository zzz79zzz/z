         Eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder can be life-threatening due to general medical complications and suicide, and patients often refuse treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic provides an overview of treatment in patients with eating disorders. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, assessment, diagnosis, course of illness, and medical complications of eating disorders are discussed separately, as is the refeeding syndrome in anorexia nervosa.

         Patients with eating disorders who are not medically stable (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115022" href="/z/d/graphic/115022.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ) should be hospitalized for medical stabilization. Criteria for hospitalizing patients with eating disorders who are medically unstable or who have medical complications are discussed in the context of anorexia nervosa. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15777.html" rel="external">
          "Anorexia nervosa in adults: Evaluation for medical complications and criteria for hospitalization to manage these complications", section on 'Treatment setting'

        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with eating disorders who are medically stable, determining the treatment setting requires a thorough general medical and psychiatric evaluation, and the decision about disposition rests upon assessment of the risks and benefits of each option. Treatment options (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73092" href="/z/d/graphic/73092.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ) usually include inpatient hospitalization, partial hospital (day program), and outpatient care; in addition, residential care may be available [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Clinical judgment and some degree of individuation is required. The choice is based upon the severity of illness as well as underlying or concurrent general medical and psychiatric disorders. As an example, patients with eating disorders may have serious medical complications and are at increased risk for suicide or non-suicidal self-injurious behavior [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ], and may thus require psychiatric hospitalization or day treatment programs.

         Treatment of eating disorders generally involves an interdisciplinary team with experience in treating these disorders; the team includes a mental health clinician, dietitian, and a general medical clinician.

         The mental health clinician typically coordinates care among the team members and administers the individual, group, and family psychotherapies that are the mainstays of treatment. In general, psychotherapy focuses primarily upon eating disorder cognitions and behaviors, and secondarily addresses affective issues, relationships, and underlying issues that may have initiated the eating disorder. In addition, clinicians with expertise in eating disorders can also provide pharmacotherapy. Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for anorexia and bulimia nervosa are discussed elsewhere in this topic.

         Dietary and nutritional support staff direct nutritional rehabilitation, discuss available dietary options and meal plan requirements with patients, and provide nutritional education regarding changes in eating behaviors. The dietitian, with the general medical clinician, sets appropriate weight goals.

         If the diagnosis of an eating disorder is not clear, the general medical clinician must rule out other nonpsychiatric medical causes of weight loss, vomiting, or menstrual irregularity. In addition, the clinician assesses patients for medical complications (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67080" href="/z/d/graphic/67080.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ), and monitors immediate medical issues (eg, vital sign stability, electrolyte abnormalities, and hydration status) as well as longer term issues (eg, bone density, menstruation, and growth issues in younger patients). For patients with anorexia nervosa, it is often necessary to check their weight and vital signs on a weekly basis to ensure weight gain and medical stability.

         The stigma of eating disorders may be associated with dysfunctional thoughts that may perhaps interfere with treatment. Education of patients that includes biological explanations may possibly mitigate stigma. Indirect evidence for incorporating biological explanations as part of psychoeducation includes a meta-analysis of four studies in 542 undergraduate students, which compared the efficacy of biological explanations with sociocultural explanations in reducing the stigma of eating disorders; three of the studies were randomized trials [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3

         ]. Reduction of stigma was superior with biological explanations, and the clinical advantage was moderate.

         – Time-limited psychodynamic psychotherapy addresses conscious and unconscious meanings of eating disorder symptoms, the effects of symptoms upon current relationships, and the patient’s relationship with the therapist, and does not advise patients about eating behaviors. Evidence supporting the use of psychodynamic psychotherapy includes a one-year randomized trial in 40 patients that compared psychodynamic psychotherapy (weekly sessions lasting 50 minutes, for one year) with usual treatment that included psychoeducation, encouraging patients to adopt a healthy diet, and monitoring patient weight (monthly sessions lasting 30 minutes) [

         ]. One type of family therapy is called family-based treatment (also called the Maudsley method), which is used for adolescents and focuses upon weight gain; the treatment initially places parents in charge of making decisions about appropriate eating and related behaviors, with the support of a family therapist [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,19-22

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Another type of family therapy for adolescents with anorexia nervosa is called parent-focused treatment, in which a therapist meets with only the parents while a nurse meets with the patient for monitoring. The benefits of family-based treatment and parent-focused treatment appear to be comparable. One open-label randomized trial (n = 107 patients and their families) compared the two treatments, which each consisted of 18 sessions administered over six months; although remission at the end of treatment was greater with parent-focused treatment than family-based treatment (43 versus 22 percent of patients), follow-up assessments at 6 and 12 months posttreatment each found that remission was comparable [

         Another reasonable alternative is systemic family therapy, which focuses upon general family functioning and processes. An open-label, nine-month randomized trial (n = 158 adolescents and their families) compared family-based treatment with systemic family therapy and found that weight gain during the first eight weeks was faster with family-based treatment than systemic family therapy, and that the median number of days of hospitalization required during the study was less with family-based treatment than systemic family therapy (8 versus 21) [

         Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an investigational approach for patients with anorexia nervosa but is clinically available for other disorders (eg, unipolar major depression). The intervention uses an alternating current passed through a metal coil placed against the scalp to generate a magnetic field, which induces an electric current that depolarizes neurons in a focal area of the surface cortex. A randomized trial compared one session of TMS with sham stimulation applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in patients with anorexia nervosa [

          27

         The treatment of binge eating disorder generally involves psychotherapy; however, pharmacotherapy is a reasonable alternative. For overweight or obese patients with binge eating disorder, behavioral weight loss therapy may be beneficial. In addition, patients should be monitored for medical complications.

          Anorexia nervosa
         </strong>
         – For patients who present with anorexia nervosa and are medically stable, options for level of care usually include psychiatric inpatient hospitalization, partial hospital (day program), and outpatient care (

         Initial treatment – The treatment of anorexia nervosa generally involves nutritional rehabilitation and psychotherapy. Nutritional rehabilitation includes prescribing and supervising meals, and proscribing binge eating and purging; hospitalization may be necessary for patients who cannot adhere to treatment. Refeeding that is too rapid or aggressive can lead to the potentially fatal refeeding syndrome. Psychotherapy options for anorexia nervosa include family therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, specialist supportive clinical management, and motivational interviewing. In addition, adolescent patients may benefit from family therapy.
