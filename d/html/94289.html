         Transsphenoidal surgery is the mainstay of treatment for most pituitary adenomas and other sellar masses. Most pituitary lesions amenable to surgery are benign anterior pituitary adenomas.
        </p>
        <p>
         The most important anesthetic concerns involve the physiologic and anatomic effects of either excess hormone secretion from functional tumors, or hormone deficiency caused by compression of pituitary tissue.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic discusses the preoperative evaluation and anesthetic management of patients undergoing transsphenoidal resection of pituitary lesions. The text reflects both publications in the anesthesia literature and our institutional practice.
        </p>
        <p>
         Surgical technique, results, and complications of transsphenoidal surgery are discussed separately. (See

         Most transsphenoidal surgical procedures are elective, with ample time for thorough preoperative evaluation and airway assessment. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94539.html" rel="external">
          "Preoperative evaluation for anesthesia for noncardiac surgery"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For elective surgery, the physiologic and anatomic effects of functioning tumors require particularly careful consideration in consultation with the surgeon and endocrinologist. Anesthetic concerns are most significant for patients with acromegaly and Cushing's disease. Patients with hormonal deficiencies (eg, hypothyroidism, arginine vasopressin deficiency [AVP-D, previously called central diabetes insipidus]) should also be identified and, if necessary, treated preoperatively. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6632.html" rel="external">

         The clinical manifestations of acromegaly are discussed in detail separately. Manifestations of particular concern for anesthetic management are discussed here. (See

          Airway changes in patients with acromegaly

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Acromegaly is associated with anatomic changes that may increase the difficulty with airway management for anesthesia, and may cause obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). These changes include mandibular and maxillary enlargement; macroglossia; swelling of the soft palate and pharyngeal wall; thickening of true and false vocal cords; vocal cord paresis; tracheal compression; and hypertrophy of the epiglottis and periepiglottic tissues [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. These changes may cause difficulty with mask ventilation, visualization of the glottis, and/or insertion of the endotracheal tube (ETT).
        </p>
        <p>
         The reported incidence of difficult direct laryngoscopy in patients with acromegaly varies between 9 and 40 percent [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-6
         </a>
         ], compared with 2 to 6 percent in patients without acromegaly [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ], though failed intubation is very rare. Similar to patients without acromegaly, bedside airway assessment tests (eg, Mallampati test, thyromental distance, mouth opening) are relatively insensitive predictors of difficult laryngoscopy, at least for direct laryngoscopy [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3,8
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91218.html" rel="external">
          "Airway management for induction of general anesthesia", section on 'Prediction of the difficult airway'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Any available relevant imaging (lateral skull radiograph, computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] of head and neck) should be reviewed for changes in airway anatomy associated with endocrine dysfunction. In some institutions, preoperative airway assessment includes preoperative flexible nasopharyngoscopy by an otolaryngologist [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Soft tissue changes associated with acromegaly may be reversible with medical management (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6625.html" rel="external">
          "Treatment of acromegaly"
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         However, bony changes are irreversible and can still be present at the time of surgery, and regression of soft tissue changes does not guarantee easier airway management. In a prospective study of 128 patients with acromegaly who underwent transsphenoidal pituitary resection, the incidence of difficult laryngoscopy was similar in patients who received preoperative treatment with

          octreotide
         </a>
         and those who did not, though the numbers were too small to draw definitive conclusions [

         Cardiovascular abnormalities associated with acromegaly include hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmias, and cardiomyopathy [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,10
         </a>
         ]. Heart failure and valvular heart disease are also more common in patients with acromegaly. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Preoperative cardiac evaluation should be similar to patients without acromegaly. Preoperative medical therapy with a somatostatin analog can improve cardiac function in patients with cardiovascular dysfunction related to acromegaly, and should be considered in consultation with the surgeon, neuro-endocrinologist, and cardiologist [

         Sleep apnea occurs in up to 50 percent of patients with acromegaly, primarily related to the airway changes discussed above [

        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with OSA are more sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of sedatives and opioids, and are at increased risk of perioperative complications. Perioperative management of patients with OSA is discussed separately in several topics. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13516.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with OSA who use positive airway pressure therapy (PAP; ie, continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] or bilevel positive airway pressure [BPAP]), the need for postoperative PAP should be discussed preoperatively with the surgeon. Postoperative PAP therapy is generally recommended for patients with OSA who use it preoperatively (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13518.html" rel="external">
          "Postoperative management of adults with obstructive sleep apnea", section on 'Positive airway pressure therapy'
         </a>
         ). However, PAP has been associated with development of pneumocephalus after transsphenoidal therapy, and some surgeons prohibit its use [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. The incidence of pneumocephalus, risk factors, and optimal timing for resumption of PAP after this type of surgery have not been defined.

The pathogenesis of SIADH related to pituitary adenomas is unknown.

         We order a complete blood count and blood typing and antibody screen (ie, type and screen). Significant bleeding is rare. However, there is potential for catastrophic bleeding because the cavernous sinus forms the lateral border of the sella turcica and contains, in addition to venous structures, the intra-cavernous portion of the internal carotid artery. Depending on the size and location of the tumor and the expected response time of the blood bank, preoperative crossmatch of one or more units of red blood cells may be indicated.

Advanced monitoring (eg, continuous intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring) may be used, based on patient comorbidities. Intra-arterial catheters may also be placed if the need for multiple blood samples is anticipated (eg, invasive tumors, diabetes mellitus, arginine vasopressin deficiency [previously called central diabetes insipidus] or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, elevated intracranial pressure). Larger arteries (eg, brachial, axillary, or femoral arteries) may be used as alternatives for patients in whom radial arterial access is not possible or appropriate (see

         In optimal surgical position, the head may be moderately extended. Extending the head can inadvertently extubate the patient or cause the ETT cuff to herniate through the vocal cords. After turning the bed and head positioning, the anesthesiologist should ensure bilateral breath sounds, end-tidal carbon dioxide return, and a lack of excessive cuff leak, prior to draping for surgery, as the anesthesia team does not have access to the head during the surgery.

        <p>
         A throat pack, typically made of moistened gauze, may be placed by the surgeon to protect the airway from blood and debris, and to prevent blood from entering the stomach, which can cause PONV.

         The anesthesia breathing circuit should be routed to allow surgical access, and in cases in which fluoroscopy is used, unimpeded access for the radiology equipment.

         After anesthesia is induced and the airway secured, the operating table is typically turned 90 degrees with respect to the anesthesia machine. The head may be secured in Mayfield pins or supported on a headrest. The arm on the side on which the surgeon will stand is padded and tucked along the patient's side. The anesthesia clinician typically has access to the opposite upper and lower extremities.

         During positioning, meticulous attention should be paid to padding joints and pressure points, particularly for patients with functioning pituitary tumors, who may be at increased risk of positioning-related injuries. Excess cortisol secretion in Cushing's disease leads to skin fragility and osteoporosis, while tissue enlargement in acromegaly can increase the risk of nerve compression. (See

         Considerations specific to transsphenoidal surgery are discussed here.
        </p>
        <p>
         Much of the surgery is not particularly stimulating, aside from drilling of the sphenoid bone, which may require transiently deepening anesthesia (eg, with short-acting opioid or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9826" href="/z/d/drug information/9826.html" rel="external">

          esmolol
         </a>
         ). Transsphenoidal surgery involves delicate dissection that requires an immobile patient. In particular, patient motion during tumor dissection can result in injury to the cavernous sinus or internal carotid artery. Immobility can be achieved with neuromuscular blocking agents, deep inhalation anesthesia, and/or

         There is no consensus regarding optimal blood pressure targets during surgery (see

          "Anesthesia for patients with hypertension", section on 'Determination of target blood pressure values'
         </a>
         ). We aim for normotension in patients without hypertension. In patients with hypertension, we aim to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) within 20 percent of baseline, as determined at previous clinical encounters. Hypertension beyond these goals should generally be avoided, since much of the intraoperative bleeding is from cut bone edges, with limited surgical options for control. The decision to maintain a higher MAP must be balanced against risks of greater bleeding.
        </p>
        <p>
         The surgeon applies a vasoconstrictor topically or injects it into the nasal mucosa before initial incision to minimize bleeding. Patients who undergo transsphenoidal surgery often experience significant hypertension and arrhythmias after intranasal injection of epinephrine-containing solutions and during emergence from anesthesia. In a single institution retrospective review of 100 patients who underwent transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, 58 percent of patients experienced a &gt;50 percent increase in systolic blood pressure with intranasal injection, and 33 percent experienced a &gt;50 percent increase in systolic blood pressure upon emergence from anesthesia [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23

         ]. There was no difference in the hemodynamic response of patients with Cushing's disease or acromegaly, compared with patients without endocrinopathy. The mechanism for such an exaggerated blood pressure response is unknown, but may relate to underlying hypertension, which is common in patients who undergo these procedures.

        </p>
        <p>
         The ideal emergence should be smooth, with avoidance of cough, straining, and hypertension, and with the patient rapidly awake enough for an adequate neurologic examination and vision assessment. Coughing and straining increase venous pressure and can cause epistaxis, and can also force nasopharyngeal flora into the wound, and therefore potentially increase the risk of meningitis.

         Extubation in a patient with a difficult airway is considered a high risk extubation (see

          "Extubation following anesthesia", section on 'Higher-risk extubation'
         </a>
         ). After transsphenoidal surgery, high risk extubation occurs most commonly in the patient with acromegaly who was difficult to intubate, or had an awake flexible scope intubation. For these patients, we administer a

          remifentanil
         </a>
         infusion (0.02 to 0.05 mcg/kg/min IV) during extubation. This allows the patient to spontaneously breathe while reducing the response to the presence of the ETT in the airway. We extubate once airway reflexes return, the patient follows commands, and appears able to maintain his or her own airway. We agree with recommendations from airway management organizations that the use of an airway exchange catheter should be considered when extubating such high-risk patients, to facilitate rapid reintubation if necessary. (See

         For patients who undergo transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, the most important anesthetic concerns involve the anatomic and physiologic changes that result from hormone abnormalities, particularly from functioning tumors that cause acromegaly or Cushing's disease. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Preoperative evaluation'

         Patients with acromegaly are at increased risk of unanticipated difficulty with airway management, cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and diabetes. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Patients with acromegaly'

         For patients with Cushing's disease, anesthetic concerns include associated cardiovascular disease, impaired glucose control, OSA, and obesity-related difficulty with airway management. (See

          Anesthetic management –
         </strong>
         General anesthesia with an oral endotracheal tube (ETT) is required for transsphenoidal pituitary surgery. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Anesthetic management'
         </a>
         above.)

         </span>
         For patients with acromegaly, difficulty with airway management should be anticipated with preoxygenation and possible apneic oxygenation and immediate availability of personnel and equipment for difficult airway management. Awake flexible scope intubation should be considered for patients who are felt to be at particularly high risk. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Airway management'
         </a>

         Prophylaxis for postoperative nausea and vomiting should be administered for all patients who undergo transsphenoidal pituitary resection. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prophylaxis for postoperative nausea and vomiting'

         Optimal resection of the tumor may require intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI). (See

          Emergence from anesthesia –
         </strong>
         The ideal emergence should be smooth, with avoidance of cough, straining, and hypertension, and with the patient rapidly awake enough for an adequate neurologic examination and vision assessment. (See
