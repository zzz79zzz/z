This task is complicated by the fact that abdominal pain is often a nonspecific complaint that presents with other symptoms [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews a diagnostic approach to nontraumatic abdominal pain in adults. The causes of abdominal pain and its pathophysiology, the evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain in the emergency department, and the evaluation of abdominal pain related to trauma is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6860.html" rel="external">"Causes of abdominal pain in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/290.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult with nontraumatic abdominal or flank pain in the emergency department"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15700.html" rel="external">"Traumatic gastrointestinal injury in the adult patient"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H629458839"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Abdominal pain is a common problem. Most patients have a benign and/or self-limited etiology, and the initial goal of evaluation is to identify those patients with a serious etiology that may require urgent intervention. A history and focused physical examination will lead to a differential diagnosis of abdominal pain, which will then inform further evaluation with laboratory evaluation and/or imaging.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H629458845"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The history of a patient with abdominal pain includes determining whether the pain is acute or chronic and a detailed description of the pain and associated symptoms, which should be interpreted with other aspects of the medical history.</p><p>The overall sensitivity and specificity of the history and physical examination in diagnosing the different causes of abdominal pain is poor [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], particularly for benign conditions [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Fortunately, studies of the accuracy of history and physical examination for the more serious causes of abdominal pain (eg, acute appendicitis), alone or in combination with focused investigations, have yielded better results [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H148947515"><span class="h3">Acute versus chronic</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is no strict time period that will classify the differential diagnosis unfailingly. A clinical judgment must be made that considers whether this is an accelerating process, one that has reached a plateau, or one that is longstanding but intermittent. Patients with chronic abdominal pain may present with an acute exacerbation of a chronic problem or a new and unrelated problem.</p><p>Pain of less than a few days’ duration that has worsened progressively until the time of presentation is clearly "acute." Pain that has remained unchanged for months or years can be safely classified as chronic. Pain that does not clearly fit either category might be called subacute and requires consideration of a broader differential than acute and chronic pain.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H629458851"><span class="h3">Description</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pain should be characterized according to location, chronology, severity, aggravating and alleviating factors, and associated symptoms. It is also important to note if the patient has recurring episodes of similar pain as this may narrow the differential.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Location and radiation</strong> – The location of abdominal pain helps narrow the differential diagnosis as different pain syndromes typically have characteristic locations  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106201 graphicRef106200 graphicRef106199 graphicRef106205" href="/d/graphic/106201.html" rel="external">table 1A-D</a>). For example, pain involving the liver or biliary tree is generally located in the right upper quadrant, but it may radiate to the back or epigastrium. Because hepatic pain only results when the capsule of the liver is "stretched," most pain in the right upper quadrant is related to the biliary tree. Pain radiation is also important: the pain of pancreatitis classically bores to the back, while renal colic radiates to the groin.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Temporal elements</strong> – The onset, frequency, and duration of the pain are helpful features. The pain of pancreatitis may be gradual and steady, while perforation and resultant peritonitis begins suddenly and is maximal from the onset.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Quality</strong> – The quality of the pain includes determining whether the pain is burning or gnawing, as is typical of gastroesophageal reflux and peptic ulcer disease, or colicky, as in the cramping pain of gastroenteritis or intestinal obstruction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Severity</strong> – The severity of the pain generally is related to the severity of the disorder, especially if acute in onset. For example, the pain of biliary or renal colic or acute mesenteric ischemia is of high intensity, while the pain of gastroenteritis is less marked. Age and general health may affect the patient's clinical presentation. A patient taking corticosteroids may have significant masking of pain, and older adult patients often present with less intense pain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Precipitants or palliation</strong> – Determining what precipitates or palliates the pain can help narrow the differential. The pain of chronic mesenteric ischemia usually starts within one hour of eating, while the pain of duodenal ulcers may be relieved by eating and recur several hours after a meal. The pain of pancreatitis is classically relieved by sitting up and leaning forward. Peritonitis often causes patients to lie motionless on their backs because any motion causes pain. Obtaining a history of pain occurring in relationship to eating lactose- or gluten-containing foods may be helpful in identifying sensitivities to these food constituents. Patients with foodborne illness may become ill after eating certain foods  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58714" href="/d/graphic/58714.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H629458880"><span class="h3">Associated symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Symptoms that occur in relation to abdominal pain may give important information.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other gastrointestinal symptoms</strong> – We ask about associated nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, hematochezia, melena, and changes in stool (eg, change in caliber). For patients with right upper quadrant pain or concern for liver disease, we also ask about jaundice and changes in the color of urine and stool. The bowel habit is an important part of the history for chronic abdominal pain. While many organic lesions can result in chronic diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often presents with swings between diarrhea and constipation, a pattern that is much less likely with organic disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Genitourinary symptoms</strong> – Patients with symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, and hematuria are more likely to have a genitourinary cause for their abdominal pain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Constitutional symptoms</strong> – Symptoms such as fevers, chills, fatigue, weight loss, and anorexia would be concerning for infection, malignancy, or systemic illnesses (eg, inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cardiopulmonary symptoms</strong> – Symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and exertional dyspnea suggest a pulmonary or cardiac etiology. Orthostatic hypotension may indicate early shock or be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other</strong> – Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis will have symptoms of polyuria and thirst. Patients with suspected IBD should be asked about extraintestinal manifestations  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81867" href="/d/graphic/81867.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H629458903"><span class="h3">Other medical history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other aspects of the history help narrow the differential.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Specific questions for females</strong> – Females should be screened for sexually transmitted diseases and risks for pelvic inflammatory disease (eg, new or multiple partners). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7596.html" rel="external">"Screening for sexually transmitted infections", section on 'Assessing risk'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Premenopausal individuals should be asked about their menstrual history (last menstrual period, last normal menstrual period, previous menstrual period, cycle length) and use of contraception. They should also be asked about vaginal discharge or bleeding, dyspareunia or dysmenorrhea, as these symptoms suggest a pelvic pathology. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/446.html" rel="external">"Prenatal care: Initial assessment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5473.html" rel="external">"Acute pelvic pain in nonpregnant adult females: Evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5467.html" rel="external">"Chronic pelvic pain in adult females: Evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Past medical history</strong> – A history of surgeries and procedures should be obtained to assess risk for differing etiologies (eg, a history of abdominal surgery is a risk factor for obstruction). A history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or multiple risk factors for CVD in a patient with epigastric pain raises concern for a myocardial ischemia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6832.html" rel="external">"Outpatient evaluation of the adult with chest pain", section on 'Differential Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Medications</strong> – A comprehensive medication list (including over the counter medications and medications that cause constipation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62307" href="/d/graphic/62307.html" rel="external">table 4</a>)) should be elicited as this can inform the differential. For example, patients taking high doses of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are at risk for gastropathy and peptic ulcer disease. Patients with recent antibiotics use or hospitalization are at risk for <em>Clostridioides difficile</em>. Patients on chronic steroids are at risk for adrenal insufficiency and may be immunosuppressed with atypical presentations of abdominal pain. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/22.html" rel="external">"Peptic ulcer disease: Epidemiology, etiology, and pathogenesis", section on 'NSAIDs, including aspirin'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/26.html" rel="external">"Peptic ulcer disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Evaluate for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and corticosteroid use'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2696.html" rel="external">"<i>Clostridioides difficile </i>infection in adults: Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathophysiology", section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other history</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Alcohol</strong> – It is important to ask about alcohol intake to assess for the possibility of liver disease and pancreatitis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Family history</strong> – Family history should be asked as appropriate based on other history. For example, patients with history concerning for IBD or cancer should also be asked about family history. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4066.html" rel="external">"Definitions, epidemiology, and risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Travel history</strong> – A travel history is important to elicit in patients with symptoms consistent with gastroenteritis or colitis (eg, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) to consider infectious etiologies [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Sick contacts</strong> – Often patients are in contact with someone with gastroenteritis before having similar symptoms. Patients with foodborne illness may also have close contacts with similar illness.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H629459402"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients should have vital signs and an abdominal examination. Other physical examination will depend on the history. Patients with chronic abdominal pain should have a thorough physical examination.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vital signs</strong> – Unstable vital signs are an indication for immediate referral to the emergency department. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/290.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult with nontraumatic abdominal or flank pain in the emergency department"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Vital signs may inform further evaluation. Weight and any changes should be noted for patients seen over multiple visits. Patients with hypoxemia should be evaluated for pulmonary etiologies of abdominal pain. Fever raises suspicion for infectious disease. Orthostatic vital signs may be indicative of dehydration or a sign of adrenal insufficiency.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Abdominal examination</strong> – The abdominal examination includes inspection, auscultation, percussion, and palpation. In patients with suspected psychogenic abdominal pain, it is important to perform the abdominal examination while the patient is distracted.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Inspection</strong> – The general appearance and level of comfort or discomfort should be noted. Inspection of the abdomen should include attention to the position assumed by the patient when in pain; strict immobility is typical of a patient with peritonitis, while patients with biliary or renal colic writhe in agony. Patients with peritonitis will have worsening pain when the examiner lightly bumps the stretcher.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Auscultation</strong> – The abdomen should be auscultated for bowel sounds. Auscultation is a useful physical finding, particularly in detecting ileus [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. Abnormal bowel sounds are highly predictive of a small bowel obstruction in patients with acute abdominal pain. Abnormally active, high-pitched bowel sounds are a feature of early bowel obstruction, while a friction rub in the appropriate area might be heard in a patient with a splenic infarct.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Percussion</strong> – We start with gentle percussion (rather than palpation). Patients with peritonitis will have pain with gentle percussion. Percussion is also used to identify ascites and hepatomegaly. Tympany signifies a distended bowel, while dullness may signify a mass. Shifting dullness is a reliable and fairly accurate sign for the detection of ascites.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Palpation</strong> – Palpation is used to evaluate tenderness of the abdomen and for enlarged organs (eg, hepatomegaly or splenomegaly) or masses. We start by examining the quadrant of the abdomen where the patient is experiencing the least pain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Muscular rigidity or "guarding" is an important and early sign of peritoneal inflammation; it can be unilateral in a patient with a focal inflammatory mass such as a diverticular abscess or diffuse in peritonitis. Guarding is typically absent with deeper sources of pain such as renal colic and pancreatitis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Rebound tenderness may reflect peritonitis. If testing for rebound tenderness is appropriate, we begin with gentle palpation and release. If the patient has no rebound tenderness with gentle palpation, we then proceed to deeper palpation and release.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The patient should be examined for signs of nerve and muscle wall injury and hernia. Pain in a dermatomal distribution and hyperesthesia are both signs of nerve involvement as in herpes zoster or nerve root impingement. Abdominal wall pathology may be found by palpation or by noting exacerbation of the pain when using the abdominal wall muscles (eg, sitting up).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rectal examination</strong> – Most patients with abdominal pain should have a rectal examination. Fecal impaction might be the explanation for signs and symptoms of obstruction in older adults, while tenderness on rectal examination may be the only abnormal finding in a patient with retrocecal appendicitis. However, some patients with localized upper abdominal pain (eg, right upper quadrant pain) or abdominal pain that is likely from a non-gastrointestinal cause (eg, suspected cystitis) may not require a rectal examination.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pelvic examination</strong> – A pelvic examination should be done whenever pelvic pathology is in the differential diagnosis. Unless the patient has another etiology of abdominal pain, all females with acute lower abdominal pain should have a pelvic examination. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3253.html" rel="external">"The gynecologic history and pelvic examination"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6860.html" rel="external">"Causes of abdominal pain in adults", section on 'Females'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other</strong> – The eyes should be examined for scleral icterus and the skin for jaundice. Patients with pulmonary or cardiac symptoms should have pulmonary and cardiac exams. Patients with history concerning for IBD should be examined for extraintestinal manifestations of IBD  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81867" href="/d/graphic/81867.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1078.html" rel="external">"Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1079.html" rel="external">"Auscultation of heart sounds"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H629459502"><span class="h2">Studies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Laboratory studies are determined by the history and physical and will vary depending on the suspected etiology. Pregnancy should be excluded in all females of childbearing age with abdominal pain. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic approach to acute abdominal pain'</a> below and <a class="local">'Diagnostic approach to chronic abdominal pain'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with abdominal pain will often have imaging as part of their evaluation. The imaging modality chosen will depend on suspected etiologies. Imaging modalities that may be used to evaluate abdominal pain include ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; including magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography), endoscopy, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13928.html" rel="external">"Overview of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/632.html" rel="external">"Overview of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H629459947"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH TO ACUTE ABDOMINAL PAIN</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnostic approach to acute abdominal pain will depend on whether or not the pain is localized.

Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on "patient info" and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Basics topics (see  <a class="medical medical_basics" href="/d/html/15388.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Stomach ache and stomach upset (The Basics)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_basics" href="/d/html/15432.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Chronic pelvic pain in females (The Basics)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_basics" href="/d/html/15732.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Upper endoscopy (The Basics)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_basics" href="/d/html/16925.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Abdominal pain (The Basics)"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Beyond the Basics topics (see  <a class="medical medical_patient" href="/d/html/2009.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Upset stomach (functional dyspepsia) in adults (Beyond the Basics)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_patient" href="/d/html/8406.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Chronic pelvic pain in females (Beyond the Basics)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_patient" href="/d/html/1992.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Upper endoscopy (Beyond the Basics)"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H29"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – Most patients with abdominal pain have a benign and/or self-limited etiology. The initial goal of evaluation is to identify those patients who have a serious etiology for their symptoms that may require urgent intervention. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The history includes determining whether the pain is acute or chronic as well as obtaining a detailed description of the pain (eg, location, radiation, temporal description, quality, severity, and precipitating and palliating features) and any associated symptoms. (See <a class="local">'History'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>All patients with abdominal pain should have measurement of vital signs and a complete abdominal examination, including inspection, auscultation, percussion, and palpation. Other physical examination will depend upon the patient's history. Patients with chronic abdominal pain should have a thorough physical examination. (See <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications for urgent and/or surgical evaluation of acute abdominal pain</strong> – Patients with unstable vital signs, with signs of peritonitis on abdominal exam, or in whom there are concerns for life-threatening causes of abdominal pain (eg, acute bowel obstruction, acute mesenteric ischemia, perforation, acute myocardial infarction, ectopic pregnancy) should be referred to the emergency department. Patients with concern for infection on initial evaluation (eg, fever, jaundice, and right upper quadrant pain) should also be evaluated promptly, often requiring referral to the emergency department for expedited evaluation. (See <a class="local">'Urgent evaluation and/or surgical abdomen'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute abdominal pain: Etiologies and differential diagnosis</strong> (See <a class="local">'Nonurgent evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Localized pain</strong> – In patients with acute localized abdominal pain, the differential diagnosis can be considered in terms of "symptom clusters"  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106199 graphicRef106200 graphicRef106201 graphicRef106202" href="/d/graphic/106199.html" rel="external">table 1A-C, 1E</a>) in order to guide further management and investigation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Diffuse or nonspecific pain</strong> – Patients with diffuse or nonspecific abdominal pain may have pain from etiologies that lead to diffuse abdominal pain  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106203" href="/d/graphic/106203.html" rel="external">table 8</a>) or those that tend to be more localized  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106199 graphicRef106200 graphicRef106201 graphicRef106202" href="/d/graphic/106199.html" rel="external">table 1A-C, 1E</a>). (See <a class="local">'Diffuse abdominal pain'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Females with lower abdominal pain</strong> – Pelvic etiologies  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106204" href="/d/graphic/106204.html" rel="external">table 6</a>) should be considered in females who have lower abdominal pain. (See <a class="local">'Females'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation of chronic abdominal pain</strong> – Most patients with chronic abdominal pain have a benign functional disorder such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or functional dyspepsia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Initial evaluation</strong> – Initial workup is focused on differentiating benign functional illness from organic pathology. (See <a class="local">'Initial workup'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Additional evaluation in certain patients</strong> – Young patients with no evidence of organic disease can be treated symptomatically, although a diagnosis of new-onset functional illness should be made only with great caution in patients over 50 years of age. These patients, by virtue of their increased risk of malignancy, will likely require abdominal imaging as their symptoms and signs dictate. Less common causes of abdominal pain  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106205" href="/d/graphic/106205.html" rel="external">table 1D</a>) should be considered in patients with repeated visits for the same complaint, in an ill-appearing patient with minimal or nonspecific findings, in patients with pain out of proportion to clinical findings, and in immunocompromised patients. (See <a class="local">'Subsequent workup'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Etiologies of abdominal pain in special populations</strong> – Specific populations of patients, including older adults, females, and patients with HIV and sickle cell disease may present with unusual causes of abdominal pain or may have unusual presentations of common disorders. (See <a class="local">'Special populations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2092436367"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Sumit Majumdar, MD, MPH, now deceased, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Fleischer AB Jr, Gardner EF, Feldman SR.
