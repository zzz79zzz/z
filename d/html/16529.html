         Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is characterized by recurrent, self-limited episodes of swelling primarily involving the skin and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract and upper airway. There are several types.
        </p>
        <p>
         HAE types I and II, which are characterized by impaired C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) activity (HAE-C1-INH) due to protein deficiency (type I) or dysfunction (type II) are discussed separately:

         In 2000, a novel type of HAE was identified that was characterized by normal C1-INH activity in plasma [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. This type was classified as "HAE with normal C1-INH" or "HAE type III." Over time, HAE with normal C1-INH was shown to result from a number of different genetic causes with similar phenotypes [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of this disorder will be reviewed here.

         Information about the incidence and prevalence of HAE with normal C1-INH is limited because it is a rare disorder. The prevalence has been estimated to be 1:100,000 among German patients [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In the largest single series, approximately 11 percent of patients were male [

         </span>
         Historically, HAE was described as a familial disorder resulting from either deficiency or dysfunction of the inhibitor of the complement protein C1, termed C1 inhibitor (C1-INH). Types I and II are now collectively abbreviated as HAE-C1-INH. In 2000, two different groups published descriptions of another familial form of angioedema, in which affected individuals had normal C1-INH levels and activity [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ].

         Thirty-six patients from 10 families were detailed in the earliest study [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. All of the affected individuals were women, and all of those tested had normal C1-INH function and plasma concentration.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">

         </span>
         In a second report published in the same year, seven females from a single family were described in whom episodes only occurred during pregnancy or with the use of exogenous estrogens [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsequently, a number of additional families were described [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,6-8
         </a>
         ]. The largest series included 265 patients from 88 families [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The terms "estrogen-dependent" and "estrogen-associated inherited angioedema" were initially proposed to describe this disorder, prior to the recognition that males can also be affected [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. In an attempt to standardize nomenclature, a consensus statement from an international expert panel has recommended the disorder be designated "HAE with normal C1-INH" [

         In types I and II HAE, excess generation of bradykinin, a potent vasoactive substance, has convincingly been shown to be the major mechanism leading to the formation of angioedema [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. The pathophysiology of types I and II HAE is reviewed in more detail separately. (See

          "Hereditary angioedema (due to C1 inhibitor deficiency): Pathogenesis and diagnosis", section on 'Pathogenesis'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In HAE with normal C1-INH, it is not as clear that bradykinin is the main mediator of angioedema, although the efficacy of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16808" href="/z/d/drug information/16808.html" rel="external">
          icatibant

         , a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, is a strong indirect indicator that bradykinin is important [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. The kinin-generating pathways interface with the coagulation (contact system) and fibrinolytic pathways, and abnormalities of proteins in these pathways could also lead to abnormal generation of angioedema  (

The first and most common point mutation c.983C&gt;A (alternatively termed c.1032C&gt;A) results in substitution of a threonine residue for lysine (Thr328Lys; alternatively Thr309Lys), and the second c.983C&gt;G (alternatively termed c.1032C&gt;G) results in substitution of the same threonine residue for arginine (Thr328Arg; alternatively Thr309Arg) [

         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. In one study, mutations in the
         <em>

         gene were associated with normal plasma concentrations of FXII but an increase in its enzymatic activity when compared with healthy controls [

          16

         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>

         <em>
          F12

         gene mutations, O-glycosylation sites are lost in the FXII protein, resulting in an abnormal glycosylation [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. In a later study, it was reported that the loss of glycosylation led to an increased rate of FXII activation resulting in activation of the kallikrein-kinin pathway and bradykinin formation [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. The two missense mutations and the deletion mutation introduce new sites in the FXII protein that are sensitive to enzymatic cleavage by plasmin [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. The FXII mutants rapidly activate after cleavage by plasmin, escape from inhibition through C1-INH, and elicit excessive bradykinin formation. The findings indicate that plasmin modulates disease activity in patients with HAE-FXII. In 2019, another study showed that the

This accelerated FXII/prekallikrein activation overwhelms the regulatory functions of C1-INH, and more kallikrein can cleave high molecular weight kininogen to bradykinin  (

         </span>
         The impact of estrogens in HAE with normal C1-INH is highly variable. An exacerbating effect of estrogens on female patients with this disorder was first highlighted in one of the original descriptions of the disease, in which females only experienced angioedema attacks during pregnancy or while using some form of exogenous estrogen, such as oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Additional patients with estrogen-exacerbated angioedema have since been described [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,33,43,44
         </a>
         ]. However, other females with HAE with normal C1-INH can tolerate high levels of estrogen without a worsening of angioedema attacks [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,27,33
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         It is not entirely clear how estrogens would induce attacks, although they may influence expression of factors important in the synthesis and degradation of bradykinin. High levels of estrogens are reported to reduce plasma C1-INH levels, increase transcription of FXII protein, and increase plasma prekallikrein levels, all favoring an increase in bradykinin production  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87451" href="/z/d/graphic/87451.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). In keeping with some interaction between estrogens and FXII, patients with HAE-FXII were found to be more sensitive to estrogens than patients with HAE-unknown in one study [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. ACE is important in degradation of bradykinin and its metabolite, and estrogens may reduce expression of ACE and allow bradykinin accumulation. Estrogens may also increase the expression of bradykinin type 2 receptors [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The negative influence of estrogens is not specific to HAE with normal C1-INH, since estrogen is a well-established trigger in some females with HAE-C1-INH. (See

         HAE should be suspected in a patient with recurrent, self-limited angioedema without urticaria or pruritus, recurrent episodes of abdominal pain or laryngeal edema, and a family history of similar symptoms. However, a family history will not be present if the patient has a de novo mutation or is the first family member to display clinical features of the disorder.

         In contrast to those patients with HAE-C1-INH, patients with HAE with normal C1-INH have normal plasma C1-INH levels and activity, as well as normal plasma C4 levels. Because there is no specific biochemical test for HAE with normal C1-INH at present, it is generally accepted that either a family history of angioedema or the presence of a mutation known to be specific for HAE with normal C1-INH is required for diagnosis. Clinical features that help differentiate this disorder from HAE-C1-INH are reviewed above. (See

         When evaluating a patient with recurrent episodes of angioedema without urticaria, other causes of angioedema must be excluded. This is particularly important in a patient with an uncertain or negative family history of angioedema. A diagnostic algorithm is provided for patients with suggestive clinical features and no family history  (

         Patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should discontinue these medications and be treated with a different type of antihypertensive. It is important to note that the impact of discontinuation may only be clear after several months, as some patients will have a small number of recurrent episodes, particularly in the first few months after the ACE inhibitor was discontinued. This is discussed in more detail separately. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are usually tolerated. (See

         If an allergic cause is suspected, the patient should be referred to an allergy specialist, if possible, or tested for immunoglobulin E (IgE) to the suspected allergen. A trial of strict avoidance is another option.

         If no medication or allergy can be implicated, then the patient can be said to have idiopathic angioedema. Complement studies are normal in idiopathic angioedema. Idiopathic angioedema can be classified to histaminergic angioedema (responding to antihistamines) and nonhistaminergic angioedema (not responding to antihistamines).
        </p>
        <p>
         A trial of antihistamine therapy is helpful in distinguishing histaminergic from nonhistaminergic idiopathic angioedema. Histaminergic idiopathic angioedema often improves with antihistamines, alone or in combination with glucocorticoids. The evidence supporting the use of H1 antihistamines in idiopathic angioedema is reviewed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8105.html" rel="external">

         We treat patients with a nonsedating H1 antihistamine for at least one month (or an appropriate amount of time, depending on the frequency of attacks in that individual). Options include

         (180 mg daily), or a similar agent. If this does not prevent episodes of angioedema, we double or quadruple the dose for another one to three months (cetirizine up to four times daily or an equivalent for one month or an interval long enough to expect three or more angioedema attacks) [

         In addition, we instruct patients to treat with additional medications at the first sign of symptoms. Some patients have identifiable sensations in the skin or tissue just before the onset of angioedema, and the medications should be taken when these sensations appear. In this setting, we ask patients to self-administer 40 mg of

         A patient not responsive to antihistamines is presumed to fall into the category of nonhistaminergic idiopathic angioedema.

         Patients with acute symptoms involving the upper airway are at risk for fatal asphyxiation. Assessment and protection of the upper airway is the first and most important management issue in the patient with an acute attack involving any part of the airway, because none of the available therapies are universally effective. In addition, these agents take time to work, and the patient's airway must be protected in the interim. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8104.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Intubation should be performed immediately if stridor or signs of respiratory arrest are present. A clinician trained in difficult airway management should be summoned, if possible, because failed attempts can lead to fatal obstruction. Emergency cricothyroidotomy may be required in rare cases. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/263.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Once the patient is assessed and either intubated or deemed stable, additional therapies can be considered. Transfer to the intensive care unit should be arranged. Frequent and meticulous monitoring of airway status should continue throughout the course of the attack until complete resolution, and patients should not be discharged until all airway symptoms have resolved.

         Long-term prophylaxis is indicated for patients who do not achieve adequate control of their disease with trigger avoidance and on-demand therapy alone. The decision to start long-term prophylactic treatment should be individualized, and the approach may differ somewhat around the world. Most experts would consider initiating prophylaxis for the following:

         Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor (HAE with normal C1-INH, previously called HAE type III) was first described in 2000 and is characterized by recurrent, self-limited episodes of skin swelling, tongue swelling, and/or abdominal pain. It is distinguished from other forms of HAE (ie, types I and II, together called HAE-C1-INH) by the presence of normal complement studies. (See

         Patients with HAE with normal C1-INH have normal function and plasma concentrations of C1-INH, in contrast to those with HAE-C1-INH. Patients from many families have specific mutations in the coagulation factor XII gene
         <em>
          (F12)
         </em>
         , the plasminogen gene, or several other genes. Many female patients have more severe disease when pregnant or taking exogenous estrogens, while others are not influenced by hormonal factors. (See

         HAE with normal C1-INH is clinically similar to HAE-C1-INH, although there are several differences. Patients with HAE with normal C1-INH have onset later in life (typically in adulthood), more frequent facial and tongue swellings, and less prominent abdominal symptoms. (See
         <a class="local">

         In the absence of a validated biochemical diagnostic test, diagnosis of HAE with normal C1-INH is based on characteristic clinical features, a family history of angioedema, and normal complement studies. Genetic testing, if available, may serve to differentiate the various types of HAE with normal C1-INH  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131576" href="/z/d/graphic/131576.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). In patients who lack a family history of angioedema, it is important to exclude idiopathic histaminergic angioedema, a disorder in which complement studies are also normal. Idiopathic histaminergic angioedema often responds to therapy with antihistamines (frequently at supratherapeutic doses), alone or in combination with glucocorticoids. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis'

         Triggers for episodes of angioedema include local trauma or physical pressure to the affected area, emotional stress, and certain medications (ie, exogenous estrogens, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors and possibly angiotensin II receptor blockers [ARBs]). In some patients, avoidance of triggers is sufficient to prevent most attacks, and no other prophylactic therapy is needed. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Avoidance of triggers'

         For patients with acute angioedema involving the tongue or upper airway, assessment and protection of the airway is the first and most important management issue, because none of the available therapies can be considered universally effective. (See
         <a class="local">
