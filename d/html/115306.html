Concerns over the dangers of cigarette smoking for the fetus serve as an additional motivator to stop smoking. Additionally, pregnancy also provides an opportunity to educate the patient's partner or family members on the benefits of smoking cessation for themselves, the patient, and the baby.</p><p>This topic will review strategies and treatment options for those who desire to stop smoking while pregnant. Related information on the impact of cigarette smoking on maternal and fetal outcomes is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4803.html" rel="external">"Cigarette and tobacco products in pregnancy: Impact on pregnancy and the neonate"</a>.)</p><p>In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the terms "woman/en" or "patient(s)" as they are used in the studies presented. We encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling and treatment needs of transgender and gender diverse individuals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2120099851"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY OF SMOKING CESSATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Survey and birth certificate data indicate that 35 to 75 percent of pregnant individuals who smoke completely stop smoking by the end of pregnancy [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>]. Most individuals who quit smoking on their own during pregnancy do so prior to their first prenatal visit. In the absence of intervention, those still smoking after their first prenatal visit are likely to continue smoking during pregnancy. A study of US birth certificate data reported that the percentage of pregnant persons who smoked declined from 7.2 to 3.7 percent between 2016 and 2022 [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. </p><p>Risk factors for continued smoking include lower education status (high school level or less), heavy smoking (&gt;10 cigarettes per day), a partner or other household member who smokes, public insurance, poor coping skills, multiparity, and coexisting emotional or psychiatric problems (eg, depression) [<a href="#rid6">6-16</a>]. Because many of these factors are interrelated, their independent effects are difficult to discern [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2278814843"><span class="h1">IMPACT OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDER INTERVENTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is expert consensus that pregnant persons who use tobacco should be identified early in pregnancy and provided augmented, pregnancy-tailored counseling on smoking cessation [<a href="#rid18">18-21</a>]. Examples of brief interventions include information about smoking-related risks from the physician and frequent follow-up to assess patient progress, as well as use of a pregnancy-specific or other self-help manual, one or more sessions with a health educator, and video tapes on smoking risks and cessation. Despite evidence that brief interventions work to reduce maternal smoking, it is estimated that only 49 percent of obstetricians routinely advise and provide follow-up for smoking cessation; furthermore, only 28 percent discuss actual strategies for cessation [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See <a class="local">'General questions (5 A's) to smoking cessation'</a> below.)</p><p>Data from meta-analyses of randomized trials show that health care provider-initiated interventions can lead to significant reductions in the number of people smoking during pregnancy and improved birth outcomes [<a href="#rid22">22-24</a>]. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 2017 meta-analysis of 16 trials, including over 6100 women, reported that smoking cessation interventions were associated with a reduced risk of low birth weight infants (odds ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.42-0.88) [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A different 2017 meta-analysis comparing psychosocial interventions (eg, counseling, health education, feedback, incentives, social support) with usual care reported use of these interventions increased the proportion of women who stopped smoking in late pregnancy (average risk ratio 1.44, 95% CI 1.19-1.73, 30 trials) and reduced low birth weight infants by 17 percent [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a 2014 systematic review, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that the difference in cessation rates between pregnant individuals who smokes who received an intervention and control groups ranged from 5.8 percent to 31.0 percent, although this did not lead to marked improvements in infant outcome [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3292840660"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO SMOKING CESSATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3174513749"><span class="h2">Our approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We refer all patients with a clear intention to quit smoking to cessation counseling. (See <a class="local">'Behavioral counseling'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Behavioral counseling</strong> – For individuals who do not smoke heavily, express that they can do this on their own, or for those who desire medication-free cessation, we recommend a trial of cessation counseling without pharmacotherapy to avoid any potential risks of pharmacotherapy. (See <a class="local">'Behavioral counseling'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Counseling plus pharmacotherapy</strong> – For individuals who do not feel they can stop on their own or who smoke heavily, we suggest pharmacotherapy as an adjunct to smoking cessation counseling. We discuss the risks and benefits of pharmacotherapy with either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9698" href="/d/drug information/9698.html" rel="external">nicotine</a> replacement therapy (NRT) or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9171" href="/d/drug information/9171.html" rel="external">bupropion</a> and ask about any contraindications. While both NRT and bupropion are reasonable drug options, the optimal treatment is not known, and the patient's preferences help determine the medication choice. (See <a class="local">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>For all patients, we also ask about additional comorbidities, such as anxiety, depression, or substance use, that may be contributing to continued smoking. We advise guided meditation (free via smartphone apps or online) and counseling with a mental health provider for all those who report anxiety. We refer patients as needed for treatment of depression or substance use disorder. We involve partners in the discussion as much as possible, and if they smoke, we discuss how smoking cessation can benefit them, their partner, and their family. If the partner is interested in quitting, we refer to the primary care physician for smoking cessation treatment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2923815506"><span class="h2">General questions (5 A's) to smoking cessation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The five A's (ask, advise, assess, assist, and arrange) provide a general approach to helping patients stop smoking, as detailed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50450" href="/d/graphic/50450.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid19">19,20,28-30</a>]. The specific action steps outlined have been gathered from various investigators and guideline panels and are not exclusive to pregnant people.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ask</strong> – Ask all<strong> </strong>patients (pregnant and nonpregnant) about and document smoking status (current and past) at every visit (including smoking status of household members) and whether anyone smokes in the woman's home or car. Among current patients who smoke, document number of cigarettes smoked per day [<a href="#rid31">31-34</a>]. For pregnant individuals, we counsel about the benefits of quitting, including the benefits that are specific to pregnancy. We encourage patients to quit smoking before planning a pregnancy and refer those who are interested in quitting to smoking cessation programs.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Remember that some patients find it difficult to admit to smoking initially or upon relapse. In one study of 107 self-reported pregnant quitters, 26 percent had salivary cotinine levels consistent with current smoking [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Questions that can help patients disclose their smoking status are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50450" href="/d/graphic/50450.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients who have stopped smoking, we congratulate them on what they have done to improve their health and that of their families. Recent quitters are at risk for relapse/continued smoking. Hence, we continue to ask about smoking status at each visit and continue to provide positive reinforcement.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients who report active smoking, we initiate or continue a strategy to help her quit.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Advise</strong> – Advise persons who smoke to stop smoking. Patients advised to quit rather than just cut down are more likely to stop smoking [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Advise patients that quitting at any point during pregnancy is beneficial, although quitting as soon as possible is the best. We discuss the benefits of smoking cessation for the pregnancy as well as for lifelong maternal and family health. We also discuss the known risks of continued smoking on pregnancy complications and risks to her child. We advise individuals who quit smoking during pregnancy to make a commitment to staying tobacco-free after delivery and include partners/other family members in the discussion whenever possible.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assess</strong> – Assess the patient's readiness to quit smoking in the next month. Accept a patient's decision to continue to smoke nonjudgmentally and continue to follow-up and encourage/offer help for smoking cessation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assist</strong> <strong>the patient who wants to quit</strong> – Several approaches have been proposed, with minimal to good supporting evidence:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Connect the smoker to pregnancy-specific, structured smoking cessation support, which is available in a variety of formats that include written material, videos, computer websites, telephone calls or text messages, or in-person counseling in individual or group settings [<a href="#rid36">36-39</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Offer a direct referral to a smoker's quit line to provide ongoing telephone counseling and support (eg, in the United States: 1-800-QUIT NOW and various local lines; in the United Kingdom: 0800-1699-169). Mobile phone messaging support can be helpful [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Refer to a smoking cessation counselor/health educator [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6920.html" rel="external">"Behavioral approaches to smoking cessation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Provide financial incentives, if available [<a href="#rid41">41,42</a>]. The odds of quitting with the use of incentives are three times the odds of quitting in the absence of incentives, holding all other interventions constant [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If she feels that she can quit, we congratulate her on wanting to quit, and at that moment, we set a quit date. We outline strategies to prepare for this date (eg, throw out ashtrays, inform other nonsmoking family members, and avoid scenarios associated with smoking).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Offer pharmacotherapy [<a href="#rid23">23,43</a>]. This strategy can be considered after counseling and behavioral support if patients find they are unable to quit on their own. Those who smoke heavily are less likely to quit on their own. (See <a class="local">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assist the patient who is NOT ready to quit now</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6920.html" rel="external">"Behavioral approaches to smoking cessation", section on 'Patients not ready to quit'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Accept her decision nonjudgmentally. Address concerns related to quitting.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Explore and address barriers that prevent the woman from utilizing smoking cessation resources (eg, lack of knowledge, fear of failure or stigmatization, access and resource issues, partner issues, family or partner smoking, coexisting anxiety).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Support the importance of having smoke-free space at home. Encourage the patient to adopt a smoke-free policy for her home and car. Encourage household members who smoke to quit for their own benefit or at least refrain from smoking in the home or car. Both actions help the pregnant woman quit [<a href="#rid44">44,45</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Recommend that she cut down the number of cigarettes. If she is willing to cut down, set a goal at the counseling visit for the number of cigarettes per day. Document this goal in your visit note so that it prompts you at the next visit to review with her. Provide positive reinforcement for cutting down. If she notes she was unable to reduce the number of cigarettes, explore and address barriers as above.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Refer for management of coexisting anxiety or depression, which may be affecting her ability to reduce or quit smoking.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Arrange</strong> – Address tobacco use at every subsequent prenatal visit to track progress, reinforce success, and provide ongoing assistance to individuals who continue to smoke. Lack of ongoing follow-up and support decrease the chance of successful smoking cessation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">This approach is similar to that used in nonpregnant adults and adolescents and reviewed in detail elsewhere in UpToDate:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16634.html" rel="external">"Overview of smoking cessation management in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16706.html" rel="external">"Benefits and consequences of smoking cessation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16752.html" rel="external">"Substance use disorders: Motivational interviewing"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6920.html" rel="external">"Behavioral approaches to smoking cessation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16635.html" rel="external">"Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6359.html" rel="external">"Management of smoking and vaping cessation in adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1181009765"><span class="h2">Barriers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Barriers to cessation, attitudes to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9698" href="/d/drug information/9698.html" rel="external">nicotine</a> patch use, and perceptions of cessation counseling among pregnant persons have been studied using focus groups [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. Reasons given for continuing to smoke in pregnancy were skepticism about smoking-related harms, addiction to nicotine, and the smoking behavior of partners and/or family members. Most patients considered use of nicotine patches acceptable; however, some expressed doubt of patch safety, believing continued smoking was preferable. The patients noted that care providers differed in their approaches to smoking cessation and that some no longer asked about smoking status after they reported "cutting down."</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H36699589"><span class="h2">Abstinence versus reduction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although abstinence early in pregnancy will produce the greatest benefits to the fetus and mother, quitting at any point in pregnancy can yield benefits [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. On the other hand, reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked during pregnancy has not produced consistent improvement in perinatal outcomes [<a href="#rid22">22,27,47</a>]. This finding, in conjunction with concerns that individuals who reduce the number of cigarettes smoked may compensate by inhaling deeper, has led to the recommendation that smoking cessation, not a reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked, should be the primary goal [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Moreover, it is likely that nondisclosure underestimates the effects of "cutting down." A placebo-controlled randomized trial of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9698" href="/d/drug information/9698.html" rel="external">nicotine</a> gum for smoking cessation during pregnancy reported similar quit rates in both the active drug and placebo groups; however, those in the nicotine gum group smoked fewer cigarettes and had lower cotinine levels and higher birth weights than those in the placebo group [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. These findings support the recommendation that patients who are unable to quit smoking should still be encouraged to reduce the number of cigarettes they smoke each day.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1083646807"><span class="h1">BEHAVIORAL COUNSELING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Consistent with society recommendations, we offer smoking cessation behavioral counseling to all pregnant individuals and view counseling, with continued monitoring and behavioral interventions, as the first-line intervention for smoking cessation [<a href="#rid21">21,30,49</a>]. Counseling interventions can include motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, relaxation techniques, problem solving facilitation, and other strategies [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. A meta-analysis of 30 studies (randomized trials, cluster-randomized trials, and quasi-randomized trials) reported counseling increased smoking cessation in late pregnancy compared with usual care (average risk ratio [RR] 1.44, 95% CI 1.19-1.73) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. The same meta-analysis also reported that, compared with usual care, counseling was associated with continued smoking abstinence at zero to five months postpartum (average RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.26-2.01, 11 studies) and at 12 to 17 months postpartum (average RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.23-3.96, 2 studies). A borderline effect was reported for the time frame 6 to 11 months (average RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.00-1.77, six studies).

There was a higher risk of congenital respiratory anomalies in the children exposed to NRT compared with those with no nicotine exposure (odds ratio 4.65, 99% CI 1.76-12.25), but the absolute risk difference was very small.

Even if NRT cannot entirely reduce all of the risks associated with smoking during pregnancy, maternal smoking cessation results in less in-utero exposure of the fetus to non-nicotine cigarette toxins such as carbon monoxide that may also contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes. Additionally, assessment of the impact of NRT during pregnancy does not typically evaluate postnatal outcomes that are influenced by continued or resumed smoking, such as upper respiratory infections, asthma, hospital admission, otitis media, and sudden infant death syndrome.

However, the data on fetal impact are limited, inconsistent, and might be confounded by additional factors such as maternal depression or concurrent use of other antidepressants.

After discussion of these data, some patients may choose to wait until the second trimester before beginning bupropion.

Although there are conflicting data regarding the risk of congenital malformations, the body of evidence suggests that bupropion does not increase the overall risk [<a href="#rid68">68</a>]. The bupropion pregnancy registry report, published by the manufacturer, prospectively reviewed nearly 1600 pregnancies from 1997 to 2008 [<a href="#rid69">69</a>]. The committee concluded that the observed 3.6 percent incidence of congenital anomalies after first trimester exposure (n = 806) was consistent with the general population rate. They also noted repeated occurrence of heart defects, but concluded that the data were insufficient to evaluate if bupropion increased heart defect risk. A subsequent retrospective case-control study from the United States National Birth Defects Prevention Study reported an increased risk for left ventricular outflow tract heart defects (hypoplastic left heart, aortic stenosis, and aortic coarctation) with first trimester exposure to bupropion (adjusted odds ratio 2.6, 95% CI 1.2-5.7) but the wide confidence interval made the true magnitude of risk less clear [<a href="#rid70">70</a>].

Of note, the 2013 Committee on Drugs of the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that NRT was the preferred pharmacologic approach to smoking cessation in breastfeeding women, although the rationale for the statement is unclear as both NRT and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9171" href="/d/drug information/9171.html" rel="external">bupropion</a> are excreted into breastmilk [<a href="#rid85">85-87</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9171" href="/d/drug information/9171.html" rel="external">Bupropion</a> – Although no adverse effects in breastfeeding infants have been reported, available data are very limited [<a href="#rid88">88</a>]. In a lactation study, the average daily infant exposure to bupropion and its active metabolites was approximately 2 percent of the maternal weight-adjusted dose.

As with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9698" href="/d/drug information/9698.html" rel="external">nicotine</a>, a decision to prescribe bupropion to breastfeeding mothers needs to be balanced with the risks of continued smoking, which are likely greater than the risks of bupropion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10339" href="/d/drug information/10339.html" rel="external">Varenicline</a> – There are limited available data for varenicline during pregnancy and no available human data on varenicline in breastfed infants [<a href="#rid67">67,74,89</a>].

The postpartum period is a period of great stress and emotional fluctuations, and lack of both social supports and coping skills has been implicated in relapse [<a href="#rid92">92,99,100</a>]. Lower mood scores have also been strongly associated with smoking relapse [<a href="#rid92">92,101,102</a>]. Approximately 50 to 70 percent of postpartum women report transient depressed mood or postpartum blues, making them vulnerable to relapse during this time. Women who relapse are more likely to have family members or friends who smoke and report less social support [<a href="#rid95">95</a>]. Relapsers are also more likely to report lower confidence for staying smoke-free [<a href="#rid92">92</a>].

Most pregnant patients who are able to quit smoking by themselves during pregnancy do so prior to their first prenatal visit. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology of smoking cessation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ask about tobacco use during pregnancy</strong> – There is expert consensus that pregnant individuals who use tobacco should be identified early in pregnancy and provided augmented, pregnancy-tailored counseling on smoking cessation. Despite evidence that brief interventions work to reduce maternal smoking, it is estimated that only approximately half of obstetricians routinely advise and provide follow-up for smoking cessation, and only 28 percent discuss actual strategies for cessation. (See <a class="local">'Impact of health care provider intervention'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Questions to identify tobacco use – </strong>The five A's (ask, advise, assess, assist, and arrange) provide a general approach to asking patients about cigarette and tobacco use and helping patients stop smoking  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50450" href="/d/graphic/50450.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The specific action steps have been gathered from various investigators and guideline panels and are not exclusive to pregnant persons. Additionally, we address tobacco use at every subsequent prenatal visit to track progress, reinforce success, and provide ongoing assistance to those who continue to smoke. (See <a class="local">'General questions (5 A's) to smoking cessation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Advise quitting</strong> – All individuals who smoke should be advised to quit. We also refer patients with additional comorbidities (such as anxiety, depression, or substance use) that can contribute to continued smoking for further evaluation and treatment. (See <a class="local">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Behavioral counseling</strong> – For all pregnant individuals who smoke, we recommend a behavioral counseling program (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). Compared with usual care, these programs result in modest improvement in postpartum abstinence and pregnancy outcomes. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9698" href="/d/drug information/9698.html" rel="external">Nicotine</a><strong> replacement therapy</strong> – In addition, for pregnant individuals who smoke heavily or are unable to quit with behavioral counseling alone, we suggest adjunctive pharmacotherapy with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Additional pharmacotherapy</strong> – <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9171" href="/d/drug information/9171.html" rel="external">Bupropion</a> is a reasonable alternative to NRT as adjunctive pharmacotherapy. The safety data for NRT are from more robustly designed studies compared with bupropion (trial versus observational data). We do not use <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10339" href="/d/drug information/10339.html" rel="external">varenicline</a> for smoking cessation in pregnant individuals because of the lack of safety information.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Timing of smoking cessation</strong> – Although smoking cessation during pregnancy is of maximal benefit if it occurs early in the first trimester, quitting at any time during pregnancy can have some beneficial effects. Patients are more likely to be successful if encouraged to quit rather than cut down. (See <a class="local">'Abstinence versus reduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk of postpartum relapse</strong> – Postpartum relapse is a significant problem, with approximately 50 percent of quitters relapsing in the first two months after delivery. These individuals should be considered "at risk" and provided with ongoing support.
