         Asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ALVSD) is defined as depressed LV systolic function in the absence of heart failure (HF) symptoms, which is called "stage B HF" in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines [

         We provide appropriate therapy for diseases that cause LV function. At times, provision of such therapies (eg, mitral valve replacement) may alter the approach to therapy. (See

         Periodic monitoring is indicated to assess for possible worsening of LV function and progression to HF. We recommend echocardiographic assessment when symptoms of HF appear in patients with established ALVSD. In addition, some experts suggest follow-up echocardiographic evaluation in asymptomatic patients to assess the response to treatment. The timing of such monitoring is determined by the stability of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in the past, the likelihood that a change in LVEF will lead to a change in therapy, and the need to provide prognostic information to the patient.

         In general, patients who may benefit from pharmacologic therapy include those with more severe LV dysfunction, evidence of abnormal LV structure and function (eg, LV dilation), causes of ALVSD not amenable to disease-specific therapy, or in whom the effects of therapy are delayed or unclear (eg, alcohol cessation)  (

          algorithm 1

         ). In contrast, therapy may be deferred in favor of prompt clinical follow-up and repeat evaluation of LVEF in patients with mild LV systolic dysfunction (eg, LVEF &gt;40 percent) who have no other signs of abnormal LV structure of function.

         In patients with ALVSD who had an MI, we suggest combination therapy with one agent from each of the following classes of medications, rather than other combinations of treatment  (

         Our approach to patients with ALVSD who do not respond to initial therapy is discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Low ejection fraction despite treatment'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach is similar to that in North American professional guidelines, though our certainty of the effectiveness of these agents is lower than suggested by the guidelines [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The typical strategy for initiation of this regimen is to start low doses of a RAAS inhibitor and a beta blocker before discharge after MI. We assess for any complications of therapy in the next one to two weeks, and, if kidney function and potassium levels are sufficiently low for initiation of an MRA, we start MRA therapy. It is reasonable to use other strategies (eg, order of therapy) for initiation of therapy, but therapy started in the hospital is more likely to continue in the outpatient setting.
        </p>

         The cautions for use, dosing, and monitoring for these agents are similar to those for patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), which are described separately:

         This therapeutic regimen is based upon indirect evidence that includes placebo-controlled clinical trials and trials that included patients with and without HF symptoms. The strongest evidence of efficacy is for ACE inhibitors, while the rationale for use of beta blockers and MRAs are based on trials predominantly composed of patients with HF symptoms. While sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are appropriate therapy for patients with LV systolic dysfunction and HF symptoms, the role of these agents in asymptomatic patients with ischemic LV systolic dysfunction is unclear. The data include:

         In patients with ALVSD from a nonischemic cause or an unknown cause, we suggest initial treatment with a RAAS inhibitor (ACE inhibitor, ARB,

          algorithm 1

         ). Patient factors (eg, LVEF value, cause of LV dysfunction) that should be used to individualize the approach to management are presented elsewhere in this topic. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Factors that influence therapeutic decisions'

         Our approach to patients with ALVSD who do not respond to initial therapy is discussed elsewhere. (See

         below.)
        </p>

         This approach is consistent with North American professional guidelines, though the guidelines suggest a higher certainty of treatment efficacy [

         Our approach is primarily based on indirect evidence from trials that evaluated the efficacy of RAAS inhibitors and beta blockers in patients who have an LVEF ≤40 after MI or that evaluated patients with HFrEF, as well as weaker data from retrospective studies. Patients with nonischemic causes of ALVSD were underrepresented in trials of patients with ALVSD. The role of MRAs and SGLT2 inhibitors as initial therapy in patients with nonischemic ALVSD is not well established; there are no dedicated trials in this population. The data include:

         Patients who received therapy for ALVSD and any disease-specific therapy but who continue to have reduced LVEF without HF symptoms should undergo an evaluation for residual causes of LV dysfunction and for new HF symptoms. Many such patients are likely to have HF symptoms. In general, patients with persistently reduced LVEF should be managed in a manner similar to patients with HFrEF, as discussed separately  (

        </p>
        <p>
         This approach is based on our view that diseases causing ALVSD are not distinct from the diseases causing HFrEF, and, as such, it is reasonable to treat patients with ALVSD who do not respond to initial therapy with a regimen appropriate for HFrEF in an attempt to slow or reverse LV dysfunction. However, there are no trials that directly assess the efficacy of combination therapy appropriate for HFrEF in this population.

          General measures
         </strong>
         – The approach to management of asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ALVSD) includes treatment (management of contributing conditions, neurohormonal blockade, and arrhythmia management), avoidance of drugs that may precipitate heart failure (HF), and monitoring for progression.

          Factors that influence therapy
         </strong>
         – In general, patients who may benefit from pharmacologic therapy include those with more severe LV dysfunction, evidence of abnormal LV structure and function (eg, LV dilation), causes of ALVSD not amenable to disease-specific therapy, or in whom the effects of therapy are delayed or unclear (eg, alcohol cessation)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef142940" href="/z/d/graphic/142940.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). In contrast, therapy may be deferred in favor of prompt clinical follow-up and repeat evaluation of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with mild LV systolic dysfunction (eg, LVEF &gt;40 percent) who have no other signs of abnormal LV structure of function. (See
         <a class="local">

         Patients with HF symptoms should be managed with therapy appropriate for HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). (See

          Dose
         </strong>
         – The target dose of any neurohormonal therapy used to treat ALVSD is similar to the target dose used to treat HFrEF. (See

         <strong>
          Duration of therapy
         </strong>
         – For most patients who receive therapy for LV dysfunction, therapy continues indefinitely. However, it is reasonable to discontinue therapy if unmanageable side effects occur. (See

         <strong>
          Low ejection fraction despite treatment
         </strong>
         – Patients should undergo an evaluation for residual causes of LV dysfunction and the presence of symptoms. Patients who received therapy for ALVSD and any disease-specific therapy but who continue to have reduced LVEF without HF symptoms should typically be managed in a manner similar to patients with HFrEF, as discussed separately  (
