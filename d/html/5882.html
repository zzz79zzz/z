         </span>
         Children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF) frequently have growth failure caused by the combination of malabsorption, increased energy needs, and reduced appetite. Nutrient delivery and correction of maldigestion and malabsorption are essential to achieve normal growth to support optimal pulmonary function and prolong life.
        </p>
        <p>
         The CF Foundation (CFF) patient registry has documented substantial improvement in life expectancy of patients with CF  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61930" href="/z/d/graphic/61930.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. To a large degree, the longer life achieved by patients with CF can be ascribed to improved treatment of lung disease, pulmonary toilet, potent and tailored antibiotics, dornase alfa (DNase), lung transplantation, and early diagnosis via newborn screening. However, greater emphasis on CF nutrition is considered important to improve longevity and quality of life. As a result, the CFF created a consensus report on practical aspects of nutrition in pediatric CF [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ] and a more theoretic report on gastrointestinal outcomes and confounders in CF [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The advent of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators has substantially changed the outlook for patients with CF lung disease (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/118899.html" rel="external">
          "Cystic fibrosis: Treatment with CFTR modulators"
         </a>
         ). Modulator therapy has also altered growth and nutrition statistics. It is likely that they will have an effect on growth and nutrition, but the full impact of these potent drugs is yet to be determined [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. While there is no doubt that these drugs will change the need for nutritional interventions, the discussion below remains valid.

         CF is caused by a defect in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cell membrane protein that forms a chloride channel and that regulates chloride and water flux [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The spectrum of CF disease varies according to the genotype and with individual and environmental factors. The nutritional risks and requirements for a patient with CF also vary along this disease spectrum but do not precisely coincide with the severity of pulmonary disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         Insufficient production and secretion of pancreatic enzymes (exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, often referred to simply as pancreatic insufficiency) causes malabsorption of fat, protein, and several micronutrients including the vitamins A, D, E, and K. Malabsorption of fat is exacerbated by bile salt abnormalities if there is concurrent intestinal or liver disease. Pancreatic function tends to decline with age. Across all age groups, approximately 90 percent of patients with CF have marked pancreatic insufficiency. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5885.html" rel="external">
          "Cystic fibrosis: Assessment and management of pancreatic insufficiency"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although pancreatic dysfunction is the major gastrointestinal contributor to malnutrition in CF, several other factors may contribute to the problem. These include CF-related liver disease (CFLD), bile salt abnormalities, CF-related diabetes mellitus, altered gastrointestinal motility, intestinal dysbiosis [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ], and small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Gastroesophageal reflux, distal intestinal obstructive syndrome, and constipation can also negatively affect nutrition. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5858.html" rel="external">
          "Cystic fibrosis: Overview of gastrointestinal disease"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to malabsorption and gastrointestinal dysfunction, at least two other mechanisms contribute to nutritional deficiencies and growth failure in patients with CF: chronic, progressive pulmonary infection with bronchiectasis leads to increased work of breathing and higher than expected nutrient needs [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ], and chronic infection may reduce appetite and cause cytokine-induced catabolism [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. In addition, chronic rhinosinusitis may impair the sense of smell, which can reduce appetite.

          Goals
         </strong>
         – An important indicator of adequate nutritional status is body mass index (BMI) in a healthy range. For children with CF, the BMI target range is above the 50
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         percentile [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. Children with BMIs between the 10
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         and 50
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         percentiles are generally considered at nutritional risk, and those with BMIs below the 10
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         percentile are in need of nutritional rehabilitation. For children younger than two years of age, the same percentile criteria are applied to weight-for-length rather than BMI. For adults with CF, the target is a BMI at or above 22 for females and 23 for males [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The nutritional status of individuals with CF tends to decline during childhood. However, data from the CF Foundation (CFF) show that, on average, the BMI percentile for both children and adults has been increasing over the past 20 years  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85551" href="/z/d/graphic/85551.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. A study reported that young children who recovered from growth faltering within two years of their CF diagnosis had better pulmonary outcomes at age 12 years compared with children who continued to falter [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. A prospective, observational study using data from the CFF Registry showed that greater weight at age four years is associated with greater height, better pulmonary function, fewer complications of CF, and better survival through age 18 years [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Treatment with CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators may further improve weight gain and nutritional status, but the full impact of these drugs is yet to be determined [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Some CF patients are overweight (BMI &gt;85
         <sup>
          th

         percentile) and even obese (BMI &gt;95
         <sup>

          Monitoring
         </strong>
         – Careful and repeated nutritional assessments allow for early detection of nutritional deterioration. The CFF recommends that children with CF be seen every three months. A thorough dietary history and measurements of height and weight should be performed at each visit. Additional measures are tracked according to a schedule for nutrition assessment  (

          Interventions
         </strong>
         – Guidance to optimize nutrition should be provided to all individuals with CF. Those who do not meet target goals for BMI, whose linear growth is less than expected for their genetic potential, or whose growth rates begin to plateau require additional attention. These patients should be given intensive counseling to optimize nutrition. They should also be further evaluated to identify reasons for nutritional deficits and potential contributors to malnutrition, including inadequate pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and small bowel bacterial overgrowth (see
         <a class="local">
          'Pathophysiology'

         Bone health is partly determined by nutritional factors in CF and is an important component of the nutritional assessment. Conversely, several other CF-associated comorbidities can cause or contribute to nutritional decline, including CFRD, pulmonary disease, and hepatobiliary disease.

          Epidemiology and risk factors

         – Bone disease, characterized by decreased mineral density, increased fracture rates, and kyphosis, is common in patients with CF, even among those with pancreatic sufficiency [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16

         <a href="#rid17">

          Screening
         </strong>
         – To monitor bone health, individuals with CF should have yearly determination of calcium, phosphorus, intact parathyroid hormone, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels  (

         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. In addition, children should have an evaluation of bone density using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) starting at eight years of age, especially if risk factors are present (eg, BMI &lt;10
         <sup>
          th

         ] &lt;50 percent predicted, glucocorticoid use of ≥5 mg daily for ≥90 days/year, delayed puberty, or a history of fractures). Even when no risk factors are present, patients should have a screening DXA scan by age 18.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         DXA scanning is now widely available. Standards have been developed for the pediatric age group, and the findings are expressed as Z-scores to reflect age-specific standards (rather than T-scores as in adults). However, interpretation remains problematic and requires adjustment for bone size and pubertal status; the unadjusted DXA Z-score for age and sex may systematically underestimate bone density in shorter patients [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21

         If the DXA scan shows bone density within a healthy range (Z-score ≥-1), we repeat the DXA scan every two years in growing children. The interval can be increased to every five years for adults with initial results in a healthy range [

         If the DXA scan shows borderline bone mineral density (Z-score -1 to -2), additional measures are taken to diagnose and treat any endocrine contributors to the bone disease (CFRD, hypogonadism) and to minimize use of glucocorticoid medications. Additional low-impact, weight-bearing exercise is encouraged. Patients receive supplemental calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D  (

         ). Weight-bearing exercise should be encouraged, and low levels of vitamin D or vitamin K should be treated aggressively. Target levels for vitamin D (as 25-hydroxyvitamin D) are 30 to 60 ng/mL (75 to 150 nmol/L). (See

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Bisphosphonates should be approached with caution in growing children with CF. This is because osteopenia in growing children with CF may be due to decreased bone formation rather than increased reabsorption. Because bisphosphonates are essentially anti-reabsorptive agents, giving them to growing children could lead to slow bone turnover. Moreover, there are increasing concerns about the use of bisphosphonates in children because these agents form bone with abnormal characteristics, have extremely long half-lives, and the long-term risks and benefits have not been fully explored [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23

         CFLD is a common and important complication of CF, occasionally leading to cirrhosis and portal hypertension, and very rarely to liver failure. Approximately 20 to 40 percent of individuals with CF develop clinically detectable CFLD. Most of this CFLD does not progress to severe disease, but in the subset in which it does, it may progress rapidly. Patients with CFLD often have fat malabsorption because of insufficient or abnormal bile acids in the intestinal lumen, in addition to the underlying pancreatic insufficiency. Therefore, patients with CFLD require close attention to nutrition, including ensuring a high energy intake and adequate levels of fat-soluble vitamins. (See

         Approximately 10 percent of patients with CF present as neonates with meconium ileus. Approximately one-half of these infants require surgical intervention, and some of those require resection of dilated, perforated, or atretic bowel, with diversion ileostomy. Resection of the terminal ileum may lead to malabsorption of

         A wide range of energy requirements are reported in individuals with CF, ranging from normal to 150 percent of normal, depending on the CF genotype, the patient's age, and current state of health, including pulmonary function and the presence of CF-related liver disease (CFLD).
        </p>
        <p>
         In the past, the caloric requirement of a CF patient was estimated to be 130 percent of recommended dietary allowance for calories [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. This is now considered an unwarranted simplification. A number of studies used open and closed indirect calorimetry and doubly-labeled water to determine energy expenditures. These studies consistently show that energy expenditure is directly associated with the severity of the CF genotype and inversely associated with pancreatic function [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29-31
         </a>
         ]. Moreover, treatment with CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy generally improves nutrition and weight gain, such that some individuals benefit from limiting the energy or fat in their diet [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Each patient should have a nutritional regimen tailored to their needs [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. In clinical practice, measurements of growth are the first and most important indicator of sufficient energy intake. If a child's body mass index (BMI) is in the target range (&gt;50 to 85
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         percentile for age) and BMI and height are steadily increasing along a percentile curve, energy intake is likely sufficient (see
         <a class="local">
          'Growth'
         </a>
         above). If the child's growth does not meet these targets, energy intake is probably suboptimal. In this case, it is reasonable to take action to empirically increase the child's energy intake (see
         <a class="local">
          'Nutrition support'
         </a>
         below). In addition, the child should be evaluated for possible causes of growth failure, including insufficient pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, gastrointestinal dysfunction, worsening pulmonary infection, or development of CF-related diabetes (CFRD). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Evaluation for comorbidities'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Measurement of resting energy expenditure (indirect calorimetry) is not practical for clinical management. The technique requires either endotracheal intubation or a tight-fitting hood to collect expired gases. CF patients do not tolerate either method well.

Both forms are effective in increasing serum vitamin D levels, and it is unclear if one preparation is more efficacious than the other. The CFF recommends vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) as an oral supplement because a small study suggests that it is somewhat more likely to achieve target 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in patients with CF than vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) [

Vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 are hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol), the major circulating form of the hormone. 25-hydroxyvitamin D is then converted in the kidney to the biologically active form of the vitamin, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.

For those 10 years and older, the recommended daily intake is 800 to 2000 international units  (

          Physiology
         </strong>
         – Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin found in a variety of green vegetables and is also synthesized by intestinal bacteria. Patients with CF are at risk for vitamin K deficiency because of fat malabsorption and also because of disturbances in the bowel flora associated with small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) or frequent use of antibiotics.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Vitamin K is a cofactor required for the activity of several key proteins in the coagulation pathways, including prothrombin. Because vitamin-K dependent carboxylation occurs in the liver, its action can be further reduced in patients with severely impaired hepatic function. Vitamin K-dependent carboxylation is also necessary for function of osteocalcin and other bone-related proteins. (See

          Monitoring
         </strong>
         – The CFF recommends annual screening for vitamin K deficiency in patients with liver disease, hemoptysis, or hematemesis; screening consists of measuring serum prothrombin time and, if possible, PIVKA-II (proteins induced by vitamin K absence) levels  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56711" href="/z/d/graphic/56711.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). In our practice, we perform these screening tests annually in all CF patients even if there is no known liver disease or bleeding diathesis because patients may have CFLD for some time before it becomes clinically apparent.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         PIVKA-II is more sensitive than prothrombin time in detecting vitamin K deficiency. Using this measure, 40 percent of patients with CF were found to have suboptimal vitamin K status, despite meeting the goals for vitamin K intake recommended by the CFF [

         – EFA deficiency is characterized by scaly dermatitis, alopecia, thrombocytopenia, and growth failure. Overt symptoms of EFA deficiency such as these are uncommon in patients with CF, but there is some evidence for subclinical EFA deficiency in this population. As an example, biochemical markers of EFA deficiency are correlated with poor growth and pulmonary status [
         <a href="#rid48">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The preferred method for assessing fatty acid status is to measure the total fatty acid profile in red blood cells. EFA deficiency is likely when the levels of linoleic, alpha-linolenic, and eicosapentaenoic acids and DHA are below reference range. This test has the advantage of providing information on omega-3 as well as omega-6 fatty acids but is not widely available [

         If this test is not available, EFA status can be partially evaluated by measuring the triene:tetraene ratio in blood; a ratio &gt;0.2 suggests EFA deficiency. This is the traditional approach for assessing EFA deficiency, but its validity has been questioned because it only provides information about omega-6 fatty acids [

          Methods to promote caloric intake
         </strong>
         – For patients with suboptimal growth, the initial intervention is to provide more intensive dietary advice to increase caloric intake [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,14
         </a>
         ]. A number of studies support this approach and show nutritional benefit through counseling with the use of behavior modification strategies to support dietary change [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56-60
         </a>
         ]. As an example, a small randomized trial found that a behavioral intervention substantially increased caloric intake in toddlers and preschool-aged children with CF as compared with standard care, and that these effects persisted 12 months after the intervention [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61,62
         </a>
         ]. The behavioral techniques included differential attention (parents praised children for desired eating behaviors and ignored non-eating behaviors) and contingencies (rewards to motivate children to meet energy goals). A larger multicenter trial of children aged 4 to 12 years assessed the efficacy of a similar behavioral intervention designed to promote energy intake [
         <a href="#rid63">
          63,64
         </a>
         ]. The group receiving the behavioral intervention achieved improved energy intake and weight gain at the end of a nine-week intervention, and a slower rate of decline in body mass index (BMI) Z-score over the subsequent two years, as compared with control patients receiving nutritional education alone.

          Management of pancreatic insufficiency
         </strong>
         – In addition to nutritional and behavioral counseling, patients with suboptimal growth should also be assessed for the possibility of emerging pancreatic insufficiency or inadequate replacement therapy; for older children and adolescents, a decline in nutritional status may be a symptom of emerging CF-related diabetes (CFRD). In addition, other types of gastrointestinal disease such as celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease should be considered. (See

         Enteral nutrition is usually provided to patients with CF via gastrostomy tube (G-tube) because nasogastric tubes are usually poorly tolerated due to chronic cough, nasal polyps, and the sensation of suffocating. Gastrojejunostomy and jejunostomy feeding may also be used, but these tubes are more difficult to place and maintain in position. Additionally, jejunal feeds must be given continuously rather than in boluses, making the route inconvenient for ambulatory patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         G-tubes can be placed surgically, endoscopically, or by an interventional radiologist, with minimal risk. If general anesthesia is not advisable for a particular patient, the procedure can be performed under sedation and local anesthesia. A skin-level device (or "button") can be used so that the patient can disconnect from all tubing between feeds, to optimize mobility and cosmesis.

         Schedules for tube feeding vary and should take into account the patient's activities and other therapies. Feeds can be instilled continuously, as boluses, or a combination of these two regimens.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the school-aged child, a frequently employed schedule supplies approximately 40 percent of daily requirements via a slow infusion overnight, and the remainder of the requirement is supplied through food taken by mouth during the day. If the child is unable to meet the daily energy requirements, the nighttime infusions can be lengthened or the rate of infusion increased so that a greater percentage of the requirements are delivered overnight.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the younger patient who is at home during the day, nutritional requirements can be supplied through a combination of nighttime continuous feeds, daytime meals, and daytime bolus feeds. If the child fails to ingest the prescribed amount at any daytime meal, a bolus feed is added to compensate.
        </p>
        <p>
         CF patients often have a complex care schedule because of their need for multiple medications and frequent pulmonary therapies. Feeding schedules should take these other elements of therapy into account.

         No one class of formula has been shown to be superior to another. Some formulas supply protein that is either elemental (free amino acids) or semi-elemental  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74962" href="/z/d/graphic/74962.html" rel="external">
          table 8
         </a>
         ). The protein in a semi-elemental formula may be extensively hydrolyzed (containing short peptides) or partially hydrolyzed (containing longer peptide chains). However, more extensive protein digestion does not have a clinical advantage as long as pancreatic enzyme replacement is given, and it may have the disadvantage of increasing the osmolarity of the formula. In one study, a non-elemental formula plus pancreatic enzyme replacement was as well-absorbed as a semi-elemental formula without pancreatic enzymes [
         <a href="#rid82">
          82
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Concentrated formulas with 1.5 to 2 Kcal/mL have the advantage of delivering more calories in a smaller volume. Since nighttime urination is a problem when using high-volume overnight feeds, a smaller volume can make the feeding schedule more tolerable. When using the more concentrated formulas, care must be exercised to avoid carbohydrate overload and possible inadequate supply of free water. Use of formulas with concentrated carbohydrates may uncover CFRD. Similarly, in established diabetics, these formulas may complicate diabetes treatment. The complications encountered because of CFRD are surmountable and should not preclude the use of enteral nutrition.
        </p>
        <p>
         Several types of formulas consisting of blenderized foods are also available. Although some are nutritionally complete formulas, they offer no nutritional advantage over the traditionally used enteral formulas listed in the table  (

LCT is the main determinant of the lipase requirement because medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) require relatively low concentrations of lipase to hydrolyze the fatty acids from the glycerol backbone. Therefore, MCT accounts for little of the fat malabsorption in CF. The LCT:MCT content varies among formulas, as outlined in the table  (

         Alternatively, lipase can be supplied by a cartridge delivery system (Relizorb) that is placed in line with the feeding tube.

         (PN) should be prescribed for CF patients when gastrointestinal function is inadequate to supply complete nutrition. This could occur during times of extreme metabolic stress, such as recovery from gastrointestinal surgery or transplantation procedure. The PN solution should contain a balance of amino acids, dextrose, lipids, vitamins, and trace elements to provide appropriate nutrition. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15634.html" rel="external">

         One study observed that PN promoted weight gain in patients with CF but was also associated with higher rates of sepsis [

         ]. Moreover, after PN was discontinued, weight decreased again, and no long-term gain was achieved. PN should not be a part of palliative care.

          Clinical importance
         </strong>
         – Nutritional issues in cystic fibrosis (CF) are pervasive and are not fully explained by pancreatic insufficiency or overcome by pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. Early recognition and intensive treatment of undernutrition in patients with CF can minimize the damaging effects of malnutrition on lung disease, longevity, and quality of life. (See
         <a class="local">

          Pancreatic insufficiency
         </strong>
         – Pancreatic insufficiency is an important contributor to malnutrition in most individuals with CF. The main consequences are due to fat malabsorption, which contributes to growth failure, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, and bone disease. (See

          CF-related diabetes (CFRD)
         </strong>
         – CFRD is an important cause of nutritional decline and affects approximately 15 percent of adolescents with CF and almost 50 percent of adults over age 30. Annual screening for CFRD is recommended beginning at age 10 years, carried out at a time of clinical stability. (See

          Routine monitoring

         Anthropometric measurements are tracked against standard curves. For children with CF, the target range for body mass index (BMI) is above the 50
         <sup>
          th

         <strong>
          Bone health
         </strong>
         – Bone disease is common in patients with CF and progresses with age. All individuals with CF should be counseled to ensure recommended intake of calcium, phosphorus, vitamin K, and vitamin D to support bone health  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82276" href="/z/d/graphic/82276.html" rel="external">

          table 4
         </a>
         ). In addition, serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, intact parathyroid hormone, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be measured annually; bone density should be measured in children older than eight years  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56711" href="/z/d/graphic/56711.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption
         </strong>
         – We recommend that all individuals with CF take supplements to meet disease-specific recommended intakes for fat-soluble vitamins  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70052" href="/z/d/graphic/70052.html" rel="external">

          Grade 1B
         </a>
         ). Several different commercially available vitamin supplements provide doses within the target range. Vitamin sufficiency should be assessed with annual laboratory monitoring  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56711" href="/z/d/graphic/56711.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Sodium requirements
         </strong>
         – Because of sodium losses in sweat, individuals with CF are prone to hyponatremic dehydration under conditions of heat stress. Most patients will need supplementation of sodium chloride to compensate for estimated sodium losses, which depend on the patient's age and climate conditions  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50515" href="/z/d/graphic/50515.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Diet and nutrition support
         </strong>
         – All individuals with CF should be given dietary counseling to encourage a balanced diet with adequate calories to ensure good growth. Caloric goals will often be higher than for the general population. Patients with growth failure can be managed with a series of interventions, beginning with intensive counseling and escalating to nutritional supplements via the oral or enteral route.
