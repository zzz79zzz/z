Nearly all patients with SCLC are current or former smokers. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4640.html" rel="external">"Cigarette smoking and other possible risk factors for lung cancer"</a>.)</p><p>SCLC is distinguished from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by its pathologic features. Clinically, it is distinguished by its rapid doubling time and high growth fraction, and the early development of metastases. SCLC usually presents with disseminated disease, and treatment strategies have been largely focused on systemic therapy. For patients with limited-stage (LS) disease, treatment usually also includes radiation therapy (RT) directed toward thoracic disease, as well as prophylactic treatment of the brain. In the uncommon circumstance that SCLC presents as a single pulmonary nodule, surgery may be a component of multimodality treatment.</p><p>For patients with extensive-stage disease, the mainstay of treatment is chemotherapy plus immunotherapy. RT to the chest and brain may be offered in select circumstances. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4633.html" rel="external">"Extensive-stage small cell lung cancer: Initial management"</a>.)</p><p>The initial management of patients with LS-SCLC is reviewed here.

However, both the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer recommend Tumor, Node, Metastasis staging for SCLC as well as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC;  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805" href="/z/d/graphic/109805.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)).

The current standard of care for patients with LS-SCLC that involves the lymph nodes consists of four cycles of combination chemotherapy (typically <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a> plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8430" href="/z/d/drug information/8430.html" rel="external">etoposide</a> [EP]) along with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy during the early part of the chemotherapy treatment (starting with the first or second cycle of chemotherapy). Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is generally recommended for patients with a complete response or significant tumor regression at the completion of chemotherapy.</p><p>Although <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9202" href="/z/d/drug information/9202.html" rel="external">carboplatin</a> can be substituted for <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a> in combination with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8430" href="/z/d/drug information/8430.html" rel="external">etoposide</a> with statistically similar outcomes, EP is preferred in patients with LS-SCLC due to the paucity of directly comparative data in this setting. However, carboplatin can be substituted if cisplatin is contraindicated for reasons such as pre-existing neuropathy, hearing loss, renal insufficiency, or congestive heart failure.</p><p>Patients with SCLC rarely survive more than a few months without treatment, even when disease appears to be localized. However, SCLC is highly responsive to both chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The results with treatment vary significantly depending upon the extent of disease.</p><p>For patients with LS-SCLC treated with contemporary chemoradiotherapy and PCI, overall response rates of 80 to 90 percent, including 50 to 60 percent complete response rates, are typically reported. Median survival is approximately 17 months, and the five-year survival rate is approximately 20 percent [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. The impact of treatment on patients with extensive-stage SCLC is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4633.html" rel="external">"Extensive-stage small cell lung cancer: Initial management", section on 'Overview of treatment of extensive-stage disease'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1807748433"><span class="h1">STAGE I DISEASE (T1 TO T2, N0)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with stage I (T1 to 2, N0) LS-SCLC who have no evidence of distant metastases, histologic confirmation that the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes are <strong>not</strong> involved, and no contraindications to surgery, we suggest resection of the primary tumor with lobectomy, plus mediastinal lymph node sampling or dissection. If performed, this should then be followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with four cycles of cisplatin-based therapy, extrapolating from benefits observed largely in patients with node-positive disease (although not typically administered with radiation). (See <a class="local">'Chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H195825111"><span class="h2">Components of treatment</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1337500665"><span class="h3">Surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We suggest surgical resection for patients who present with a solitary pulmonary nodule that has been diagnosed as SCLC and who have no evidence of hilar or mediastinal nodal involvement, no distant metastases, and no contraindications to surgery. There are no clinical trials that directly compare a combined-modality approach including surgery with chemoradiotherapy alone. Retrospective data cannot exclude the possibility of selection bias. Specifically, the observed survival outcomes in resected SCLC may be due to reduced tumor burden among patients in whom resection is possible, or that these patients have biologically less aggressive disease.</p><p>Data suggesting a benefit from surgery in patients with LS-SCLC come from the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) Lung Cancer Study Project [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The IASLC database of over 8000 cases of SCLC included 349 cases (4 percent) in which the cancer was resected and staged pathologically. The five-year survival rates for patients with pathologic stage I, II, and III SCLC were 48, 39, and 15 percent, respectively. By contrast, evidence from multiple clinical trials indicates that a nonsurgical (chemoradiotherapy) approach in patients with LS-SCLC results in a five-year survival rate of 26 to 34 percent in primarily stage III SCLC.</p><p>Similar results were observed in a subsequent propensity- and stage-matched analysis of survival of patients with early-stage and locally advanced SCLC in the National Cancer Database. From a dataset of 29,994 clinical stages I to III SCLC, 2089 patients who had surgery were matched to nonsurgically treated patients. This analysis suggested nearly a doubling of median overall survival (OS) for N0 patients treated with surgery: 38 versus<em> </em>22 months. Their analysis also showed that the benefits of surgery were only seen when an R0 resection was achieved, that lobectomy was superior to sublobar resections and to pneumonectomies, and that adjuvant chemotherapy should be considered after these R0 resections [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4230851668"><span class="h3">Postoperative chemotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We suggest adjuvant chemotherapy for patients who have undergone a complete resection for SCLC. Regimen selection is the same as for patients who do not undergo surgery. (See <a class="local">'Chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>There are no randomized clinical trials that have compared surgery alone versus surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. However, observational studies have suggested improved outcomes with adjuvant chemotherapy. In a study of over 1500 patients with pT1-2N0M0 SCLC in the National Cancer Database, patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (with or without radiation) experienced an improved five-year survival compared with those undergoing surgery alone (53 versus 40 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. In another series of 119 patients who underwent surgical resection for SCLC, 112 of whom also received adjuvant chemotherapy, the five-year survival rates for those with pathologic stage I, II, or III disease were 51, 28, and 19 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. This is in contrast to results from earlier studies that demonstrated a five-year survival rate of 1 percent among patients treated with surgery alone [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1240755429"><span class="h3">Adjuvant RT, if nodal involvement identified at surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A retrospective review of 3017 patients with LS-SCLC enrolled in the National Cancer Database suggested that postoperative thoracic radiation therapy (RT) was associated with a five-year OS benefit among those with pathologic N2 disease (29 versus 19 percent), but not among those with lesser degrees of nodal involvement [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Patients with pathologic N0 disease had decreased five-year OS with RT (39 versus 46 percent, respectively), while there were no differences in survival among patients with pathologic N1 disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3038000861"><span class="h1">STAGE II TO III DISEASE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3282747325"><span class="h2">Components of treatment</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H193051682"><span class="h3">Chemotherapy</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3225557794"><span class="h4">Preferred regimen: Etoposide plus cisplatin</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8430" href="/z/d/drug information/8430.html" rel="external">Etoposide</a> plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a> (EP) is the standard regimen for chemotherapy in patients with LS-SCLC along with early, concurrent thoracic radiation therapy (RT)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66855" href="/z/d/graphic/66855.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p>Initial studies of combined-modality therapy in patients with LS-SCLC used chemotherapy regimens such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9391" href="/z/d/drug information/9391.html" rel="external">doxorubicin</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10045" href="/z/d/drug information/10045.html" rel="external">vincristine</a> (CAV), followed sequentially by thoracic RT. Subsequent studies used EP in a similar sequential approach and demonstrated favorable response and survival rates with relatively tolerable toxicity [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>These regimens were compared in a trial in which patients with either LS- or extensive-stage (ES)-SCLC were randomly assigned to CAV, EP, or CAV alternating with EP [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The 146 patients with LS-SCLC received thoracic RT (40 to 50 Gy) after four cycles of chemotherapy. For patients with LS-SCLC, response rates to initial chemotherapy were significantly higher with EP (77 percent) and CAV/EP (88 percent) compared with CAV (51 percent); overall survival (OS) was similar in all three treatment arms (EP 11.7 months, CAV/EP 11.8 months, CAV 12.4 months). Based on these early studies, many oncologists adopted EP as the standard of care since it resulted in less myelotoxicity and was easier to combine with thoracic RT in patients with LS-SCLC due to a lower risk of mucosal and pulmonary toxicity.</p><p>EP was compared with another alkylator-based regimen, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8663" href="/z/d/drug information/8663.html" rel="external">epirubicin</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10045" href="/z/d/drug information/10045.html" rel="external">vincristine</a> (CEV), in 214 patients with LS-SCLC; thoracic RT (42 Gy) was given between the third and fourth cycles of chemotherapy [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. OS was significantly better in patients assigned to EP, with a median survival of 14.5 months versus 9.7 months and two-year survival rates of 25 versus 8 percent in the EP and CEV arms, respectively. There was no difference between arms in the number of patients who received definitive thoracic RT, prophylactic cranial irradiation, or second-line chemotherapy for relapse. These results in favor of EP are consistent with the findings of two meta-analyses that demonstrated a modest survival advantage in studies evaluating etoposide-based or cisplatin-based therapy in patients with both LS- and ES-SCLC [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>].</p><p>Overall, these studies confirm EP as the preferred regimen for the treatment of patients with LS-SCLC.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H445795472"><span class="h4">Alternatives</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Substitution of </strong><strong>carboplatin</strong><strong> for </strong><strong>cisplatin</strong> – <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9202" href="/z/d/drug information/9202.html" rel="external">Carboplatin</a> is frequently substituted for <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a> to reduce the risk of nonhematologic toxicities, such as nausea, vomiting, ototoxicity, neuropathy, and nephropathy. However, due to the potential curability of LS-SCLC and the relatively small number of LS-SCLC patients evaluated thus far, cisplatin remains the standard agent, with carboplatin restricted to patients with contraindications to or poor tolerance of cisplatin.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A meta-analysis that included 663 patients in four trials compared the efficacy of cisplatin-based versus carboplatin-based regimens in SCLC [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Only 32 percent of patients in the meta-analysis had LS-SCLC, since only two of the trials enrolled patients with LS disease [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. Overall, response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and OS were similar with cisplatin-based and carboplatin-based regimens in patients with both LS- and ES-SCLC [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].

Accelerated hyperfractionated RT potentially reduces the opportunity for tumor cell regeneration during treatment by shortening the overall treatment time.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.
