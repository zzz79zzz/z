         Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the spirochete
         <em>
          Treponema pallidum
         </em>
         . The manifestations of this disease are notoriously protean, with different stages occurring over time in untreated infection [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. Patients may seek evaluation for symptoms or signs of primary infection (eg, chancre), secondary infection (eg, diffuse rash), or tertiary infection (eg, symptoms of aortic insufficiency). Alternatively, patients may be completely asymptomatic and only identified on routine screening. The diagnosis of syphilis is most commonly made by serologic testing, a technique first described by Wasserman in 1906 [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The appropriate use and interpretation of diagnostic testing are important for optimal patient management. Testing for syphilis will be reviewed here. The pathophysiology, natural history, clinical manifestations, and treatment of this disorder as well as the laboratory monitoring of patients undergoing therapy are discussed elsewhere. (See

         Diagnostic testing for syphilis should be performed on patients with signs or symptoms of infection. In addition, asymptomatic patients should be screened for syphilis if they are at high risk for having acquired disease or for transmitting disease to others. Serologic testing is generally used to make a diagnosis of syphilis. The approach to testing is described below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Approach to testing'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         All persons who are diagnosed with a new syphilis infection should be treated. In addition, they should be offered HIV testing as well as screening for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). (See

         Since syphilis can present with a wide range of signs and symptoms, the threshold for serologic testing should be low. We test the following groups of patients regardless of their apparent risk behaviors:

         When deciding which other sexually active persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should assess if the patient is from a demographic group in which the prevalence rates of syphilis are particularly high [

         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. However, in such patients, testing as often as every three months may increase the detection of syphilis [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. (See

         For patients taking PrEPs, testing for STIs should be performed every three months in asymptomatic MSM and transgender women (TGW) at risk for recurrent STIs (eg, those with recent STIs or multiple sex partners) or every six months for all others taking PrEP who are sexually active [

         Screening for syphilis in asymptomatic nonpregnant adults and adolescents at high risk for infection is an important public health intervention that is supported by the United States Preventive Services Task Force [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Screening can identify patients with asymptomatic disease who, if left untreated, could otherwise be at risk for progression to late syphilis. Similarly, it can reduce syphilis transmission, since patients with unsuspected early primary or secondary disease can have lesions (eg, chancres and condyloma lata) that go unnoticed but are teeming with spirochetes, making them highly infectious to others.

         Serologic tests provide a presumptive diagnosis of syphilis. There are two types of serologic tests for syphilis: nontreponemal tests and treponemal-specific tests. The use of only one test is insufficient for diagnosis since serologic testing (especially nontreponemal tests) can be associated with false-positive results.
        </p>
        <p>
         False-negative results can also occur since serologic testing relies upon a humoral immune response to infection. Thus, the use of serologic testing may be limited in patients with advanced immunosuppression and/or early disease. As an example, although the majority of patients have a positive serologic test when they present with a chancre (ie, two to four weeks after exposure), approximately 20 to 30 percent have a nonreactive nontreponemal test [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. For such patients, serologic testing generally turns positive within the next two to four weeks. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Negative nontreponemal test in early syphilis'
         </a>

         Nontreponemal tests (also known as tests for reagin antibodies) are based upon the reactivity of serum from infected patients to a cardiolipin-cholesterol-lecithin antigen. Although these screening tests are nonspecific, and therefore not definitive, they have traditionally been used for initial syphilis screening due to their relatively low cost, ease of performance, and ability to be quantified for the purpose of following response to therapy.

         In general, these assays are semi-quantitative in that the amount of antibody present (both IgM and IgG) generally reflects the activity of the infection. Positive nontreponemal tests are reported as a titer of antibody (eg, 1:32, which represents the detection of antibody in serum diluted 32-fold). Titers tend to wane over time even without treatment, but successful therapy accelerates the pace of antibody decline. Changes in titer are followed after treatment to detect a therapeutic response.

         Both false-positive and false-negative results can be seen with nontreponemal tests as discussed below. (See

         Treponemal tests have historically been more complex and expensive to perform than nontreponemal tests. Thus, they have traditionally been used as confirmatory tests for syphilis when the nontreponemal tests are reactive. However, newer versions of these tests have been automated, enhancing simplicity and facilitating ease of use. As a result, these tests are increasingly used as an initial screening test for syphilis rather than as confirmatory tests (reverse screening). (See

         As a group, these tests are based upon the detection of antibodies directed against specific treponemal antigens and thus tend to be more specific than nontreponemal tests. Treponemal tests are qualitative and are reported as "reactive" or "nonreactive" [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>

         In late 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments waiver permitting the use of a rapid (10-minute) fingerstick treponemal-based antibody test called the Syphilis Health Check (SHC). The SHC can be used in clinical settings (eg, physicians' offices, emergency rooms, labor and delivery units) and those that are community-based (eg, freestanding counseling and testing sites) [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22

         ]. The waiver allows both nonmedical persons and health care workers to perform these tests. However, further evaluation of the SHC is needed before widespread use of this point-of-care (POC) test can be recommended since the sensitivity of the test has been lower in postmarketing studies compared with the FDA trial studies [

         <a href="#rid24">
          24

         Improvements in PCR testing resulting from better antigen specificity and the recognized lack of sensitivity of darkfield microscopy or DFA testing when the number of treponemes is low may explain these results.

          Initial screening with a nontreponemal test
         </strong>
         – Traditional serologic testing algorithms for syphilis have involved initial screening with a nontreponemal test (eg, RPR). A reactive nontreponemal test is then confirmed with a treponemal test, such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. In general, for asymptomatic patients, no further testing is needed if the nontreponemal test is negative  (

         However, for patients who present early in the course of disease (eg, ulcer, rash), serologic testing may be negative. If there is a high clinical suspicion for syphilis, presumptive treatment should be administered and then repeat serologic testing should be performed in two to four weeks. (See

          Initial screening with a treponemal test
         </strong>
         – An increasingly popular algorithm reverses the order and uses a treponemal test (eg, TP-EIA or chemiluminescence immunoassay [CIA]) as the screening test followed by a nontreponemal test for confirmation if the treponemal test is positive  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef134582" href="/z/d/graphic/134582.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 2

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Although observational studies have reported a higher false-positive rate with this reverse screening method compared with the traditional approach described above, it can detect syphilis in some patients with syphilis who would not have been identified if a nontreponemal test was used initially [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. This includes those with very early syphilis, those with prior treated syphilis, and those with late or late latent syphilis whose nontreponemal test has become nonreactive over time. The approach to such patients with discordant results (ie, the treponemal test is reactive but the reflex nontreponemal test is negative) is discussed elsewhere. (See
         <a class="local">

         The positive predictive value and negative predictive value of treponemal EIA tests as a screening approach for syphilis depend upon the prevalence of syphilis in the population. As an example, when the reported seroprevalence of syphilis is 0.71 (the prevalence of syphilis in the United States in 2008), the negative predictive value of the treponemal EIA exceeds 98 percent; however, the positive predictive value is as low as 12 percent [

         If the CSF-VDRL is nonreactive and neurosyphilis is suspected, a CSF FTA-ABS or CSF
         <em>
          T. pallidum
         </em>
         particle agglutination assay (TP-PA) can be ordered [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Although it is less specific than a CSF-VDRL, the CSF FTA-ABS or CSF TP-PA test is quite sensitive, and neurosyphilis is highly unlikely if either of these tests are negative.
        </p>
        <p>
         The use of nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) testing of CSF has been evaluated in persons with syphilis [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. In a prospective study of 40 patients with presumed neurosyphilis, nPCR had a sensitivity of 42 percent, as compared with 30 percent for CSF-VDRL. The absence of a "gold standard" for diagnosing neurosyphilis complicates interpretation of these findings as some of the tested patients may not have had neurosyphilis. Thus, the true sensitivity and specificity of a positive CSF PCR test is uncertain.

         In patients with otic or ocular symptoms, CSF evaluation is warranted for persons with clinical signs of neurosyphilis (eg, cranial nerve dysfunction, meningitis, stroke, acute or chronic altered mental status, or loss of vibration sense) [

         Appropriate interpretation of serologic testing depends upon the presence or absence of clinical disease, the patient's prior history of syphilis, and the individual's immune status. For patients with HIV, the diagnosis of syphilis is generally made the same way as for those without HIV [

         The combination of a positive screening nontreponemal test and a positive treponemal confirmatory test supports a diagnosis of syphilis. For patients without a history of syphilis, these results are consistent with a new infection that must be treated. However, for patients with a history of treated syphilis in the past, the interpretation is sometimes less clear, and the need for treatment depends upon the patient's clinical presentation and the nontreponemal titer. Some patients may not recall their history, and, in such cases, contacting the local health department may prove helpful in providing prior test results and treatment history.
        </p>
        <p>
         On rare occasion, both nontreponemal and treponemal tests can be falsely positive. This can result from a different infectious etiology (eg, endemic treponematoses such as yaws, bejel, and pinta), or a noninfectious condition affecting immune function [

         For those without a known history of syphilis, a diagnosis is made when both nontreponemal and treponemal tests are reactive. To determine the appropriate treatment, patients should be assessed for symptoms and stage of disease  (

         Although treponemal tests usually remain positive after infection, titers of nontreponemal assays decline following successful therapy and usually revert to nonreactive over time  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef134583" href="/z/d/graphic/134583.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 3
         </a>
         ). Thus, for patients with a history of treated syphilis, the presence of a positive nontreponemal test often indicates a new infection, an evolving response to recent treatment, or treatment failure. In some cases, a patient may have had an adequate decline in titers but the nontreponemal titer does not serorevert (previously referred to as being serofast). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7597.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         To properly interpret serologic test results, titers should be compared with the patient's prior post-treatment titer. If possible, titers should be compared using the same test methodology since the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) may differ from one another. If the post-treatment titer is not readily available, the results can sometimes be obtained by calling the local public health department, which maintains a registry of past positive tests. A detailed discussion of how to manage patients with an inadequate response to treatment is presented separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7597.html" rel="external">

         In laboratories using the nontreponemal test for screening, patients who have a positive nontreponemal test followed by a negative treponemal test are generally considered to have a false-positive syphilis result. It is estimated that 1 to 2 percent of the United States population has false-positive nontreponemal test results [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Although false-positive test results tend to be of low titer, the level of the titer alone does not reliably help the clinician differentiate between a true- or false-positive result. Thus, a reactive nontreponemal test must be followed with specific treponemal testing to rule out active syphilis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Serologic testing algorithms'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         False-positive tests are particularly common during pregnancy (see

          "Syphilis in pregnancy"
         </a>
         ). In addition, false-positive nontreponemal test results can be related to an acute event, such as an acute febrile illness (eg, endocarditis, rickettsial disease) or recent immunization [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41,42
         </a>
         ]. Test abnormalities attributed to these conditions are usually transitory and typically last for six months or less. Other etiologies include chronic conditions, such as autoimmune disorders (particularly systemic lupus erythematosus); intravenous drug use; chronic liver disease; and underlying HIV disease.

         Patients who are tested for syphilis using an initial treponemal-specific screening strategy can have discordant results (ie, a positive treponemal test followed by a negative nontreponemal test). In the New York experience, discordant results were seen in 3 percent of 116,822 specimens [

        <p>
         Discordant results often occur in patients with a history of successfully treated syphilis. In these cases, no further evaluation or treatment is needed unless there is concern for re-exposure. When prior syphilis history is unknown, the local health department should be contacted and may be helpful in providing records of prior testing and treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients without a history of treated syphilis, a discordant result can occur in very early syphilis or in late syphilis when nontreponemal tests have become nonreactive over time (see

         Most false-negative nontreponemal results occur when the test is performed prior to the development of humoral antibodies  (

         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. Although treponemal tests may or may not show a positive result in this setting, they are generally considered more sensitive than nontreponemal tests. The fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) is thought to be most sensitive in primary syphilis (sensitivity of 98.2 versus 92.7 percent for rapid plasma reagin and 72.5 percent for VDRL test) [
         <a href="#rid44">

         If there is a high clinical suspicion for early syphilis, repeat serologic testing at a later time point (eg, two to four weeks later) may be diagnostic. Direct methods for visualizing the organism are not generally available. Presumptive therapy, rather than waiting for the results of additional testing, is appropriate in patients at high risk for syphilis. (See

         A second major cause of a false-negative nontreponemal test is the "prozone reaction." When antibody titers are high (as often seen in secondary syphilis), an overabundance of antibodies interferes with clumping of antigen-antibody complexes. Thus, a prozone reaction refers to the inability to visualize agglutination, which normally occurs when antigen and antibody bind together to form a complex. This phenomenon occurs in less than 2 percent of samples from patients with syphilis and is usually associated with pregnancy, HIV coinfection, and neurosyphilis [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Experienced laboratory technologists may suspect the prozone phenomenon when an apparent nonreactive test exhibits a rough or granular appearance. They can then dilute the specimen so that sufficient agglutination can be seen and the true sample reactivity becomes apparent. Providers can also request that a specimen be evaluated for a prozone reaction.

         Some patients will be treated for syphilis prior to testing. Such patients with a history of very early treatment may have no laboratory evidence of prior syphilis because of full seroreversion of the nontreponemal test. Although seroreversion of the treponemal serology can also occur, complete seroreversion of both the treponemal and the nontreponemal tests is uncommon.

         On rare occasion, patients may have a negative nontreponemal test in the presence of active syphilis. This is typically seen in patients with advanced immunosuppression (eg, patients with AIDS) and is thought to reflect B-cell failure during late-stage HIV infection [

        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, during the natural history of syphilis, a positive nontreponemal test can become nonreactive over time, even in the absence of treatment; however, this generally evolves over many years. If such a situation is suspected, screening with the treponemal test may be helpful since these tests are more likely to remain positive for life.

          Whom to test
         </strong>
         – Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the spirochete
         <em>
          Treponema pallidum
         </em>
         . Diagnostic testing for syphilis should be performed in patients with signs and symptoms of infection  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50435" href="/z/d/graphic/50435.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In addition, asymptomatic patients should be screened for latent syphilis if they are at high risk for having acquired disease or for transmitting disease to others (eg, pregnancy). (See

         <strong>
          Approach to testing
         </strong>
         – For most patients, a presumptive, rather than definitive, diagnosis of syphilis is made using serologic testing of blood specimens. Methods that detect the organism are not generally available.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Serologic testing to diagnose syphilis should include the use of both nontreponemal and treponemal tests. For those without prior syphilis, either test can be used as the initial screening test  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef134582" href="/z/d/graphic/134582.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 2

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Confirmatory testing is necessary due to the potential for false-positive screening test results. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnostic tests'

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         If a diagnosis of neurosyphilis is being considered, cerebrospinal fluid evaluation should also be performed. (See

          Interpretation of serologic testing
         </strong>
         – Appropriate interpretation of serologic testing depends upon the presence or absence of clinical disease, the patient's prior history of syphilis, and the individual's immune status. As examples:

          Positive nontreponemal and treponemal test
         </strong>
         – For patients without a history of prior syphilis, a diagnosis of syphilis is made when both nontreponemal and treponemal tests are reactive. All persons who are diagnosed with a new syphilis infection should be treated. (See
         <a class="local">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         For patients with a history of treated syphilis, the presence of a positive nontreponemal test can indicate a new infection, an evolving response to recent treatment, or treatment failure. In some cases, a patient may have had an adequate decline in titers but nontreponemal titers do not serorevert. (See

         It is estimated that 1 to 2 percent of the United States population has false-positive nontreponemal test results. False-positive tests are particularly common during pregnancy. Other reasons for a false-positive test include acute infection, recent immunization, and autoimmune conditions.

         – Patients who are tested for syphilis using an initial treponemal-specific screening strategy ("reverse algorithm") can have a positive treponemal test followed by a negative nontreponemal test. This scenario is usually seen in patients with a history of previously treated syphilis  (
