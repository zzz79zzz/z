The terminology for the various TMA syndromes has evolved as their underlying disease mechanisms have become clearer. (See <a class="local">'Preferred terminology'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2792076049"><span class="h2">Evolution of disease understanding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Originally, the TMA syndromes associated with AKI were recognized mostly in children. By far the most common etiology in children is an enteric infection by Shiga toxin-producing bacteria (<em>Shigella dysenteriae</em> and some strains of <em>Escherichia coli</em>, such as <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7). The clinical presentation characteristically begins with several days of severe abdominal pain and diarrhea, which becomes overtly bloody. As the diarrhea is decreasing, up to 15 percent of children develop AKI [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. This disorder is hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), sometimes described as Shiga toxin-mediated HUS (ST-HUS). Even in outbreaks, the diagnosis of ST-HUS is not always confirmed by documentation of Shiga toxin or Shiga toxin-producing organisms.</p><p>After the initial description of HUS, some children were described as having HUS without diarrhea. Often these children had persistent or recurrent disease. Some had a family history of HUS. These children were initially described as having "atypical" HUS, to distinguish them from "typical" HUS with a diarrhea prodrome caused by enteric infection. This distinction was initially appropriate for pediatric practice when there were no therapeutic implications in the era before complement-directed therapies became available.</p><p>Following the discovery that dysregulation of the alternative pathway of complement contributed to the etiology of "atypical" HUS, anti-complement therapy was developed. When complement dysregulation is associated with AKI, intervening with anti-complement therapy improves renal outcomes [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The availability of anti-complement treatment and the lack of specificity of the diagnostic criteria for many of the TMA syndromes have rapidly expanded the consideration of this diagnosis, particularly in adults [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Now nearly one-half of patients diagnosed with complement-mediated TMA (CM-TMA) are adults. The availability of anti-complement therapy and its potential therapeutic benefit when AKI is present makes it essential to distinguish CM-TMA from other causes of TMA and AKI. The diagnosis of CM-TMA is difficult to substantiate when turnaround time is slow for complete genetic studies. (See <a class="local">'Terminal complement blockade'</a> below.)</p><p>Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a TMA that primarily causes microvascular symptoms in organ systems other than the kidney (eg, central nervous system). Immune TTP is caused by an autoantibody and is effectively treated with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and therapies to reduce autoantibody production. In the era before TPE was used as effective therapy, TTP was characterized by a pentad that included MAHA, thrombocytopenia, fever, neurologic symptoms, and AKI; however, the AKI component of the pentad is rarely seen in the era of TPE because patients recover before AKI can develop. As an example, a 2017 review of kidney function in 78 consecutive patients in the Oklahoma TTP Registry found that only eight (10 percent) had KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) stage 3 AKI, and only three (4 percent) required dialysis [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Presenting findings in TTP are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1338.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of immune TTP"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2406710294"><span class="h2">Preferred terminology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We prefer the following terminology, which takes into account the etiology of TMA and therefore facilitates earlier recognition of directed therapy in affected individuals [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ST-HUS</strong> – We reserve the name HUS for the disease caused by Shiga toxin (ST-HUS). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The term ST-HUS implies that recovery will occur spontaneously. Renal replacement therapy is frequently required in the acute phase and chronic kidney disease may occur. Recurrence of ST-HUS is rare. Supportive care involves hydration, treatment of pancreatitis-related manifestations (such as hyperglycemia), and transfusion for severe anemia. (See <a class="local">'Causes of ST-HUS'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complement-mediated TMA</strong> – Complement-mediated TMA (CM-TMA) is the preferred term (rather than atypical HUS) for the TMAs associated with inherited pathogenic variants in complement genes <strong>or</strong> acquired autoantibodies against complement factor H (CFH).

Additional supportive care may involve hydration, dialysis, or transfusions for severe anemia. (See <a class="local">'Causes of CM-TMA'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Certain terms based on older nomenclature continue to be used, and these may inadvertently propagate ambiguities in understanding disease physiology and management.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26528751"><span class="h1">CAUSES OF ST-HUS AND CM-TMA IN ADULTS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3091716389"><span class="h2">Causes of ST-HUS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Shiga toxin (ST or STX, also called verotoxin or verocytotoxin [VT]) is a two-subunit bacterial toxin that belongs to a family of proteins originally identified from <em>Shigella dysenteriae </em>type 1 [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. ST binds to a glycolipid receptor (globotriaosylceramide [Gb3]) that is expressed on kidney cells and other cell types [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. There are several related Shiga-like toxins [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. ST can be produced by a number of organisms and may be transferred between bacteria by a bacteriophage [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong><em>E. coli</em></strong> – The most common cause of ST-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome (ST-HUS) in industrialized societies is ST-producing <em>E. coli</em> (STEC). The most frequently isolated strain is <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7, although other serotypes of <em>E. coli</em> such as O104:H4 can also produce high levels of one or more Shiga toxins [<a href="#rid2">2,5,10,11</a>].

There were 501 cases <em>of E. coli </em>O157:H7 infection; 45 developed HUS; three died. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>An outbreak of <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 infection in Walkerton, Ontario (Canada) in 2000 was eventually traced to the municipal water supply; 1346 cases of diarrheal illness were reported [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Of these, 65 individuals were admitted to the hospital, 27 developed HUS, and six died. The median age of affected individuals was 29 years (range, &lt;1 to 97 years).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The strain responsible for the large outbreak in 2011 in Germany, causing ST-HUS in 845 patients with 54 deaths, was O104:H4 [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. The O104:H4 strain was also responsible for a large outbreak in France the same year [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. These outbreaks in Germany and France were caused by contaminated sprouts. Since children rarely eat sprouts, most affected patients were adults. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A 2016 outbreak <em>of E. coli</em> strain O121 was reported in the United States in association with ingestion of contaminated raw flour; there were 56 cases of infection and one case of HUS [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">STEC is typically acquired by eating contaminated foods or beverages such as undercooked ground beef, unpasteurized juice or cider, raw milk, or raw produce (eg, lettuce, spinach, sprouts) [<a href="#rid19">19-22</a>]. Other sources include ingestion of contaminated water, contact with farm animals (eg, cattle), or person-to-person contact [<a href="#rid19">19,22,23</a>]. Although outbreaks are highly visible, most cases of STEC infections are sporadic (not due to outbreaks) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Shigella</strong> – Shigella species including <em>S. dysenteriae</em>, <em>S. sonnei</em>, and <em>S. flexneri</em> have been reported to cause TMA with AKI [<a href="#rid24">24-28</a>]. These infections may be more common in rural Asia and India [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other bacteria and viruses</strong> – Cases of TMA with AKI have been described with other bacterial organisms (salmonella, campylobacter) as well as viruses [<a href="#rid30">30-32</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3712904412"><span class="h2">Causes of CM-TMA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Complement-mediated TMA (CM-TMA) may be caused by inherited pathogenic variants (disease-causing mutations) in complement gene variants or by autoantibodies directed against complement factor H (CFH) [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1629278069"><span class="h3">Role of complement system</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The complement system plays a central role in host innate immunity. It participates in antibody-mediated immunity, promotes phagocytosis (via opsonization), directly lyses foreign cells via the membrane attack complex, and may recruit other immune mediators (eg, via cytokines) to a site of injury or infection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1371.html" rel="external">"Overview of hemostasis", section on 'Blood coagulation as part of the host defense system'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3920.html" rel="external">"Overview and clinical assessment of the complement system", section on 'Functions of the complement system'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3968.html" rel="external">"Complement pathways"</a>.)</p><p>In order to achieve immune surveillance, the alternative pathway of complement is constitutively active and inducible (ie, it has features that allow rapid amplification of necessary functions). This reactivity necessitates precise regulation in order to limit inadvertent injury to self-tissues. This concept is comparable with the continuous low-level activation of the coagulation system and the requirement for inhibitors (eg, proteins C and S) to prevent excessive thrombin generation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3967.html" rel="external">"Regulators and receptors of the complement system"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1330.html" rel="external">"The endothelium: A primer", section on 'Complement-mediated endothelial cell injury'</a>.)</p><p>The complement regulatory proteins include CFH, complement factor I (CFI), membrane cofactor protein (MCP, also called CD46), and others. These prevent excessive and/or inappropriate activation of complement on host cells, as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3967.html" rel="external">"Regulators and receptors of the complement system", section on 'Complement regulation'</a>.)</p><p>In adults with CM-TMA, gene variants appear to be more common than autoantibodies (see <a class="local">'Pathogenic sequence variants in complement genes'</a> below). This was suggested by a series of individuals with TMA and AKI in a French database that included 125 adults [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Autoantibodies were only seen in four (3 percent) compared with pathogenic variants in complement genes in 73 (58 percent). Pregnancy was the triggering factor in 18 of 93 females (19 percent) in this cohort.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1057130870"><span class="h3">Pathogenic sequence variants in complement genes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pathogenic sequence variants in a number of complement genes have been described, including <em>CFH</em>, <em>CFI</em>, <em>MCP</em>/<em>CD46</em>, <em>C3</em>, and <em>CFB </em>[<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Additional details of these variants, the mechanisms by which they may promote TMA, and possible genotype-phenotype correlations are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6084.html" rel="external">"Complement-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome in children", section on 'Genetic variants'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1331.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology of TTP and other primary thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs)", section on 'Complement-mediated TMA pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Hereditary CM-TMA related to a variant in a complement gene may present at any age. In a series from a French database, disease variants in <em>CFI</em> and <em>CFH</em> appeared to present at an older age than variants in <em>MCP</em>, but numbers may have been too small to draw firm conclusions about genotype-phenotype correlations [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Clinical features in this series such as the incidence of end-stage kidney disease and mortality were not different from disease caused by different genotypes. In data from Johns Hopkins, the median age of presentation in adults with TMA and AKI was 46 years, and the majority were female [<a href="#rid35">35,36</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3712051805"><span class="h3">Sequence variants of uncertain significance in complement genes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Genetic testing may identify variants that have not been documented to be pathogenic. These are often referred to as variants of uncertain significance (VUS). The designation may apply to either a benign or pathogenic variant, if more data were available; therefore, they cannot be assumed to be pathogenic or to be the cause of CM-TMA. The gene variants must be considered to be a potential risk. Consultation with the genetic testing laboratory or a genetics professional may provide additional understanding of the risk for causing kidney disease. The perception of the pathogenic importance may be influenced by a personal or family history of a similar kidney disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1771735037"><span class="h3">Autoantibodies against CFH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Autoantibodies directed against complement factor H (CFH) are reported in approximately 8 to 10 percent of CM-TMA patients and may be more common in some countries [<a href="#rid37">37,38</a>]. While it was initially believed that these antibodies only occurred in children, it is clear that they may also be seen in adults.
