The genus Ebolavirus consists of six species: Zaire, Sudan, Bundibugyo, Tai Forest, Reston, and Bombali [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Of these, only the first four have caused recognized disease in humans; all but the Reston virus are indigenous to Africa. Several other genera of filoviruses have recently been identified in animals, but there is no evidence that they cause disease in humans.</p><p>The Zaire species of Ebola virus was the first to be discovered [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. From 1976 through 2013, it caused multiple outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and neighboring countries in Central Africa, with case fatality rates often approaching 90 percent. Those outbreaks usually involved fewer than 100 cases and were contained within a period of weeks to a few months. In 2014, the Zaire virus appeared in West Africa, producing an epidemic in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone that took more than two years to bring under control [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. There were nearly 29,000 total cases (suspected, probable, or confirmed), of which more than 15,000 were laboratory confirmed, and the overall case fatality rate was approximately 40 percent. Since then, the Zaire species has been responsible for additional epidemics, including several outbreaks in the DRC [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. A subsequent outbreak in Guinea in early 2021 appears to have resulted from persistent human infection since the 2014 West African epidemic, though the manner of persistence could not be determined [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3023.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and pathogenesis of Ebola virus disease"</a>.)</p><p>The Sudan species of Ebola virus was also discovered in 1976 [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. In five outbreaks in Uganda and Sudan, including one that ended in January 2023, case fatality rates have averaged approximately 50 percent. The Bundibugyo species has been responsible for small outbreaks in Uganda and the adjacent DRC [<a href="#rid12">12</a>], while the Ivory Coast virus has caused one nonfatal case [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The Reston virus, which has been found in pigs in the Philippines, and the Bombali virus, identified as viral RNA in African bats, are not known to cause disease in humans. </p><p>Epidemics typically begin when a human comes into contact with an infected animal or its body fluids [<a href="#rid1">1,3</a>]. However, the persistence of virus in persons who have recovered from Ebola virus disease may potentially be a source of infection for new outbreaks [<a href="#rid9">9,14-16</a>]. Person-to-person transmission is based upon direct physical contact with the body fluids of a living or deceased patient. Patients typically present with a nonspecific febrile syndrome that may include headache, muscle aches, and fatigue [<a href="#rid1">1,3,17</a>]. Vomiting and diarrhea frequently develop during the first few days of illness and may lead to significant volume losses. A maculopapular rash is sometimes observed. Despite the traditional name of "Ebola hemorrhagic fever," major bleeding is not found in most patients, and severe hemorrhage tends to be observed only in the late stages of disease. Some patients develop progressive hypotension and shock with multiorgan failure, which typically results in death during the second week of illness. By comparison, patients who survive infection commonly begin to show signs of clinical improvement during the second week of illness.</p><p>The experience of the 2014-2016 West African epidemic demonstrated that the mortality associated with Ebola virus disease may be reduced through adequate supportive care [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. It also accelerated the investigation of therapies and vaccines for treatment and prevention of the Zaire species of Ebola virus [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. As an example, two different monoclonal antibody therapies were found to be beneficial in the “PALM” clinical trial conducted in the North Kivu epidemic in the DRC [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. In addition, the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, first found to provide significant protection in West Africa, was given to more than 300,000 people during the course of the North Kivu epidemic and to more than 30,000 people during the 2020 outbreak in the Équateur Province [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. </p><p>This topic will discuss the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Ebola virus disease. Detailed discussions of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of Ebola virus disease are found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3023.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and pathogenesis of Ebola virus disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97985.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prevention of Ebola virus disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H134221"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>During the nearly 40 years between the first recognized Ebola outbreaks in Zaire and Sudan in 1976 and the beginning of the 2014-2016 epidemic in West Africa, several publications described the clinical and laboratory features of the disease [<a href="#rid5">5,11,18</a>]. That information was supplemented by many patient series from Ebola treatment units in West Africa and case reports of patients treated in the United States and in Europe  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef99186" href="/d/graphic/99186.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid19">19-24</a>].</p><p>Although most features of Ebola virus disease in the West African epidemic matched earlier descriptions, patients differed in two respects: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Major hemorrhage was less common than previously described. Thus, the name of the disease was changed from "Ebola hemorrhagic fever" to "Ebola virus disease." </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Volume losses from vomiting and diarrhea made a greater contribution to severe illness than previously recognized.</p><p></p><p>Before the 2014 to 2016 epidemic, reports of Ebola outbreaks in Africa largely focused on severe and fatal illness, but the spectrum of Ebola virus infection may have also included milder infections that escaped detection [<a href="#rid25">25-28</a>]. One report that reviewed past serosurveys from Central Africa suggested "asymptomatic" Ebola virus infections could occur [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Subsequent studies, including a retrospective analysis of a large cohort of survivors and contacts from the West African epidemic, have reached similar conclusions [<a href="#rid30">30-32</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H134397"><span class="h2">Incubation period</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with Ebola virus disease typically have an abrupt onset of symptoms 6 to 12 days after exposure (range 2 to 21 days) [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>]. There is no evidence that infected persons who have not yet developed signs of illness are infectious to others. However, all symptomatic individuals should be assumed to have virus in the blood and other body fluids, and appropriate safety precautions should be taken. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3023.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and pathogenesis of Ebola virus disease", section on 'Transmission'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97985.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prevention of Ebola virus disease", section on 'Infection control precautions during acute illness'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H134474"><span class="h2">Signs and symptoms</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial syndrome</strong> – Most cases of Ebola virus disease begin with the abrupt onset of fever and chills, but low-grade fever and malaise may also precede the development of more severe symptoms [<a href="#rid24">24,33</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Common signs and symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of appetite [<a href="#rid19">19-21,34</a>]. Reports have also described weakness, myalgias, as well as a high fever accompanied by relative bradycardia as seen in typhoid fever [<a href="#rid18">18,33</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rash</strong> – A diffuse erythematous, nonpruritic maculopapular rash may develop by day 5 to 7 of illness. The rash usually involves the face, neck, trunk, and arms, and can desquamate; it is generally easier to see in light-skinned persons [<a href="#rid18">18,35,36</a>]. During the outbreak in Sierra Leone, rash was reported as rare [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]; however, it was clearly described in case reports of infected health care workers [<a href="#rid23">23,33</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gastrointestinal</strong> – Gastrointestinal signs and symptoms are common and usually develop within the first few days of illness. These include watery diarrhea (up to 10 liters per day) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>], nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Vomiting and diarrhea may result in severe fluid loss, potentially leading to dehydration, hypotension, and shock [<a href="#rid19">19-22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hemorrhage</strong> – Case series from the West African epidemic indicate that many patients develop some degree of bleeding during their illness, most commonly manifested as blood in the stool (about 6 percent), petechiae, ecchymoses, oozing from venipuncture sites, and/or mucosal bleeding [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Clinically significant hemorrhage may be seen in the terminal phase of illness and in pregnancy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97985.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prevention of Ebola virus disease", section on 'Considerations during pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neurologic</strong> – Patients occasionally develop meningoencephalitis, with findings such as an altered level of consciousness, hyperreflexia, myopathy, stiff neck, gait instability, and/or seizures [<a href="#rid22">22,38,39</a>]. These clinical manifestations typically develop around days 8 to 10 of illness.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cardiac</strong> – Pulse-temperature dissociation with relative bradycardia may be observed during acute illness [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. In addition, retrosternal chest pain attributed to pericarditis has been reported [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Myocarditis has also been described [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Respiratory</strong> – Tachypnea and shortness of breath may represent hypoxia or hypoventilation due to respiratory muscle fatigue, contributing to pending respiratory failure. During the West African epidemic, this phenomenon was observed in nearly one-third of patients treated in Europe and the United States in the setting of intravenous fluid resuscitation [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ocular</strong> – Patients may develop conjunctival injection and/or signs and symptoms of uveitis (eg, blurred vision, photophobia, blindness) during the acute phase of illness [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. In addition, uveitis has been documented during convalescence. (See <a class="local">'Convalescence'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H134730"><span class="h2">Laboratory findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with Ebola virus disease typically develop leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and serum transaminase elevations, as well as renal and coagulation abnormalities [<a href="#rid3">3,19-21,42</a>]. Other laboratory findings include a marked decrease in serum albumin, hypoglycemia, and elevated amylase levels  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef99186" href="/d/graphic/99186.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Leukopenia</strong> – Leukopenia usually presents as lymphopenia, followed by an elevated neutrophil count. Immature granulocytes and abnormal lymphocytes, including plasmacytoid cells and immunoblasts, may be seen in blood smears.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thrombocytopenia</strong> – Platelet counts decrease during the acute phase of illness, but generally do not fall below 50,000 to 100,000/microL. Platelet counts typically reach a nadir around day 6 to 8 of illness.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Abnormal hematocrit</strong> – Patients with Ebola virus disease may present with an increased or decreased hematocrit. As an example, in one cohort study that evaluated 100 patients, 15 had an increased hematocrit upon presentation and 36 were anemic [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Transaminase elevations</strong> – Because Ebola virus can cause multifocal hepatic necrosis, blood chemistry tests usually demonstrate elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. In one study, AST levels correlated with viral load [<a href="#rid43">43</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Coagulation abnormalities</strong> – Prothrombin (PT) and partial thromboplastin times (PTT) can be prolonged and fibrin degradation products elevated, consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation. These changes are most prominent in severe and fatal cases. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Renal abnormalities</strong> – Proteinuria is a common finding, and renal insufficiency with elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine can be seen in both the early and late stages of disease [<a href="#rid19">19,42</a>]. Acute kidney injury is exacerbated by excessive fluid loss from diarrhea and vomiting without adequate volume replacement but may also develop as a result of direct viral-mediated damage of renal tissues in the absence of severe volume loss [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Electrolyte abnormalities</strong> – Patients may develop significant electrolyte disturbances (eg, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia) secondary to the gastrointestinal manifestations of the disease. Such individuals may require frequent repletion of electrolytes to prevent cardiac arrhythmias. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97985.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prevention of Ebola virus disease", section on 'Supportive care'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H107362722"><span class="h2">Disease course</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who survive Ebola virus disease typically begin to improve during the second week of illness. Fatal disease has been characterized by more severe clinical signs and symptoms early during infection, with progression to multiorgan failure with death typically occurring in the second week. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97985.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prevention of Ebola virus disease", section on 'Prognostic factors'</a>.) </p><p>Some patients develop secondary complications related to their disease and/or the treatments they receive [<a href="#rid44">44,45</a>]. These include bacterial sepsis, respiratory failure associated with aggressive fluid resuscitation, and/or lung and kidney injury. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97985.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prevention of Ebola virus disease", section on 'Supportive care'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H107362808"><span class="h2">Convalescence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The convalescent period of Ebola virus disease is prolonged and can persist for more than two years [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Convalescent patients can suffer from weakness, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, insomnia, headache, urinary frequency, memory loss, and failure to regain weight that was lost during illness, resulting in significant disability. During and after the West African epidemic, these findings were supported in several studies, including one that included nearly 1000 survivors [<a href="#rid47">47-50</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other clinical manifestations include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Retro-orbital pain, uveitis, and hearing loss [<a href="#rid46">46,47,51,52</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Extensive sloughing of skin and hair loss, which may result from virus-induced necrosis of infected sweat glands and other dermal structures [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Symptoms of depression and anxiety [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. A study of survivors of the 1995 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo found that some patients suffered depression and anxiety for more than two decades [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. Another subsequent study found that depression and post-traumatic stress disorder were common among the survivors of the Ebola virus disease epidemic that occurred in the eastern DRC from 2018 to 2020 [<a href="#rid54">54</a>].</p><p></p><p>Symptoms and signs can be severe, and in one report of Ebola survivors after the outbreak of Ebola Sudan virus disease in Uganda in 2000, many patients were unable to resume their previous work activities [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. A study of more than 300 survivors of the epidemic in West Africa found that a majority suffered from symptoms that interfered with their life, and more than half still reported symptoms at five years of follow-up [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. It has been postulated that a higher Ebola viral load at the time of clinical presentation is associated with the development of symptoms during convalescence [<a href="#rid52">52,56</a>].</p><p>Some patients develop new clinical manifestations after recovery from their initial infection. In one report, the median time from discharge to onset of clinical manifestations was one to two weeks [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. In this study of 277 Ebola survivors from the West African epidemic who were evaluated after discharge from a treatment center, 76 percent had arthralgias, 60 percent had new ocular symptoms (eg, blurry vision, light sensitivity, itchy eye), 24 percent had auditory symptoms (eg, tinnitus, hearing loss), and 18 percent had uveitis. The persistence of virus in the central nervous system and testes after apparent recovery is the subject of continuing research in laboratory animal models of Ebola virus disease [<a href="#rid57">57</a>].</p><p>Others develop late complications of Ebola virus disease, with manifestations developing months after they have recovered from their initial illness. As an example, one patient who had recovered from Ebola virus disease developed meningitis 10 months after her initial diagnosis, and infectious virus was recovered in the cerebrospinal fluid [<a href="#rid58">58</a>]. In another report, uveitis developed 14 weeks after Ebola virus disease was initially diagnosed, and the aqueous fluid contained infectious virus [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. The role of persistent virus in causing clinical manifestations during convalescence is unclear; in one case report, immune activation was felt to contribute to the development of uveitis [<a href="#rid59">59</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of uveitis, unlike other conditions, continues to increase for at least two years after initial symptom onset. In a prospective longitudinal study, 516 Ebola virus disease survivors and 586 controls were followed for 12 months and underwent ophthalmologic exam [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. The prevalence of uveitis in survivors increased from 26 percent a median of one year after symptom onset to 33 percent after an additional year of follow-up.

Since most patients suspected of possible Ebola virus disease will have travelled to and/or reside in Sub-Saharan Africa, the following disorders should be considered:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Malaria</strong> – Travelers who develop a febrile illness after returning from Sub-Saharan Africa should be evaluated for malaria, which can present with similar findings to Ebola virus disease and may occur concurrently. Microscopic examination of blood smears and/or rapid antigen testing are typically used to diagnose malaria.

Transmission to humans occurs primarily through exposure to the aerosolized excretions of local multimammate rats, or in rare cases, through contact with body fluids of infected individuals. Diagnosis is made by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing and/or serology.

The organism responsible for the enteric fever syndrome is <em>Salmonella enterica</em> serotype Typhi (formerly <em>S. typhi</em>). Worldwide, typhoid fever is most prevalent in impoverished areas that are overcrowded, with poor access to sanitation. The diagnosis is typically made through identification of the organism in blood cultures.

However, in measles, this is followed by conjunctivitis, coryza, and cough, as well as a characteristic maculopapular, blanching rash that begins on the face. The diagnosis of measles is typically established via antibody or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.

Patients typically present with malaise, anorexia, and abdominal cramps, followed by the sudden onset of diarrhea. Nausea, vomiting, and low-grade fever may also occur. When attempting to distinguish between travelers' diarrhea and diarrhea that occurs in Ebola virus disease, clinicians should note whether the condition appears to be part of a systemic illness or is mostly confined to the gastrointestinal tract. A patient who develops diarrhea in the setting of Ebola virus disease is likely to have a several-day history of fever, myalgia, fatigue, and other signs of a rapidly progressive systemic disease.

The appearance of multiple patients with a similar, rapidly progressive illness would be especially suggestive of bioterrorism. Any clinician suspecting that such an event is unfolding should report it promptly to local and state health authorities. General concepts regarding bioterrorism are discussed elsewhere.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

Most cases are due to outbreaks in endemic areas. However, because of its virulence and high infectivity, Ebola virus is classified as a Category A bioterror agent. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Bioterrorism'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Incubation period</strong> – The incubation period is typically 6 to 12 days but can range from 2 to 21 days. (See <a class="local">'Incubation period'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Signs and symptoms</strong> – Patients with Ebola virus disease usually have an abrupt onset of nonspecific symptoms and signs such as fever, malaise, headache, and myalgias. As the illness progresses, vomiting and diarrhea may develop, often leading to significant fluid loss. Patients with worsening disease display hypotension and electrolyte imbalances leading to shock and multiorgan failure, sometimes accompanied by hemorrhage  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef99186" href="/d/graphic/99186.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Signs and symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – Whether Ebola virus disease is considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient with fever and flu-like symptoms will vary markedly depending upon the circumstances, in particular whether a recognized Ebola epidemic is currently taking place. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with clinical findings consistent with the disease (ie, fever and/or severe headache, weakness, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or unexplained hemorrhage), clinicians should obtain a careful history to determine if they have had a possible exposure to Ebola virus within 21 days prior to the onset of symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a class="local">'Determining the risk of exposure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>All patients who have or are suspected of having Ebola virus disease should be promptly isolated. Infection control precautions should include hand hygiene; standard, contact, and droplet precautions; as well as the correct use of appropriate personal protective equipment. Hospital infection control staff, as well as the local or state health department, should be contacted immediately. (See <a class="local">'Symptomatic patients with identifiable risk'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Medical evaluation of symptomatic patients with a history of exposure generally includes testing for Ebola virus and other likely pathogens. Whether laboratory testing for Ebola virus should be performed depends, in part, upon the relative likelihood that a patient was exposed to the virus and the presence of compatible clinical symptoms and/or laboratory findings  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116306" href="/d/graphic/116306.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Monitoring for symptoms and signs of Ebola virus disease should be performed for asymptomatic persons who have had an exposure to Ebola virus. (See <a class="local">'Asymptomatic individuals with identifiable risk'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic tests</strong> – Diagnostic tests for Ebola virus infection are principally based upon the detection of specific RNA sequences by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing in blood or other body fluids. Ebola virus is generally detectable in blood samples within three days after the onset of symptoms; repeat testing may be needed for patients with symptoms for fewer than three days duration. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic tests'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> – The differential diagnosis will vary markedly with the clinical and epidemiologic circumstances. As an example, travelers returning from Sub-Saharan Africa should be evaluated for illnesses commonly seen in those areas, such as malaria. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li class="breakAll">Bray M, Chertow D. Filoviruses.
