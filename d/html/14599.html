          Smoking cessation
         </strong>
         – Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is known to cause severe lung disease in smokers. In a study of 199 smokers, individuals who were homozygous for an AAT null allele with severe deficiency of the AAT protein, were significantly more likely to attempt to quit smoking (59 percent) than either mutation carriers (heterozygotes; 34 percent) or individuals with a normal genotype (26 percent) [

         In a study of 261 smokers who were asked to consider one of two randomly assigned hypothetical scenarios, individuals who were informed of having genetic risk factors for heart disease were more likely to report an inclination to quit smoking than individuals in a high-risk (but without genetic risk factors) group [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5

A substantial proportion of respondents reported that their decisions were motivated by the belief that smoking cessation would translate to reductions in heart disease, suggesting that genetic risk factors would not negatively influence the ability to modify behavior and improve risk factor avoidance.

          Cholesterol lowering

         – In a study of 781 individuals who were carriers of pathogenic gene variants that cause familial hypercholesterolemia (ascertained through an affected relative), cholesterol-lowering medication use in at-risk individuals increased from 51 to 81 percent two years after learning genotype status [

        <p>
         What is not clear is whether genetic information for individuals who have no known increased risk prior to genetic testing will lead to change in lifestyle behaviors. In a sample of over 2000 patients who completed genome-wide testing through a direct-to-consumer (DTC) vendor, testing did not result in any short-term change in diet or exercise behavior [

The price of exome sequencing and genome sequencing continues to fall, and the catalog of disease-associated copy number variants or deleterious sequence variants, produced from genome-wide association studies, array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH), and next-generation sequencing (NGS; including exome sequencing and genome sequencing), is rapidly increasing [

         Skeptics argue that, while there are selected examples where specific biomarkers or genetic tests can help guide medical decision-making, more widely implemented profiling remains challenging in clinical practice. Factors cited to support this viewpoint include the high costs of genetic testing (which may decline), the lack of reliable predictive biomarkers for most conditions, the lack of clear therapeutic alternatives (based on genetic differences) for many conditions, and the lack of knowledge and expertise among most clinicians regarding genetics, risk prediction, and genetic counseling [
         <a href="#rid8">

         Additional barriers to implementation apply to cancer therapy. These issues are discussed in more detail below. (See

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite obstacles, there is strong support for the development of personal genomics among health care policy makers and research funding agencies [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6

         <a href="#rid11">
          11

         The concept of a biomarker test to detect cancer in asymptomatic individuals is especially appealing because it could lead to early diagnosis; earlier detection may also reduce the need to use more aggressive, more toxic, more costly therapy; and potentially result in a greater number of individuals being cured of their disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         CancerSEEK is a multi-analyte blood test that detects common, cancer-associated DNA variants using a panel of 61 amplicons for cancer "driver" mutations (for which only one abnormal copy would be sufficient to cause cancer) as well as 41 protein biomarkers associated with common cancers [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. In a series of 1005 individuals already known to have nonmetastatic cancer of one of eight common cancer types (ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, colon/rectum, lung, or breast), the median sensitivity for detecting cancer was 70 percent. Among individual tumor types, sensitivity was highest for ovarian cancer (98 percent) and lowest for breast cancer (33 percent). Sensitivity increased with more advanced-stage cancers (43 percent for stage I, 73 percent for stage II, and 78 percent for stage III). Specificity was over 99 percent; only 7 of 812 healthy individuals without known cancer tested positive, and it is possible that these individuals had early cancer that was not clinically detectable. The test was also able to determine the type of cancer in the majority of individuals (median, 63 percent). Limitations of the study included the presence of more advanced cancers in case patients than would be expected in the general population, and an absence of known chronic inflammatory conditions in the controls that might lead to more false positive tests. Additional validation is needed before this test is incorporated into clinical practice.

The median progression-free survival was similar between the two groups (2.3 versus 2.0 months). One conclusion from this study was that further research into personalized medicine is needed. Additional research may focus on combining molecularly targeted agents to overcome resistance or incorporating information about tumor evolution using circulating tumor DNA.

         The earliest clinical implementations of genetic profiling have been in the area of pharmacogenetics, also referred to as pharmacogenomics. Pharmacogenetics is the study of variability in drug response due to genetic factors and includes the prediction of a patient's response to a specific therapy and susceptibility to toxicity and adverse events. Pharmacogenetic data may inform both the selection of a particular treatment and the individualized dose and dosing schedule for that treatment. This subject is described in more detail separately.

         Drug labels for numerous drugs include information regarding pharmacogenetic biomarkers that can be tested. Though most notably impacting dosing of medications used to treat hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, pharmacogenetic markers are also available for medications used in the treatment of infectious, cardiac, rheumatologic, and pulmonary diseases [

         With the recognition that a sufficient quantity of fetal DNA is present in the maternal circulation for clinical testing, it is becoming increasingly easier and safer to accurately assess the structural integrity and sequence variation of fetal genes.

         The availability and scope of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing services is evolving, and various legislative and regulatory bodies are actively developing policies regarding these services. Some companies are seeking approval for testing without physician involvement, whereas others are obtaining a physician order based on an online survey. Personal genome testing has been available to the general public in the United Kingdom and Canada since late 2014 [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Although DTC testing is marketed directly to patients and performed without an ordering physician, results are typically shared with the health care team and/or genetic counselors [
         <a href="#rid29">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In the Impact of Personal Genomics Study survey, 54 of 961 respondents (5.6 percent) who had recently undergone DTC testing reported either starting a new medication or changing a medication they were already taking based on the results of DTC tests. Most of these patients (83.3 percent) reported discussing the change with a health care provider. Importantly, the vast majority of respondents (875 people, 91.2 percent) had at least one pharmacogenetic variant indicated on their report, and there was a direct association between the number of positive pharmacogenetic tests received and the likelihood of a change in medication prescription (1.57-fold increase in the odds of a change for each positive test result, 95% CI 1.17-2.11) [

          FDA ruling
         </strong>
         – In late 2013, the FDA requested that the company discontinue marketing of their health-related personal genome service (PGS; ie, disease-risk prediction) in the United States because the clinical validity of the service had not been demonstrated by the company [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. The FDA considered the PGS kit to be a device and hence under their regulatory purview. The company suspended its clinical services in the United States but continued to provide services related to raw genetic data, information about carrier status, and ancestry testing, as well as testing services in the United Kingdom.

         <strong>
          FDA authorization for carrier states
         </strong>
         – In February 2015, the FDA authorized for marketing DTC carrier testing by 23andMe in the United States for Bloom syndrome (an autosomal recessive disorder) [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. Simultaneously, the FDA classified all carrier-screening tests as class II medical devices, subject to general controls such as misbranding. The FDA subsequently exempted these tests from premarket review. With these regulatory changes, 23andMe and several other companies have begun offering DTC carrier screening for a variety of conditions. As an example, in early 2017, 23andMe began providing DTC testing for increased risk of a predetermined set of 10 conditions that include celiac disease, factor XI deficiency, G6PD deficiency, and late-onset Alzheimer disease; results of this testing might result in lifestyle modifications and/or discussions with a clinician [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. It should be noted that these tests improve patient access to information about carrier status, but it is unclear how well the results will be used, particularly in the absence of pre- or post-test genetic counseling. Results are returned to patients using reporting formats approved by the FDA.

         – Given the heterogeneity among DTC vendors in the genetic variants tested and the predictive models used to develop risk estimates, questions have been raised regarding the reliability and reproducibility of these services. The accuracy of identifying pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants is one concern; the accuracy of using the resulting information to predict the risk of disease is a separate concern of equal or greater importance.

         ]. DNA from five individuals was sent to each company for testing, and risk predictions for 13 diseases were compared. Genotype calls (ie, the genotypes reported at each locus based on single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNP] analysis) were in excellent agreement (&gt;99 percent concordance). In contrast, risk prediction for diseases was discordant in about one-third of cases. Disease risk predictions from the two companies

         more than one-half of the time for seven conditions (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, heart disease, Crohn disease, type 2 diabetes); risk predictions were concordant in four conditions. Conditions demonstrating strong agreement were those in which an identical SNP with a very strong genetic effect was tested by both companies (for example, the SNP for celiac disease that confers a sevenfold increase in risk). SNPs with such strong effects are rarely observed in common complex diseases.

The variability in risk prediction was influenced by the SNPs that were genotyped for each condition and the reference population used [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45

          46

         ]. This study also pointed out the need for risk data that is based upon client ethnicity, as the majority of genome-wide association studies have focused on populations with European ancestry, with uncertain applications to other ethnicities, including people with ancestry from Asia, Africa, and other continents [

         – In most cases, data about genetic risk have been obtained from testing individuals with a known personal or family history of disease.

          Implications for management
         </strong>
         – Results from genetic testing, both typical and atypical, may have major implications for management. In their 2013 notification to the 23andMe company regarding screening for medical risk variants, the US FDA expressed concerns regarding the potential misuse of reported genetic information leading to inappropriate management. As an example, patients might make treatment decisions regarding prophylactic mastectomy, chemoprevention, or aggressive surveillance based on false-positive or false-negative
         <em>
          BRCA1
         </em>
         genotypes. An editorialist suggested that the FDA may not have intervened if the genome service had been available only to an ordering physician, rather than marketed directly to consumers [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. The implications of results should be discussed with a clinical geneticist, genetic counselor, or clinician with expertise in the condition in question, but as the amount of DTC testing increases, resources to provide such counseling may become strained.

         To the extent that results of DTC testing promote healthy lifestyle and health maintenance interventions such as exercise, healthy diet, and recommended screenings (eg, cancer screening, risk assessment for cardiovascular disease), they may be likely to be of value to the individual. For disorders in which other interventions may be appropriate (eg, medication, surgery), the value of speaking with a clinical geneticist, genetic counselor, or expert clinician should be emphasized regardless of the results of DTC testing. These experts may help with interpretation of results, additional testing not provided in the DTC product, and interventions most likely to be helpful. (See

         ]. These inconsistencies are largely due to differences in the risk-estimation models used and in the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) content of the array platforms. Standardization of these models and the SNP content will help improve this problem. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is developing policies regarding standardization and oversight of these tests, and policies have been discussed in Australia and the United Kingdom; some have advocated for international certification of quality standards [

         – Discrimination based on the results of genetic testing or even on the basis of having obtained a test is a potential concern (eg, denial of insurance coverage or other services). Many jurisdictions have tried to put protections in place, such as the Genetic Insurance Non-discrimination Act (GINA) in the United States, which provides some protections (eg, for health insurance, but not for life insurance).

         Genome sequencing will likely identify a variety of "risk" alleles in all individuals. With the limited available understanding of risk concepts or penetrance of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants and risk alleles, the identification of risk alleles or carrier status for autosomal recessive disorders could inappropriately influence reproductive decisions.

          Definition
         </strong>
         – Personalized medicine (also called precision medicine) involves the use of an individual's genetic profile to guide decisions made with regards to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. Other genetics terminology is presented separately. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Terminology'

         <strong>
          Rationale
         </strong>
         – Potential benefits of personalized medicine include customized treatment plans that can include targeted pharmacotherapy to improve drug response and reduce toxicity and expense, targeted recommendations for lifestyle modifications and other disease-prevention strategies, and enhanced patient satisfaction with health care. Genetic information can enhance patient compliance with behavior-modification recommendations. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Drug dosing
         </strong>
         – The earliest implementation of genetic profiling into clinical practice has been in the area of pharmacogenetic testing. Pharmacogenetic biomarkers are available for over 70 drugs; many of these markers involve polymorphisms in cytochrome drug metabolizing activity. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          DTC testing
         </strong>
         – The use of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing services is evolving, and various legislative and regulatory bodies are actively developing policies regarding these services. Genetic testing for carrier status is considered a class II medical device and does not require premarket approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Clinicians and patients should be aware of the concerns that have been raised about the accuracy, interpretation, and value of DTC genetic testing. Answers to frequently asked questions about DTC testing are provided by the National Human Genome Research Institute (

          Other "omics" initiatives
         </strong>
         – Analyses based upon gene expression profiling, proteomics, metabolomics, or lipidomics may enhance the predictive value of testing used for personalized medicine. Gene expression profiling is used for some tumors, reflecting cellular, genetic, and environmental factors. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Challenges to implementation
         </strong>
         – Multiple issues will need to be addressed to successfully implement personalized medicine. Areas of concern include clinicians' limited knowledge base of genetics and risk interpretation if not trained in genetics; lack of infrastructure to store and confidentially retrieve an individual's genetic data; timing of testing; issues related to which clinicians are responsible for ordering, transmitting, and maintaining information; test standardization and quality; reimbursement; and overcoming public misperceptions related to genetic data.
