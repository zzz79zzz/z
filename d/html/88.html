Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) evaluations account for approximately 10 to 20 percent of all these cases. The approaches to chest pain patients in general or those who are likely to have an ACS are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/288.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult with chest pain in the emergency department"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/184.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the emergency department"</a>.)</p><p>This group of patients is among the most challenging in acute care medicine in part because of the frequency of the clinical problem. Challenges, which at times compete with one another, include the need to rapidly diagnose ACS so that appropriate interventions can be initiated, the pressure to discharge patients appropriately from busy EDs, and the tendency to overinvestigate chest pain patients, which leads to increased resource utilization.</p><p>Two primary goals of the early evaluation of patients with chest pain suggestive of myocardial ischemia are to rapidly confirm the diagnosis of an ACS if possible (a "rule-in") or exclude the diagnosis. Diagnosing ACS in a timely manner is a high priority, as early intervention in patients with ACS has been shown to lead to better outcomes. Conversely, for patients with a low to intermediate risk of an ACS, it is important that unnecessary time and resources not be spent overpursuing the diagnosis.</p><p>This topic discusses the evaluation of patients with chest pain who are at low or intermediate risk for ACS as assessed by the results of the initial history (including age and risk factors), physical exam, and electrocardiogram (ECG). The use of troponin testing, risk assessment, and care pathways is presented. A major goal of the topic is to help clinicians identify patients who are candidates for early discharge from the ED.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DEFINITION OF ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The term "ACS" is applied to patients in whom there is evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction. There are three types of ACS: ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI), and unstable angina (UA). The first two are characterized by a typical rise and/or fall in serum troponin [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. UA is characterized by new or worsening myocardial ischemia without elevated biomarkers and is often a clinical diagnosis based on history, dynamic ECG changes, or inducible ischemia on stress testing. UA accounts for a smaller proportion of ACS now that there is widespread use of highly sensitive troponin, which can detect very small amounts of myocardial injury. Establishing whether a patient has ACS requires integration of information obtained from a careful patient interview and examination, as well as from serial evaluation of the ECG, troponin levels, and occasionally provocative testing results. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/52.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction", section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The primary focus in the very early evaluation (generally within the first 15 minutes after presentation) of patients with possible ACS is to reasonably confirm or exclude in an expeditious manner ACS as the cause for the patient's symptoms  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef132448" href="/z/d/graphic/132448.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). In this early time period, reasonable confirmation of ACS is generally secured by the finding of diagnostic ECG changes. ACS is reasonably excluded when the probability of ACS is very low (generally considered below a 1 to 2 percent threshold [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]). (See <a class="local">'Risk assessment'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients who have or are likely to have an ACS, appropriate management strategies should be initiated  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef56813" href="/z/d/graphic/56813.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/184.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the emergency department", section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, other life-threatening illnesses should be rapidly identified that would remove the patient from a low- to medium-risk ACS category. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/288.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult with chest pain in the emergency department"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Prehospital</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with symptoms of possible ACS (eg, chest discomfort with or without radiation, shortness of breath, weakness, diaphoresis, nausea, or light headedness) should generally be instructed to call their emergency telephone number, be evaluated by emergency medical services, and be brought to the hospital by ambulance. Emergency medical service evaluation and transport result in more rapid and focused evaluation by streamlining the triage process. Prehospital evaluation should include obtaining a prehospital 12-lead ECG and continuous ECG monitoring.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Immediate in-hospital evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>On hospital arrival, patients with symptoms that raise the possibility of myocardial ischemia should have the following performed (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/184.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the emergency department"</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Continuous ECG monitoring.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An initial 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes of arrival (even if one has been performed in an ambulance, unless that ECG showed ST-segment elevation) in patients ≥25 years of age with chest pain, or age ≥50 years with chest pain or other symptoms that could represent myocardial ischemia like shortness of breath, altered mental status, upper extremity pain, syncope, or generalized weakness. Very elderly (≥80 years of age) patients with abdominal pain or nausea/vomiting should have an immediate 12-lead ECG as well [<a href="#rid2">2,5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">It is recommended that the ECG be repeated at 20- to 30-minute intervals for any patient with ongoing pain in whom a suspicion of ACS continues. Patients whose ECGs are diagnostic for or strongly suggestive of either STEMI or NSTEMI should be managed for those diagnoses. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/66.html" rel="external">"Overview of the acute management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/68.html" rel="external">"Overview of the acute management of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A brief history and physical examination to screen for signs or symptoms of cardiopulmonary distress. The history should include questions that evaluate whether the chest pain is likely to represent myocardial ischemia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1472.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with suspected angina pectoris"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">As will be discussed below, risk scores also use patient age and coronary artery disease risk factors. (See <a class="local">'Risk scores'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>At a minimum, the following laboratory tests should be ordered as soon as possible in patients with possible ACS: high sensitivity cardiac troponin (where available), serum electrolytes, serum creatinine, and a complete blood count. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/288.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult with chest pain in the emergency department", section on 'Laboratory studies'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">While patients who are assessed to be at very low risk of an ACS do not need a troponin test, many institutions have protocols that direct nursing staff to order them based on their assessment, which may be prior to physician evaluation. We believe this is a reasonable strategy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The results of the first high sensitivity troponin should be available within 60 minutes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86.html" rel="external">"Troponin testing: Clinical use", section on 'Diagnosis of acute MI'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A chest radiograph is usually performed in patients suspected of having an ACS, since alternative diagnoses such as heart failure, pneumonia, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, or large pericardial effusion may be detected [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H965566338"><span class="h2">Risk assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We attempt to assign patients to low, intermediate, or high risk for ACS category, or definite ACS  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef105869" href="/z/d/graphic/105869.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), based on information obtained from the history, physical examination, ECG, and continuous ECG monitoring  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef132448" href="/z/d/graphic/132448.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) but before the first troponin level is available. Multiple scoring systems have been evaluated. We prefer the History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, and a single sensitive Troponin (HEART) score, which is used in the HEART Pathway (see <a class="local">'Care pathways'</a> below). Using this score, individuals with a score of 0 to 3 are considered low risk. There is an element of subjectivity in the HEART score, so internal discussions to improve consistency of use are suggested [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Low-risk patients generally have none of the risk factors found in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef105869" href="/z/d/graphic/105869.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Specifically, low-risk patients cannot have a history of coronary artery disease or have ST-segment elevation, significant ST-segment depression, or new T wave inversion.</p><p>We manage patients as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the patient's likelihood of ACS is very low (&lt;1 to 2 percent) based on the history, physical examination, and initial ECG, additional testing for ACS is not likely to be beneficial.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>All other patients with possible (but not definite) ACS should be further risk stratified by the measurement of serum troponin, if not already ordered. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86.html" rel="external">"Troponin testing: Clinical use"</a> and <a class="local">'Troponin testing'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">These patients should be monitored with continuous ECG rhythm monitoring at least until return of the first troponin value. Any changes in clinical condition (eg, patient complaints or change in vital signs) should prompt reassessment. Serial ECGs should be performed on patients with continuous pain or changes in symptoms to detect dynamic changes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients felt to have definite ACS or who are at high risk should be managed accordingly. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/68.html" rel="external">"Overview of the acute management of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/66.html" rel="external">"Overview of the acute management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/184.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the emergency department"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>At some lower threshold of pretest probability, the clinician is more likely to cause harm by further testing. It has been suggested that an acceptable lower limit of pretest probability for ACS, above which further testing should be done, is 1 to 2 percent [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. We believe patients below this threshold are very low risk and are unlikely to benefit from additional testing for an ACS. All other patients should receive further testing and risk stratification.</p><p>Providers commonly identify very low-risk patients using an experienced clinician's unstructured clinical estimate. In an evaluation of this method, approximately 25 percent of chest pain patients were classified as very low risk (&lt;2 percent risk), and these patients experienced an event rate of 0.7 percent (95% CI 0-2.4) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. With the introduction of clinical decision aids, many clinicians and health systems have moved toward more objective classification systems, typically incorporating serum troponin measurements. (See <a class="local">'Troponin testing'</a> below.)</p><p>When formulating the clinician's pretest (before the troponin) probability, it is important to avoid eliminating the possibility of an ACS even when an alternative diagnosis is possible. In patients being evaluated for chest pain, it has been shown that those with a "clear-cut" alternative noncardiac diagnosis still have a 4 percent rate of ACS at 30 days [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Similarly, patients with a "clear-cut" alternative noncardiac diagnosis and a Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score of 0 had a 2.9 percent rate of ACS at 30 days [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. As an example, among patients with ACS, a common misdiagnosis is gastroesophageal reflux disease. In two different datasets, it has been shown that patients with ACS commonly describe their pain as burning [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. A gastrointestinal etiology should be assigned only after the diagnosis of a cardiac emergency has been excluded. Further, a trial of antacids or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9706" href="/z/d/drug information/9706.html" rel="external">nitroglycerin</a> should not be used as a reliable method to determine whether pain is of gastrointestinal or cardiac origin.</p><p>The diagnosis of ACS is more likely to be missed in certain populations. In one study conducted in an American emergency department, patients with ACS who were inappropriately discharged included females &lt;55 years old, Black Americans, those with dyspnea as the primary complaint, and patients with a normal ECG [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In addition, older adults often present with atypical histories. We recommend that clinicians incorporate all data elements when forming an unstructured estimate of ACS probability, avoid overreliance on the presence of an alternative diagnosis, and use caution when defining the very low-risk patient population.</p><p>While we have identified specific times in this process when evaluation must take place rapidly, evaluation is a continuous process, and new information at any time point can alter a patient's risk category. For example, worsening of symptoms, arrhythmias, or new ECG changes on continuous monitoring can make the possibility of an ACS more likely.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4250599526"><span class="h1">TROPONIN TESTING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In those patients for whom the diagnosis of ACS remains a possibility after rapid evaluation of the history, physical examination, and 12-lead ECG (see <a class="local">'Risk assessment'</a> above), a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) should be obtained as soon as possible. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86.html" rel="external">"Troponin testing: Clinical use", section on 'Diagnosis of acute MI'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1401014622"><span class="h2">Background</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Compared with a standard troponin assay, hs-cTn leads to the diagnosis of acute MI in a modest additional number of chest pain patients and may do so earlier in the patients' emergency department (ED) stay [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. This occurs because hs-cTn detects biochemical evidence of myocardial injury at lower concentrations, and hs-cTn assays allow for discrimination of small changes in concentration even within the normal reference range. However, MI is not ruled in unless there is both a rising and/or falling pattern of values and one value above the upper reference limit (URL) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/52.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction", section on 'Definitions'</a>). However, the issue of whether this improves long-term cardiovascular outcomes is debated [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. In addition, very low hs-cTn values identify patients at low risk of MI in the ED.</p><p>With hs-cTn, serial values &lt;99<sup>th</sup> percentile of the URL make the diagnosis of acute MI quite unlikely, but the value does not exclude the possibility of unstable angina [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. The use of sex-dependent 99<sup>th</sup> percentile URL is advocated by the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction and will be different depending on the assay used. A value of &lt;5 ng/L with the Abbott hs-cTnI assay or with the Roche hs-cTnT assay is capable of identifying patients at extremely low risk of acute MI and whose long-term prognosis is good [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>].</p><p>The negative predictive value of a very low value of a high-sensitivity assay (Abbott cardiac troponin I assay) at presentation to the hospital was evaluated in the High-STEACS prospective cohort (derivation) study of 4870 patients with suspected ACS [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. With this assay, the limitation of detection was 1.2 ng/L, and a URL (99<sup>th</sup> percentile) was 34 ng/L in males and 16 ng/L in females. The primary outcome was index MI, or subsequent MI or cardiac death at 30 days. A troponin concentration &lt;5 ng/L had a negative predictive value of 99.6 percent. The effectiveness of combining this test with clinical information for the purpose of selecting patients for early discharge remains to be determined. The one group that had a less robust negative predictive value (NPV) included individuals who presented in two hours or less from the onset of symptoms. Caution is necessary with these early rapid approaches for early presenting patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1413819618"><span class="h2">Elevated first troponin</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If the first troponin returns clearly elevated in a patient with clinical findings consistent with ACS, the management for NSTEMI likely begins. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/68.html" rel="external">"Overview of the acute management of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes"</a>.)</p><p>However, this paradigm may be changing with the routine use of increasingly sensitive troponin assays. Data from outside the United States suggest that 11 to 15 percent of patients will be classified as having NSTEMI based on that initial hs-cTn result, of whom 68 to 79 percent will ultimately be adjudicated as having NSTEMI [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. As these hs-cTn assays are applied to broader patient populations with concomitant medical conditions such as sepsis and renal failure, this positive predictive value is likely to be reduced. This fact needs to be considered by clinicians.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2546795136"><span class="h2">Normal first troponin</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If the troponin value is less than the upper reference limit, further evaluation is directed by the clinical presentation and risk factors.

However, even those who endorse the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines concur with the need for caution in those who present early after the onset of symptoms [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>]. The sensitivity of this approach of 99 percent is what ED physicians state that they need [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. The prognosis during follow-up suggests that the risk of patients who might be discharged using such a strategy is low. In fact, these values are in the range where the frequency of a positive stress test is also low [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. This strategy, using a single value below the limit of detection, is possible in most regions that use hs-cTn but is not presently validated for application in the United States (for the hs-cTnT assay) because the lowest value that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will permit to be reported in the United States is a higher concentration (6 ng/L) than the limit of detection (3 ng/L for one piece of equipment and 5 ng/L for another). An analysis confirms that the use of a value of 6 ng/L provides slightly less robust information [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Other approaches using higher cut-offs are less well validated [<a href="#rid19">19,30,31</a>]. However, with multiple newer assays on the horizon, the likelihood of this becoming a viable option with many assays is substantial. The higher the value used, the greater percentage of the population that can be included with such an approach.</p><p>The ESC guidelines advocate for a one-hour rule-out, which includes a three-hour troponin determination for patients indeterminate at one hour, and clinical trials suggest this may work reasonably well [<a href="#rid32">32,33</a>]. However, these approaches have used very small changes in values to make decisions. Those small changes in values have been criticized as being outside of the ability of the assays to measure [<a href="#rid32">32,34</a>]. Data substantiate this concern, suggesting that repeating values will change the designation of a given patient 25 percent of the time [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. In addition, the validation of the one-hour approach has been criticized for lacking enough patients who present within two hours of the onset of symptoms [<a href="#rid25">25,30</a>]. However, the majority of the data indicate that in most patients, a rule-out diagnosis can be accomplished in two to three hours. This is facilitated by the fact that most patients do not arrive early (within two hours of the onset of symptoms). Thus, any patient who is &gt;3 to 6 hours after the onset of symptoms (assuming no recurrences) and who has a normal cTn value (either hs-cTn or contemporary cTn) can be considered to have ruled out for acute MI [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. With hs-cTn assays, one- to three-hour rule-outs using assay specific change criteria are usually adequate.

For those with clear non-MI reasons for elevation, values consistent with prior values, no upward trend, and a history not concerning for unstable angina, attention should be turned to addressing the underlying condition if possible. If the underlying condition is not immediately life threatening, close outpatient follow-up is reasonable. For those not meeting those criteria, management in an observation or inpatient unit for serial troponin measurement and consideration of specialty consultation and/or imaging are prudent. Additional data are needed to define the optimal approach for these patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3674210727"><span class="h2">Late presenters</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who present 12 hours or more after the onset of symptoms can be diagnostically challenging. If the first hs-cTn is elevated in these patients, clinicians should be careful in their interpretation of changes or deltas between first and second values. Patients with adjudicated NSTEMI with less acute presentations, and those with longer ischemic times, are more likely to present near their peak hs-cTn value. Subsequent values may downtrend or stay about the same, providing false reassurance or misleading the clinician away from the diagnosis of NSTEMI, but still leaving the patient with substantial risk for mortality from ACS [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. These patients potentially require additional testing.

The TIMI score (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13466.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>) was derived and validated in patients enrolled in clinical trials with ACS, but has since been validated in patients suspected to have ACS [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. Advantages include simplicity, lack of a need for a nomogram or computer algorithm, and its ability to predict a risk of short-term (30 days) outcome [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. Among the elements of the TIMI risk score, troponin elevation was the most powerful factor. However, even TIMI 0 patients had a significant 2.1 percent incidence of the composite outcome. As such, the TIMI score has limited utility as a tool to determine who can be discharged as very low risk with no further testing. Once ACS has been documented, then the GRACE risk score performs better than the TIMI score [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The HEART score  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef105869" href="/z/d/graphic/105869.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) uses similar components to the TIMI risk score. The HEART score has been widely validated [<a href="#rid23">23,41,42</a>]. However, validation studies have shown the need to add a three-hour troponin to achieve acceptable sensitivity [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. A score of 0 to 3 identifies a patient at low risk of major adverse cardiovascular events; patients with a score of 4 to 6 have intermediate risk, and those with a score of 7 or greater are high risk. A meta-analysis of 30 studies of the HEART risk score found that a score of 4 or greater had a sensitivity of about 96 percent for the prediction of short-term (39 days or 6 weeks) incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events [<a href="#rid43">43</a>].

Patients with STEMI were excluded. Two assays were studied: hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI, which are the only two presently included in the COMPASS calculator; only hs-cTnT is approved for use in the United States. The algorithm was developed based on samples measured at presentation and once thereafter. A distinction was made between an early second sample (one to two hours) and a later one (&gt;2 hours). The diagnostic and prognostic performance of multiple hs-cTn cutoff combinations were assessed in derivation and validation groups. An interactive risk assessment tool that predicted the risk of MI in the ED and the subsequent 30-day risk of MI or MI/death based on the 15 studies was included in the analysis. In the derivation group, hs-cTnI &lt;6 ng/L and an absolute change of less than 4 ng/L after 45 to 120 minutes resulted in a negative predictive value of 99.5 percent for MI. The associated 30-day risk of MI or death was 0.2 percent. None of the studies included were from the United States, where cTn samples often involve more diverse populations than in many places where the testing is mostly used when the primary issue is evaluation for possible MI. The tool is likely to be helpful for young patients who are being evaluated for possible MI. Prior to recommending wide-spread use of this tool, additional validation is needed, particularly in populations with differing baseline risk.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H348364682"><span class="h2">Care pathways</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If the second troponin value is also normal, we use the HEART score to reestimate risk  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef105869" href="/z/d/graphic/105869.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and the HEART Pathway  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef132448" href="/z/d/graphic/132448.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) to determine the next step in management.</p><p>Most EDs use a care pathway, also called an "accelerated diagnostic pathway," for patients at low to moderate risk of an ACS.

There are many reasonable evaluation strategies, including performing the entire evaluation and stress imaging during the index encounter. We recommend a structured evaluation with the HEART Pathway and expedited discharge of patients stratified as low risk.
