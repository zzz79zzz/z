         Castleman disease (CD, angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) describes a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative disorders that share common histopathologic features.
        </p>
        <p>
         CD is classified into at least three distinct disorders based on the number of regions of enlarged lymph nodes with characteristic histopathologic features and the presence/absence of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8, also called Kaposi sarcoma associated herpesvirus [KSHV]) infection:

         Unicentric CD (UCD) involves one or more enlarged lymph node(s) in a single region of the body that demonstrates CD histopathologic features that lie along a spectrum with hyaline vascular histopathologic subtype on one end, plasmacytic histopathologic subtype on the other, and a "mixed" subtype in the middle. A subset of patients have systemic symptoms.

         Multicentric CD (MCD) involves multiple regions of lymphadenopathy that demonstrate CD histopathologic features that lie along a spectrum with hypervascular histopathologic subtype on one end, plasmacytic histopathologic subtype on the other, and a "mixed" subtype in the middle. These patients also have systemic inflammatory symptoms with generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, and organ dysfunction due to excessive pro-inflammatory hypercytokinemia, often including interleukin (IL)-6. MCD is further subclassified according to the presence of HHV-8:

         HHV-8-associated MCD – Approximately half of MCD cases are caused by HHV-8 infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive or otherwise immunocompromised individuals, and these cases are referred to as HHV-8-associated MCD.
        </p>
        <p>

         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         HHV-8-negative/idiopathic MCD (iMCD) – Approximately half of patients with MCD are HHV-8 negative. These cases have nearly identical clinical and histopathologic features as HHV-8-associated MCD, but the etiology is unknown. These cases are referred to as HHV-8-negative MCD, idiopathic MCD, or iMCD.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         It is essential that all cases of CD are subdivided into UCD, HHV-8-associated MCD, or iMCD at the time of diagnosis as all three subtypes have varying clinical features, treatments, and outcomes. CD is also associated with a number of malignancies, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, skin changes).

         This topic review will discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical and pathologic features, diagnosis, and treatment of UCD. HHV-8-negative/idiopathic MCD, HHV-8-associated MCD, a review of diseases associated with HHV-8 infection, and the virology of HHV-8 are presented separately.

         The pathogenesis of UCD is poorly understood. The characteristic histopathologic features of lymph nodes from patients with Castleman disease (CD) are believed to either be exaggerations of the types of reactive changes that can be seen in response to normal antigenic stimuli or representative of a low-grade neoplastic process. These features include atrophic and hyperplastic germinal centers, follicular dendritic cell (FDC) prominence, the accumulation of immunoblasts and plasma cells, and increased vascularity. Similar histologic changes are seen in other disorders associated with chronic immune activation, including autoimmune diseases, lymphomas, various congenital immunodeficiency states, and viral infections.

         Viral, autoimmune, and neoplastic processes have all been proposed as possible etiologies underlying UCD. Unlike human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8)-associated multicentric CD, UCD is
         <strong>
          not

         associated with HHV-8 infection or HIV infection.
        </p>
        <p>
         A subset of UCD cases may be the result of somatic mutations in monoclonal cell populations that act through neoplastic mechanisms. The following findings suggest a neoplastic mechanism driving UCD pathogenesis:

         Monoclonality was identified in lymph node tissue from 19 of 25 UCD cases using conventional and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods, but in 0 of 20 cases of lymphoid hyperplasia [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Since the T cells and B cells were polyclonal, the monoclonal cell populations were likely stromal cells.

         In another study, UCD lymph nodes were found to have increased numbers of small follicles with abnormally low proliferation by Ki67 staining, which is also observed in follicular lymphoma [

         Cytogenetic abnormalities have been identified in several cases of UCD, many of which are believed to occur in stromal cell populations. These include modifications in chromosome segment 12q13–15, which is commonly found in mesenchymal tumors and a clonal cytogenetic anomaly (t(1;22)(p22;q13)) hypothesized to affect megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1) gene, which is implicated in acute megakaryocytic leukemia, and endothelial cell growth factor 1 (ECGF1) gene, which promotes angiogenesis and prevents cellular apoptosis [

         In another study, somatic mutations in the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRb) gene were found in 7 of 41 UCD samples (17 percent, all hyaline-vascular variant) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. These mutations were confined to the non-hematopoietic stromal cells in UCD.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Familial cases of UCD have been rarely reported, though genomic sequencing has not been performed to identify inherited mutations [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         While studies evaluating the role of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in UCD have had mixed results, EBV is unlikely to be the primary driver of UCD given the high prevalence of EBV infection and rarity of UCD. A potential role for EBV in the pathogenesis of UCD was suggested when lymph nodes from one cohort of 18 patients with UCD were all found to be EBV-positive by PCR [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]; however, there were no control samples and this was not reproduced in a separate cohort [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. In a separate study, the lack of T-bet expression by UCD lymph node T and B cells suggested that UCD is not virally driven, as T-bet is expressed by cells in the context of high interferon gamma during intracellular pathogen infection [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Finally, a study involving virome capture sequencing of lymph node tissue from 12 UCD patients detected evidence of EBV sequences in 7 cases, but the clinical relevance is unclear given that there were significantly fewer EBV-positive cells in UCD compared to EBV-driven lymphoproliferative disorders [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Of note, no other viral associations were detected.

         The precise cell type within the lymph node responsible for driving UCD pathogenesis and producing cytokines has also not been identified [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Candidate cells include FDCs, germinal center B cells, and interfollicular plasma cells [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Several findings suggest that stromal cells, specifically FDCs, play a key role in the pathogenesis of UCD. Stromal cell overgrowth, FDC prominence, and FDC dysplasia are common in UCD [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ], and several studies have identified monoclonal stromal cells in UCD [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3,5,6
         </a>
         ]. FDCs are essential for normal germinal center formation, directing lymphocytes into appropriate regions within the lymph node, and promoting B cell survival. The dysmorphic germinal centers in UCD may reflect FDC dysfunction [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Further support comes from case studies that have described patients who developed FDC sarcoma concurrently with UCD and in the same region of lymph nodes where a UCD lymph node was resected [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19

         ].

         Though the etiology of the hypercytokinemia is unknown, a portion of UCD, HHV-8-associated multicentric CD (MCD), and HHV-8-negative MCD are linked to excessive release of interleukin (IL)-6 or related polypeptides [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Early studies correlated local production of IL-6 to the systemic manifestations seen in a minority of patients with UCD [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16
         </a>
         ], since lymph node excision resulted in relief of symptoms along with a decrease in serum IL-6 levels [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,21
         </a>
         ]. However, levels of IL-6 and other inflammatory mediators have not been systematically studied in a large number of UCD cases.
        </p>
        <p>
         An increased prevalence of an IL-6 receptor single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which is associated with increased soluble IL-6 receptor levels, was identified in a cohort of UCD and HHV-8-negative MCD compared with healthy controls [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. The significance of this SNP is unclear since it is present in 33 percent of healthy individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
         Studies in UCD have also reported increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in interfollicular areas of lymph nodes and increased serum VEGF levels [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23,24
         </a>
         ]. Increased VEGF expression is believed to be induced by IL-6 and may be responsible for the increased angiogenesis seen in UCD tissue. Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has also been reported in UCD [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ].

         In the United States (US), the annual incidence of Castleman disease (CD) has been estimated to range from 6500 to 7700 in a 2014 study to approximately 2000 in a 2022 study that utilized ICD-10 codes in insurance claims data [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25,26
         </a>
         ]. In the 2014 study, approximately 75 percent were estimated to be unicentric CD and the remaining 25 percent were estimated to be split between HHV-8-associated MCD or HHV-8-negative/idiopathic MCD (iMCD). The 2022 study estimated that about 40 percent of incident CD cases are UCD.
        </p>
        <p>
         In Japan, the incidence appears to be similar to that seen in the US; however, in contrast with data from other countries and for unclear reasons, MCD appears to be more common than UCD, and HHV-8-associated MCD is rare [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,28
         </a>
         ]. There is less published information regarding the incidence in other areas, but communication among the international community of CD physicians suggests no clear associations with particular ethnicities. Now that there is a unique ICD-10 code being used internationally for CD (D47.Z2), more accurate estimations of epidemiology are expected.
        </p>
        <p>
         While UCD can occur at any age, it is generally a disease of younger people. The median age at presentation is approximately 30 to 35 years with cases reported in people as young as 1 year and as old as over 60 years [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29-31
         </a>
         ]. There is a slightly increased incidence of UCD in women than men [

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Life expectancy is usually not changed following the diagnosis of UCD. However, patients with UCD are at increased risk of developing paraneoplastic pemphigus, follicular dendritic cell sarcoma, and lymphomas, which can be fatal. CD is also associated with autoimmune diseases including autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia, and acquired factor VIII deficiency. Unlike HHV-8-associated multicentric CD, UCD is

         Patients with UCD are commonly asymptomatic and come to clinical attention when an enlarged lymph node is noted on physical examination or imaging studies [

         ]. UCD usually affects just one lymph node. If more than one lymph node is enlarged, those lymph nodes, by definition, must be confined to a single lymph node region (eg, left cervical chain) to be considered to represent UCD. If the lymphadenopathy occurs in multiple regions of the body, then diagnostic criteria for human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8)-negative multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) should be evaluated [

         While these systemic symptoms may be experienced by any patient with unresected UCD regardless of histopathologic subtype, they are more commonly seen in patients with the plasmacytic histopathologic subtype of UCD. In contrast, signs and symptoms related to the hyaline vascular histopathologic subtype are typically due to impingement and compression of neighboring structures (eg, airway, vessels) by the enlarging mass.

         UCD can present in any lymph node in the body, and the size of the enlarged lymph node is typically greater than the enlarged lymph nodes seen in HHV-8-associated MCD or HHV-8-negative/idiopathic MCD. The distribution of disease differs between case series. In one review of 278 cases, the median lymph node size was 5.5 cm, with the most common sites of disease being the chest (24 percent), neck (20 percent), abdomen (18 percent), and retroperitoneum (14 percent) [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. Less common sites included the axilla, groin, and pelvis. A separate large series found that the most common sites for UCD were abdomen (40 percent), neck (23 percent), mediastinum (16 percent), inguinal (9 percent), lung hilum (7 percent), and axilla (7 percent) [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. UCD lesions are typically confined to lymph node tissue, however, there are rare, reported cases of UCD lesions in solid organs. These are most frequently seen in the parotid gland, where the disease may originate in intraparotid lymph nodes.

         UCD is characterized by expansions of morphologically benign lymphocytes that usually leave the structure of the underlying lymph node at least partially intact. B cells and plasma cells are polyclonal and T cells show no evidence of an aberrant immunophenotype.

         Histopathology is best conceptualized as a spectrum. While three histopathologic subtypes are recognized for UCD, the clinical relevance of the specific subtypes is unknown, distinctions between the histopathologic features are not always clear, and there is very poor inter-pathologist consistency when determining histopathologic subtype [

         Patients with UCD are commonly asymptomatic and are brought to clinical attention when an enlarged lymph node is noted on physical examination or imaging studies. UCD should be suspected in the setting of a single persistently enlarged lymph node associated with moderate to intense post-contrast enhancement on computed tomography (CT). In such cases, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) should be considered to establish that the disease is limited to a single site with a relatively lower standardized uptake value (SUV) in other nodes. SUV of greater than 10 should raise concerns about lymphoma rather than UCD. Histopathologic review of an excisional biopsy of the enlarged lymph node is necessary to diagnose UCD.
        </p>
        <p>
         The biopsy should demonstrate the histopathologic features described above. Immunohistochemistry for LANA-1 of lymph node tissue to detect HHV-8 should be performed on all patients believed to have any form of Castleman disease (CD). UCD can be diagnosed if all of the following requirements are met:

         The differential diagnosis of UCD includes other disorders that can present with an enlarged lymph node and/or systemic symptoms. As a general rule, it is unusual for other causes of reactive lymphadenopathy to present with enlargement of a solitary lymph node, or to result in lymph node enlargement to sizes greater than 2 to 3 cm, clues that can be helpful when the histologic appearance raises the possibility of UCD.

        <p>
         The role of systemic glucocorticoids and radiation therapy (RT) is limited. Systemic glucocorticoids can provide symptomatic relief but do not predictably reduce UCD lymph node size. RT doses of approximately 30 to 45 Gy have been utilized with high response rates [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46,50,51
         </a>
         ]. Importantly, radiation-induced fibrosis may make subsequent surgical intervention more difficult, limiting its use in general practice. RT is also associated with potential long-term sequelae, especially when used in pediatric and younger adult populations.

        <p>
         Other interventions used for HHV-8-negative/idiopathic MCD (eg, cytotoxic immunodepletion) can also be considered for treatment of unresectable UCD or UCD with systemic symptoms. (See

         After completion of the initially planned treatment (usually complete surgical resection), patients should be evaluated to determine the disease response to treatment and should be followed longitudinally for relapse and complications.
        </p>
        <p>
         One month following the completion of planned therapy, the response to treatment should be documented by history, physical examination, and laboratory studies (complete blood count [CBC], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], biochemical profile, albumin, interleukin [IL]-6, C-reactive protein [CRP], serum free light chain assay, and quantitative immunoglobulins). Post-treatment imaging should be performed between one and three months following the completion of planned therapy. The post-treatment imaging study of choice is the positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET/CT) scan, which provides information on the size and activity of residual masses. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast is an acceptable alternative. If a PET/CT is performed, the scan should be done at least two months after surgery to ensure that there is no FDG uptake due to post-operative changes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Following excision, patients are followed annually with CT and laboratory studies, which include CBC, LDH, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes, albumin, IL-6, CRP, serum free light chain assay, and quantitative immunoglobulins. Annual imaging may be discontinued after five years if the patient remains disease free. If there is evidence of disease recurrence, a PET/CT may be warranted to assess for potential development of lymphoma.

         Most patients with UCD will experience long-term disease-free survival following complete resection. Death due to UCD is rare, with a systematic review of 278 cases of UCD reporting a 4 percent mortality over 10 years of follow-up [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. Complete resection of the UCD lymph node, rather than diagnostic/incomplete resection, was the only significant predictor of survival. Among cases with complete resection, cases with visceral lymph node resection had a significantly worse overall survival than peripheral lymph node resection.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are also aware of rare patients with UCD who have persistent inflammatory symptoms even after complete surgical resection. Such patients should undergo further evaluation to exclude alternative diagnoses, including multicentric Castleman disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         UCD may be associated with an increased risk of lymphoma. Of 48 reported cases of UCD in one series, three developed B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), one developed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and two others amyloidosis, despite complete resection [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48-52,57
         </a>
         ]. Another series of eight cases of UCD associated with NHL has been reported [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. The two diagnoses were concurrent in three, with a mean interval of 46 months between the diagnosis of UCD and the subsequent NHL. Also in this series was a case of HL with UCD-like histologic changes in the same lymph node. It is unclear whether these cases represent a true malignant transformation or presence of lymphoma at the initial diagnosis of Castleman disease that was not detected. Initial evaluation of the lymph node biopsy with molecular studies for IgH gene rearrangement is recommended to rule out the latter.

         Paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) is an often-fatal paraneoplastic mucocutaneous blistering disease that is most commonly induced by lymphoproliferative disorders. Approximately 15 percent of instances of paraneoplastic pemphigus are associated with UCD [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>
         ]. Resection of the UCD lymph node may result in improvement of the paraneoplastic pemphigus, but that is not always the case. Aggressive treatment of the paraneoplastic pemphigus and possible development of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (formerly called bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP]) is necessary.

          Classification of Castleman disease
         </strong>
         – Castleman disease (CD) describes a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative disorders that share common histopathologic features and abnormal proliferation of morphologically benign lymphocytes. CD is classified based on the number of lymph node regions with enlarged lymph nodes. Unicentric CD (UCD) involves one or more lymph node(s) in a single region, while multicentric CD (MCD) involves multiple lymph node sites and is subclassified into human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8)-associated MCD and HHV-8-negative/idiopathic MCD.

         <strong>
          Clinical presentation
         </strong>
         – UCD is most often an isolated lymphoproliferative disorder of children and young adults. Patients are commonly asymptomatic and are brought to clinical attention when an enlarged lymph node is noted on physical examination or imaging studies. Most lesions are in the mediastinum, but UCD can present in any lymph node location. Laboratory and clinical abnormalities are seen in less than 25 percent of cases. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Signs and symptoms'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         UCD should be suspected in the setting of a single persistently enlarged lymph node associated with moderate to intense post-contrast enhancement on computed tomography (CT). 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) should establish that the disease is limited to a single site.

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis is made upon pathologic review of a complete excisional biopsy of a lymph node. Biopsy should demonstrate histopathologic features consistent with the hyaline vascular, plasmacytic, or mixed histopathologic subtypes, though the clinical utility of these histopathologic subtypes is unclear. HHV-8 testing via LANA-1 should be performed and be negative in all cases of UCD. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pathology'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The evaluation should exclude other disorders that can present with a solitary enlarged lymph node that displays CD-like histopathologic features. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Differential diagnosis'

         <strong>
          Management
         </strong>
         – For most patients, we recommend complete excisional resection of the involved lymph node rather than core biopsy or incomplete resection  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef117393" href="/z/d/graphic/117393.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1

         ) (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_3" rel="external">
          Grade 1C
         </a>
         ). Complete resection is curative in most patients.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         If the involved lymph node cannot be completely removed because of its anatomic location and it is causing compressive symptoms, we proceed with systemic B cell depleting therapy to reduce mass size followed by surgical resection. If the involved lymph node cannot be completely removed because of its anatomic location and it is causing inflammatory symptoms, options for systemic therapy include treatments utilized for HHV-8-negative/idiopathic MCD. Localized radiation therapy has a relatively limited role in refractory cases with continuing symptoms. (See
