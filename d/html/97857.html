Through simultaneous recording of multiple physiologic parameters, changes in sleep/wake state or alterations in one parameter can be correlated with other signals. Thus, PSG is a much more powerful diagnostic tool than can be provided by recording only one or two simultaneous physiological measures.</p><p>Younger and younger children are being referred to sleep specialists and sleep laboratories for evaluation of sleep disorders; PSG is often required for diagnosis, and sometimes treatment. While PSG is considered a relatively painless, noninvasive procedure by most adults, it can be challenging and even frightening for children and therefore requires special considerations.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of PSG in infants and children, including indications for testing, derived information, techniques for obtaining useful data, and scoring and interpretation. An approach to the assessment and classification of specific sleep disorders in children is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6357.html" rel="external">"Assessment of sleep disorders in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H28395533"><span class="h1">TYPES OF SLEEP STUDIES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>] and the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>] identify four classes of sleep studies based upon how channels are recorded and whether a sleep technologist is present throughout the recording to provide oversight ("attended" or "unattended").</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A level 1 polysomnography (PSG) is performed in a sleep laboratory with a sleep technologist present, recording a minimum of seven channels including electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), submentalis (chin) electromyography (EMG), electrocardiogram (ECG)/heart rate, and pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A level 2 PSG is simply a level 1 PSG which is recorded unattended, in or out of the sleep laboratory.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A level 3 study records a minimum of four channels, including ventilation, oximetry, ECG, or heart rate, and is done at home or outside of the sleep laboratory, unattended. Home sleep apnea test (HSAT) devices commonly used to identify sleep apnea in adults most often record nasal pressure, respiratory effort, body position, heart rate, and snoring. Some HSAT devices also record actigraphy and peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) in order to provide surrogate measures of sleep and arousal [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A level 4 study records two to three cardiorespiratory signals (most often airflow, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and heart rate) and is typically done at home, unattended.</p><p></p><p>Comprehensive in-laboratory overnight PSG (ie, level 1 PSG) is still regarded as the gold standard method for recording sleep/wake states and for diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and other sleep disorders in children, for several reasons:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A technologist is present throughout to identify problems, repair or replace equipment, and test treatment(s) if needed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The severity of sleep-disordered breathing (ie, the apnea hypopnea index [AHI], mean number of apneas and hypopneas per hour) can be derived from sleep time, rather than time in bed. AHI based on time in bed may be falsely low, underestimating OSA severity if too much of the night is spent awake.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nonrespiratory sleep disorders and other disruptors of sleep can also be identified.</p><p></p><p>However, Level 1 PSG is expensive and time- and labor-intensive to record, score, and read. Availability is often limited, and wait times can be long in some regions, especially for infants and young children [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>].</p><p>For these reasons and others, level 3 studies (ie, home sleep apnea testing) are increasingly used in adults to diagnose OSA. There are more limited data on level 3 studies in children, and this has not yet become standard practice. (See <a class="local">'Alternative studies'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7694.html" rel="external">"Home sleep apnea testing for obstructive sleep apnea in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H28395539"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS FOR POLYSOMNOGRAPHY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Polysomnography (PSG) plays a role in the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of respiratory and nonrespiratory sleep disorders in children [<a href="#rid7">7-12</a>].

Although PSG is not routinely indicated in the evaluation of sleepwalking and sleep terrors, it should be performed when there is clinical suspicion for another sleep disorder (eg, OSA) that may be precipitating partial arousals from sleep.

Adopting and routinely employing child-friendly, family-centered PSG practices can increase the likelihood of obtaining an interpretable PSG and of having the patient return for follow-up [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>Child-friendly PSG techniques begin with preparation and education of the child and family, ideally before they come to the laboratory. The techniques reviewed below are derived from expert experience in recording over 1000 sleep studies in children [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1728191540"><span class="h2">Preparation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Preparing the child and caregiver before the PSG lessens anticipatory anxiety and procedural distress, increases cooperation, improves parent/caregiver satisfaction, and helps the child tolerate future medical procedures.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When a sleep study is indicated, the clinician should describe the procedure in age-appropriate, positive terms and provide an explanation of why the study is needed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Written and visual preparatory material can be very helpful. This may include pamphlets, an introductory video showing how PSG is done, and a tour of the sleep laboratory.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Encourage the child to bring personal items from home (eg, favorite toy, blanket, stuffed animal, doll, pajamas).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clinicians and staff should identify patients who may need additional assistance and support ahead of time, in order to arrange for 1:1 staffing if needed. Such patients may include those who are medically fragile, developmentally delayed, or who have had difficulty tolerating other procedures. Examples of screening questions include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>How easily does your child tolerate tests, surgeries, medical procedures, or even sitting still for haircuts?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Does your child have sensory sensitivities (noise, touch, smell, textures)?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Does your child have any home medical equipment or specialized medical needs (eg, feeding tubes, suctioning devices, peritoneal dialysis, mechanical ventilator, tracheostomy caps)?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Allow at least 90 minutes before usual sleep onset in children younger than six years of age (or any children with developmental disabilities) to permit adjustment to the laboratory and hook-up; two hours lead-time is needed for a PSG that includes expanded EEG montages.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Longer technologist shifts are needed to record PSG in children because of their longer sleep times: 12 to 16 hours in infants 4 to 12 months; 11 to 14 hours for ages 1 to 2 years; 10 to 13 hours for ages 3 to 5 years; and 9 to 12 hours for ages 6 to 12 years [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. It is useful to extend the sleep recording time to capture sufficient rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in the morning (when apnea is often worse).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If it seems likely the child will have great difficulty cooperating for PSG (or has failed it before), and the PSG is crucial for medical decision-making, consider involving a child life specialist to prepare the child for PSG [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. A formal desensitization protocol, in which children are gradually exposed to portions of the PSG equipment at home in the weeks leading up to a study, can be taught to caregivers and may increase the likelihood of a successful study in children with autism spectrum disorder or developmental delay [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoid performing a PSG when a patient is acutely unwell or on the same day as immunization [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Acute illness may exacerbate sleep-disordered breathing or other sleep problems. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unless the PSG is performed for a special purpose (eg, suspected narcolepsy or parasomnia), patients should maintain their usual sleep habits prior to the study.  </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Children should avoid caffeinated or energy drinks the day of the PSG.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Medications the child takes should be reviewed. Hypnotics, sedatives, and opioid-based analgesics can worsen or induce sleep-disordered breathing and may alter sleep architecture and arousal thresholds [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates can alter sleep architecture, arousal thresholds, sleep spindles, muscle tone, and leg movements. The clinician ordering the PSG needs to decide whether <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13171" href="/d/drug information/13171.html" rel="external">clonidine</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13360" href="/d/drug information/13360.html" rel="external">caffeine</a>, melatonin, nasal steroids, antihistamines, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12600" href="/d/drug information/12600.html" rel="external">methylphenidate</a> and dexamphetamine should be continued the night of the study. In some cases, withdrawal of a chronic medication or substance may further disturb sleep.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sedation to obtain sleep in a pediatric PSG is best avoided.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1728191647"><span class="h2">Electrode application</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Children younger than six years of age have limited ability to cooperate with the PSG procedure and set up, and even older children may regress under stressful conditions. Younger children need short, concrete explanations. Patience, flexibility, and a playful and positive attitude can go a long way.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoid laying children down or restraining them to apply sensors. Instead, position the child (who can sit) in the parent/caregiver's lap (chest-to-chest hugging, sitting sideways or forward). Children feel less vulnerable when placed in these "positions of comfort" and are better able to maintain a sense of control and cooperation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Seek out the parent/caregiver's help and advice. What has helped the child manage hard things in past? What may help the child cooperate with the setup? </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use child-friendly terminology for the PSG sensors and explanations for the setup and procedure [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Medical play can help the child cooperate [<a href="#rid21">21-24</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Demonstrate how and where a sensor is applied on their doll or stuffed animal before placing it on the child.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Encourage the child to touch the sensors and equipment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Ask the child to blow bubbles up in the air while attaching the chin electromyography (EMG), or put the play electrode on the doll while you place one on the child.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Give the child choices: Do I put on the leg or chin sticky first? Which finger for your finger nightlight?

(See <a class="local">'Types of sleep studies'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications</strong> – The most common indication for PSG in children is a suspected diagnosis of OSA or other sleep-related breathing disorder (SRBD). In addition to its diagnostic role, PSG plays an important role in the titration of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy for OSA and in the preoperative evaluation before upper airway surgery (eg, adenotonsillectomy). PSG is also indicated for the evaluation of atypical or potentially injurious parasomnias, and for suspected narcolepsy types 1 or 2 or other central disorders of hypersomnolence, in combination with a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). (See <a class="local">'Indications for polysomnography'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Technique</strong> – PSG can be frightening for children. Adopting and routinely employing child-friendly, family-centered PSG practices can increase the likelihood of obtaining an interpretable PSG and the patient returning for follow-up. (See <a class="local">'Child-friendly techniques'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Recorded signals</strong> – Sleep/wake states are scored in a PSG by recording electroencephalography (EEG), eye movements (electrooculography [EOG]), and submentalis (chin) surface electromyography (EMG). In addition, multiple sensors are applied to characterize ventilation and cardiac rhythms, including a snoring microphone, nasal pressure airflow, oronasal thermal sensors, respiratory impedance plethysmography, electrocardiogram (ECG, one or two leads), pulse oximetry, body position, and carbon dioxide monitoring. Surface EMG activity from the anterior tibialis muscles is routinely recorded to detect leg muscle activity and movements. (See <a class="local">'Recorded signals'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Scoring and interpretation</strong> – Following the recording, sleep/wake states and arousals are manually scored in 30-second sequential epochs. Respiratory events, periodic limb movements, paroxysmal motor behaviors, and other events are also scored, tabulated, and collated  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111056" href="/d/graphic/111056.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The scored sleep study is then reviewed, revised where necessary, and interpreted by a sleep specialist  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef142872" href="/d/graphic/142872.html" rel="external">figure 10</a>). (See <a class="local">'Scoring and interpretation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Safety </strong>– Level 1 PSG is a relatively safe procedure, although there are few systematic studies. The most common adverse events reported by pediatric sleep centers are falls out of a crib or bed, emphasizing the importance of fall awareness and other standard safety measures in the sleep laboratory. (See <a class="local">'Safety considerations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Alternative studies</strong> – Although in-laboratory PSG remains the preferred and appropriate study for the evaluation of both respiratory and nonrespiratory sleep disorders in children, the availability of PSG is limited in some regions, especially for infants and children. Alternative studies for detecting OSA may be considered if PSG is not available, recognizing that such studies do not precisely replicate results of full, in-laboratory PSG. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6363.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea in children", section on 'Alternatives to polysomnography'</a>.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Collop NA, Anderson WM, Boehlecke B, et al.
