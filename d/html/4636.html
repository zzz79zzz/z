Approximately 25 percent of patients with stage IB, 35 to 50 percent of stage II, and a greater percentage of those with pathologic stage III NSCLC eventually recur and die of their disease despite potentially curative surgery [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging is the most important prognostic factor determining the likelihood of relapse and therefore predicts those most likely to benefit from adjuvant therapy  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805" href="/z/d/graphic/109805.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Adjuvant chemotherapy is not indicated for patients with resected stage IA disease. Our approach according to stage is discussed below, and is consistent with expert guidelines [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Discussion of prognosis according to stage is found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4602.html" rel="external">"Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system for lung cancer", section on 'Prognosis by stage'</a>.)</p><p>Additionally, a number of molecular biomarkers to predict who may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy are under study and are discussed below.</p><p>Although the stages are according to the eighth edition staging system, it is recognized that the studies cited may have used previous editions of the staging system, which is a limitation of existing data.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3919122389"><span class="h2">Stage I disease</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1411811467"><span class="h3">Stage IA disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with stage IA disease should not receive adjuvant chemotherapy, given evidence suggesting worsened survival associated with adjuvant treatment.</p><p>In the Lung Adjuvant <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">Cisplatin</a> Evaluation (LACE) meta-analysis, which included five studies with approximately 4600 patients with completely resected NSCLC, there was a trend toward worsened survival among patients with stage IA disease receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] of death 1.40, 95% CI 0.95-2.06) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Although subsequent retrospective data have suggested improved outcomes with adjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk stage IA disease, data remain mixed, and we do not suggest adjuvant chemotherapy for any subsets of stage IA disease. In preliminary reporting of a Japanese retrospective review of patients with stage IA disease, among the 641 patients with high-risk factors (eg, an invasive component size of &gt;2 cm, visceral pleural invasion, lymphatic permeation, or vascular invasion), adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improvements in five-year rates of recurrence-free survival (81 versus 74 percent) and overall survival (OS; 93 versus 82 percent) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Limitations in generalizability of this study are that it likely included many patients who were diagnosed based upon screening computed tomography (CT), and who were treated with a chemotherapy regimen not typically used outside of Japan (ftorafur plus uracil). By contrast, in a retrospective National Cancer Database study including over 10,000 patients, adjuvant chemotherapy did not impact OS among patients with pathologic T2N0 NSCLC with high-risk disease (defined by lymphovascular invasion, visceral pleural invasion, high-grade tumor, sublobar resection, tumor size) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3607822280"><span class="h3">Stage IB disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The role of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with resected stage IB disease remains controversial. We offer adjuvant chemotherapy to medically appropriate patients with stage IB disease whose tumors display one or more high-risk features, including lymphovascular invasion, poor differentiation, or high standardized uptake value (SUV) on positron emission tomography (PET; variably defined as SUV 10 or more). However, there is no consensus among expert groups. For example, for patients with stage IB NSCLC, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Cancer Care Ontario guidelines do not endorse adjuvant chemotherapy for routine use because of the lack of definitive evidence establishing improved survival [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. By contrast, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines consider either observation or adjuvant chemotherapy an appropriate option for patients with resected stage IB NSCLC, depending on risk factors for recurrence [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>In the LACE meta-analysis discussed above, among patients with stage IB disease, there was only a nonsignificant trend toward improved OS (HR of death 0.93, 95% CI 0.78-1.10) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Studies have not clearly identified which patients with stage I disease might fall into a high-risk subset. Molecular markers may identify patients who are at higher risk of relapse who therefore may be more likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, though their use should be considered investigational.</p><p>Special considerations for those with somatic activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (<em>EGFR</em>) are discussed below.

For patients with stage II to III resected NSCLC that has been treated with adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy, we suggest an adjuvant checkpoint inhibitor. (See <a class="local">'Adjuvant immunotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>While clinical trials from the 1970s and early 1980s did not show a consistent benefit with adjuvant chemotherapy [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], multiple subsequent large trials using adjuvant platinum-based combinations have demonstrated a benefit  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90104" href="/z/d/graphic/90104.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid9">9-15</a>]. Sufficient data are now available from these newer trials to conclude that adjuvant chemotherapy is useful for patients with completely resected, stage II and III NSCLC. While the adjuvant chemotherapy trials have not specifically analyzed patients with multiple tumors within the same lung (T3N0 or T4N0 disease), these patients are generally treated in the same manner as other patients with stage II and III disease and are managed with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4623.html" rel="external">"Management of stage III non-small cell lung cancer", section on 'Multiple tumor nodules'</a>.)</p><p>The improved survival with adjuvant chemotherapy using modern cisplatin-based regimens was demonstrated in the LACE meta-analysis that combined individual patient data from the five largest trials  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90104" href="/z/d/graphic/90104.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3,9-13</a>]. In a pooled analysis of 4584 patients with completely resected NSCLC with a median follow-up of 5.2 years, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a decreased risk of death of 5.4 percent at five years compared with no chemotherapy (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.96) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The effect on survival varied by stage, but a benefit that reached statistical significance was seen only for patients with stage II (HR of death 0.83, 95% CI 0.73-0.95) and IIIA disease (HR of death 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.94). All five trials used cisplatin-based chemotherapy, although the IALT [<a href="#rid9">9</a>], European Big Lung [<a href="#rid10">10</a>], and the ALPI [<a href="#rid11">11</a>] trials each integrated <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a> into multiple chemotherapy regimens  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90104" href="/z/d/graphic/90104.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). In addition, these three trials allowed the use of adjuvant thoracic radiation at the discretion of the treating clinician, as did the ANITA trial [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>A subsequent Cochrane meta-analysis from the Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Collaborative Group demonstrated a 4 percent OS benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy among 8447 patients in 26 trials treated surgically without radiation, although only nonsignificant trends were observed for patients with stage II and IIIA disease, which comprised a minority of the included patients (approximately one-third) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>Special considerations for those with somatic activating mutations in <em>EGFR</em> are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'EGFR-mutated cancers'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3505077890"><span class="h2">Stage IIIB/C</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the seventh edition TNM staging, all patients with stage IIIB had unresectable disease. The eighth edition groups rare patients with T3/T4N2 disease as stage IIIB; however, these patients are technically resectable. If the disease is completely resected, these patients are treated per the discussion above for stage II/III. However, the initial approach to most patients with stage IIIB/C disease typically does not include surgery, and therefore the issue of adjuvant chemotherapy is not relevant to these populations. Discussion of the management of patients with unresectable stage IIIB/C disease is found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4623.html" rel="external">"Management of stage III non-small cell lung cancer", section on 'N3 disease'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with stage IV disease are typically treated with systemic therapy, taking into account disease histology and genetics. Site-specific local management of metastases may also be indicated. In select instances of oligometastatic disease, definitive local treatment may be considered. The role of adjuvant systemic treatment after definitive treatment of oligometastatic disease is also discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4607.html" rel="external">"Overview of the initial treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer", section on 'Factors in choosing initial therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H255411019"><span class="h2">Special considerations</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3390449843"><span class="h3">Patients requiring surgery and radiation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The indications for adjuvant chemotherapy among those who will be treated with surgery and radiation are the same as for those treated with surgery alone. Specifically, for patients with resected stage II or III disease, we recommend adjuvant chemotherapy rather than observation, regardless of whether radiation is indicated. Similarly, we only treat patients with stage I disease with adjuvant chemotherapy if their tumors have high-risk features, regardless of whether adjuvant radiation is indicated. Tumors historically referred to as stage IB &gt;4 cm in the seventh edition staging are now considered stage IIA. Discussion of which patients should be treated with postoperative radiation, including those with positive margins as well as those with N2 disease, is found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4642.html" rel="external">"Management of stage I and stage II non-small cell lung cancer", section on 'Positive resection margins'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4623.html" rel="external">"Management of stage III non-small cell lung cancer", section on 'Adjuvant postoperative RT'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4623.html" rel="external">"Management of stage III non-small cell lung cancer", section on 'Adjuvant therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Regarding timing of treatment, for those with N2 disease receiving RT, we administer chemotherapy prior to RT [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. For patients with positive margins, chemotherapy may be given either concurrently, before, or after radiation.</p><p>A Cochrane meta-analysis from the Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Collaborative Group included results based upon individual patient data from 2660 patients in 12 trials who were managed with surgery plus RT with or without adjuvant chemotherapy [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Approximately 95 percent of these patients had stage II or IIIA disease. There was an improvement in OS with adjuvant chemotherapy (HR of death 0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.97), corresponding to a 4 percent increase in OS at five years (33 versus 29 percent). The meta-analysis did not detect a difference in outcome between patients who received chemotherapy before versus after RT.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1542625595"><span class="h3">Older adult patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although older adult patients have not been well represented in adjuvant trials, the available data suggest that older adults with resected NSCLC should not be excluded from receiving adjuvant chemotherapy based upon age alone. The decision to pursue adjuvant therapy should consider both the potential benefits of such treatment and the health of the individual patient. A fit older adult is likely to derive as much benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy as a younger individual, with similar tolerance of toxicities. For those with baseline comorbidities such as hearing loss that make <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a> a suboptimal choice, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9202" href="/z/d/drug information/9202.html" rel="external">carboplatin</a> is a reasonable alternative (see <a class="local">'Rationale for use of cisplatin over carboplatin'</a> below). However, for frail older patients or those with significant comorbidities, the risks may outweigh benefits, and it is reasonable to omit adjuvant chemotherapy.</p><p>The role of adjuvant chemotherapy in appropriately selected older adult patients is supported by both the LACE meta-analysis and an unplanned subset analysis of the JBR.10 trial (which was one of the trials included in the meta-analysis)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90104" href="/z/d/graphic/90104.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>]. It should be noted, however, that fewer than 10 percent of the patients in LACE were over 70 years of age and that two of the three positive studies excluded patients older than 75 years, illustrating that trials are limited in assessing this population. The LACE meta-analysis demonstrated that efficacy was not significantly different in older (≥70 years) compared with younger patients, even though older patients received lower doses and fewer cycles of chemotherapy [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. In addition, no differences in severe toxicity were observed. Similarly, in JBR.10, patients &gt;65 years received fewer cycles of chemotherapy (median, three versus four cycles in those ≤65 years) but experienced an OS benefit that was similar to that observed in younger patients [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>Neither of these analyses can be generalized to assess the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in the broader population of older patients, since patients enrolled in the adjuvant chemotherapy trials represent a group that was likely more fit than those of similar age who were not enrolled. Therefore, decisions regarding adjuvant chemotherapy in the older adult patient must be individualized according to patient functional status. Special considerations for the use of chemotherapy in older adult patients are discussed separately.

Osimertinib is initiated after the completion of any indicated chemotherapy.</p><p>In a phase III double-blind trial of 682 patients with <em>EGFR</em>-mutant, stage IB to IIIA [<a href="#rid20">20</a>] NSCLC who had undergone a complete resection (with some patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy), those assigned to adjuvant <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="105441" href="/z/d/drug information/105441.html" rel="external">osimertinib</a> (administered until recurrence for up to three years) versus placebo had improved two-year DFS rates relative to placebo (89 versus 52 percent; HR 0.20, 99% CI 0.14-0.30) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. At 24 months, 98 percent of the patients in the osimertinib group and 85 percent of those in the placebo group were alive without central nervous system (CNS) disease (overall HR for disease recurrence or death 0.18; 95% CI 0.10-0.33). These results led to a recommendation for study closure by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee. Benefits were maintained at longer follow up of 44 months (DFS HR 0.23) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Osimertinib also improved OS (five-year OS rate of 88 versus 78 percent with placebo; HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.34-0.70) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. In general, the agent was well tolerated, with serious adverse events occurring in 16 percent receiving osimertinib and 13 percent receiving placebo.

A choice among these agents depends on the side effect profile and patient and provider preferences. Vinorelbine has been the most studied agent, but is associated with neuropathy as well as the greatest incidence of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. Furthermore, it requires central intravenous access due to its vesicant properties. Docetaxel causes alopecia and has a higher incidence of febrile neutropenia than gemcitabine, and is also associated with pneumonitis and hypersensitivity reactions (for which steroid premedication is necessary). Gemcitabine is associated with thrombocytopenia. Pemetrexed is commonly chosen for those with nonsquamous histology given that it has the lowest incidence of febrile neutropenia and is not associated with alopecia or neuropathy.</p><p>The E1505 trial randomly assigned approximately 1500 patients with completely resected NSCLC to treatment with a cisplatin-based doublet with or without <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8683" href="/z/d/drug information/8683.html" rel="external">bevacizumab</a>.

Based on the prospective LUNG-ART study, the routine prescription of postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) for all resected N2 disease is no longer recommended [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. For situations where PORT is planned, it should be administered following completion of chemotherapy, typically within four to six weeks. While available data suggest that adjuvant radiation sequenced either before or after chemotherapy leads to similar outcomes [<a href="#rid16">16</a>], we administer radiation after the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy since either concurrent chemoradiotherapy or radiation followed by chemotherapy might compromise the ability to deliver the recommended dose and cycles of chemotherapy. Moreover, available evidence, albeit limited, suggests improved survival with sequential rather than concurrent chemotherapy and radiation. For example, in a National Cancer Database study of approximately 3500 patients with primary, non-metastatic NSCLC undergoing surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiation, those receiving sequential chemotherapy and radiation experienced improved survival compared with those receiving concurrent chemotherapy and radiation (55 versus 40 months, respectively, a difference that was statistically significant) [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p>For patients in whom either adjuvant immunotherapy or EGFR inhibition are indicated, these are initiated typically after completion of radiation.</p><p>Indications for PORT are found elsewhere.

The development of active platinum-based combinations and the completion of large clinical trials assessing the activity of adjuvant chemotherapy for resected NSCLC have led to the use of adjuvant chemotherapy to improve the outcome in patients with completely resected NSCLC.
