Secondary prevention of SCD refers to medical or interventional therapy undertaken to prevent SCD in patients who have experienced symptomatic life-threatening sustained VT/VF or have been successfully resuscitated from sudden cardiac arrest. The secondary prevention of SCD in patients with HF and cardiomyopathy will be reviewed here, with emphasis on the role of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). The different types of ventricular arrhythmias, the effects of HF therapy on ventricular arrhythmias, and the role of electrophysiologic testing are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/968.html" rel="external">"Ventricular arrhythmias: Overview in patients with heart failure and cardiomyopathy"</a>.)</p><p>The approaches to the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias related to specific heart muscle diseases, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and isolated left ventricular noncompaction, are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4932.html" rel="external">"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: Treatment and prognosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4924.html" rel="external">"Isolated left ventricular noncompaction in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/119625.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Management of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death risk"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While the exact percentages and mode of death in patients with HF vary with HF class and type of cardiomyopathy, progressive pump failure, unexpected SCD, and SCD during episodes of clinical worsening of HF each account for approximately one-third of deaths in HF patients [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) are the most common arrhythmic causes of SCD, although bradyarrhythmias and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) are responsible in 5 to 33 percent of cases [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. </p><p>More severe HF is associated with a higher overall mortality rate and a higher absolute rate of SCD, but a decreasing proportion of SCD to total deaths. This trend was illustrated in the MERIT-HF (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9645" href="/z/d/drug information/9645.html" rel="external">Metoprolol</a> CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure) trial in which patients with increasing HF class (NYHA class II, III and IV) had increasing rates of SCD at one year (6.3, 10.5, and 18.6 percent, respectively), but a decreasing percentage of deaths that were classified as SCD (64, 59, and 33 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Patients who have received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for secondary prevention have significantly higher rates of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias triggering appropriate ICD intervention than recipients of primary prevention ICDs, approximately threefold higher in one national registry from Israel [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Although ICD therapy improves survival of patients who suffered prior sudden cardiac arrest, mortality remains high. The mechanisms of death in such patients were illustrated in analyses from several secondary prevention ICD studies [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nonarrhythmic cardiac death, usually progressive HF – 45 to 50 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Arrhythmic death – 20 to 35 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Noncardiac death, primarily renal and pulmonary disease – 20 to 30 percent</p><p></p><p>Arrhythmic death can occur despite recognition and termination of tachyarrhythmias by the ICD [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. These deaths often result from PEA, also called electromechanical dissociation (EMD), or acute cardiac mechanical dysfunction [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>]. PEA or bradyarrhythmias may be the mechanism of SCD in up to 40 percent of patients [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. However, post-mortem interrogation of ICDs demonstrated that 25 percent of sudden deaths in ICD patients (representing 5 percent of all deaths) were caused by inability to defibrillate VF [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. This situation may occur with VT/VF storm or refractory myocardial ischemia/infarction.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">SECONDARY PREVENTION OF SCD</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with HF or cardiomyopathy who survive an episode of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or experience sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) are at high risk of future sustained arrhythmic events and SCD. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3431830421"><span class="h2">Our approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We proceed with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation in most survivors of SCA due to sustained VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF), after completely reversible causes are excluded. (See <a class="local">'Reversible causes of SCA or sustained VT'</a> below.)</p><p>Antiarrhythmic medications and/or catheter ablation should be used as adjunctive therapy to ICD implantation to suppress recurrent ventricular arrhythmias that lead to ICD therapy. These recommendations are in agreement with 2017 guidelines published by the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society (AHA/ACC/HRS) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In rare instances, class III antiarrhythmic drugs, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9941" href="/z/d/drug information/9941.html" rel="external">sotalol</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8595" href="/z/d/drug information/8595.html" rel="external">amiodarone</a>, and/or catheter ablation may be selected as primary therapy for patients who refuse or who are not considered candidates for ICD therapy. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1075672"><span class="h2">Reversible causes of SCA or sustained VT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In some survivors of SCA or sustained VT, a transient or reversible cause (eg, acute myocardial ischemia [MI], electrolyte disturbances, medication-related proarrhythmia, etc) can be identified which is felt to have caused the acute problem. Initial treatment should be directed at the underlying disorder. However, prior to concluding that SCA was due to a reversible cause, a thorough evaluation should be performed, usually involving a heart rhythm specialist. For example, in a patient who presents with VF and is found to have mild hypokalemia, it is generally not appropriate to assign the cause of the SCA just to the low potassium level. </p><p>Correction of a reversible cause of SCA or sustained VT is most likely to be adequate in one of several settings:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Polymorphic VT or VF that is preceded by clear evidence of MI or acute MI – In such cases, revascularization is often adequate for the purpose of reducing the risk of SCD. However, some of these patients will later qualify for a primary prevention ICD due to severe left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction (MADIT II criteria) or systolic dysfunction and HF (SCD-HeFT criteria). Guideline-directed medical therapy should be applied, and follow-up evaluation with a cardiologist soon after discharge should be arranged for additional risk stratification. A repeat evaluation of LV function is recommended &gt;40 days post-MI and &gt;90 days after revascularization to determine if the patient qualifies for ICD implantation based on primary prevention indications [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].

Among the relatively small number of patients with an LVEF &lt;20 percent, survival tended to be better with the ICD (72 versus 64 percent), but the difference did not reach statistical significance.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H438756384"><span class="h3">CASH trial</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the Cardiac Arrest Survival in Hamburg (CASH) trial, 349 survivors of cardiac arrest due to documented VT or VF were randomly assigned to treatment with an ICD, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9645" href="/z/d/drug information/9645.html" rel="external">metoprolol</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9821" href="/z/d/drug information/9821.html" rel="external">propafenone</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8595" href="/z/d/drug information/8595.html" rel="external">amiodarone</a> [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Assignment to propafenone was discontinued prematurely when interim analysis revealed a 61 percent higher mortality than that seen in patients randomized to ICD therapy.</p><p>After a mean follow-up of 57 months, there was a non-significant reduction in total mortality in patients receiving an ICD compared with those treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8595" href="/z/d/drug information/8595.html" rel="external">amiodarone</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9645" href="/z/d/drug information/9645.html" rel="external">metoprolol</a> (36.4 versus 44.9 percent). The secondary end point of SCD was significantly reduced by the ICD compared with drug therapy (13 versus 33 percent).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H438756390"><span class="h3">CIDS trial</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study (CIDS) 659 patients with resuscitated VT/VF or syncope deemed to be secondary to VT/VF were randomly assigned to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8595" href="/z/d/drug information/8595.html" rel="external">amiodarone</a> or ICD therapy and followed for five years [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. In those treated with an ICD, there were non-significant reductions in total mortality (8.3 versus 10.2 percent per year) and SCD (3 versus 4.5 percent per year).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1075211"><span class="h3">Meta-analysis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A significant mortality benefit with ICD therapy was noted in the AVID trial, while nonsignificant trends toward reduced mortality with ICD therapy were noted in the CASH and CIDS trials. The lack of statistical significance in the last two trials could have represented a beta error as the trials were underpowered to detect a significant difference of the magnitude observed. In addition, it is possible that patients considered by their clinicians to be good candidates for ICD therapy would be less likely to be enrolled and subjected to randomization, thus favoring the control group.</p><p>In a meta-analysis of the AVID, CASH, and CIDS trials along with a fourth smaller trial, the following findings were noted [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with an ICD had a significant reduction in total mortality compared with those receiving antiarrhythmic therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.75, 95% CI 0.64-0.87).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with an ICD had a 50 percent reduction in SCD (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34-0.62).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The absolute reduction in all-cause mortality was 7 percent, meaning that 15 patients needed to be treated to prevent one death. </p><p></p><p>A second meta-analysis of AVID, CIDS, and CASH came to similar conclusions, finding a 28 percent relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality and a 50 percent reduction in arrhythmic death [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Patients with LVEF &gt;35 percent had less benefit from ICD therapy than those with EF ≤35 percent. </p><p>A subsequent meta-analysis of AVID, CIDS, and CASH further quantitated the benefit of the ICD in secondary prevention patients, finding a two-year absolute risk reduction in total mortality of 8 percent, with a number needed to treat to achieve mortality benefit of 13 [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1595150"><span class="h3">Contemporary observational cohort studies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The evidence supporting ICD therapy for secondary prevention rests upon randomized clinical trials that were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. However, more contemporary observational studies or registries support these findings. In a cohort of 6996 patients with new onset ventricular arrhythmia in the setting of preexisting coronary heart disease and HF (from the National Veterans Administration database), 1442 patients had an ICD implanted [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. At three-year follow-up, the patients who received an ICD had significant reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality compared with those without an ICD (37 versus 55 percent and 23 versus 36 percent, respectively; adjusted odds ratio 0.52 for all-cause mortality and 0.56 for cardiovascular mortality), with no difference in noncardiac death. The benefit occurred despite a significantly lower frequency of use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers, and statins. This reduction in risk of death (28 percent) was similar to that seen in AVID (31 percent). In a smaller study of 357 patients who received an ICD for secondary prevention with much longer follow-up (mean 82 months), 208 persons (59 percent) received an ICD therapy for ventricular tachyarrhythmia, while 44 percent of participants died without receiving any ICD therapy [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. An analysis of the NCDR ICD Registry evaluated mortality in 46,685 patients with ICDs implanted for secondary prevention indications in contemporary practice [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. The mortality rate in this registry at one year was 10 percent compared with 8 to 11 percent among ICD patients enrolled in the secondary prevention randomized clinical trials (AVID, CIDS, CASH). Overall, the magnitude of the benefit of ICD therapy for secondary prevention in this real-world cohort was similar to or greater than that in the randomized trials, although mortality also remains high due to significant comorbidities.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1595156"><span class="h3">Effect in older patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Randomized clinical trials evaluating the role of the ICD for secondary prevention included only a minority of patients who were ≥75 years old. A meta-analysis of pooled individual patient data from three major randomized trials (CASH, CIDS, and AVID) comparing ICD with antiarrhythmic therapy for secondary prevention included 252 patients (out of 1866 total, or 13.5 percent) who were ≥75 years old [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. This meta-analysis suggested that the survival benefit from ICD therapy may be reduced in older patients compared with younger patients [<a href="#rid21">21-23</a>]. In contrast, other studies have shown older patients to benefit equally from primary or secondary prevention ICD therapy as younger patients [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>].</p><p>While clinical trials enrolled relatively few older adult patients, the National Cardiovascular Data Registry ICD Registry provides the ability to examine outcomes in much larger numbers of patients in real-life clinical practice. In an analysis of 12,420 Medicare patients who were ages 65 years or older (mean age 75 years) who underwent initial ICD implantation between 2006 and 2009 for secondary prevention of SCD, the overall risk of death at two years was 21.8 percent [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. However, there was a twofold difference in total mortality between patients ≥80 years of age and those who were ages 65 to 69 years (28.9 versus 14.7 percent; adjusted risk ratio 2.01, 95% CI 1.85-2.33). The study did not include a control group of similarly matched patients without an ICD; therefore no conclusions can be drawn about any potential total mortality benefit from placing the ICD for secondary prevention. However, nearly four in five patients over age 65 years who received an ICD for secondary prevention were alive two years later, indicating that age alone should not be the deciding criterion for ICD placement. Rather, multiple clinical factors should be considered including comorbidities, functional status, and competing risks of mortality, with the patient and family engaged in a shared decision-making process. This is highlighted in the guidelines, which state “In patients with ventricular arrhythmias or at increased risk for SCD, clinicians should adopt a shared decision-making approach in which treatment decisions are based not only on the best available evidence but also on the patients’ health goals, preferences, and values (class I, LOE B-NR) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].” </p><p>These results suggest that ICD use in older patients should be individualized. Patients with few comorbidities may benefit, while those with significant other illnesses may be more likely to die of non-arrhythmic causes. Clinicians should consider issues of competing mortality risk, co-morbidities, risk of complications, and patient preferences for end-of-life care.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1595188"><span class="h3">Effect in heart failure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who are being evaluated for an ICD for secondary prevention and who have at least class II HF symptoms, significant LV systolic dysfunction, left bundle branch block, and a QRS duration ≥150 milliseconds should be strongly considered for an ICD that also provides cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).

For such patients with an ischemic cardiomyopathy, we generally perform an invasive electrophysiology (EP) study and, if the patient has inducible VT, implant an ICD. For patients with a nonischemic cardiomyopathy, an EP study is less informative, although it may reveal conduction abnormalities or bundle branch reentrant VT. In such patients, decisions regarding ICD implantation should be individualized based upon clinical circumstances, type of heart muscle disease, and patient preference. Cardiac MRI can be a useful test to detect scarring and fibrosis; in some cardiomyopathies, the presence of these can predict arrythmia sudden cardiac death.</p><p>The 2017 AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines recommend the use of an ICD in patients with significant LV dysfunction due to ischemic cardiomyopathy who have unexplained syncope [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. However, regardless of the history of syncope, many such patients will already qualify for an ICD for primary prevention of SCD based upon SCD-HeFT criteria, and patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and severe LV dysfunction (ie, LVEF ≤30 to 35 percent) generally qualify for an ICD based upon MADIT-II [<a href="#rid28">28</a>] or SCD-HeFT criteria [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1593018"><span class="h3">Patients with transient or reversible disorders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with a life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia due to a transient or reversible cause (often an ischemic event) have been thought to have a low risk for recurrent SCA after correction of the underlying precipitant.

Over a mean follow-up of 3.8 years, 319 patients (40 percent) died, with ICD recipients having a significantly lower mortality risk (HR 0.61 compared with patients without an ICD, 95% CI 0.47-0.80). The benefit was consistent across all subgroups with the exception of patients whose reversible cause was MI/ischemia, in whom no mortality benefit was seen. While patients with SCA in the setting of MI did not receive a mortality benefit from ICD therapy, it should be noted that all of these patients underwent coronary revascularization before being classified as having a reversible cause of SCA. Additionally, 32 of the ICD recipients (15 percent) received an appropriate ICD therapy during follow-up, including 21 percent of the group without MI/ischemia, suggesting that SCA in the setting of a perceived reversible cause may not always be related to the putative reversible cause. While this study is limited by its retrospective, nonrandomized nature, it suggests caution on the part of clinicians evaluating patients after cardiac arrest not to overestimate the potential for reversibility of arrhythmic risk, particularly outside of the setting of acute MI.</p><p></p><p>The 2017 AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines for the management of ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death recommend ICD therapy for patients who either survive SCA or experience hemodynamically unstable VT or stable VT not due to "reversible causes" if meaningful survival greater than one year is expected [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].

Sotalol or mexiletine may be alternative drugs for selected patients with structural heart disease who have an ICD. Often, a beta blocker is coadministered with antiarrhythmic drugs, which do not have intrinsic beta-blocker activity. Beta blockers are often separately indicated in patients with ventricular arrhythmias due to coexistent HF, LV dysfunction, and/or coronary artery disease. In addition, beta blockers have important antiarrhythmic action which may reduce recurrence of ventricular arrhythmias.
