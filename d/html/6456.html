         Diarrhea refers to the passage of loose or watery stools. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a case as the passage of three or more loose or watery stools per day [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Nevertheless, absolute limits of normalcy are difficult to define; any deviation from the child's usual pattern should raise concern (particularly with ill appearance, the passage of blood or mucus, or dehydration) regardless of the actual number of stools or their water content.

         Acute infectious gastroenteritis due to viruses accounts for most bouts of diarrhea in resource-abundant settings, resulting in more than 1.5 million outpatient visits and 200,000 hospitalizations in the United States annually [

         Profuse non-bloody and watery diarrhea frequently occurs as part of the initial presentation in patients with staphylococcal TSS. Hypotension is often severe and unresponsive to aggressive fluid resuscitation. The diagnosis of TSS is based upon clinical presentation  (

         Intussusception is most common from 6 to 12 months of age, and the vast majority of cases occur in the first two years of life. Most children with intussusception develop sudden onset of intermittent, severe, crampy abdominal pain, accompanied by inconsolable crying and drawing up of the legs toward the abdomen. Bloody diarrhea is often a late finding, although rarely may be the sole presenting feature. The episodes of pain usually occur at 15- to 20-minute intervals. They become more frequent and may be followed initially by emesis of gastric contents. Bilious emesis may develop as the obstruction progresses. Between the painful episodes, the child may behave normally. As a result, initial symptoms can be confused with gastroenteritis. As symptoms progress, there may be intermittent episodes of lethargy that worsen over time, which can be mistaken for meningitis. A sausage-shaped abdominal mass may be felt, on occasion, in the right side of the abdomen. Abdominal radiographs may reveal a paucity of gas on the right, which may be better visualized with left lateral decubitus imaging. The diagnosis is established by abdominal ultrasound or air contrast enema. (See

         Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), although uncommon, merits consideration in any child with bloody diarrhea, particularly in the first five years of life, because it is a potentially fatal illness. It complicates 6 to 9 percent of enterohemorrhagic

         infections with the 0157:H7 strain and usually begins 5 to 10 days after the onset of diarrhea. HUS, which has a sudden onset, is characterized by the triad of (see

         Children typically have a prodromal illness with abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea that precedes the development of HUS by several days to weeks, as a result of which a patient may have no signs of hemolysis or renal failure when seen earlier in the course. The diarrhea and associated gastrointestinal complaints may mimic those of ulcerative colitis, other enteric infections, and appendicitis. The diagnosis of HUS in children is generally made on clinical grounds based on the characteristic clinical and laboratory findings previously described: a prodrome of diarrhea due to a Shiga toxin-producing
         <em>
          E. coli
         </em>
         , followed by abrupt onset of the characteristic triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. (See

         Antibiotic treatment should be avoided in patients with HUS because it may cause relatively rapid worsening of clinical status or prolong the course of disease. (See

         This disorder results from an overgrowth of toxin-producing clostridial organisms in the bowel. The typical presentation is acute watery diarrhea with lower abdominal pain, low-grade fever, and leukocytosis, starting during or shortly after antibiotic administration. Occasionally the course can be fulminant, progressing from diarrhea to toxic megacolon and shock. Community-associated infection with a highly toxigenic strain of

         Observational studies suggest that children younger than five years of age are more likely to have diarrhea at presentation than school-aged children. The presumed mechanism for the diarrhea is irritation of the colon by the inflamed appendix. The stools are usually of low volume and with mucus. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6479.html" rel="external">
          "Acute appendicitis in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical features by age'

        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of appendicitis as the cause of diarrhea may be delayed because the classic constellation of findings is absent. This is particularly true in very young children or among patients of any age who have both a perforated appendix and a long duration of illness. However, abdominal tenderness may be greater than would be expected with gastroenteritis. An approach to the diagnosis of appendicitis is provided in the algorithm  (

         Toxic megacolon is a potentially lethal complication of preexisting bowel disease or infectious colitis that is characterized by total or segmental nonobstructive colonic dilatation plus systemic toxicity. Signs and symptoms of acute colitis that are frequently resistant to therapy are often present for at least one week prior to the onset of acute dilatation. Severe bloody diarrhea is the most common presenting symptom, while improvement of diarrhea may herald the onset of megacolon. Physical examination invariably reveals a toxic appearing patient with altered sensorium, tachycardia, fever, postural hypotension, lower abdominal distension and tenderness, with or without signs of localized or generalized peritonitis. However, large doses of steroids, analgesics, or a clouded sensorium may mask the signs or symptoms of toxic megacolon. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of toxic megacolon should be considered in all patients presenting with abdominal distension and acute or chronic diarrhea. The diagnosis is clinical, based upon the finding of an enlarged dilated colon on abdominal imaging accompanied by severe systemic toxicity. (See

         Congenital secretory diarrheas are characterized by profuse watery diarrhea beginning at or shortly after birth and are rare. They are caused by a variety of inherited disorders that disrupt nutrient digestion, absorption, or transport, enterocyte development and function, or enteroendocrine function. Although they are not usually life-threatening, congenital secretory diarrheas may lead to profound dehydration in the young infant over a short course of time. (See

         Viral gastroenteritis is, by far, the single most common diarrheal disorder seen in the emergency department and in general practice. Based upon prospective series of infants and children using various highly accurate methods for identification of viral infection, a viral pathogen is identified in up to 60 percent of all children with isolated diarrhea and over 75 percent of children with vomiting and diarrhea [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-7
         </a>
         ]. Since 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as an important viral etiology of diarrhea in children. The incubation time from exposure, predominant season, severity and duration of illness depends upon the specific virus  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80471" href="/z/d/graphic/80471.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). Stool testing for specific viruses is typically not necessary but may be employed during outbreaks to determine the etiology. (See

         Non-bloody diarrhea, vomiting, and fever are the most common findings in children with viral gastroenteritis. Gross blood or mucus in the stool are uncommon in viral gastroenteritis and should prompt consideration of bacterial enteritis or other etiology. (See

         Bacterial enteritis typically affects children older than two years of age and occurs through oral-fecal contamination and after exposure to poultry, other farm animals, or contaminated meat or produce.

         Diarrhea may also occur when intake of solid foods is limited (sometimes referred to as "starvation stools"). Although typically referring to a type of chronic diarrhea in malnourished children, diarrhea can also persist in well-nourished children with acute viral gastroenteritis who are only given clear liquids during the course of their illness. After fluid repletion is complete, resumption of a normal diet in patients with viral gastroenteritis helps to avoid this condition. (See

         Lactase deficiency, when it occurs in younger children, is usually a transient problem caused by mucosal injury from an enteric infection. The lactose intolerance associated with acute viral gastroenteritis usually is mild and self-limiting, lasting several days to one to two weeks. Breastfeeding and infant formula can be resumed when severe dehydration is corrected and can continue without change for the child with mild dehydration. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5992.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         In older children and adolescents, a primary lactase deficiency can causes chronic lactose intolerance. Ingestion of lactose may result in symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea. In addition, adolescents may have symptoms of vomiting. The abdominal pain may be cramping in nature and is often localized to the periumbilical area or lower quadrants. In children, the stools may be bulky, frothy, and watery. A presumptive diagnosis of lactose intolerance can be made in patients with mild symptoms that occur within a few hours after significant lactose ingestion (eg, &gt;2 servings of dairy/day or &gt;1 serving in a single dose that is not associated with a meal) and resolve after five to seven days of avoidance of lactose-containing foods. The diagnostic approach to lactose intolerance is discussed in greater detail separately. (See

         – Parasitic infections are uncommon among immunocompetent children in resource-abundant settings but may occur in those patients with recent immigration, travel to an underdeveloped country, backcountry camping, exposure to poultry or other farm animals, or consumption of processed meat. Parasitic infections are also more frequently seen in immunocompromised patients and can cause severe illness.

         Mushroom poisoning – A variety of mushroom species cause acute gastroenteritis soon after ingestion without any further toxicity. Often these exposures occur when children take a bite of a "little brown mushroom" while playing outside in the backyard. With ingestion of these mushrooms, symptoms occur within one to three hours and include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping as well as diarrhea. Close attention to the history of ingestion and the timing associated with the onset of symptoms is important to differentiate acute gastroenteritis from the more concerning delayed gastroenteritis that may indicate consumption of a more lethal variety of mushroom toxins (eg, amatoxins, gyromitrin, orellanine).

         Organophosphate or carbamate compound poisoning – Diarrhea is a component of the cholinergic excess seen after ingestion, inhalation, or skin contamination of organophosphates and carbamates. Toxicity typically occurs within minutes to hours of exposure. Other findings include salivation, tearing, vomiting, bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, and bradycardia. Weakness, fasciculations, and paralysis may also develop. In addition, the patient may have a petroleum distillate or garlic odor. Diagnosis is made on clinical grounds. Direct measurement of red blood cell acetylcholinesterase activity provides a measure of the degree of toxicity. (See

          Laxative-induced diarrhea

         – Caregivers may give children laxatives in an attempt to treat constipation or, rarely, as a form of medical child abuse. Adolescents with eating disorders may misuse laxatives in an attempt to lose weight. The physician should inquire about laxative use when diarrhea is persistent or when other signs of an eating disorder are present. When intentional laxative use is suspected but is not disclosed on history, suggestive laboratory findings include hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, a positive laxative screen for diphenolic laxatives (eg,

         Potential for dehydration – The number of episodes of diarrhea per day, the amount of oral fluid intake, and urine output (eg, number of wet diapers or frequency of urination in the past 24 hours) and a recent weight (if available) help identify patients who are likely to be dehydrated.

         Duration of diarrhea – An acute diarrheal illness is typically defined as a duration of five days or less but return to normal stool consistency after viral gastroenteritis, the most common etiology in resource-abundant regions may take longer. Diarrhea that has persisted beyond five days may warrant consideration of other diagnoses, especially in children who are ill-appearing, have bloody diarrhea in association with weight loss, or other findings suggesting a more serious underlying condition such as those discussed below.

         The patient who requires volume resuscitation must be quickly identified.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mild dehydration (less than 5 percent body weight) is often not discernable by physical examination but may be suggested by a history of decreased oral intake, increased losses (eg, vomiting or diarrhea), and decreased urine output. Clinical evidence of moderate (5 to 10 percent) or severe (&gt;10 percent) dehydration membranes is usually apparent  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76198" href="/z/d/graphic/76198.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). The most useful signs for predicting a volume deficit of 5 percent or more include a tired or fatigued general appearance, delayed capillary refill time greater than two seconds, dry mucous membranes, and decreased tears. However, no single physical examination finding is particularly predictive, and a combination of findings should be present for children with moderate to severe dehydration. When available, comparison of current weight with a recently obtained prior weight can also help define the percent of dehydration. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6142.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical assessment of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children", section on 'Estimating degree of hypovolemia'

         The presence of fever in an immunocompetent child with diarrhea is the hallmark of infection. Most febrile children with non-bloody diarrhea have viral enteritis. Although children with SARS-CoV-2 most often present with respiratory complaints, fever and diarrhea can be the sole presenting symptoms in infants and young children. (See

Urgent conditions are suggested by a history of bloody diarrhea or the physical finding of abdominal tenderness  (

         The child with chronic diarrhea who is well-appearing and tolerates oral fluids can be managed as an outpatient.

          Acute diarrhea
         </strong>
         – The patient with acute diarrhea who requires volume resuscitation must be quickly identified. Clinical evidence of dehydration is already apparent at a deficit of 5 percent of body weight, except in rare cases of hypernatremia  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76198" href="/z/d/graphic/76198.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). A combination of historical and physical examination findings rather than one single feature provides the most useful model for predicting a volume deficit of 5 percent or more. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Physical examination'

         A palpable mass or peritonitis suggests appendicitis, intussusception or, less commonly, toxic megacolon. Generalized toxicity and/or shock may occur with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), severe dehydration, or with sepsis, such as from
         <em>
          Salmonella
         </em>
         or staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS). (See

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In addition to identifying volume depletion and life-threatening conditions, a thorough examination must be performed because systemic, non-enteric infections, particularly otitis media, may cause acute diarrhea. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Extraintestinal infections'

         Ancillary studies in children with acute diarrhea are based upon a careful history and physical examination. Most previously healthy children with self-limited diarrhea (eg, viral gastroenteritis, extraintestinal infections, functional diarrhea, starvation stools, or transient lactase deficiency) and no exposures to bacterial pathogens require no specific testing. (See
         <a class="local">

         An acute diarrheal illness is typically defined as a duration of five days or less but return to normal stool consistency after viral gastroenteritis, the most common etiology in resource-abundant regions may take longer. Diarrhea that has persisted beyond five days may warrant consideration of and evaluation for other diagnoses, especially in children who are ill-appearing, have bloody diarrhea in association with weight loss, or other findings suggesting a more serious underlying condition.
