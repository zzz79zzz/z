This includes individuals with sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiac and noncardiac surgery. This practice is based on evidence from randomized trials in various populations demonstrating equivalent or superior outcomes with restrictive transfusions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7948.html" rel="external">"Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusion in adults", section on 'Summary of supporting evidence'</a>.)</p><p>In most cases, a restrictive transfusion strategy involves transfusing for a hemoglobin of <strong>&lt;7 g/dL</strong> rather than a higher threshold. Some clinicians may reasonably choose a threshold of 7.5 g/dL for cardiac surgery or 8 g/dL for orthopedic surgery or preexisting cardiovascular disease. For individuals with acute coronary syndromes, including acute myocardial infarction, the data do not clearly support a specific threshold, and the approach is individualized. The transfusion threshold used for a specific patient should generally match the value used in clinical trials that most closely match the patient's condition, as summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef93934" href="/d/graphic/93934.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131907" href="/d/graphic/131907.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). As an example, the Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC) trial randomly assigned 838 critically ill adults to a restrictive transfusion strategy (transfusion for hemoglobin &lt;7 g/dL) or a liberal strategy (transfusion for hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL) and found decreased hospital mortality in the restrictive arm [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. However, in a secondary analysis of the TRICC trial, mortality was not significantly increased among individuals with acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina ischemic heart disease who received the restrictive transfusion strategy compared with the liberal strategy [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Additional supporting evidence and meta-analyses are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7948.html" rel="external">"Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusion in adults", section on 'Thresholds for specific patient populations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2858146435"><span class="h2">Symptomatic patients may require higher hemoglobin targets</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although adherence to restrictive thresholds is an important principle of patient blood management programs, clinical judgment remains important, especially for symptomatic patients such as those with active bleeding or hemodynamic instability. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7948.html" rel="external">"Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusion in adults", section on 'Symptomatic patient'</a>.)</p><p>This was illustrated in a 2023 prospective study involving 3643 patients in 233 ICUs across six continents for whom the median hemoglobin prior to transfusion ranged from 5.3 to 9.1 g/dL [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Overall, the study showed there is significant variability in transfusion indications, especially across continents. In 84 percent of ICUs, transfusions were administered to some patients with hemoglobin &gt;7 g/dL. The most commonly stated explanations for transfusion included low hemoglobin, active bleeding, hemodynamic instability, or other symptoms.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Ordering RBCs</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3870160790"><span class="h3">Typing and crossmatching</span></p><p>If there is life-threatening anemia and insufficient time to perform this testing, emergency release blood can be used. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7953.html" rel="external">"Pretransfusion testing for red blood cell transfusion", section on 'Emergency release blood for life-threatening anemia or bleeding'</a>.)</p><p>If time allows, pretransfusion testing is used to identify blood for transfusion, as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7953.html" rel="external">"Pretransfusion testing for red blood cell transfusion"</a>.)</p><p>Briefly, pretransfusion testing requires a patient blood sample taken within the previous three days to allow RBC typing, antibody screening, and crossmatching. Antibodies against ABO antigens develop in all individuals (A individuals develop anti-B, B individuals develop anti-A, and O individuals develop anti-A and anti-B). Type O, RhD-negative RBCs are considered the universal donor since they lack A, B, and RhD antigens on their surface.</p><p>In contrast to antibodies to the ABO blood group that are formed regardless of prior transfusions, other alloantibodies may develop following exposure to allogeneic blood (from transfusion, pregnancy, organ transplantation, or sharing needles). These antibodies are detected as part of route antibody screening and the transfusion medicine service will determine the extent of testing needed to provide compatible blood. The turnaround time depends on whether the individual has a common or rare blood type and whether alloantibodies are present.</p><p>Emergency release RBCs are type O, RhD-negative (the universal donor), making the likelihood of a serious hemolytic transfusion reaction exceedingly low. Many institutions provide group O, RhD-positive RBC units for females who are beyond childbearing age and males. Using emergency release blood is always preferable to not transfusing in life-threatening anemia. In these situations, direct communication with the transfusion medicine service is essential, to confirm the need for emergency release blood and determine the likely number of units needed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7953.html" rel="external">"Pretransfusion testing for red blood cell transfusion", section on 'Emergency release blood for life-threatening anemia or bleeding'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3619238898"><span class="h3">Whole blood versus RBCs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is almost always performed using packed RBCs. Alternatives include whole blood or salvaged autologous blood. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7939.html" rel="external">"Practical aspects of red blood cell transfusion in adults: Storage, processing, modifications, and infusion", section on 'Sources of RBC units'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7939.html" rel="external">"Practical aspects of red blood cell transfusion in adults: Storage, processing, modifications, and infusion", section on 'Whole blood'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7937.html" rel="external">"Surgical blood conservation: Intraoperative blood salvage"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>RBCs</strong> – Each unit of RBCs has a total volume of 300 mL, of which RBCs constitute approximately 200 mL.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Whole blood</strong> – Interest in using whole blood has been increasing, especially in trauma patients or massive transfusion settings, including cardiovascular surgery [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. The rationale for use is that it provides RBCs, plasma, and platelets in an appropriate ratio in a single transfusion. Whole blood is not universally available. Local guidelines should be followed.

It can be used in a variety of surgical procedures when appropriate expertise is available. It may be lifesaving in certain cases of rare blood type or when crossmatch-compatible blood is not available. Specific indications, contraindications, and supporting evidence are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7937.html" rel="external">"Surgical blood conservation: Intraoperative blood salvage"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H986507109"><span class="h3">Number of RBC units</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In most cases, one unit of red blood cells (RBCs) or whole blood is expected to raise the hemoglobin by approximately 1 g/dL and the hematocrit by approximately 3 percent.</p><p>General practice is to transfuse one unit of RBCs at a time and check a post-transfusion hemoglobin 15 minutes to 1 hour following transfusion to determine if additional units are needed. This avoids unnecessary transfusions, reduces the risk of transfusion complications, and preserves the blood supply for other patients. However, we occasionally transfuse more than one unit (eg, two to three units) sequentially before checking the hemoglobin when the initial hemoglobin and/or degree of continued bleeding warrant this approach.</p><p>In massive bleeding or massive hemolysis when it is not possible to obtain a post-transfusion hemoglobin rapidly enough to keep up with blood loss, bleeding is monitored clinically and RBC units are transfused based on the estimated blood loss, with periodic hemoglobin measurement to assist in monitoring.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3285295102"><span class="h3">Modifications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Certain patients may benefit from (or require) specialized modifications, such as the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Leukoreduction</strong> – Leukoreduction (filtering out white blood cells [WBCs] using an in-line filter) is performed at the time of blood collection in virtually all blood collection facilities in the United States; this is referred to as pre-storage leukoreduction. The main advantages of leukoreduction include reducing febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTRs; especially important in critically ill individuals) and decreasing the risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. There are no adverse complications. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7939.html" rel="external">"Practical aspects of red blood cell transfusion in adults: Storage, processing, modifications, and infusion", section on 'Pre-storage leukoreduction'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7947.html" rel="external">"Immunologic transfusion reactions", section on 'Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Irradiation</strong> – Irradiation is the principle means of preventing transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (ta-GVHD), a fatal complication that occurs when donor WBCs attack the recipient's bone marrow and other tissues as foreign. At-risk recipients include those who are partially HLA-matched with the donor (related family members, individuals from genetically homogenous populations) and those with immunocompromised states. The table summarizes indications for irradiation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119039" href="/d/graphic/119039.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The process slightly reduces the shelf-life of the unit.

As an alternative, some transfusion services substitute blood that has been treated with a pathogen inactivation method, provided that local guidelines permit this approach.

In a randomized trial involving 25 ICUs (27,411 patients), use of small-volume tubes resulted in a small reduction in RBC units transfused per patient (relative risk 0.88, 95% CI 0.77-1.00) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].
