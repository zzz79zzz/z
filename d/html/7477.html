Patients are less likely to respond well to therapy the longer active disease persists, and it is widely accepted that patients with active RA should be treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) at the earliest stage of disease, ideally within less than three months of symptom onset. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7516.html" rel="external">"General principles and overview of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults", section on 'Prognosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7516.html" rel="external">"General principles and overview of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults", section on 'Early use of DMARDs'</a>.)</p><p>The most commonly used DMARD for the initial treatment of RA is <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a> (MTX), although some patients are unable or reluctant to take this drug, and alternative agents are sometimes necessary as the initial DMARD in place of MTX. The choice of therapeutic agents, including both antiinflammatories and DMARDs, is influenced by multiple factors. (See <a class="local">'Approach to management'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7491.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults"</a>.)</p><p>The alternatives to MTX as the initial DMARD for the treatment of patients with active RA will be reviewed here. A more comprehensive description of the general principles of RA management and the initial treatment of RA, as well as the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of RA and the treatment of disease resistant to initial therapy, are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7516.html" rel="external">"General principles and overview of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7491.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7504.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7490.html" rel="external">"Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults resistant to initial conventional synthetic (nonbiologic) DMARD therapy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/103866.html" rel="external">"Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults resistant to initial biologic DMARD therapy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1832024112"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Alternatives to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a> (MTX) are sometimes used for the initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) either because of comorbidities that present an absolute or relative contraindication to MTX, the initial disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) usually employed for treating RA, or because of patient or clinician preferences. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7491.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults"</a>.)</p><p>The choice of the alternative agent to MTX is largely based upon the following: disease severity; comorbidities; patient preferences regarding relative risks and benefits and route of administration; and regulatory, insurance, and cost limitations. It is further shaped by evidence from indirect comparisons and limited head-to-head comparisons. (See <a class="local">'Assessment of disease activity and prognosis'</a> below and <a class="local">'Other management issues'</a> below and <a class="local">'Choice of therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Most patients unable to take MTX can be treated initially with another nonbiologic conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD), such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10097" href="/d/drug information/10097.html" rel="external">leflunomide</a> (LEF). Alternative nonbiologic DMARDs, depending upon comorbidities, disease activity and other factors, include <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9963" href="/d/drug information/9963.html" rel="external">sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ), <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8541" href="/d/drug information/8541.html" rel="external">hydroxychloroquine</a> (HCQ), and other much less frequently used agents. The use of HCQ monotherapy is typically limited to patients with low disease activity.</p><p>In patients unable to use these medications, a biologic agent such as a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor is typically preferred, but several other biologic agents can be used for initial monotherapy. Other potential treatment options include Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, which have been classified as targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2803800215"><span class="h1">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are several general principles that are important in the management of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), regardless of the specific drugs chosen to treat the disease. These principles are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7516.html" rel="external">"General principles and overview of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Briefly, these include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Evaluation and ongoing care by a rheumatologist</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Treatment of all patients diagnosed with RA with disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy to prevent, arrest, or retard disease-related damage</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Achievement and maintenance of tight control of disease activity, defined as remission or a state of low disease activity, without compromising safety</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use of antiinflammatory therapies, including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and glucocorticoids, to help control symptoms until DMARDs take effect</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identification, management, and prevention of comorbid conditions that can complicate the disease course</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use of ancillary therapies, such as exercise and rehabilitation, to optimize patient outcomes</p><p></p><p>Our approach is generally consistent with the recommendations of major groups, such as the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR; formerly known as European League Against Rheumatism) [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1688324126"><span class="h1">ASSESSMENT OF DISEASE ACTIVITY AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients should be assessed for their level of disease activity as a major element in determining drug choice. Adverse prognostic features should also be noted but are of less importance than disease activity in treatment choices.</p><p>Disease activity is best assessed by use of a quantitative composite measure, such as the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI), or Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data (RAPID)-3 [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Adaptations of such measures for use in telehealth visits have also been proposed [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7516.html" rel="external">"General principles and overview of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults", section on 'Assessment and monitoring'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7494.html" rel="external">"Assessment of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity and physical function"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7516.html" rel="external">"General principles and overview of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults", section on 'Overview of assessment and monitoring'</a>.)</p><p>Important elements of the patient assessment include physical function, pain, the number of tender and swollen (ie, inflamed) joints, patient and provider global assessments, and extraarticular disease. We find that the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)-II is a useful measure in clinical practice for routine assessment of functional status at each patient visit; a commonly used alternative measure is the Multidimensional HAQ (MD-HAQ) [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. Laboratory indices of inflammation, including the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, may also be assessed. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring and reevaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Another measure that has been advocated for the assessment of disease activity is a blood test, the proprietary multibiomarker disease activity (MBDA) test, although there is a lack of evidence to support its additional value over standard clinical measures of disease activity as part of routine care [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7503.html" rel="external">"Biologic markers in the assessment of rheumatoid arthritis", section on 'Multi-protein biomarker algorithms'</a>.)</p><p>Compared with the level of disease activity, the presence or absence of features historically predicting a poor prognosis has limited influence on treatment decisions, particularly given the efficacy and relative safety of current treatment approaches, together with the wide acceptance of the importance of starting DMARDs early in all patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7516.html" rel="external">"General principles and overview of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults", section on 'Early use of DMARDs'</a>). Those features predicting a poor prognosis include rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies, functional limitation, extraarticular disease, and the presence of bone erosions on radiographs. The prognosis of RA is discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7516.html" rel="external">"General principles and overview of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults", section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H203751110"><span class="h1">OTHER MANAGEMENT ISSUES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other management issues, in addition to the choice of disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy, are of critical importance in the comprehensive care of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These issues are addressed in detail separately; briefly, they include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nonpharmacologic and preventive therapies</strong> – A number of nonpharmacologic measures and other medical interventions are important in the comprehensive management of RA, in addition to antiinflammatory and antirheumatic drug therapies [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. These interventions, including exercise, rehabilitation, patient education, vaccinations, cardiovascular and fracture risk reduction, and others, are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7498.html" rel="external">"Nonpharmacologic therapies for patients with rheumatoid arthritis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/103773.html" rel="external">"Immunizations in autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pretreatment interventions</strong> – We take a number of important precautions before using DMARDs, including laboratory assessments (complete blood count, serum creatinine, aminotransferases, and other studies as indicated), evaluation of comorbidities, vaccinations, and screening for hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and latent tuberculosis infection. Many rheumatologists obtain a baseline chest radiograph for later comparison if pulmonary issues arise. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/103773.html" rel="external">"Immunizations in autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1411.html" rel="external">"Risk of mycobacterial infection associated with biologic agents and JAK inhibitors"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8017.html" rel="external">"Treatment of tuberculosis infection (latent tuberculosis) in nonpregnant adults without HIV infection"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4380.html" rel="external">"Overview of pleuropulmonary diseases associated with rheumatoid arthritis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/115049.html" rel="external">"Tuberculosis infection (latent tuberculosis) in adults: Approach to diagnosis (screening)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Antiinflammatory symptom management</strong> – We use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or glucocorticoids (systemic and/or intraarticular) for initial symptomatic control of inflammation while awaiting the response to DMARD therapy. We do not use NSAIDs or glucocorticoids as the sole or primary treatments. The use of these medications, including NSAIDs and oral and intraarticular glucocorticoids, is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7491.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults", section on 'Symptomatic treatment with antiinflammatory drugs'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Analgesic (non-antiinflammatory) agents</strong> – In addition to the medications noted above, we use analgesic medications, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> and/or low doses of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10010" href="/d/drug information/10010.html" rel="external">tramadol</a>, if required, for additional pain relief. We avoid the use of stronger opioid analgesics when possible in patients with RA because their pain can typically be controlled by effective use of antiinflammatories and DMARDs that control the disease process. Patients who appear to require opioids for adequate pain relief should be evaluated for other comorbid causes of pain (eg, fracture, tumor, spinal disorders, fibromyalgia, or others).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Drug therapy for flares</strong> – RA has natural exacerbations (also known as flares) and reductions of continuing disease activity. It is important to distinguish a disease flare, characterized by symptoms and physical and laboratory findings of increased inflammatory synovitis, from other causes of joint inflammation (eg, septic arthritis), as well as noninflammatory causes of local or generalized increased pain. The severity of the flare and background drug therapy influence the choice of therapies. Drug therapy for flares is discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7516.html" rel="external">"General principles and overview of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults", section on 'Drug therapy for flares'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3098586387"><span class="h1">INITIAL TREATMENT CHOICES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3409402388"><span class="h2">Choice of therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In most patients who require an alternative to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a> (MTX), we generally use monotherapy with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10097" href="/d/drug information/10097.html" rel="external">leflunomide</a> (LEF) or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9963" href="/d/drug information/9963.html" rel="external">sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ). For patients whose drug choice is not limited by regulatory or insurance restrictions, a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8925" href="/d/drug information/8925.html" rel="external">etanercept</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8583" href="/d/drug information/8583.html" rel="external">adalimumab</a>), <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8526" href="/d/drug information/8526.html" rel="external">abatacept</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10208" href="/d/drug information/10208.html" rel="external">tocilizumab</a> are appropriate options, given the available evidence from randomized trials. Patients with low disease activity may respond to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8541" href="/d/drug information/8541.html" rel="external">hydroxychloroquine</a> (HCQ) alone, or to SSZ. (See <a class="local">'Nonbiologic traditional DMARD alternatives to methotrexate'</a> below and <a class="local">'Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors'</a> below and <a class="local">'Other alternative agents'</a> below.)</p><p>There are insufficient data to determine the optimal initial therapy in patients who require an alternative to MTX. The use of these agents as alternatives when MTX cannot be used is supported by trials comparing biologic or other nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to MTX, which have demonstrated largely similar or occasionally better efficacy of these other agents, although MTX dosing and route of administration have often not been fully optimized in these trials. In particular, the trials have not evaluated split oral dosing for MTX doses above 15 mg/week, where bioavailability is quite variable between individual patients; nor have they evaluated parenteral administration of higher MTX doses, which can enhance efficacy and tolerability. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7507.html" rel="external">"Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis", section on 'Alternatives to once-weekly oral therapy'</a>.)</p><p>There are insufficient direct comparisons of the various non-MTX conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with each other to recommend one specific non-MTX csDMARD over other DMARDs for all patients in this situation. Thus, the choice of agent is largely based upon a combination of factors, including regulatory or insurance requirements, comorbidities and patient preferences regarding relative risks and benefits, route of administration, and cost. (See <a class="local">'Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors'</a> below and <a class="local">'Other alternative agents'</a> below.)</p><p>Several trials have shown greater benefit with Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors than MTX in early RA when they have been directly compared, providing evidence of efficacy in this setting (see <a class="local">'JAK inhibitors'</a> below and <a class="local">'Tofacitinib'</a> below and <a class="local">'Baricitinib'</a> below and <a class="local">'Upadacitinib'</a> below and <a class="local">'Filgotinib'</a> below). However, safety concerns from a phase 3b/4 clinical trial demonstrating a dose-dependent increased risk in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), malignancy, opportunistic infection, venous thromboembolisms (VTEs), and overall mortality with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="87040" href="/d/drug information/87040.html" rel="external">tofacitinib</a> compared with TNF inhibitors in RA patients with cardiovascular risk factors resulted in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-recommending JAK inhibitor utilization only after TNF inhibitor failure so this is no longer an appropriate option for most patients [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/130611.html" rel="external">"Overview of the Janus kinase inhibitors for rheumatologic and other inflammatory disorders", section on 'Pretreatment screening and precautions'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/130611.html" rel="external">"Overview of the Janus kinase inhibitors for rheumatologic and other inflammatory disorders", section on 'Adverse effects'</a>.)</p><p>We take the following general approach:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In most patients with active RA who are unable to use MTX, we suggest an alternative oral csDMARD such as LEF, and less often SSZ, rather than a biologic agent, as initial DMARD therapy. These drugs are taken orally and have a lower risk of serious adverse effects, including infection, than the TNF inhibitors, other biologic DMARDs, and the JAK inhibitors. (See <a class="local">'Nonbiologic traditional DMARD alternatives to methotrexate'</a> below and <a class="local">'Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors'</a> below and <a class="local">'Other alternative agents'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients with moderate to severely active disease or significant functional impairment who are not restricted by regulatory or cost constraints, a TNF inhibitor is a reasonable alternative as the initial agent rather than a csDMARD because of the efficacy and relative rapidity of onset of these drugs.

LEF can also be used for patients unable to use MTX in whom a TNF inhibitor may be preferred, but who are unable to use a biologic DMARD for initial therapy due to regulatory, insurance, or cost limitations. We may also use LEF in patients who have a strong preference for an oral rather than a parenteral agent. In patients unable to use MTX because of liver disease or pregnancy, LEF should be avoided and an alternative such as SSZ may be appropriate. The use and safety of LEF are discussed in detail separately.

Some randomized trials suggest that LEF is more effective than SSZ in achieving a clinical response, decreasing functional disability, and reducing progression of erosive changes [<a href="#rid15">15-18</a>]; others indicate comparable efficacy of the two agents [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]. Additionally, the adverse effect profile of LEF is generally similar to that of MTX, with similar rates of withdrawal for drug toxicity at two years [<a href="#rid19">19,21</a>]. The drug should be avoided in patients with chronic liver disease but may be used in patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction in whom it is safer than MTX. Women of childbearing potential must be on adequate contraception and go through LEF washout prior to pursuing pregnancy.</p><p>The efficacy of LEF was comparable with MTX and superior to placebo in a meta-analysis and in randomized trials comparing these agents, but these trials have been criticized for using lower maximum doses of MTX (up to 15 mg/week) than have subsequently been commonly employed (up to 25 mg/week) [<a href="#rid22">22-25</a>]. As an example, in one trial involving 482 MTX-naïve patients, an American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for 20 percent improvement (ACR20) at one year was achieved in a similar proportion of patients on LEF or on MTX, and this rate was significantly higher than that seen with placebo (52 and 46 percent versus 26 percent) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. LEF has not been directly compared with the TNF inhibitors, but the superiority of TNF inhibitors is suggested by several observations; these include the comparability of LEF to SSZ and to sometimes suboptimal doses of MTX, the more rapid effects and greater overall benefit of TNF inhibitors when they have been directly compared with MTX or SSZ, and clinical experience. Additional data describing the efficacy of LEF, particularly in patients resistant to initial DMARD therapy, are described separately.

SSZ can also be used as an alternative to HCQ in patients with less severe disease. SSZ alone (begun at 500 mg twice daily and gradually increased [eg, by 500 mg per week] to up to 3000 mg daily divided into two or three doses) or in combination with HCQ was effective in trials including patients with early, severely active RA [<a href="#rid12">12,14</a>]. The use of SSZ in this group is also consistent with the recommendations of the ACR [<a href="#rid12">12,26</a>]. A trial of SSZ can also be used regardless of the presence of adverse prognostic features if needed, particularly in patients with low to low-to-moderate disease activity.</p><p>SSZ may be used as monotherapy but is most commonly used in the United States together with other DMARDs, typically in combination with MTX and/or HCQ (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7490.html" rel="external">"Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults resistant to initial conventional synthetic (nonbiologic) DMARD therapy", section on 'DMARD triple therapy'</a>). The efficacy of SSZ monotherapy in the treatment of RA has been evaluated and documented in numerous randomized trials [<a href="#rid18">18,27-36</a>]. In at least one randomized trial, the combination of SSZ and HCQ demonstrated efficacy that was similar to that of MTX monotherapy, suggesting that this combination may also be a reasonable alternative therapeutic combination in patients unable to take MTX [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].</p><p>SSZ, rather than HCQ alone, should be used, either by itself or combined with HCQ, in those with relatively more severe disease because it is more effective than monotherapy with HCQ [<a href="#rid34">34</a>], although it may be less well tolerated.</p><p>In a meta-analysis of eight randomized trials involving 903 patients, active therapy with SSZ was significantly more effective than placebo [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].

Although SSZ works more quickly than HCQ and has greater clinical efficacy, it is not as well tolerated as HCQ [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].

In trials using lower doses of MTX than have subsequently been employed, SSZ was comparable to both MTX and LEF, although persistence on therapy over 24 months was poor. A number of trials comparing SSZ with the various nonbiologic (conventional) DMARDs have been performed [<a href="#rid39">39-43</a>], including comparisons with MTX [<a href="#rid44">44,45</a>].</p><p>Treatment adherence with SSZ regimens can be more difficult than with other DMARDs, given the need for two to three times daily administration of a total of four to six pills, as well as the occurrence of side effects, which may also limit its use in some patients [<a href="#rid46">46,47</a>].</p><p>The adverse reactions described for SSZ are either idiosyncratic (eg, hypersensitivity or immune-related), such as skin reactions, agranulocytosis (eg, acute neutropenia), or hepatitis; or dose-related, such as gastrointestinal upset, headache, leukopenia, or anemia [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. The idiosyncratic reactions require permanent drug discontinuation, while the dose-related effects may be managed by dose reduction. Approximately 20 to 25 percent of patients withdraw from clinical trials because of intolerable side effects [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. Two-thirds of such withdrawals result from symptoms due to gastrointestinal and central nervous system toxicity (including headache), and approximately 4 to 5 percent because of rash [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

(See <a class="local">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Choice of therapy</strong> – The choice of the disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) to employ as an alternative to MTX is largely based upon evidence from indirect comparisons and limited head-to-head comparisons; disease severity, comorbidities, patient preferences regarding relative risks and benefits and route of administration; and regulatory, insurance, and cost limitations. (See <a class="local">'Approach to management'</a> above and <a class="local">'Choice of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment approach</strong> – In most patients with active RA who are unable to use MTX as their initial DMARD, we suggest <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10097" href="/d/drug information/10097.html" rel="external">leflunomide</a> (LEF) rather than another conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) or a biologic DMARD (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). We generally prefer LEF (20 mg daily) over <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9963" href="/d/drug information/9963.html" rel="external">sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ) because it may have greater efficacy, especially for the treatment of moderate to severely active RA. The advantages of LEF over tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are that it is taken orally and has a lower risk of serious adverse effects, including infection. However, other agents are reasonable alternatives to LEF, particularly in the following settings:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Liver disease</strong> – In patients unable to use MTX because of liver disease, LEF should also be avoided and an alternative such as SSZ (1 to 1.5 g twice daily) or a TNF inhibitor (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8925" href="/d/drug information/8925.html" rel="external">etanercept</a> 50 mg subcutaneously once weekly or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8583" href="/d/drug information/8583.html" rel="external">adalimumab</a> 40 mg subcutaneously every two weeks), unless otherwise contraindicated, should be used. (See <a class="local">'Sulfasalazine'</a> above and <a class="local">'Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>High disease activity and significant functional impairment</strong> – TNF inhibitors (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8925" href="/d/drug information/8925.html" rel="external">etanercept</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8583" href="/d/drug information/8583.html" rel="external">adalimumab</a>) are reasonable alternatives for initial therapy in patients with moderate to high disease activity or significant functional impairment who are not restricted by regulatory or cost constraints. (See <a class="local">'Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Mild disease</strong> – In patients who have low disease activity, we suggest <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8541" href="/d/drug information/8541.html" rel="external">hydroxychloroquine</a> (HCQ) as the initial alternative DMARD to MTX, rather than a more potent csDMARD or biologic DMARD (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). We would also use HCQ in patients with findings limited to mild inflammatory arthritis and a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test, in whom a distinction cannot be made between early RA and early systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The typical dose is 200 to 400 mg daily, but no more than 5 mg/kg/day calculated based upon actual body weight. LEF and SSZ are other reasonable alternatives for this population. (See <a class="local">'Limited arthritis'</a> above and <a class="local">'General approach'</a> above and <a class="local">'Hydroxychloroquine'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Pregnancy considerations</strong> – Reasonable options if pregnancy is anticipated include SSZ, HCQ in patients with mild disease, or a TNF inhibitor, while LEF should be avoided. The choice of drugs in pregnancy, including choices between TNF inhibitors, is described separately. (See <a class="local">'Pregnancy, comorbidities, and other special considerations'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7514.html" rel="external">"Rheumatoid arthritis and pregnancy"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Alternative therapies</strong> – Additional reasonable alternatives that can be effective as initial monotherapy are <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8526" href="/d/drug information/8526.html" rel="external">abatacept</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10208" href="/d/drug information/10208.html" rel="external">tocilizumab</a>, biologic DMARDs usually administered by subcutaneous injection. However, abatacept and tocilizumab are rarely available for this group of patients due to regulatory and/or cost constraints. Patient preference regarding route of administration, regulatory and cost constraints, and clinician experience with these agents are the major factors usually determining choice in a given patient. (See <a class="local">'Choice of therapy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Other alternative agents'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring</strong> – During the initial treatment of patients with active RA, the patient should be reevaluated every four to eight weeks to assess the effectiveness of therapy and to monitor for possible drug toxicity. We advise the periodic reevaluation of disease activity using a quantitative composite measure at each assessment. In patients who fail to achieve remission or low disease activity within three months of initiating therapy or who require more than 5 to 7.5 mg/day of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> or equivalent glucocorticoid to maintain a state of remission or low disease activity, we use a more potent DMARD or combination of DMARDs rather than continuing the same treatment for a greater duration.
