         At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. Subsequently, the infection has spread throughout the world, resulting in a global pandemic. The coronavirus is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the illness it causes is coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

         This topic will present issues relevant to care in nursing homes (NHs), most of which are licensed and serve as both long-term care and skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). In this topic, we refer to "patients and residents" as "residents," while acknowledging the heterogeneity of the typical population in a NH that serves as both a long-term care facility and SNF (ie, long-stay "residents" and short-stay "patients").

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Nursing homes (NHs) have played a central role in the COVID-19 outbreaks in the United States, a fact first recognized after an outbreak in a NH in Kirkland, Washington resulted in several deaths [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Since then, further outbreaks have underscored the enormous risk of COVID-19 in the older NH population [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Updated case counts and deaths for residents and staff can be found on the Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services (CMS)
         <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdata.cms.gov%2Fcovid-19%2Fcovid-19-nursing-home-data&amp;token=Vbvp5yuAkbU9cg88%2Fbeow1iQS7hBtQ4QErKdTcDexaWJSyyqjgw5oNytAqto79soKvqknA6jRGITOsNk1z2Gjg%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=128349" target="_blank">

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         COVID-19 disproportionately affects NH populations due to the high proportion of frail older adults and those with underlying chronic conditions [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. These factors increase both the prevalence and severity of infection, resulting in high mortality rates. Clusters of infections have been blind to the quality of the NH; even the best-prepared, highest-quality, and most well-resourced facilities have had tragic clusters of infections with high mortality rates. However, NHs with nurse staffing shortages, and those with more crowding (those with an equal mix of double- and quadruple-occupancy rooms versus an equal mix of single- and double-occupancy rooms), may be more susceptible to the spread of COVID-19 [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-7
         </a>
         ]. Additionally, there appear to be racial and ethnic disparities in NH COVID-19 cases and deaths [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. In one study, nursing homes that cared for a high number (&gt;30 percent) of residents in underrepresented racial and ethnic groups reported more weekly new COVID-19 cases compared with those who cared for a low number (&lt;2.9 percent; 1.5 versus 0.4 cases per facility) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to the risks inherent in the resident population, NHs are "tinderboxes" for recurrent clusters of infections due to the high resident to health care personnel (HCP) ratios, the closed environment, and use of resident common spaces [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Additionally, residents with dementia present unique challenges such as difficulties in maintaining isolation, due to wandering, and the need for high-contact care. Patients with dementia also appear to be at greater risk of severe disease [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Although there is an intense regulatory and industry focus on infection control, staff in many NHs were working with inadequate testing capability and shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the first several months of the pandemic, which undermined even the best efforts at infection control. Availability of testing and PPE has now greatly improved in most NHs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Vaccination (along with other infection control measures) has led to a decrease in the risk of COVID-19 in NHs. However, vaccination appears to be insufficient to completely prevent outbreaks of infection in NH settings. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Vaccination'

         </span>
         To help reduce the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in nursing homes (NHs), certain general measures should be implemented. These include vaccination of residents and staff, implementing certain visitor restrictions, use of source control (eg, masks), symptom screening, and testing of both residents and health care personnel (HCP). It is important that these general measures be put in place, since asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission can occur and symptom screening alone may not detect all cases of COVID-19 [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in a multistate study of 182 skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) in 20 states with at least one COVID-19 case as of July 15, 2020, there were 5403 resident cases, of which 2194 (40.6 percent) were asymptomatic, 1033 (19.1 percent) were presymptomatic, and 2176 (40.3 percent) were symptomatic at presentation [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that each facility designate an individual with infection prevention and control training to provide on-site management [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Specific infection control measures are impacted by the degree of community transmission.
        </p>
        <p>
         During the initial stages of the pandemic, strategies to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection in NHs also included discontinuing use of common dining areas, canceling all group activities, restricting patient movement within the facility, and eliminating use of volunteers and other nonessential vendors [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14-16
         </a>
         ]. In coordination with federal and state agencies, most facilities have resumed certain activities based upon resident vaccination status and community transmission rates.

          —
         </span>
         During the COVID-19 pandemic, NHs restricted visitors in the health care setting. Initially, visitation was primarily limited to end-of-life situations (defined as death estimated in hours to days); however, over time, institutions started to liberalize restrictions (eg, limited socially distanced outdoor visits) given the psychological harm strict visitor restrictions can have on residents, families, and other loved ones [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17-19
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Social isolation'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In the United States, the CDC supports relaxing restrictions on indoor visitation for residents unless the resident is recovering from COVID-19 or is in quarantine after an exposure [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. There may be additional restrictions during an outbreak setting or when there is substantial or high community transmission. The approach to liberalizing visits within a facility should be made in conjunction with local departments of public health. More detailed information on visitation in NHs can be found on the CDC
         <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fhcp%2Finfection-control-recommendations.html&amp;token=ZQMismBtcAxxH%2BuE1Hb32uHIewehjc%2FiwHtMHIQSTPbwuItCsM4nAdpKzURPU7Kozsy3NLgl%2FFzswTV7i1StbYmm1p%2FfEUm72XoaGHo5Tro%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=128349" target="_blank">

         Depending upon institutional policy, certain precautions should still be taken regardless of resident or visitor vaccination status. These may include:

         Visitors should not be allowed to enter the facility if they have a fever or symptoms of COVID-19, were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the prior 10 days, or have had prolonged close contact (within six feet of an infected person for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period) with someone with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the prior 10 days. These criteria differ from community criteria for discontinuing isolation or quarantine. (See

         During the COVID-19 pandemic, all visitors, residents, and HCP were required to wear masks when in the NH setting. Over time, the need for universal masking has been dictated by the specific institution, and depends in part on the degree of
         <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcovid.cdc.gov%2Fcovid-data-tracker%2F%23datatracker-home&amp;token=GDOHlJesKJxD%2BqMepjAIW9a31twICI2FmC%2FbTQUSZdV1k9DU5YjYjAI5UIHDNqhWzesYcHRq91J8%2FN3XJYVGog%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=128349" target="_blank">
          community transmission
         </a>
         . The goal of universal masking is to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from unsuspected virus carriers [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20,21
         </a>
         ]. However, masks or respirators with exhalation valves or vents are
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         considered sufficient for source control (ie, containing respiratory secretions) [

          Residents
         </strong>
         – When possible, residents should wear a well-fitting mask when leaving their room or when they are within six feet of any other individual [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. However, this can be challenging in dementia units where residents may not have the cognitive capacity to wear a mask and where social distancing can also be difficult to maintain. When such residents do not adhere to wearing a mask, the use of enhanced infection control precautions (eg, eye and face protection) by HCP provides additional protection, even when interacting with those who are not suspected of having COVID-19.

          Indications
         </strong>
         – Staff and residents of long-term care facilities, including those who have had prior COVID-19 infection, should be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 unless there is a contraindication (eg, allergic reactions to the vaccines or their components) [

         In long-term care facilities in the United States, vaccination coverage has been relatively high among residents, but it has been lower among staff. In a report that evaluated vaccine uptake in 11,460 facilities during the first month of a vaccine rollout program, a median of 78 percent of residents received one of the available COVID-19 vaccines, whereas only 38 percent of staff members were vaccinated [

         Improving vaccination in HCP in the NH setting is important since low staff vaccination rates have been associated with an increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths among residents. In a study of over 12,000 United States NHs comparing facilities with low and high staff vaccination coverage, staff vaccination had the most effect on resident outcomes in counties with the highest prevalence of COVID-19. In such counties, there was an estimated 1.56 additional COVID-19 cases per 100 beds, and an additional 0.19 COVID-19–related deaths per 100 beds among residents in facilities with the lowest versus highest staff vaccination coverage [

          Considerations after vaccination
         </strong>
         – After receiving the vaccine, residents may experience common side effects (eg, fever, fatigue, headache, chills, myalgia, arthralgia), which may be similar to some of the clinical features of COVID-19. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128323.html" rel="external">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In the United States, the CDC has provided guidance to help providers when this situation occurs [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. As an example, there are certain signs and symptoms that are consistent with infection rather than vaccination, such as cough, shortness of breath, and/or loss of taste or smell. If these are present, patients should be evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious etiologies, and clinicians should use infection control precautions for those with suspected COVID-19 pending the evaluation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Infection control precautions'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For patients with clinical findings that could be consistent with either vaccination or infection, the CDC states the following approach is reasonable [

         Patients should be restricted to their room and providers should ideally use PPE required for caring for a patient with suspected COVID-19. (See
         <a class="local">
          'When caring for residents with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'

         Testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed if the resident is in a facility with active transmission, had prolonged close contact with someone with COVID-19 in the prior 14 days, or has symptoms that have persisted for at least two days.

          Efficacy –
         </strong>
         Vaccination (along with other infection control measures) has contributed to a decrease in the risk of COVID-19 in NHs [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29-33
         </a>
         ]. Early in the pandemic, a comparison of NHs based on vaccination status found a greater decrease in COVID-19 cases among both residents and staff in 797 NHs that had administered the first dose of vaccine within the preceding three weeks compared with 1709 facilities that had not yet initiated vaccination (48 versus 21 percent decline in resident cases, 33 versus 18 percent decline in staff cases) [
         <a href="#rid29">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Some data suggest that bivalent booster doses have provided additional protection in those who previously received monovalent vaccines. In a report that evaluated 192,289 facility-weeks from October 10, 2022 to January 8, 2023, residents who were up to date with their recommended COVID-19 vaccines (including bivalent booster doses) had a 30 to 50 percent lower risk for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with residents who were not up to date with COVID-19 vaccines [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. Incidence rates among residents who were up to date with COVID-19 vaccination ranged from 7.2 to 15.6 per 1000 residents during this period; by contrast, the incidence rates in those who were not up to date ranged from 9.5 to 18.8 per 1000 residents.

         Throughout the pandemic, recommendations regarding the need for universal screening and testing have evolved, and depend upon institutional policy [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,35
         </a>
         ]. Priorities for universal testing should include facilities that have a known infection in one or more residents or HCP and facilities in communities with a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
        </p>
        <p>
         Early identification of cases of COVID-19 is particularly important in long-term care facilities since rapid spread of infections associated with high case fatality rates has been repeatedly reported [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Repeated point prevalence testing can identify asymptomatic residents and help guide efforts to reduce transmission [

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, both contact tracing and facility-wide testing should be performed when residents or HCP with COVID-19 are identified [

         Contact tracing typically involves determining if staff members and residents interacted using appropriate PPE (eg, mask on the resident and appropriate PPE for the staff member); which units the staff members or residents were on; if residents were outside of their room without appropriate PPE, and whether residents or staff members were potentially exposed outside of the building. Based upon this information, the approach to quarantine can be determined.

         The approach to testing in residents and HCP, including which test to use, is described below and depends in part on degree of community transmission and presence of an outbreak. (See

         Several studies have demonstrated the benefit of universal testing prior to widespread vaccination [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36,39
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in a study of 11 Maryland long-term care facilities, 153 cases of COVID-19 were identified based on targeted symptom-based testing; universal testing of the remaining residents identified an additional 354 cases (39.6 percent of those tested), of which more than one-half were asymptomatic [

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Studies have also looked at the impact of universal screening during various periods of the epidemic. One retrospective cohort study evaluated the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 screening among staff members and the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths among residents during potential outbreaks in 13,424 skilled nursing facilities before vaccine approval, before the B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant wave, and during the omicron wave [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. Over the course of the study (2020 to 2022), facilities who did the most testing (approximately 1.7 tests per staff member per week) had a lower number of COVID-19 cases and deaths than facilities who did the least amount of testing (approximately 0.6 tests per staff member per week). There were 519.7 versus 591 COVID-19 cases per 100 potential outbreaks for high- and low-testing facilities, respectively (adjusted difference -71.5, 95% CI -91.3 to -51.6), and there were 42.7 versus 49.8 deaths per 100 potential outbreaks (adjusted difference -7.1, 95% CI -11.0 to -3.2). The impact of screening was greatest before the widespread availability of vaccines.

Since older adults with COVID-19 may not show typical symptoms (eg, fever or respiratory symptoms, loss of smell), the CDC recommends that more than two temperatures &gt;99.0°F, as well as the presence of atypical symptoms, such as worsening malaise, new dizziness, or diarrhea, prompt isolation and further evaluation for COVID-19 [

         After that, practices vary.

         Several tests are available for detecting infection with SARS-CoV-2  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). The preferred test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in NH residents and staff is typically a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) using a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Tests should have a sensitivity of 95 percent and specificity of 90 percent. In the United States, these should be emergency-use tests authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128404.html" rel="external">
          "COVID-19: Diagnosis", section on 'NAAT (including RT-PCR)'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, antigen testing may be preferred in certain settings (eg, limited availability of PCR testing or long turnaround times). Although antigen tests are typically less sensitive than RT-PCR, results can be available rapidly (approximately 15 minutes), which is important in implementing effective infection control strategies [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41-43
         </a>
         ]. Antigen testing is also preferred when testing is required for asymptomatic people who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the prior 90 days, since some people may remain NAAT positive but not be infectious during this period. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128404.html" rel="external">
          "COVID-19: Diagnosis", section on 'Antigen testing'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         When an antigen test is used, confirmatory nucleic acid testing (eg, RT-PCR) should generally be performed in asymptomatic HCP and residents whose antigen test is positive, as well as in those who are symptomatic when the antigen test is negative [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. Some institutions do confirmatory testing for all symptomatic persons (even if the antigen test is positive); this is particularly important when cohorting residents with COVID-19 together.
        </p>

         Confirmatory testing should be performed within 48 hours of the antigen test. Pending the results, HCP should be excluded from work and should quarantine; residents should be placed in a private room and infection control precautions used for patients with COVID-19 should be implemented until the diagnosis is confirmed.

         Testing is generally not recommended for asymptomatic people who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the prior 30 days.

         The use of aerosol-generating procedures should be minimized in all patients to reduce the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. As an example, nebulizer treatments should be changed to metered-dose inhalers unless nebulizer treatment is deemed essential for an individual resident. In these instances, HCP should use enhanced infection control precautions when administering the nebulizer treatment (or any other aerosol-generating procedures, such as continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP], bilevel PAP [BPAP], deep suctioning of tracheostomies, high-flow oxygen administration, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR]).

         Residents with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be in a private room, when possible. However, when private isolation rooms are not available, residents with confirmed COVID-19 may be roomed together, assuming there are no other contraindications (eg, drug-resistant organism).

         Facilities should identify an area to care for residents with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and dedicated staff should be assigned to work only in that area of the facility. If the facility has airborne infection isolation rooms (ie, single-resident, negative-pressure rooms), they should be prioritized for residents who require aerosol-generating procedures (eg, residents with tracheostomies requiring nebulizer treatments). When this is not possible, a private room should be used and the door kept closed. If available, a portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter can be used.

         When there is ongoing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, certain enhanced infection control precautions (eg, goggles or face shields) should be used in addition to standard precautions and universal masking, regardless of the individual suspicion for COVID-19. The types of precautions depend on the degree of community transmission and whether the health care worker is providing routine care or is involved with high-risk procedures (eg, aerosol-generating procedures or treatments).

         Any patient transferred to a NH or SNF with symptoms of COVID-19 should be isolated, regardless of vaccination status. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Isolation for residents with confirmed or suspected infection'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>

         Our general approach to asymptomatic residents is as follows:

         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         require additional isolation precautions upon return to the NH. This includes those who met criteria using a non-test-based strategy  (

          table 2
         </a>
         ). However, residents who are ready to be discharged prior to meeting these criteria should continue to adhere to the infection prevention and control recommendations described above. (See
         <a class="local">
          'When caring for residents with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         If a test-based strategy was used and the patient has prolonged shedding, there is no specific guidance on when the isolation/quarantine can be discontinued. Thus, the decision to discontinue the isolation/quarantine must take into consideration the duration time since diagnosis, the resident’s underlying conditions, how long the resident has been clinically improved, the psychological effects of prolonged isolation, and the risk of transmission to HCP and other residents (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127501.html" rel="external">

         – Patients without known COVID-19 who are transferred to a NH or SNF should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 within the 48 hours prior to transfer. Residents should also have a series of two viral tests for SARS-COV-2 infection: immediately and, if negative, again three and five days after their admission [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13

         <a href="#rid14">
          14-16
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         However, the approach to new or returning residents in individual communities can vary and depends upon guidance from local health officials. As an example, institutions have varying requirements for the number of tests required prior to entry into the facility and the duration of quarantine once they arrive (eg, 7 versus 10 days). In some states, quarantine is required for all residents who leave the building for more than 24 hours.

         The pandemic has presented nursing home (NH) staff and clinicians with several opportunities to reinforce and build on resident management strategies in order to both prevent excess COVID-19 cases and improve care. The strategies below are for all residents, regardless of known COVID-19 infection, as all residents are at risk and asymptomatic infections are common.

         </span>
         For the last decade, NHs have been under increasing pressure to reduce hospital transfers due to financial incentives and regulatory guidance. To minimize the risk of hospital-acquired infections, it is especially important to reduce unnecessary transfers because they expose vulnerable NH residents not only to hospital-acquired conditions but potentially to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as other respiratory viruses.
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Several tools and strategies are available for NHs that can help achieve this goal through the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine (AMDA) and the Interventions to Reduce Acute Care Transfers Program (INTERACT) [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. These strategies generally include using tools and alerts to identify changes in condition early, structured communication with health care personnel (HCP) in the NH and between the NH and hospital, and the use of decision support tools to identify when a clinician should be notified immediately about a specific change in condition.
        </p>

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         Improved communication and collaborative relationships with local hospitals and health systems are useful to minimize transfers as well as review interfacility transfer policies and efforts to educate nurses, advance practice clinicians, and clinicians.

         Engaging all residents and families or other loved ones in advance care planning discussions and updating advance directives as appropriate can guide decision-making on the appropriateness of hospital transfers. This is especially important in situations where intensive care unit beds and respirators are in short supply [

         The pandemic adds impetus to complete and document advance directives in order to continue to improve end-of-life care. Some NH residents have advanced illnesses and many are at the end of life. If they acquire the virus and develop symptoms of COVID-19, they may rapidly deteriorate with respiratory distress. Transfer to hospital and respiratory care in the intensive care unit may be unnecessarily burdensome to these residents and their families.

         In general, there should be no changes to routine vaccination recommendations for NH residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there may be consideration for the timing of routine vaccinations with respect to COVID-19 vaccination. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129849.html" rel="external">
          "COVID-19: Vaccines", section on 'Other administration issues'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In particular, NHs should prioritize early vaccination of patients against influenza. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3807.html" rel="external">
          "Principles of infection control in long-term care facilities", section on 'Residents'

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Staff should also receive influenza vaccination unless they have a clear contraindication. Immunity among the staff is a major factor in preventing the spread of the illness among NH residents, many of whom do not have a robust immune response to the vaccination. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3889.html" rel="external">
          "Immunizations for health care providers", section on 'Influenza vaccine'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, as is the case with other acute illnesses, in persons with acute COVID-19, vaccination should be delayed until the acute illness has resolved. This approach is supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in their guidance on influenza vaccination [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ], and it is reasonable to extrapolate this same principle to other routine vaccinations.

         Health care personnel (HCP) support is of particular concern in facilities where multiple residents have died. Although hospice can provide support for HCP, facility-wide support should be made available to all staff. Many HCP are at risk for burnout because of understaffing, delaying time off, illness of family members, fear of getting sick themselves, day care and school closures, and reduced income because of loss of work of family members. Facilities need a multipronged approach to support their staff. Examples include HCP education on safe and effective use of personal protective equipment (PPE), supplying meals/snacks, opportunities to relax/meditate, flexibility on time off policies so that accrued time off is not lost, and ongoing financial support during times of illness, especially if COVID-19-related.

          Impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in nursing homes

         – COVID-19 disproportionately affects nursing home (NH) populations due to the high proportion of older adults and those with underlying chronic conditions. In addition, NHs are "tinderboxes" for recurrent clusters of infections due to the high resident to health care personnel (HCP) ratios, the closed environment, the use of resident common spaces, and the unique challenges of residents with dementia who have difficulty adhering to social distancing and universal masking policies.

          Overview of measures to prevent infection
         </strong>
         – To help reduce the introduction and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), certain general measures should be implemented in the NH setting in areas of ongoing transmission. Depending upon institutional policy, these may include vaccination, certain visitor restrictions, universal use of source control (eg, masks), symptom screening, and testing of asymptomatic residents and HCP in certain settings.

          Vaccination
         </strong>
         – Staff and residents of long-term care facilities, including those who have had prior COVID-19 infection, should be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2  (

         After receiving the vaccine, individuals may experience common side effects (eg, fever, fatigue, headache, chills, myalgia, arthralgia), which may be similar to some of the clinical features of COVID-19. In this setting, management depends upon the types of symptoms that are present, duration of symptoms, and the risk for disease. (See

          Infection control precautions for those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19
         </strong>
         – The following types of infection control precautions should be used when caring for those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in the NH setting, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status (see
         <a class="local">
          'Infection control precautions'

         Residents with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be placed in a private room when possible. However, when private isolation rooms are not available, residents with confirmed COVID-19 may be roomed together, assuming there are no other contraindications (eg, drug-resistant organism). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Isolation for residents with confirmed or suspected infection'

         HCP should wear a gown, gloves, a respirator or medical mask, and eye or face protection (goggles or face shields). For respiratory protection, an N95 respirator should be used for all aerosol-generating procedures. We suggest an N95 respirator rather than a medical mask (eg, surgical mask) when caring for all residents with suspected or confirmed COVID-19; however, medical masks are an alternative for routine care when personal protective equipment (PPE) is severely limited. If respirators with exhalation valves or vents are used, a medical mask should be placed on top of it, since these types of respirators are not sufficient for source control. (See

         Most patients can discontinue precautions using a non-test-based strategy  (

          table 2
         </a>
         ) since data suggest that prolonged viral RNA shedding after symptom resolution is not clearly associated with prolonged infectiousness. However, a test-based strategy is generally preferred for those who are moderately to severely immunocompromised. (See

         <strong>
          Precautions for those without COVID-19
         </strong>
         – When there is ongoing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, certain enhanced infection control precautions (eg, goggles or face shields) should be used in addition to standard precautions and universal masking, regardless of the individual suspicion for COVID-19. The types of precautions are dictated by institutional policy, and depend on the degree of community transmission and whether the health care worker is providing routine care or is involved with high-risk procedures (eg, aerosol-generating procedures or treatments). (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          New or returning residents
         </strong>
         – The approach to new or returning residents can vary. In general, residents without known COVID-19 who are being admitted to a NH facility should have negative testing for SARS-CoV-2 within the 48 hours prior to transfer regardless of vaccination status. In addition, patients should be tested after arrival. (See
         <a class="local">

          Advance care planning
         </strong>
         – Advance care planning, in particular Do Not Hospitalize Orders, should be discussed for residents in whom the risks and discomforts of hospitalization outweigh the benefits. Palliative care consultations and hospice can provide support for families and residents who are nearing the end of life. (See

         <strong>
          Addressing the psychological impact
         </strong>
         – Psychological stress affects both residents and HCP. Residents are impacted by social isolation and efforts to enhance social engagement are essential. HCP are at risk of burnout and will need multipronged support strategies, including flexible time off policies and financial support during personal or family illness. (See
