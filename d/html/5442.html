Early pregnancy loss, which occurs in the first trimester (ie, up to 12+6 weeks gestation), is the most common type. Individuals experiencing pregnancy loss are evaluated for conditions that require emergency treatment and then counseled regarding the different management options, which include expectant, medication, and surgical management.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical presentation and initial evaluation of patients with pregnancy loss up to 20 weeks of gestation.

We recognize that not all people capable of pregnancy identify as female and we encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling needs of transmasculine and gender expansive individuals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3824688773"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H693806400"><span class="h2">Uncomplicated bleeding and cramping</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Uncomplicated bleeding and cramping, the most common symptoms of individuals with pregnancy loss, imply that the patient is hemodynamically stable, at low risk of becoming hemodynamically unstable based on the volume of bleeding, and without evidence of infection. Additional symptoms of uncomplicated pregnancy loss may also include a loss or reduction of pregnancy symptoms, such as decreased breast tenderness and/or nausea and vomiting. While bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy is fairly common, not all individuals with first-trimester bleeding and/or cramping will experience pregnancy loss; other causes of these symptoms, such as ectopic pregnancy, should be excluded [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bleeding</strong> – Bleeding during pregnancy is common. The volume of vaginal bleeding with pregnancy loss varies considerably, particularly by gestational age, and patients often report passing clots or tissue. Generally, neither the volume of bleeding nor self-reported passage of tissue are sufficient to confirm pregnancy loss without further evaluation, which typically includes a pelvic ultrasound. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Incidence</strong> – In an observational study of 550 pregnant individuals, 117 (21 percent) experienced bleeding before 20 weeks gestation and 67 (12 percent of entire group) ended in loss [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Of the 117 individuals with bleeding, 59 (50 percent) experienced loss. Two additional losses occurred without bleeding. A different prospective study of over 400 pregnant people documented early pregnancy loss in 12 percent of those with first-trimester vaginal bleeding [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Timing of bleeding and pregnancy loss</strong> – A prospective study of 701 patients reported that isolated vaginal bleeding at six to eight weeks of gestation was associated with the greatest increased risk of pregnancy loss (risk difference 56 percent, 95% CI 38-75) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. However, as early pregnancy loss commonly occurs at six to eight weeks of gestation, bleeding is likely a symptom of loss and not the etiology. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cramping and/or pain</strong> – The pain that occurs with pregnancy loss is often crampy in nature and can be mild to severe, especially during passage of gestational tissue. The pain can be constant or intermittent and is often associated with vaginal bleeding. Options for pain management for individuals experiencing pregnancy loss are discussed in expectant management. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128965.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy loss (miscarriage): Description of management techniques", section on 'Expectant management'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>As bleeding and cramping are also symptoms of other early pregnancy complications, including ectopic and molar pregnancy, pregnant individuals with vaginal bleeding or pelvic pain should be evaluated promptly. In these situations, ultrasound imaging is typically needed for a complete assessment, particularly in cases when the provider cannot confirm that pregnancy tissue has passed spontaneously  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef88947" href="/d/graphic/88947.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6799.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and differential diagnosis of vaginal bleeding before 20 weeks of gestation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5487.html" rel="external">"Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H857077905"><span class="h2">Complicated (hemorrhage and/or infection)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common complications associated with pregnancy loss are hemorrhage and infection, which can be severe, and at times require emergency intervention. Risk of both generally increases with increasing gestational age of loss beyond 13 weeks gestation.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hemorrhage</strong> – While vaginal bleeding is common in patients with pregnancy loss, onset of severe hemorrhage can necessitate transfusion and surgical evacuation. Those with severe hemorrhage typically present with heavy vaginal bleeding combined with orthostatic vital signs, anemia, and/or tachycardia. The overall risk of severe hemorrhage that requires hospitalization is low at approximately 1 percent [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Hemorrhage'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Infection</strong> – Signs and symptoms of infection include abdominal or pelvic pain, uterine tenderness, purulent discharge, and/or systemic signs of infection, such as fever, tachycardia, or hypotension. The incidence of intrauterine infection with pregnancy loss increases with increasing gestational age; it is approximately 15 percent in the first 12 weeks, then as much as 66 percent for losses between 12 and 24 weeks [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], particularly for those in whom there has been a long delay between symptom onset and diagnosis of pregnancy loss or between diagnosis of pregnancy loss and expulsion of the pregnancy [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Intrauterine infection can occur spontaneously or can follow medical or surgical interventions. Although infection may be asymptomatic and undiagnosed outside of study settings, patients diagnosed with clinically symptomatic infection are not candidates for expectant or medical management of pregnancy loss. Individuals with severe infection leading to hemodynamic instability have a septic abortion and require emergency evaluation and treatment. (See <a class="local">'Septic abortion'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Groups with increased risk </strong>– Individuals with poor access to health care or with delayed identification of pregnancy loss may be more likely to have spontaneous passage of gestational tissue (and resultant hemorrhage) or complications such as infection [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Individuals who may be less likely to expect or recognize their pregnancy early in gestation, such as adolescents, perimenopausal people, or those with irregular menses, might also be at higher risk of later presentation and/or complications.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3570587120"><span class="h2">Asymptomatic or incidental</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Highly sensitive pregnancy tests and ultrasounds enable diagnosis of pregnancy loss before the onset of symptoms. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/130879.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy loss (miscarriage): Ultrasound diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1149019927"><span class="h2">Complete versus incomplete pregnancy loss</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition to the presence or absence of symptoms, individuals with pregnancy loss can be further characterized by whether there is complete or incomplete emptying of the uterus. The presence of symptoms, as discussed above, and/or retained intrauterine tissue helps determine treatment options and helps guide patients in their decision-making.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complete </strong>– This phrase is used to describe patients with an empty uterus after documentation of prior intrauterine pregnancy. This is important since an empty uterus can be seen by ultrasound in the setting of normal early pregnancy that is too early to visualize, miscarriage, or ectopic pregnancy. The phrase can be applied to those with an empty uterus following pregnancy loss or termination, regardless of how the loss or termination was managed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Incomplete </strong>– This wording refers to tissue retained within the uterus (gestational sac or fetal or placental tissue). Incomplete pregnancy loss can occur after partial spontaneous passage of pregnancy tissue or following medical or surgical treatment. It is often symptomatic, but the absence of symptoms does not exclude the possibility of retained tissue.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2200049448"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once an intrauterine pregnancy is identified on ultrasound, pregnancy loss is diagnosed if any subsequent ultrasound (performed routinely or for symptoms) shows no intrauterine pregnancy or loss of previously seen cardiac activity. Alternately, single-ultrasound criteria exist, and selection of criteria is tailored to the patient's preferences and clinical scenario. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/130879.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy loss (miscarriage): Ultrasound diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H331338608"><span class="h1">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most individuals with bleeding during pregnancy will not experience pregnancy loss [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Approach to the pregnant patient with bleeding is presented in detail in related content  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef88947" href="/d/graphic/88947.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6799.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and differential diagnosis of vaginal bleeding before 20 weeks of gestation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5410.html" rel="external">"Ultrasonography of pregnancy of unknown location"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1458990888"><span class="h1">PATIENT CATEGORIZATION BY CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1427460564"><span class="h2">Assess for alarm findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pregnant individuals of less than 20 weeks gestation who present with evidence of hemorrhage with hemodynamic instability and/or infection with evidence of sepsis syndromes require urgent, and often emergency, evaluation and treatment.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinically unstable patient</strong> – For those with life-threatening hemorrhage and/or infection who also have intrauterine products of conception, surgical evacuation of the pregnancy is indicated even if ultrasound criteria for pregnancy loss are not fully met, including the loss of fetal heart tones. <strong>Follow-up assessments of pregnancy viability should never delay appropriate care for a patient.</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinically stable patient</strong> – For a clinically stable patient, providers should discuss the risks and benefits of delaying care to provide definitive diagnosis of pregnancy loss. For a highly desired pregnancy, patients often prefer to have a follow-up ultrasound, which may be warranted if they do not meet definitive criteria for pregnancy loss with one ultrasound. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/130879.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy loss (miscarriage): Ultrasound diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H445057561"><span class="h3">Hemorrhage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Urgent uterine aspiration is indicated for individuals with severe bleeding; emergency aspiration is warranted in the setting of unstable vital signs. Unstable vital signs may include orthostatic vital signs, hypotension, and/or tachycardia as well as laboratory evidence of anemia. Blood transfusion may be required.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128965.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy loss (miscarriage): Description of management techniques", section on 'Surgical management (uterine aspiration)'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6710.html" rel="external">"Overview of postpartum hemorrhage", section on 'Early recognition, assessment, and intervention'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In most cases, after the pregnancy is evacuated, the bleeding will rapidly resolve. In settings where outpatient or emergency department uterine aspiration is feasible, it is preferable to perform the procedure where it can be done most expeditiously. However, a clinically unstable patient (severe hypotension, for instance) may require stabilization and hospital transfer before or after a procedure can be performed. Ongoing bleeding after uterine aspiration is uncommon but, if it occurs, can be managed with uterotonics, similar to the management of bleeding after surgical pregnancy termination. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128965.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy loss (miscarriage): Description of management techniques", section on 'Complications'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3287.html" rel="external">"First-trimester pregnancy termination: Uterine aspiration", section on 'Hemorrhage'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H886379845"><span class="h3">Septic abortion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Septic abortion refers to an infected uterus in the setting of pregnancy of less than 20 weeks gestation with clinical evidence of sepsis syndromes. Pregnancies ≥20 weeks gestation with intrauterine infection are typically referred to as having chorioamnionitis. Signs and symptoms include abdominal or pelvic pain, uterine tenderness, purulent vaginal discharge, and/or other systemic signs of infection (eg, fever, elevated white blood count). When not treated urgently, septic abortion progresses rapidly and can be lethal. Those who show signs of infection along with intrauterine products of conception (either from incomplete pregnancy loss or incomplete pregnancy termination) are not candidates for expectant or medication management. Patients with septic abortion typically require inpatient admission, rapid treatment with broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics, and immediate evacuation of the uterus  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131956" href="/d/graphic/131956.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). Detailed discussions of septic abortion, including treatment, and sepsis syndromes are presented separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/130878.html" rel="external">"Septic abortion: Clinical presentation and management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1657.html" rel="external">"Sepsis syndromes in adults: Epidemiology, definitions, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1613.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1738903325"><span class="h2">Evaluate clinically stable patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients most commonly receive a diagnosis of pregnancy loss at the time of a routine ultrasound or an ultrasound performed for symptoms such as spotting or cramping. There is usually time to provide thorough counseling regarding the various management approaches, and the patient can consider the options and decide on their preferred management approach over the course of days or weeks.</p><p>For these patients, we take the following approach:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2113631317"><span class="h3">Confirm diagnosis and gestational age</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In most cases, pregnancy loss is diagnosed with transvaginal ultrasound. The gestational age of the pregnancy as determined with ultrasound, not by last menstrual period dating, and influences the management options. Clinicians who receive referrals for pregnancy loss management should confirm that adequate diagnostic criteria have been met in stable patients. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/130879.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy loss (miscarriage): Ultrasound diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>First trimester</strong> – First-trimester losses are those up to 12+6 weeks gestation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Second trimester</strong> – Early second-trimester pregnancy loss is one that occurs after 13+0 and prior to 20+0 weeks of gestation [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Signs and symptoms of second-trimester pregnancy loss include bleeding, cramping/pain, or labor. Diagnosis of second-trimester pregnancy loss includes ultrasound documentation of intrauterine fetal death or spontaneous delivery.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H260104721"><span class="h3">Assess patient history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinically stable patients need complete medical evaluation with both individual and family histories to assess for medical comorbidities. Patients with conditions such as bleeding disorders, large uterine fibroids, or suspected molar pregnancy, or who are on an anticoagulation medication, may have a higher risk for bleeding and other complications with expectant, surgical, or medication management of pregnancy loss. Consultation with a clinician experienced with pregnancy loss management, when available, is advised for complex patients. Patient preferences, medical factors, and available resources will often make one treatment approach preferable.</p><p>As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Favoring expectant management</strong> – Individuals who desire to avoid interventions, do not mind the unpredictable nature of pregnancy loss, and are able to receive follow-up care may prefer expectant management (ie, allowing the pregnancy tissue to pass on its own).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Favoring medication management</strong> – A patient with some uterine, cervical, or vaginal anomalies may have a pregnancy that is not easily reached with a uterine aspiration device, and thus, medication management may be the preferred option. This option may also be preferred by individuals who prefer to avoid uterine instrumentation but would also like a more predictable timeframe for pregnancy expulsion and miscarriage completion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Favoring surgical management</strong> – A patient on therapeutic anticoagulation may have a higher bleeding risk with expectant or medication management, and in this case, surgical management may be preferable. Additionally, someone who prefers immediate and predictable completion of the pregnancy loss might choose surgical management.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H927468963"><span class="h3">Perform physical and laboratory examinations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who present with confirmed or suspected pregnancy loss undergo speculum and bimanual evaluations in addition to general assessment. Handheld tone Doppler evaluation may be performed for pregnancies of 12 weeks gestation or greater. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3253.html" rel="external">"The gynecologic history and pelvic examination", section on 'Components of the examination'</a>.)</p><p>In clinical situations with access to ultrasound and laboratory services, transvaginal sonography and/or laboratory serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) are the two key tests. Ultrasound is useful if available, as it has higher specificity and sensitivity than speculum or physical examination for a range of diagnoses associated with pregnancy problems.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Physical examination.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Speculum examination</strong> – Speculum examination is performed to assess for bleeding, including the source and quantity, and signs of infection (eg, frank pus from cervical os). Active pregnancy loss is suggested by bleeding coming from the cervix and an open cervical os. Traditionally, the findings of vaginal bleeding with an open cervix were diagnosed as an "inevitable abortion." However, this terminology is no longer preferred because, in practice, cervical dilation can be difficult to visually assess, and only 12 percent of patients with first-trimester bleeding experience pregnancy loss [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. While some individuals with pregnancy loss have a visibly dilated cervix or pregnancy tissue present at the os, others (particularly those who are parous) have an external cervical os that appears dilated even with a normal pregnancy. Furthermore, a cervix that appears closed and has no active bleeding does not exclude pregnancy loss.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Bimanual examination</strong> – A bimanual examination can determine whether the external cervix is open and whether there is tissue within the cervical canal. Tenderness upon uterine palpation may indicate infection. Additionally, if ultrasound is not readily available, bimanual examination can estimate gestational age, which can then be compared with the patient's known gestational age to assess for discrepancy and possible pregnancy loss. However, uterine size may be difficult to assess in patients with obesity, uterine fibroids, or other uterine anomalies. Additionally, the patient's estimated gestational age may be incorrect. Thus, providers must be aware of the limitations of physical examination for diagnosing pregnancy loss.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Tone</strong> <strong>Doppler assessment</strong> – Absence of fetal heart tones on handheld Doppler in a pregnancy of 12 weeks or greater should prompt further evaluation for pregnancy loss, though it is not a criterion used for diagnosis. The ability to find heart tones varies by gestational age, patient habitus, uterus position, and fetal position.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Laboratory evaluation</strong> – Routine laboratory evaluation typically includes a blood type and antibody screen. The goal is to identify RhD-negative individuals who may benefit from <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9858" href="/d/drug information/9858.html" rel="external">anti-D immune globulin</a>. Serum hCG is valuable in follow-up of patients with pregnancy of unknown location when used in conjunction with serial ultrasound imaging. Progesterone has limited utility in the diagnosis of pregnancy loss.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Blood type and RhD antigen screen</strong> – Tests for blood type and Rh status are performed to identify RhD-negative individuals who are at risk of developing Rh alloimmunization and in case blood type and antibody information is needed for transfusion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7924.html" rel="external">"Red blood cell antigens and antibodies", section on 'Rh blood group system'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6820.html" rel="external">"RhD alloimmunization in pregnancy: Overview"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6773.html" rel="external">"RhD alloimmunization: Prevention in pregnant and postpartum patients"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Serum hCG</strong> – There are no hCG levels or trends that are diagnostic for pregnancy loss, but relative changes can be helpful.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Normal variations</strong> – Given the substantial variation in hCG levels at any gestational age, one hCG value is not sufficient for diagnosis of pregnancy loss, and a single hCG value &lt;4000 milli-international units/mL should be interpreted with great caution. It is important to consider that the rate of hCG increase and trends may be unpredictable, particularly at low levels. Three serial hCGs are typically needed to establish a trend. In one section editor's experience, a dramatic drop in hCG &gt;25 percent over 48 hours in the setting of uterine bleeding is highly suggestive of pregnancy loss and may be helpful if ultrasound is not readily available. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3209.html" rel="external">"Human chorionic gonadotropin: Biochemistry and measurement in pregnancy and disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">In normal pregnancies, average hCG levels plateau at approximately 8 to 11 weeks and then decline [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In counseling patients about the probability of a viable pregnancy given a single hCG level and their ultrasound findings, we use data from an analysis of 651 pregnancies that concluded that discriminatory hCG levels at which structures would be predicted to be seen 99 percent of the time were 3510 milli-international units/mL for gestational sac, 17,716 milli-international units/mL for yolk sac, and 47,685 milli-international units/mL for embryonic pole [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Pregnancy of unknown location</strong> – Serum hCG testing is commonly performed as part of the assessment for pregnancy of unknown location and is often helpful in excluding ectopic pregnancy.

In a study of 360 pregnant individuals with bleeding in early pregnancy at 6 to 10 weeks gestation, a cutoff of &lt;35 nmol/L led to a positive predictive value for pregnancy loss of 68 percent and a negative predictive value of 91 percent [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Serum progesterone testing may be appropriate in some clinical settings, but the authors do not use this test for the diagnosis of pregnancy loss. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5487.html" rel="external">"Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Other testing'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3105600899"><span class="h3">Assess patient preferences and values</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some patients have a strong preference for one type of pregnancy loss management even before receiving detailed information about the risks and benefits of each option.

However, most individuals with bleeding during pregnancy will not experience pregnancy loss. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Uncomplicated pregnancy loss</strong> – Uncomplicated pregnancy loss implies that the patient is hemodynamically stable, at low risk of becoming hemodynamically unstable based on the volume of bleeding, and without evidence of infection. Pregnancy loss can also be an incidental finding on pelvic ultrasound. (See <a class="local">'Uncomplicated bleeding and cramping'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Complicated pregnancy loss</strong> – Individuals with complicated pregnancy loss typically present with hemorrhage and/or infection, which can be severe. Risk of both generally increases with increasing gestational age of loss beyond 13 weeks gestation. (See <a class="local">'Complicated (hemorrhage and/or infection)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Asymptomatic loss</strong> – Highly sensitive beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) tests and transvaginal ultrasounds enable diagnosis of pregnancy loss before the onset of symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Asymptomatic or incidental'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Complete versus incomplete</strong> – In addition to the presence or absence of symptoms, individuals with pregnancy loss can be further characterized by whether there is complete or incomplete emptying of the uterus. The presence of symptoms and/or retained intrauterine tissue helps determine treatment options and guide patients in their decision-making. (See <a class="local">'Complete versus incomplete pregnancy loss'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – Transvaginal ultrasound is generally performed in all pregnant individuals with signs or symptoms suggestive of pregnancy loss to confirm both an intrauterine gestation and evidence of viability. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> – Most individuals with bleeding during pregnancy will not experience pregnancy loss. Approach to the pregnant patient with bleeding is presented in detail in related content  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef88947" href="/d/graphic/88947.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).

The majority of patients are clinically stable, and there is usually time to provide thorough counseling regarding the various management approaches. (See <a class="local">'Patient categorization by clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Alarm findings</strong> – Pregnant individuals of less than 20 weeks gestation who present with evidence of severe hemorrhage with hemodynamic instability and/or infection with evidence of sepsis syndromes require urgent, and often emergency, evaluation and treatment. For those with life-threatening hemorrhage and/or infection, surgical evacuation of the pregnancy is indicated even if ultrasound criteria for pregnancy loss are not fully met, including the loss of fetal heart tones. <strong>Follow-up assessments of pregnancy viability should never delay appropriate care for an unstable patient.</strong> (See <a class="local">'Assess for alarm findings'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Clinically stable patients </strong>– Evaluation of clinically stable patients includes confirmation of pregnancy loss and approximate gestational age at the time of loss, physical examination, limited laboratory evaluation, and discussion of management options. There is usually time to provide thorough counseling regarding the various management approaches, and the patient can consider the options and decide over the course of days or weeks.
