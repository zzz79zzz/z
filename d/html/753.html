         Pathogenic (harmful) variants in the breast cancer susceptibility genes 1 and 2 (
         <em>
          BRCA1
         </em>
         and
         <em>
          BRCA2
         </em>
         [
         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         ]) are very strong hereditary risk factors for the development of breast and ovarian cancer. Although most breast and ovarian cancers are sporadic, approximately 6 percent of breast cancer and 20 percent of ovarian cancer cases are caused by pathogenic variants in these genes [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-8
         </a>
         ]
         <em>
          .
         </em>
         Pathogenic variants in other high- to moderate-risk genes such as tumor protein p53 (
         <em>
          TP53
         </em>
         ), partner and localizer of
         <em>
          BRCA2
         </em>
         (
         <em>
          PALB2
         </em>
         ), phosphatase and tensin homolog (
         <em>
          PTEN

         ), checkpoint kinase 2 (
         <em>
          CHEK2
         </em>
         ), and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (
         <em>
          ATM
         </em>
         ) account for a smaller percentage of breast, and, in some cases, ovarian, prostate, or pancreatic cancers [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         As such, certain individuals with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, prostate, or pancreatic cancer may benefit from hereditary risk evaluation to determine their own and family members' risk for these and associated cancers. For patients who undergo genetic testing, expertise is required to ensure that the appropriate testing is ordered, that it will be adequately interpreted, and that the results are likely to influence management of the patient or family members at risk for hereditary cancer [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. The complexity involved in pre- and post-test risk assessment underscores the importance of genetic counseling both before and after testing.

        <p>
         This topic reviews the genetic testing and the interpretation of genetic tests that can identify individuals at high risk for what has been called hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC). However, with the recognition that pathogenic variants in the most commonly implicated genes (
         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         ) also predispose to cancers affecting men, namely prostate and pancreatic cancer, the acronym HBOC is less inclusive [

         In this topic, we will use the terms "woman/en" or "patient" to describe genetic females. However, we recognize that not all people with breasts and pelvic anatomy that may include a vagina, uterus, ovaries, and/or fallopian tubes identify as female, and we encourage the reader to consider transgender and gender nonbinary individuals as part of this larger group.

         While unaffected individuals often present with concerns about their hereditary cancer risk, whenever possible, it is ideal to initiate genetic testing in a family member who is most likely to test positive for a pathogenic variant, which is usually a woman affected by early breast cancer or ovarian cancer (any age). However, the optimal person to test within a family could also include individuals with other diagnoses such as pancreatic cancer, metastatic breast cancer, or metastatic prostate cancer, even in the absence of a family history of other cancer types [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15-17
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83943.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Genetic testing in such cases also can affect treatment options (eg, inhibitors of poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase [PARP] are US Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of breast cancer susceptibility genes 1 and 2 [
         <em>
          BRCA1
         </em>
         and
         <em>
          BRCA2
         </em>
         (
         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         )] carriers with pancreatic, ovarian, or advanced, triple-negative breast cancer). In addition, the phase III OlympiA trial found that adjuvant treatment with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="98761" href="/z/d/drug information/98761.html" rel="external">

         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         pathogenic variants who had high-risk, early-stage, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative early breast cancer  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef131856" href="/z/d/graphic/131856.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid18">
          18-20
         </a>
         ]. Thus, breast cancer patients who may benefit from this treatment are recommended to undergo germline genetic testing. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14227.html" rel="external">
          "ER/PR negative, HER2-negative (triple-negative) breast cancer", section on 'Patients with previous exposure to chemotherapy'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The most commonly implicated pathogenic variants in these types of patients occur in the
         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         genes [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ], which are inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion. Data regarding clinical characteristics associated with
         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         are discussed elsewhere. (See

         Most patients are offered the option of multigene panel testing, which includes, at a minimum, high-penetrance susceptibility genes:
         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         , cadherin 1 (

         (
         <em>

         ), phosphatase and tensin homolog (
         <em>
          PTEN

         ), and tumor protein p53 (
         <em>
          TP53

         <a href="#rid17">
          17

         ]. We also include other genes such as ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (
         <em>
          ATM
         </em>
         ), checkpoint kinase 2 (

         Ashkenazi Jewish adults, even if they have no personal or family history of cancer, may request testing. Although guidelines do not currently recommend systematic testing of such individuals, we offer
         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         testing and the option of a multigene panel to individuals who are interested. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Other groups have supported different criteria for genetic testing. For example, the American Society of Breast Surgeons has recommended that genetic testing be made available to everyone with a personal history of breast cancer, in addition to those meeting the NCCN criteria [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. The NCCN, however, notes that genetic testing in individuals with a low probability of testing positive (&lt;2.5 percent), such as breast cancer patients diagnosed &gt;60 years of age without a family history of breast, ovarian, pancreatic, or prostate cancer, is unlikely to yield results with clinical utility [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends that women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer or who have an ancestry associated with
         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         gene mutations should be assessed with a familial risk-assessment tool (eg, the Ontario Family History Assessment Tool, The International Breast Cancer Intervention Study [IBIS] instrument, or brief versions of BRCAPRO, but not the Gail model) [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. According to these guidelines, those who have an increased likelihood of a hereditary risk based on such an assessment should receive genetic counseling and, if appropriate, genetic testing, while those without such an indication should not be offered routine genetic counseling or testing. Although no studies have evaluated the effectiveness of genetic counseling and testing in reducing the incidence and mortality of
         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         -related cancers, the systematic review on which these guidelines were based included 14 studies (with almost 44,000 patients) that together found moderate to high accuracy of eight risk-assessment tools in predicting the presence of pathogenic
         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         variants [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In the setting of differing guidelines from expert groups, we continue to support the use of the NCCN criteria as a guide to selecting appropriate individuals for genetic testing, in part because mathematic models may be cumbersome to use in a clinical setting and due to the limitations of family history assessment (eg, unknown family history, small family size, etc). Moreover, many of the risk models assess risk for harboring only high-risk gene mutations (ie,
         <em>
          BRCA1/
         </em>
         2) and do not assess for
         <em>
          PALB2
         </em>
         mutations and less penetrant phenotypes, such as those associated with more moderate-risk genes (eg,
         <em>
          CHEK2
         </em>
         ,
         <em>
          ATM
         </em>
         ), or other syndromes that are less commonly associated with breast or ovarian cancer, such as Lynch syndrome. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2605.html" rel="external">
          "Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnostic approach'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the NCCN criteria do not flag all high-risk individuals, and some studies suggest that universal multigene panel testing among patients with solid tumors will increase the detection of heritable pathogenic variants, and influence treatment (albeit in a minority of patients) [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26-28
         </a>
         ]. For example, in one study of nearly 2984 patients with solid tumors undergoing multigene panel testing, pathogenic germline variants were found in 13 percent, including 282 moderate- and high-penetrance cancer susceptibility genes [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. Nearly 30 percent of patients with high-penetrance variants had modifications in their treatment. In the overall group, a total of 192 patients (6.4 percent) had incremental clinically actionable findings that would not have been detected by phenotype or family history-based testing criteria. More data are needed to refine the genetic testing criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our considerations for testing recommendations include not only the NCCN guidelines, but also the potential impact of test results on patient management, including treatment, as well as financial factors and implications for relatives. Given that the cost of genetic testing has declined significantly and is affordable for many patients, we believe that discussions around testing should address not only the likelihood of testing positive, but also the potential clinical utility.

         Expert guidelines recommend that patients with metastatic or advanced cancer undergo genomic sequencing if the results would influence management; given site-agnostic drug approvals for cancers with a high tumor mutation burden, mismatch repair deficiency, or neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (
         <em>
          NTRK
         </em>
         ) fusions, this provides a rationale for genomic testing for all solid tumors [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Tumor testing performed to guide therapy in cancer patients may identify pathogenic variants in a number of genes (eg,
         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         ) that are also present in the germline, with one study finding that almost one-third of patients with tumor DNA sequencing harbored a germline pathogenic variant [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. Evidence suggests an association between microsatellite-instable or mismatch-repair-deficient tumors and Lynch syndrome, regardless of primary tumor type [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. Thus, confirmatory germline testing is important for patients who receive such results, irrespective of the type of cancer. Such information may affect treatment decisions and may also have important implications for family members.
        </p>
        <p>
         When such patients are referred to us for confirmatory germline testing, we determine if broader genetic testing with a multigene panel is indicated based on the patient's personal or family history and ancestry, as not all germline variants will also be detected in the tumor [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. On the other hand, clinically actionable, somatic variants that were first identified in tumors and then confirmed in the germline have occurred in patients who did not meet clinical guidelines for germline testing [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30,32
         </a>
         ]. Thus, panel testing is appropriate for many of these patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of note, while
         <em>
          TP53
         </em>
         mutations are commonly found on tumor profiling, germline mutations are very rare [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,31,33,34
         </a>
         ]. Thus, unless personal or family history is suggestive of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, we do not obtain germline testing if somatic mutations in
         <em>
          TP53
         </em>
         are detected.

         In regards to estimating a woman's risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer, most models available for clinical use assume that the cases of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer are attributable to
         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         mutations, and thus do not provide probabilities about breast cancer risk based on the chance of testing positive for a moderate-risk or other high-risk pathogenic gene variant. However, the

         Traditionally, genetic testing for hereditary cancer was offered after comprehensive genetic counseling and all results were also delivered in the context of genetic counseling. However, alternative modes of providing genetic testing are increasingly being utilized.

         Whenever possible, patients who are candidates for genetic testing should have the option of undergoing pretest counseling for an individualized genetic risk assessment and discussion of the options for and implications of genetic testing. Pretest counseling may be performed by genetic counselors or other health professionals with expertise in hereditary cancer. Further information about genetic counseling is discussed separately. (See

         <strong>
          Medical history and pedigree evaluation
         </strong>
         – An important component of pretest counseling is a detailed review of the patient's past medical history and family history, which should include information on maternal and paternal relatives, preferably covering at least three generations. This process is key to not only determining which individuals should undergo genetic counseling, but also is instrumental in ordering the right test and counseling the patient about the rationale for testing and the likelihood of obtaining a positive result. In rare instances, the pedigree reveals the presence of a rare noncancer hereditary syndrome for which specific genetic testing may be indicated. (See

          Discussion of genetic testing recommendations

         – We most commonly make a recommendation for multigene panel testing that includes high- and moderate-risk genes. We also discuss the option of ordering a larger panel that includes newer genes, for which there is less evidence about risk and management. We discuss potential test result outcomes, including a higher rate of variants of uncertain significance with larger panels. (See

          Discussion of financial considerations
         </strong>
         – For patients considering genetic testing, it is important to address financial considerations. (See

          "Genetic testing", section on 'Cost and insurance reimbursement'

         In the United States, most insurance companies cover 90 percent or more of the costs of commercial breast cancer susceptibility genes 1 and 2 (
         <em>

         ]) or multigene panel testing in appropriate candidates. Moreover, several commercial laboratories cap patient out-of-pocket costs (minus a deductible) if testing is covered by insurance. A letter of medical necessity may be required to document the potential impact of a positive test result on surveillance or surgical recommendations for an individual. For patients without insurance, financial assistance programs exist through many labs. In addition, some companies offer self-pay options for multigene testing for $250 or less. In some cases when patients cannot afford testing, testing another family member first may prove useful. If a pathogenic variant is identified, testing relatives for the single variant (or single gene) can be done inexpensively.

          Discussion of legal protection against genetic discrimination
         </strong>
         – One of the primary sources of concern about potential harm in patients undergoing genetic testing stems from their fear of genetic discrimination, which can be a common reason for declining genetic testing [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. Fortunately, within the United States, federal and state laws provide many protections against genetic discrimination. Additional information on genetic discrimination and legal protection is discussed elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2901.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Pretest counseling may be offered in person; however, telephone counseling and telehealth are increasingly utilized as well [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49,50
         </a>
         ]. Two large, randomized studies of telephone versus in-person pre- and post-test
         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         genetic counseling showed that the two methods of service delivery are equally safe and effective [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51,52
         </a>
         ]. Although telephone genetic counseling expands access to this service, the uptake of genetic testing has been found to be somewhat lower in women who undergo telephone counseling; however, the reasons for this are unclear [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51,52
         </a>
         ]. Moreover, it is important to assess individuals for distress or anxiety, as certain individuals may be better served by in-person pre- and post-test counseling whenever possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of note, particularly in light of changes to service delivery that occurred during the coronavirus pandemic, video-assisted or telehealth genetic counseling has become increasing popular. Research indicates that such an approach produces similar if not better outcomes compared with telephone-only genetic counseling with respect to factors such as knowledge, patient satisfaction, and psychologic functioning [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53,54
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Although psychosocial concerns may deter some high-risk individuals from genetic testing, studies have demonstrated no evidence of major risks for psychological dysfunction in those who pursue testing, including those who test positive for a
         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         mutation [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55-57
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, high-risk patients should be encouraged to proceed with testing, particularly if their or their relatives' medical management is likely to be altered by a positive result. High-risk individuals who decline genetic testing should be offered referral to (or ongoing) genetic counseling, access to information regarding genetic testing, and psychological support if they are anxious or distressed [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. Even if they ultimately do not proceed with testing, these individuals should receive individualized guidelines for cancer surveillance and risk reduction based on their personal and family history.

         The confluence of several factors has resulted in the increased use of streamlined genetic testing service delivery models, particularly for patients with a diagnosis of cancer in whom universal testing is recommended (eg, all patients with ovarian or pancreatic cancer). (See

         For most patients (irrespective of age) meeting National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria for testing, we offer next-generation multigene panel testing, including for those previously tested without a next-generation multigene panel (typically those tested prior to 2013). Although pathogenic variants in breast cancer susceptibility genes 1 and 2 (

         ]) are most commonly implicated in women with classic signs of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer, approximately 4 to 7 percent have a pathogenic variant in another gene with probable breast and ovarian cancer associations [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-6
         </a>
         ]. The most common such mutations are in moderate-risk genes, including checkpoint kinase 2 (

         <a href="#rid64">
          64
         </a>
         ]. Some commercial genetic testing companies offer multigene panels that are confined to analysis of high- and moderate-risk gene mutations only, whereas others offer several panel options, including those assessing new, rare, and/or preliminary-evidence genes. (See

         This testing can be performed using blood, saliva, or buccal mucosa. Although one option for patients meeting diagnostic criteria for a specific hereditary cancer syndrome (eg, Li-Fraumeni or Cowden) is to test only for mutations in the single associated gene, we typically order a multigene panel for these patients as well, in order to cover other potential differentials, particularly as the cost difference, if any, may be negligible.

         Individuals undergoing panel testing must be prepared for the possibility that a high-penetrance variant may be identified even in the absence of a classic presentation of the associated syndrome [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71,72
         </a>
         ]. As a result, highly aggressive interventions may be recommended, such as consideration of upper endoscopic screening and prophylactic gastrectomy in the setting of cadherin 1 (
         <em>
          CDH1
         </em>
         ), even if there are no gastric cancers in the family [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71
         </a>
         ]. In addition, because of the sheer number of genes for which testing may be performed (ranging from 5 to more than 80), the number of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) that may be identified is a concern. The rate of VUS detection also varies based upon the population studied and among laboratories performing the tests. (See

          'Variants of uncertain significance'

        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, in large panels, many of the genes assessed are relatively newly identified. Pathogenic variants in these genes are rare, cancer risks are not well characterized, there are no guidelines for medical management, and the role of predictive testing for family members is uncertain [

         testing regardless of personal or family history of cancer. However, as more Ashkenazi Jewish individuals undergo panel testing and other pathogenic variants are identified, it is reasonable to offer this type of expanded testing even in individuals whose only risk factor is their Jewish ancestry. (See

         One population-based study revealed that genetic testing based on family history criteria alone may miss up to one-half of mutation carriers among those of Ashkenazi Jewish descent [

          74,75

         founder mutation carriers were identified [
         <a href="#rid74">
          74

         ]. One-half of these carriers had no significant family history of breast or ovarian cancers. Their female relatives were then offered testing, which revealed 211 mutation carriers. The resulting breast and ovarian cancer risks were similar to those quoted for
         <em>
          BRCA1/2

        <p>
         A randomized trial of population screening among Ashkenazi Jews in the United Kingdom detected 56 percent more
         <em>
          BRCA1/2

         mutation carriers than family history screening alone, and did not result in adverse psychological or quality of life outcomes [

          76

         Some individuals at very high risk for hereditary cancer do not have a pathogenic variant in a moderate- to high-risk gene, or any of the newer genes assessed on large panels. While it is tempting to consider sequencing of all DNA coding regions (whole-exome sequencing [WES]) or all coding and noncoding DNA regions (whole-genome sequencing [WGS]), available data suggest that such testing is unlikely to yield more actionable results than an expanded panel [
         <a href="#rid78">
          78

          79-81

         In another large study, PRS and first-degree family history of breast cancer were used to estimate the lifetime risk of breast cancer in women with pathogenic variants in one of nine high- to moderate-risk genes [

Although the likelihood of a false-positive result is very low, it is critical for the result to be confirmed, and an individual, signed report should be provided to the patient. Note that consumers may also obtain their raw genotype data from DTC companies and have it interpreted by a third party. These results yield high rates of false-positive results, including discrepancies about result interpretation, as well as false-negative results [

         An important component of post-test counseling is to inform patients and their family members of the implications of the test result, identify at-risk individuals based upon the pedigree structure, and encourage sharing of this information with relatives. In addition, patients should be provided with information for their relatives (eg, copies of the test result and information on how to find a genetic counselor). Finally, they should stipulate when, if ever, they would disclose results without patient consent. Clinicians should document that patients are informed about who in their family is at risk for hereditary cancer and what the potential implications are.

         Most of these variants are protein truncating, while others may result in an abnormal amount or conformation of gene product (protein). Some pathogenic variants are unique to individual families, whereas others have been reported in several different families.

         A true-negative result means that a pathogenic variant that has been identified in a patient's family member (usually a first- or second-degree relative such as a parent, sibling, aunt or uncle) has been ruled out in the tested individual.

         It is less clear how to interpret negative test results in families with a pathogenic variant in a moderate-risk gene such as checkpoint kinase 2 (
         <em>
          CHEK2)

         or in rare genes such as
         <em>
          RAD50.
         </em>
         In these families, it is often not possible to know whether the identified variant led to the cancers in the family, or whether other gene variants or SNPs could be contributing to increased cancer risks as well. Thus, in families with these types of moderate-risk gene variants, genetic testing in at-risk individuals may not provide a definitive answer about cancer risk or whether management should be altered [
         <a href="#rid99">
          99,100
         </a>
         ]. Whether further testing is indicated depends on the situation and the individual's risk, as well as which test was done. (See

         There are two types of uninformative results. The first occurs when genetic testing results do not indicate the presence of a pathogenic variant, and there is no known cancer susceptibility pathogenic variant in the family. The second is when one or more variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are identified. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         The first type of uninformative negative result may be due to a number of possibilities that depend, in part, on what testing was performed. The possibilities include:

         If an unaffected individual is the first to be tested in a family, a negative result could mean that they did not inherit a pathogenic variant that may be present in other relatives, or the result could be due to one of the explanations above.

         It is possible for sporadic cancers, such as breast cancers, to occur within families who have an identified pathogenic variant. When this occurrence can be documented, the affected individual is said to be a "phenocopy," which refers to a noncarrier in a family known to harbor a pathogenic variant in genes such as
         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         . Thus, if the first affected individual to be tested in a family receives a negative result, it may still be recommended to offer testing to another individual in the family, preferably one with a genetically related cancer.

         When a gene alteration is identified but its clinical significance is unclear, this is termed a VUS. In this instance, it is unclear if the variant is an undefined pathogenic variant, a benign polymorphism (ie, normal change in the gene), or a variant with an intermediate risk of cancer [
         <a href="#rid101">
          101,102
         </a>
         ]. Some individuals may test positive for a pathogenic variant and still have one or more VUS results. For individuals lacking a pathogenic variant, in whom one or more VUS are identified, the result is considered uninformative. Such individuals should be managed based upon their personal and family history, and should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be counseled as though the variant is pathogenic.
        </p>
        <p>
         Given the high rate of VUS obtained from multigene panel testing, patients must be informed that such findings are expected, and, that over time, many VUS will be reclassified. Standard criteria, determined by professional societies as well as functional, epidemiologic, and clinical parameters, are used to determine if a VUS can be reclassified as a normal or harmful change in the gene [

         ]. Although it is a helpful resource, it should not be used independently of laboratory generated data to interpret VUS results given that discordant classifications are not rare [
         <a href="#rid104">
          104,105
         </a>

         <a href="#rid106">
          106
         </a>
         ]. However, a small number of VUS get reclassified in such a way that clinical management is altered [
         <a href="#rid107">
          107
         </a>
         ]. Thus, providers must review VUS reclassifications when obtained from the laboratory (or inquire about reclassification when appropriate) and notify patients accordingly. We also advise patients to keep us informed of their current contact information in the event an amended report is issued.

         Based upon 20 years of experience and more than one million samples tested for a deleterious
         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         mutation, the rate of identification of a VUS within a major United States laboratory was reported to be 2.1 percent, a decrease of 84 percent over the prior decade [
         <a href="#rid102">
          102
         </a>
         ]. The VUS rate in
         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         is higher in certain ethnic groups such as individuals who are of African or Middle Eastern descent [
         <a href="#rid102">
          102
         </a>
         ]. It is important to note that the higher the number of genes assessed (ie, as part of a multigene panel test), the more VUS will be identified. For example, in a study of 9187 patients with breast, colorectal, ovarian, pancreatic, or prostate cancer tested with a 76 or 88 germline gene panel, one or more VUS were found in 57 percent of the patients [
         <a href="#rid108">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with VUS (or positive) results from multigene testing may participate in an online registry called Prospective Registry of Multiplex Testing (PROMPT), a collaborative effort among academic institutions and commercial laboratories in the United States to study and reclassify these types of results [

        </p>
        <p>
         In some clinical settings, relatives of the patient with a VUS may be tested for clinical research to track the variant in the family, the data from which may be useful in aggregate to reclassify the variant.

         However, for those who do not pursue additional testing or for whom additional testing is also uninformative, determining an individual's risk of developing cancer can be challenging, and it is highly dependent on the family history, an individual's own cancer history and risk factors, and the type of testing performed.

         Women deemed to be at high lifetime risk of breast cancer (defined as a risk of at least 20 percent) should undergo annual screening mammogram, annual breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and at age 21, clinical breast exam every 6 to 12 months. Imaging should begin 10 years prior to the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected family member but not prior to age 30 for mammography and not prior to age 25 for MRI [

         Women with a life expectancy of at least 10 years may also consider risk-reduction options. For example, women with a five-year breast cancer risk of at least 1.7 percent or a 20 percent lifetime risk of cancer may consider chemoprevention with agents such as

        <p>
         For some breast cancer survivors with a family history of breast cancer, their lifetime risk of developing a CBC may make them good candidates for heightened surveillance with breast MRI in addition to mammography. Although a panel convened by the American Cancer Society concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against MRI in breast cancer survivors [
         <a href="#rid118">
          118
         </a>
         ], MRI may be appropriate for screening survivors with other risk factors, such as those related to breast cancer subtype, age at diagnosis, or reproductive or family history [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,110,112,119
         </a>
         ]. Studies are needed to determine whether MRI screening in breast cancer survivors is associated with mortality reduction. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15781.html" rel="external">
          "Approach to the patient following treatment for breast cancer", section on 'Breast imaging'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         As an alternative to surveillance, women with high risk for CBC may consider a bilateral mastectomy as their definitive treatment, with the contralateral mastectomy performed at the time of diagnosis or at a later point. While some studies had suggested a survival benefit to this procedure, this was likely driven by selection bias, and subsequent studies have not demonstrated survival benefit for contralateral prophylactic mastectomy [
         <a href="#rid120">
          120
         </a>
         ]. It is also important to note that if these women receive adjuvant endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive disease, they would derive about a 50 percent reduction in risk of developing a new breast cancer. (See

         Women with no family history of ovarian cancer and negative genetic testing results are usually considered to be at average risk of ovarian cancer and are not candidates for ovarian cancer screening.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although unselected women with a prior history of breast cancer have historically been reported to have a slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer [
         <a href="#rid121">
          121
         </a>
         ], it is likely that most of that risk can be attributed to pathogenic variants in susceptibility genes such as
         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         [
         <a href="#rid122">
          122

         <a href="#rid96">
          96,123,124
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         For women without a family history of ovarian cancer in whom pathogenic variants in genes associated with increased risks of ovarian cancer are ruled out (especially
         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         ), we do not offer risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (rrBSO) for risk reduction (even if a strong family history of breast cancer is present).
        </p>
        <p>
         Risk assessment for all women should take into account other risk factors associated with ovarian cancer, such as infertility, reproductive factors, and hormonal use. (See

         When a woman with a family history of ovarian cancer tests negative for a panel including genes in which pathogenic variants are associated with ovarian cancer, her risk of ovarian cancer may still be elevated relative to the general population [

         We counsel about the limited effectiveness of available screening for ovarian cancer, which includes cancer antigen (CA) 125 blood tests and transvaginal ultrasound, and that this approach is generally not advised. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7563.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         This approach is based on epidemiologic data suggesting increased ovarian cancer risks among women with a family history of ovarian cancer. For example, studies suggest that women who have one first-degree relative with ovarian cancer have about a 5 percent risk of ovarian cancer, a 3.5 percent risk if she has one second-degree relative, and a 7 percent risk of ovarian cancer if she has two affected relatives [
         <a href="#rid126">
          126,128
         </a>
         ]. However, some of this risk may be due to pathogenic variants in
         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         and, to a lesser extent, in other genes associated with ovarian cancer (eg, RAD51 paralog C [
         <em>
          RAD51C
         </em>
         ]
         <em>

         <em>
          BRIP1
         </em>

          Introduction
         </strong>
         – Although most breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancers are sporadic, a minority are caused by germline mutations in breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 or 2 (
         <em>
          BRCA1
         </em>
         or

         [
         <em>
          BRCA1/2

          Criteria for genetic risk evaluation
         </strong>
         – Key criteria for genetic risk evaluation include, among others, personal history of female breast cancer diagnosed ≤50 years, triple-negative breast cancer, or personal or family history of ovarian cancer, male breast cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, or exocrine pancreatic cancer. Alternatively, some experts suggest universal testing of all patients with breast cancer. Patients who are candidates for genetic testing should have the option of being referred to a credentialed genetics provider for pre- and post-test education. Increasingly, alternatives to traditional pretest education and counseling are being offered. (See
