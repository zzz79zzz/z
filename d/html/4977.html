Clinically, BPD is defined as an ongoing need for supplemental oxygen and/or respiratory support at either 28 days postnatal age or 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) in a preterm neonate with radiographic evidence of parenchymal lung disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93656" href="/z/d/graphic/93656.html" rel="external">image 1</a>).

Caloric demands are generally high to meet the metabolic requirements for growth and healing. Total energy needs are often &gt;130 kcal/kg per day in some infants may increase to 150 kcal/kg per day; protein intake needs are generally in the range of 3.5 to 4 g/kg per day [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Because fluid intake is often restricted, the volume of feeding may need to be reduced and provided with high caloric density to meet the neonate's needs. </p><p>In our centers, fortified human milk that is supplemented to meet their needs for adequate growth is given to infants with BPD. Mother's milk is preferred, but if not available, donor milk should be used. If fluid restriction &lt;140 mL/kg is needed, commercially available human milk fortifier can be added to increase caloric density to 24, 27, or 30 kcal/oz as needed. An alternative option is to alternate feeds between fortified human milk and preterm formula with a higher nutrient density [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5050.html" rel="external">"Human milk feeding and fortification of human milk for premature infants", section on 'Fortification of human milk'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5003.html" rel="external">"Growth management in preterm infants", section on 'Bronchopulmonary dysplasia'</a>.)</p><p>Patients should be weighed two to three times per week while in the hospital, and length and head circumference should be measured weekly  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70389" href="/z/d/graphic/70389.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90267" href="/z/d/graphic/90267.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). Additional monitoring includes measurements of blood urea nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase concentrations. Serum electrolyte concentrations should be monitored in infants on diuretic therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5003.html" rel="external">"Growth management in preterm infants"</a> and <a class="local">'Diuretics'</a> below.)</p><p>Infants with BPD are at risk for metabolic bone disease (MBD) and they require calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D supplementation because of their rapid growth, loss of accretion of these nutrients during the third trimester of pregnancy, and, in some patients, renal losses from diuretic therapy. Management and prevention of MBD in preterm infants is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5056.html" rel="external">"Management of bone health in preterm infants"</a>.)</p><p>The nutritional prescription should be adjusted as needed based upon the infant's growth and laboratory results. Consultation with a dietitian experienced in the management of chronically ill infants is advised.</p><p>Infants with BPD may have oral motor dysfunction and feeding disorders that adversely affect growth and require specific intervention. Consultation with an experienced clinician (occupational and/or speech therapist) is useful to assess and manage these feeding difficulties. The evaluation and management of these patients are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4976.html" rel="external">"Neonatal oral feeding difficulties due to sucking and swallowing disorders"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3571452464"><span class="h3">Fluid restriction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most infants with BPD, we suggest modest fluid restriction (140 to 150 mL/kg per day). In severely affected infants, fluid restriction to 110 to 120 mL/kg per day may be necessary. </p><p>Based upon our clinical experience, modest fluid restriction appears to improve pulmonary function and reduces the risk of pulmonary edema. Limited clinical trial data support this practice [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]; however, the trials were largely performed in the 1980s and 1990s and may not be directly applicable to modern-day practice. In addition, most trials evaluated the impact of fluid restriction in the early postnatal course (before the neonate had established BPD). The one trial comparing restrictive versus liberal feeding volumes in neonates with established BPD did not detect a benefit of fluid restriction in any of the measured respiratory outcomes [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. However, it was a small trial (60 infants) and may have been underpowered to detect a true difference.</p><p>As noted above, adequate nutrition must be provided to ensure proper growth regardless of the decision to restrict fluid intake. The caloric density of feeds may need to be increased in patients who are managed with a more restrictive fluid intake. (See <a class="local">'Growth and nutrition'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h2">Respiratory support</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Respiratory care is supportive. The goal is to maintain adequate gas exchange while minimizing further lung injury. Depending on the severity of lung disease, respiratory support may consist of supplemental oxygen (eg, via nasal cannula), noninvasive support (eg, nasal continuous positive airway pressure [nCPAP], noninvasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation [NIPPV], or high-flow nasal cannula [HFNC]), or invasive mechanical ventilation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/130240.html" rel="external">"Approach to mechanical ventilation in very preterm neonates", section on 'Indications for invasive MV'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5067.html" rel="external">"Respiratory support, oxygen delivery, and oxygen monitoring in the newborn", section on 'Respiratory support devices'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3152080112"><span class="h3">Supplemental oxygen</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goal of supplemental oxygen therapy in neonates with BPD is to meet the metabolic needs of the neonate while avoiding high concentrations of oxygen, hyperoxia, and hypoxia. The initial target range for oxygen therapy is a peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) of 90 to 95 percent. This is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/112392.html" rel="external">"Neonatal target oxygen levels for preterm infants", section on 'Oxygen target levels'</a>.)</p><p>Once an infant with BPD reaches term and achieves mature retinal vascularization (as documented by ophthalmologic examination), the upper limit of the target SpO<sub>2</sub> range can be increased to &gt;95 percent [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. </p><p>Supplemental oxygen therapy can be beneficial to infants with BPD since it ensures adequate tissue oxygenation and avoids alveolar hypoxia, thereby reducing pulmonary vascular resistance [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. However, increases in the inspired oxygen concentration, even small changes, may have a negative impact on the clinical course by exacerbating pulmonary inflammation or pulmonary edema. It also increases the risk of retinopathy of prematurity. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6263.html" rel="external">"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP): Risk factors, classification, and screening", section on 'Risk factors'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4987.html" rel="external">"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD): Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Oxygen toxicity'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3101282144"><span class="h3">Noninvasive support</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with moderate BPD (grade II) generally require noninvasive positive airway pressure support, which may be provided with nCPAP, NIPPV, or HFNC. The choice between these modalities is largely center dependent. Our centers most often use nCPAP. Details regarding these modalities are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5067.html" rel="external">"Respiratory support, oxygen delivery, and oxygen monitoring in the newborn", section on 'Respiratory support devices'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h3">Mechanical ventilation</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H124121838"><span class="h4">Approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with established BPD who require mechanical ventilation, our suggested approach is as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We suggest a synchronized mode with both mandatory and spontaneous breaths (ie, synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation plus pressure support or assist control ventilation). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5032.html" rel="external">"Overview of mechanical ventilation in neonates", section on 'Synchronized modes'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We suggest volume-targeted ventilation with low tidal volumes (4 to 6 mL/kg). The rationale for low tidal volume ventilation in infants with BPD is to minimize volutrauma, which contributes to ventilator-induced lung injury and worsening BPD. However, infants with severe BPD may require higher tidal volumes over time to maintain effective ventilation because airway dilation and dead space to tidal volume ratio increase with chronic mechanical ventilation [<a href="#rid1">1,10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/130240.html" rel="external">"Approach to mechanical ventilation in very preterm neonates", section on 'Volume-targeted versus pressure-limited ventilation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4987.html" rel="external">"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD): Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Mechanical ventilation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We initially use a standard inspiratory time setting (ie, 0.35 to 0.4 seconds). However, based on our clinical experience, a slightly prolonged inspiratory time (0.4 to 0.5 seconds) sometimes is needed to promote uniform lung inflation in patients who develop uneven airway obstruction. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is set to 5 to 7 cm H<sub>2</sub>O since this minimizes atelectasis and may reduce pulmonary edema. However, infants with bronchomalacia (narrowing of the bronchi due to diminished cartilage airway support) may require higher levels of PEEP to keep airways open during exhalation. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We suggest the following targets for gas exchange:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) goal is 90 to 95 percent initially. Once the infant reaches term, the upper limit of the target SpO<sub>2</sub> range can be increased to &gt;95 percent.

In patients with severe BPD, PaCO<sub>2</sub> values up to 70 mmHg may be tolerated on occasion to avoid further escalation of ventilator support [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/130240.html" rel="external">"Approach to mechanical ventilation in very preterm neonates", section on 'Gas exchange targets'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Endotracheal suctioning is performed only if needed and care should be used to ensure that the suction catheter does not pass beyond the distal end of the endotracheal tube ("calibrated suctioning"). This is because excessive suctioning is associated with tracheal and bronchial injury. </p><p></p><p>Additional details regarding mechanical ventilation in preterm neonates are provided separately.

The frequency of blood gas sampling depends on the severity of illness and frequency of ventilator changes. We initially obtain daily or every other day blood gas samples and then decrease the frequency as the clinical condition stabilizes with fewer ventilator changes. A blood gas and chest radiograph should generally be obtained if the infant experiences an episode of respiratory decompensation. (See <a class="local">'Acute exacerbations'</a> below.)</p><p>As the infant grows and lung function improves, periodic attempts should be made to wean ventilator support as tolerated. Infants who can maintain acceptable PaCO<sub>2</sub> levels with minimal ventilator support and without increased respiratory effort or tachypnea can be extubated to nCPAP and then to nasal cannula oxygen as needed based on SpO<sub>2</sub> values.</p><p>Additional details regarding monitoring and weaning infants receiving mechanical ventilation are provided separately.

The appropriate timing and indications of tracheostomy placement in ventilator-dependent infants remains poorly defined [<a href="#rid1">1,11,12</a>]. In our practice, tracheostomy is considered in infants who are 40 to 42 weeks postmenstrual age and are expected to need continued ventilator support. However, the optimal timing is uncertain and individualized decision-making is required. </p><p>In a multicenter cohort study of 8683 surviving infants &lt;30 weeks gestational age (GA) born between 2001 and 2011, tracheostomy was performed in 3.5 percent (n = 304) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].
