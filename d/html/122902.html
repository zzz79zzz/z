While all systemic therapy given for non-metastatic invasive breast cancer is intended to reduce the risk of distant recurrence, the purpose of administering it prior to surgery is to downstage the tumor and provide information regarding treatment response. Typically, neoadjuvant treatment has taken the form of chemotherapy, although there is increasing interest in expanding the role of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in certain subsets of patients.</p><p>This topic will review selection of chemotherapy regimen for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer for whom the decision has been made to pursue neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT).

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14225.html" rel="external">"General principles of neoadjuvant management of breast cancer", section on 'Patient selection'</a>.)</p><p>For those with triple-negative disease receiving neoadjuvant treatment, chemotherapy is standard. Selection of regimen is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Choosing a regimen'</a> below.)</p><p>Chemotherapy remains the standard neoadjuvant approach in patients with locally advanced, hormone receptor-positive disease, although endocrine therapy may be considered in some of these patients. The choice between chemotherapy and endocrine neoadjuvant therapy is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98345.html" rel="external">"Neoadjuvant management of newly diagnosed hormone-positive breast cancer", section on 'Therapeutic options'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H446665336"><span class="h1">BENEFITS OF NEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>NACT is associated with high rates of clinical response and a greater likelihood of facilitating cosmetically acceptable surgery. For example, patients who were not candidates for breast conservation may become eligible after NACT; those with limited node-positive disease (cN1) may be appropriate for more limited axillary surgery after NACT. However, NACT has not been shown to improve disease-free or overall survival compared with the same treatment administered after surgery [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>Outcomes for patients receiving neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy were demonstrated in an individual patient data meta-analysis conducted by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group, which was based on data from 4756 women in 10 trials initiated between 1983 and 2002 [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Compared with adjuvant chemotherapy, NACT resulted in:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An increased frequency of breast-conserving surgery (65 versus 49 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Equivalent risks of distant recurrence (38 percent at 15 years in both arms) and breast cancer mortality (34 percent at 15 years in both arms).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An increased risk of local recurrence (21 versus 16 percent at 15 years; hazard ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.17-1.61), which has been attributed to the increase in breast-conserving surgery, but is of limited concern since it apparently does not increase the risk of distant recurrence or breast cancer mortality.</p><p></p><p>Among patients treated with NACT, achievement of a pathologic complete response at surgery is prognostically significant, particularly in patients with more aggressive breast cancer subtypes, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14225.html" rel="external">"General principles of neoadjuvant management of breast cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14225.html" rel="external">"General principles of neoadjuvant management of breast cancer", section on 'Pathologic assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Finally, emerging studies suggest that NACT may allow for a tailored approach to systemic therapy after breast surgery. In particular, studies have shown that administering <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8839" href="/z/d/drug information/8839.html" rel="external">capecitabine</a> as adjuvant treatment to women with TNBC and residual cancer after NACT (CREATE-X trial) or administering <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10101" href="/z/d/drug information/10101.html" rel="external">trastuzumab</a> emtansine as adjuvant treatment to women with HER2-positive breast cancer and residual cancer after NACT and HER2-targeted therapy (KATHERINE study) can improve long-term outcomes. Thus, in some patient populations, administration of NACT plays a role in identifying patients more likely to benefit from subsequent treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/788.html" rel="external">"Selection and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer", section on 'Patients who received neoadjuvant treatment'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/773.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant systemic therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer", section on 'Residual disease'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1969314925"><span class="h1">CHOOSING A REGIMEN</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The sections below describe chemotherapy options for patients with HER2-negative disease. Special considerations for those with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are discussed afterwards. (See <a class="local">'Special considerations for triple-negative disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Regimens utilized in the adjuvant setting also demonstrate activity as neoadjuvant treatment. Commonly used regimens for patients with HER2-negative disease include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anthracycline-based regimens such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9391" href="/z/d/drug information/9391.html" rel="external">doxorubicin</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a> followed or preceded by a taxane (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9735" href="/z/d/drug information/9735.html" rel="external">paclitaxel</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/z/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a> [AC-T]), and</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anthracycline-free regimens such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/z/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a> (TC), amongst others.</p><p></p><p>Results of the Anthracycline in Breast Cancer (ABC) analysis, which evaluated anthracycline-based regimens versus six cycles of TC in the adjuvant setting, inform neoadjuvant choices as well [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Although, overall, anthracycline-treated patients did slightly better (four-year invasive disease-free survival [IDFS] of 91 percent versus 88 percent for TC), in subset analysis, the benefit of adding the anthracycline was substantial only in node-positive TNBC and hormone receptor-positive patients with four or more involved nodes. Patients with node-negative TNBC or hormone receptor-positive patients with limited (one to three positive nodes) nodal involvement received minimal benefit from the addition of an anthracycline. These data are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/788.html" rel="external">"Selection and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer", section on 'Acceptable alternatives to anthracycline-based treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Many patients warranting neoadjuvant therapy have larger tumors and/or nodal involvement, and thus would qualify as "higher-risk" cases, in whom we favor anthracycline- and taxane-based regimens (eg, AC-T). But for many "intermediate-risk," HER2-negative patients, especially those with hormone receptor-positive cancers, and in patients for whom the potential cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines are a major concern, an anthracycline-free regimen such as TC is a reasonable alternative. (See <a class="local">'Anthracycline-free alternatives'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H472341994"><span class="h2">Anthracycline-based regimens</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For high-risk patients who are treated with NACT (eg, those with node-positive disease or node-negative TNBC ≥1 cm), we suggest an anthracycline- and taxane-based combination rather than a non-anthracycline-based treatment [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Data supporting the addition of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9202" href="/z/d/drug information/9202.html" rel="external">carboplatin</a> to weekly <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9735" href="/z/d/drug information/9735.html" rel="external">paclitaxel</a> and the programmed cell death protein 1-targeted monoclonal antibody <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="96957" href="/z/d/drug information/96957.html" rel="external">pembrolizumab</a> to taxane- and anthracycline-based NACT in stage II and III TNBC are discussed later in this topic. (See <a class="local">'Special considerations for triple-negative disease'</a> below.)</p><p>A major goal of neoadjuvant therapy is to provide effective systemic "adjuvant" therapy. Thus, in HER2-negative patients receiving anthracycline-based regimens, we typically administer four cycles of dose-dense (every two weeks) <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9391" href="/z/d/drug information/9391.html" rel="external">doxorubicin</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a> followed or preceded by <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9735" href="/z/d/drug information/9735.html" rel="external">paclitaxel</a> given either weekly for 12 weeks (AC-weekly T), or every two weeks for four cycles (AC-T)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55933" href="/z/d/graphic/55933.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Results from the ECOG 1199 trial demonstrated that, following AC, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/z/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a> administered every three weeks for four cycles was at least as effective as weekly paclitaxel as adjuvant therapy in patients with hormone receptor-positive cancers, and thus is a reasonable alternative in these patients [<a href="#rid7">7</a>] (see <a class="local">'Anthracycline-free alternatives'</a> below). In TNBC, we typically administer weekly paclitaxel with either weekly or every-three-week <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9202" href="/z/d/drug information/9202.html" rel="external">carboplatin</a> followed by four cycles of AC, with concurrent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="96957" href="/z/d/drug information/96957.html" rel="external">pembrolizumab</a> every three weeks. AC is usually administered every two weeks (referred to as "dose-dense"), though every three weeks is a reasonable alternative, as the superiority of dose-dense AC has not been demonstrated in the neoadjuvant setting.</p><p>The Oxford meta-analysis of adjuvant chemotherapy trials demonstrated overall benefit for anthracycline-based regimens over <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/z/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/z/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a> (CMF), and additional benefit for the sequential administration of a taxane in the adjuvant setting [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. A subsequent analysis demonstrated a benefit for dose-dense (every two weeks) compared with standard-frequency (every three weeks) adjuvant chemotherapy [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Further details are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/788.html" rel="external">"Selection and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer", section on 'Rationale for anthracycline- and taxane-containing regimen'</a>.)</p><p>In the neoadjuvant setting, multiple studies have demonstrated that addition of a taxane to an anthracycline-based regimen, either concurrently or sequentially, is associated with increased response rates [<a href="#rid10">10-17</a>]. As an example, in the NSABP B27 trial, 2411 patients received four cycles of neoadjuvant AC, after which they were randomly assigned to receive no further chemotherapy, four cycles of neoadjuvant <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/z/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a> (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) every three weeks, or to undergo surgery followed by four cycles of adjuvant docetaxel [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The addition of docetaxel in the neoadjuvant setting increased the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate from 13 to 26 percent, although the addition of this agent, whether given prior to or after surgery, had no demonstrable impact on overall survival (OS; 74 percent with neoadjuvant AC only and 75 percent in the arms containing docetaxel) or disease-free survival (59 and 62 percent).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H371590569"><span class="h3">Choice of taxane to pair with an anthracycline</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among patients receiving anthracyclines, we typically use <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9735" href="/z/d/drug information/9735.html" rel="external">paclitaxel</a> as our taxane of choice, though <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/z/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a> is a reasonable alternative in patients with hormone receptor-positive cancers, as discussed above. For patients who have had a previous hypersensitivity reaction to a taxane not amenable to conservative management, or a contraindication to the steroids administered with it, nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10159" href="/z/d/drug information/10159.html" rel="external">nabpaclitaxel</a>) is an acceptable alternative. Further details on the approach to taxane hypersensitivity are found below. (See <a class="local">'Anthracycline-based regimens'</a> above and <a class="local">'Management of hypersensitivity reaction to a taxane'</a> below.)</p><p>Results from the GeparSepto trial suggest that <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10159" href="/z/d/drug information/10159.html" rel="external">nabpaclitaxel</a> improves pCR rates and IDFS relative to standard <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9735" href="/z/d/drug information/9735.html" rel="external">paclitaxel</a> but is associated with greater toxicity.
