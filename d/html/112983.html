         Psoriasis is a systemic, immune-mediated disease that can negatively impact the quality of life of affected children and their families  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113134 graphicRef113135 graphicRef126360 graphicRef113323 graphicRef113138 graphicRef113139 graphicRef126359 graphicRef126362 graphicRef99441" href="/z/d/graphic/113134.html" rel="external">

         ). In most children, psoriasis can be adequately treated with topical medications. However, children with moderate to severe psoriasis often require phototherapy or systemic therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although many of the therapies commonly administered for psoriasis in children and adults are similar, high-quality efficacy and safety trials to guide the best approach to psoriasis in children are more limited. As a result, the development of guidelines for the treatment of pediatric psoriasis is challenging. In clinical practice, consideration of patient-specific factors, such as patient age, severity of disease, comorbidities, and tolerance of the risks and side effects of specific medications, guides the approach to treatment  (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The management of chronic plaque psoriasis, the most common clinical variant of psoriasis in children, will be reviewed here. The diagnosis of psoriasis in children and the approach to treatment of other clinical variants of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are reviewed separately.

          Disease severity
         </strong>
         – Most children have mild to moderate psoriasis (generally defined as psoriasis involving less than 10 percent of the total body surface area), which can often be adequately treated with topical medications, such as corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and vitamin D analogs. Approximately 10 to 20 percent of children have moderate to severe psoriasis, defined as psoriasis that involves more than 10 percent of the body surface area or psoriasis that cannot be adequately improved with topical therapy. Moderate to severe psoriasis often requires phototherapy or systemic therapy  (

         </strong>
         – The availability of efficacy and safety data for specific age groups differs among treatments.

         Mild to moderate plaque psoriasis is generally defined as psoriasis involving less than 10 percent of the total body surface area. Given the limited amount of skin involvement, topical therapy is usually manageable for patients and their caregivers  (

         Preferred initial therapies for mild to moderate plaque psoriasis in children include topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, topical vitamin D analogs, and emollients.
        </p>
        <p>
         Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay for pediatric psoriasis based upon the extensive clinical experience that supports efficacy for this indication and the wide availability and affordability of some of these agents [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. However, long-term corticosteroid therapy is associated with increased risk for side effects, such as skin atrophy. Thus, topical calcineurin inhibitors and topical vitamin D analogs are often added to (or substituted for) topical corticosteroid therapy to reduce corticosteroid exposure. Emollients can be a useful adjunct to all therapies.

          Regimen
         </strong>
         – Plaque psoriasis usually responds to topical corticosteroid therapy provided the agent selected has adequate potency. Psoriasis plaques on the trunk and extremities in children can be treated with high-potency to medium-potency (group 2 to 4  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402" href="/z/d/graphic/62402.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         )) topical corticosteroids applied twice daily. Signs of improvement (reduced erythema and plaque thickness) are sometimes evident within the first one to two weeks, with additional improvement occurring with continued use. We continue daily treatment for up to four weeks. Once sufficient improvement occurs, the topical corticosteroid can be discontinued or tapered to intermittent use (two consecutive days per week [eg, weekends]) to maintain the response, if needed. Daily application for up to four weeks is resumed for subsequent flares.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         If psoriasis plaques on the trunk or extremities do not respond sufficiently within four weeks of daily treatment with a group 2 to 4 topical corticosteroid, a short course (≤2 weeks) of a super-high potency (group 1  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402" href="/z/d/graphic/62402.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         )) topical corticosteroid may lead to improvement. After two weeks of use, application should be tapered to intermittent use (eg, two consecutive days per week). Alternatively, the patient can be transitioned to a lower-potency corticosteroid.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         We often incorporate a vitamin D analog in the treatment regimen when feasible. Patients or caregivers can apply the vitamin D analog simultaneously with the topical corticosteroid during treatment of acute flares. Once the frequency of topical corticosteroid application is reduced to two days per week, application of the topical vitamin D analog may continue on the remaining five days. (See

         – Topical corticosteroids are available in a wide variety of vehicles (eg, ointment, cream, lotion, gel, solution, spray, foam). In general, ointments are preferred over other vehicles to enhance penetration of psoriatic scale. However, patient preferences and certain sites (eg, hair-bearing scalp) warrant consideration of other vehicles to maximize the likelihood of adherence to therapy. (See

          Use on hyperkeratotic plaques

         – Inadequate penetration of topical corticosteroids can lead to poor responses in children with markedly hyperkeratotic plaques. Compounding topical corticosteroids with keratolytics, like 6% salicylic acid, with or without topical tar can facilitate treatment of these plaques.

Risk for these side effects can be reduced by limiting the duration of application, avoiding excessive application (a thin layer is sufficient), and avoiding use of potent corticosteroids on the face and intertriginous areas. (See

         Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids may also lead to hypothalamic-pituitary axis suppression, particularly in children. To minimize risk of this side effect, avoidance of long-term, daily use of topical corticosteroids on large skin areas is prudent. (See

         Topical calcineurin inhibitors are an additional first-line treatment option for psoriasis in children.

         The application of emollients is an important adjunctive measure for psoriasis. Moisturizing the skin can make scale less prominent and reduce pruritus and fissuring. Emollients may also help to minimize the Koebner phenomenon (occurrence of new psoriasis plaques in sites of skin trauma) through reducing the likelihood of skin irritation.

The topical calcineurin inhibitor is applied twice daily until satisfactory improvement. Improvement is expected within the first month of treatment. Once resolution has occurred, treatment can be stopped. Application is resumed upon recurrence of disease.

         Alternatively, topical corticosteroids can be used for psoriasis on the face or intertriginous skin. The agent selected should have a low potency (group 6 or 7). The corticosteroid is applied twice daily for up to two weeks. If sufficient improvement is obtained, treatment can be stopped, with the plan to resume treatment during subsequent flares. If the response is insufficient or disease recurs rapidly (eg, within a few weeks), we favor transitioning the patient to topical calcineurin inhibitor therapy.

         Guidelines on the therapeutic approach to moderate to severe psoriasis in children are lacking. Selection among the available treatments is dependent upon consideration of patient-specific factors, such as severity of disease, comorbidities, tolerance of risks and side effects, and prior treatment history  (

          methotrexate
         </a>
         is the most common systemic medication used for psoriasis in children. Advantages of methotrexate include a long history of use for pediatric psoriasis, availability of an oral formulation, and low cost compared with other psoriasis therapies. Disadvantages of methotrexate include a relatively slow onset of action, the need for laboratory monitoring during treatment, and the potentially serious side effect of hepatotoxicity. In addition, methotrexate may be less effective than some biologic agents. A randomized trial found methotrexate inferior to

          Phototherapy
         </strong>
         – Our use of phototherapy for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is based upon the absence of risk for the serious, systemic side effects that may occur with systemic therapies. However, phototherapy requires frequent office visits (unless home phototherapy is implemented), which is difficult for some families, and phototherapy is not recommended for very young children. In addition, there is some uncertainty regarding the long-term risk for skin cancer in children treated with NBUVB phototherapy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13745.html" rel="external">
          "UVB phototherapy (broadband and narrowband)", section on 'Short- and long-term adverse effects'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Ideal candidates for NBUVB phototherapy are children who can come for frequent visits and who are old enough to follow instructions and safely remain in a light booth alone. We typically consider phototherapy in children over the age of six years (most commonly, preadolescents and adolescents), although even young children can be treated when a parent or caregiver accompanies the child in the booth and can provide entertainment. Phototherapy is also a useful option for children and families who desire to avoid systemic therapy. (See

          Cyclosporine
         </a>
         can be rapidly effective for psoriasis. However, the drug has the potential for serious adverse effects and is generally reserved for children with acute, severe flares of disease that require immediate relief and severe psoriasis types, such as acute generalized pustular psoriasis and erythrodermic psoriasis. The side effects of cyclosporine limit the recommended duration of therapy to less than one year. The low cost of cyclosporine compared with biologic therapy is an advantage of this therapy. (See

         Oral retinoids can be effective for psoriasis but are less favored for chronic plaque psoriasis based upon lower efficacy as monotherapy compared with other agents.

Most children require continued treatment to maintain improvement. If flares occur during tapering, increasing the maintenance dose by 0.1 mg/kg above the dose at which the flare occurred often regains control of disease.

         Controlled administration of artificial ultraviolet light, specifically NBUVB, can be an appropriate therapy for some children. Phototherapy options include NBUVB and targeted phototherapy with the excimer laser. Of these, NBUVB is more commonly used for the treatment of children. The excimer laser provides the advantage of minimizing exposure of unaffected skin to ultraviolet B (UVB), but data on the efficacy and safety of the excimer laser in children are limited. Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) phototherapy is rarely used in children due to concern for greater risk for side effects compared with NBUVB (see

          Administration
         </strong>
         – Phototherapy is usually administered in the outpatient setting two to three times per week. Once satisfactory improvement is achieved, the frequency of treatments is tapered as tolerated. The child must be able to follow instructions and should be comfortable with standing still in an enclosed space alone. School-age children are typically able to manage phototherapy; some younger children are reasonable candidates as well [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Home phototherapy is a convenient alternative for children who have had phototherapy safely and effectively initiated in an outpatient setting. Patients and caregivers should be given clear instructions for the advancement of ultraviolet light exposure, and intermittent clinical follow-up is necessary.

Of the 79 children available for final analysis, 73 (92 percent) achieved at least 75 percent clinical improvement, including 40 children (51 percent) who achieved complete clearance of skin lesions.

          Adverse effects and precautions

         – Potential side effects of NBUVB phototherapy include cutaneous erythema, dryness, pruritus, and blistering. Available data suggest that NBUVB does not increase the long-term risk for skin cancer; however, additional studies are necessary to confirm this, particularly in children. Topical vitamin D analogs should be applied after (not before) phototherapy sessions.

         – Fumaric acid esters are used for the treatment of psoriasis in Europe. A trial in which 135 children (ages 10 to 17 years) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to fumaric acid esters tablets or placebo supports efficacy of fumaric acid esters [

         Although mild to moderate plaque psoriasis in children under the age of four years is likely to respond to the general approach described above, modifications are appropriate for this population. In general, less potent topical corticosteroids (groups 4 to 7  (

          table 1

         )) are preferred over higher-potency agents. For children in diapers, treatment of this area with topical corticosteroids should be monitored closely, since the occlusive effect of the diaper may increase risk for cutaneous side effects  (

        </p>
        <p>
         As with older children, the primary treatments for facial and intertriginous psoriasis are topical calcineurin inhibitors and low-potency topical corticosteroids. We prefer to use topical calcineurin inhibitors (

         </a>
         1%) for facial and intertriginous psoriasis, particularly when continuous corticosteroid therapy is required for disease control or side effects from topical corticosteroid therapy have occurred. Safety concerns regarding the use of topical calcineurin inhibitors are reviewed separately. (See

        <p>
         Topical vitamin D analogs and topical retinoids are rarely used in the treatment of infants because of the common side effect of skin irritation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach to moderate to severe psoriasis in children under the age of four primarily consists of optimization of topical therapy. We typically avoid phototherapy and systemic therapies in this age group because of safety concerns with use in this population. However, use of these interventions is necessary in rare, refractory cases.

         Psoriasis in children is typically chronic, but its course is unpredictable. Spontaneous remissions and exacerbations are common. Occasionally, alleviating conditions, such as sun exposure during the summer months, or triggers, including infections and trauma, can be identified. The available therapies provide satisfactory disease control for the majority of pediatric patients.

         – Our typical treatments for children with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (psoriasis involving more than 10 percent of the body surface area or that cannot be successfully treated with topical therapy) who are at least four years of age include

         , phototherapy, and biologic therapy is based upon consideration of factors such as severity of disease, comorbidities, tolerance of risks and side effects, treatment availability, and prior treatment history. Methotrexate can be administered orally and has a long history of use for pediatric psoriasis but requires laboratory monitoring. Phototherapy is favored when there is a desire to avoid systemic therapy but requires frequent clinic visits. Biologic agents can be highly effective but are administered via injection, which can be challenging for some children (see

         . Data on the relative efficacy of individual biologic agents for pediatric psoriasis are limited. There is no single biologic therapy that is preferred for the initial treatment of all patients. Shared decision making with the patient and/or caregiver(s) plays an important role in treatment selection (see

          ustekinumab

         as the only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved biologic therapy for psoriasis in children four and five years of age often necessitates use of etanercept for initial therapy in this population.
