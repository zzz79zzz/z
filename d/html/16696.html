Clinical evaluation should identify associated serious head injury, laceration of the galea, or bony defect of the skull. After hemostasis is achieved and the wound is irrigated, scalp lacerations are typically closed with surgical staples under local anesthesia. Sutures may be preferred over staples for large, gaping wounds and to provide hemostasis for wounds with brisk bleeding.</p><p>The assessment and management of scalp lacerations will be reviewed here. Minor wound management, methods of suture placement, and closure of skin wounds with staples are discussed in detail separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6328.html" rel="external">"Minor wound evaluation and preparation for closure"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6319.html" rel="external">"Skin laceration repair with sutures"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6320.html" rel="external">"Closure of minor skin wounds with staples"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4198638"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As in all trauma patients, the initial clinical assessment should provide rapid identification of potentially fatal conditions. Evaluation should rapidly identify airway compromise (while maintaining cervical spine immobilization), impaired breathing, hemorrhagic shock, and altered level of consciousness upon patient arrival at the emergency department. Such systematic evaluation helps ensure detection of potentially life-threatening injuries. The approach to the injured child or adult is discussed in detail separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64241" href="/z/d/graphic/64241.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6571.html" rel="external">"Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child", section on 'Primary survey'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13854.html" rel="external">"Initial management of trauma in adults", section on 'Primary evaluation and management'</a>.)</p><p>Scalp lacerations should be identified during a vigilant and organized secondary survey.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6328.html" rel="external">"Minor wound evaluation and preparation for closure", section on 'Risks for poor outcome'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, the clinician should also elicit allergies to any medications, especially local anesthetics, and the patient’s tetanus immunization status. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2084.html" rel="external">"Allergic reactions to local anesthetics", section on 'Evaluation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13875.html" rel="external">"Assessment and management of facial lacerations", section on 'Tetanus prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4198847"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The scalp should be examined carefully to evaluate for signs of injury to the underlying structures  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87633" href="/z/d/graphic/87633.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). The layers of concern in the scalp include the subcutaneous tissue, galea aponeurosis, connective tissue and periosteum overlying the bone. Visible or palpable bony defects warrant computed tomography of the head to determine presence of intracranial injury or penetration of the wound through the skull. </p><p>Removal of all foreign debris and blood will allow for proper assessment. Bleeding is a common problem with scalp lacerations. Hemostasis of a wound is necessary to allow for an appropriate examination. Direct pressure for approximately 15 minutes with or without local injection of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/z/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/z/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> can often provide sufficient hemostasis. If these methods fail, the clinician should evert the edges of the scalp wound using manual manipulation, hemostats, or skin hooks. The wound is then rapidly closed with sutures. In this situation, simple interrupted sutures provide circumferential wound closure and thus better control of bleeding than noncircumferential wound closure with staples.

If these wounds are not closed, they will heal by secondary intention but have increased scarring and risk for wound infection. In general, a scalp laceration with no increased risk factors for infection can be closed regardless of time from injury if appropriate cleansing is performed [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6328.html" rel="external">"Minor wound evaluation and preparation for closure", section on 'Type of closure'</a>.)</p><p>Delayed primary closure (ie, cleansing and debridement at the time of initial presentation with definitive wound closure performed electively four to five days later) may be warranted for wounds that present after 24 hours and have increased risk for infection. There is no definite time point after which wounds must be closed by delayed primary closure. In general, the decision should be based upon the time from injury, patient factors that increase the risk of infection (ie, vascular insufficiency), and wound factors (contamination or foreign body potential). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6328.html" rel="external">"Minor wound evaluation and preparation for closure", section on 'Type of closure'</a>.)</p><p>Because of the excellent blood flow to the scalp, wound infections are rare, even following repair of contaminated wounds or bite wounds. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4199115"><span class="h2">Contraindications and precautions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Wounds with obvious signs of inflammation (redness, warmth, swelling, pus drainage) should not be closed primarily. Scalp laceration closure should also not delay further evaluation and definitive care of more urgent traumatic injuries, including underlying intracranial injuries [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p>When closure is delayed, saline-soaked gauze packing (wet-dry closure) can be provided to enhance secondary healing. Appropriate antibiotic coverage (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8676" href="/z/d/drug information/8676.html" rel="external">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> or, in penicillin allergic patients, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9275" href="/z/d/drug information/9275.html" rel="external">clindamycin</a>) aimed at the flora of the skin and possibly upper respiratory tract can be initiated in selected patients with wounds other than bite wounds (eg, patient with diabetes mellitus, or other risks for poor wound outcome). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6328.html" rel="external">"Minor wound evaluation and preparation for closure", section on 'Type of closure'</a>.)</p><p>Indications and empiric oral antibiotic regiments for patients with animal bites  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75020" href="/z/d/graphic/75020.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) and human bites  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69328" href="/z/d/graphic/69328.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) are discussed separately.

If these methods fail, the edges of the scalp wound can be everted manually or using hemostats or skin hooks and the wound rapidly closed with sutures.

Disposable hair combs can be used to help remove blood clots and other foreign debris.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The volume of wound irrigation for scalp lacerations is based upon wound size and degree of contamination. Moderate sized scalp lacerations (&gt;2.5 to 5.0 cm in length) with minimal contamination may be irrigated with 100 to 150 mL while contaminated wounds and wounds &gt;5.0 cm in length may benefit from irrigation with 200 mL or more.

This approach is appropriate for wounds that are straight and less than 10 cm. Patients need to have hair that is longer than 1 cm and scalp bleeding must be controlled prior to the procedure [<a href="#rid20">20-22</a>]. We prefer the modified hair apposition technique over hair tying because it can be performed in patients with hair as short as 1 cm. Scalp wound closure with staples may be faster than the modified hair apposition technique with similar wound outcomes, and closure with sutures is preferred when control of bleeding is necessary.</p><p>Modified hair apposition is performed in the following manner  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63626" href="/z/d/graphic/63626.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid20">20,22</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ensure that the wound is clean and is not actively bleeding.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Using forceps or hemostats, grasp between 5 and 15 strands of hair directly opposite and on each side of the wound.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cross the strands once without knotting until the wound edges are apposed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Maintain the strand closure by having an assistant place one drop of glue where the strands cross.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoid getting glue into the wound.

For example, in a randomized study of 189 patients with scalp lacerations, wound healing after modified hair apposition was similar to sutured wounds with a significantly lower risk for complications (eg, infection, scarring, bleeding, or wound breakdown [7 versus 22 percent]) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Hair apposition was less painful and quicker than wound closure with sutures (median closure time 5 versus 15 minutes). However, the complication rate for sutures in this study was higher than reported in other scalp wound studies, thus limiting the generalizability of these results. </p><p>Modified hair apposition is obviously not a suitable technique for bald patients or those with short hair (&lt;1 cm). Profusely bleeding scalp wounds and those with gross contamination may require close clipping of hair to achieve hemostasis, proper wound cleansing, and debridement and also preclude the use of the hair apposition technique. In addition, the modified hair apposition technique requires an assistant to apply glue to the hair strands. </p><p>Although modified hair apposition appears to have advantages when compared to suture placement in patients with the appropriate wound and hair characteristics, the benefits when compared to closure of scalp wounds with staples is less well studied. Modified hair apposition takes approximately 5 to 10 minutes [<a href="#rid20">20</a>] to perform while staple closure typically takes approximately 1 minute [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. However, modified hair apposition avoids the need for staple removal which requires a special instrument and can be painful. Both methods provide good cosmetic results with few complications.
