However, historically, person-to-person spread outside the household and mortality from mpox are significantly less than for smallpox. The rash of mpox can also be similar in appearance to more common infectious rashes, such as those observed in secondary syphilis, herpes simplex infection, and varicella-zoster virus infection.</p><p>This topic will review the virology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of mpox. Topic reviews that discuss the treatment and prevention of mpox are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8295.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prevention of mpox (monkeypox)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8296.html" rel="external">"Vaccines to prevent smallpox, mpox (monkeypox), and other orthopoxviruses"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2197026916"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In November 2022, the World Health Organization, who is responsible for naming and renaming of diseases under the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), changed the name of the disease referred to as “monkeypox” to “mpox” [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. This change was made to follow current best practices of not naming diseases after animals or geographic locations and to reduce any stigma that could be associated with the original name.</p><p>The virus that causes mpox will continue to be referred to as monkeypox virus until the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) officially decides what the name of the virus should be. However, the former Congo Basin (Central African) clade was renamed as Clade one (I) and the former West African clade was renamed as Clade two (II). Clade II consists of two subclades, IIa and IIb. (See <a class="local">'Virology'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H656348099"><span class="h1">VIROLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Monkeypox virus is an orthopoxvirus that is in the same genus as variola (the causative agent of smallpox) and vaccinia viruses (the virus used in the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10175" href="/z/d/drug information/10175.html" rel="external">smallpox vaccine</a>). Electron microscopy of cells infected with monkeypox virus shows a brick-like virion, indistinguishable from the virions of variola or vaccinia viruses  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56100" href="/z/d/graphic/56100.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Two distinct strains of monkeypox virus have existed in different geographic regions of Africa, as suggested by epidemiologic, animal, and molecular evidence [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Clade I has been responsible for disease in the Congo basin whereas clade II has been isolated in West Africa. The strain isolated from West Africa is less virulent and lacks several genes present in the strain from Central Africa [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p>Clade II consists of two subclades, clades IIa and IIb [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The existence of these two subclades was recognized during the 2022 global outbreak [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. (See <a class="local">'2022 global outbreak'</a> below and <a class="local">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p>Early analyses of viruses from this outbreak reveal that they are similar to sequences of strains circulating in Nigeria from the 2018 to 2019 outbreak. Initial sequence data from 15 isolates indicate that there are more mutations than expected in the DNA genome, raising the possibility that the circulating virus is undergoing accelerated human adaptation [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2224177189"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Monkeypox virus was first isolated in Denmark in the late 1950s from a colony of laboratory monkeys from Singapore that were going to be used for polio virus research [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. During the following decade, additional outbreaks of mpox were seen in laboratory animals in the United States as well as zoo animals in Rotterdam [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Monkeypox virus was first identified as a cause of disease in humans in the 1970s in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3983560929"><span class="h2">Geographic distribution</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Since the discontinuation of smallpox immunization, which also protects against mpox, cases of mpox have generally occurred in Central and West Africa. The first outbreak of mpox in the Western hemisphere occurred in the United States in 2003 [<a href="#rid8">8-10</a>]. Since then, sporadic cases have been reported in several nonendemic countries, mostly related to travel from Africa. However, an ongoing global outbreak associated with person-to-person transmission was reported in May 2022 and has involved thousands of individuals in dozens of <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fpoxvirus%2Fmonkeypox%2Fresponse%2F2022%2Fworld-map.html&amp;token=4ZcyscDBCla9RMWuKj7aKb82v%2FqHQmpOTgSCiZacRizNvexuk5CzQm69sndhvJ6BGF18yNSNvVoM9ejK%2BXtomWYiVWPOGodCBnSDfcHqm1I%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=139254" target="_blank">countries</a> [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. Transmission of monkeypox virus is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Transmission'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3071065730"><span class="h3">Central and West Africa</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Monkeypox virus was first identified as a cause of disease in humans in the 1970s in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly the Republic of Zaire) [<a href="#rid13">13-17</a>]. Following its recognition as a human pathogen, 59 cases of human mpox were reported between 1970 and 1980 in West Africa and Central Africa, with a mortality rate of 17 percent in children under 10 years of age [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>]. All of these cases occurred in the rain forests of West and Central Africa among individuals exposed to small forest animals (eg, rodents, squirrels, and monkeys).</p><p>After the eradication of naturally occurring smallpox in 1977 and the discontinuation of routine smallpox immunization (ie, vaccinia virus vaccine) in 1980 [<a href="#rid20">20</a>], the World Health Organization (WHO) monitored subsequent human mpox cases [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The WHO was concerned that discontinuation of the vaccinia virus vaccine, which also protects against mpox, would lead to increased susceptibility of the population and the possibility of an increased incidence of mpox.</p><p>A population-based surveillance study from 2005 to 2007 reported a 20-fold increase in incidence of mpox compared with that seen in the 1980s in the Democratic Republic of the Congo [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. From 2005 to 2007, 760 laboratory-confirmed human mpox cases were identified. This study supported concerns of increased human cases of mpox due to the lack of prior smallpox vaccination as persons with a history of smallpox immunization had a fivefold lower risk of mpox compared with unvaccinated persons. Other factors associated with an increased risk of infection included living in forested areas, male sex, and age &lt;15 years.</p><p>Since 2017, there has been an increase in mpox cases in Nigeria; this occurred after almost 40 years with no reported cases [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. Some cases from this outbreak in Nigeria have occurred in travelers returning to nonendemic countries. (See <a class="local">'Sporadic cases related to travel from endemic countries'</a> below.)</p><p>In 2022, the WHO reported that mpox was endemic in several African countries including Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Ghana (identified in animals only), Ivory Coast, Liberia, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, and South Sudan. From January to May 2022, most suspected cases of mpox occurred in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with 1284 cases and 58 deaths reported [<a href="#rid11">11,25</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3423279440"><span class="h3">Nonendemic countries</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3261939286"><span class="h4">2022 global outbreak</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A global outbreak of mpox was first recognized in Europe in May 2022 [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Cases related to this outbreak were reported in nonendemic <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fpoxvirus%2Fmonkeypox%2Fresponse%2F2022%2Fworld-map.html&amp;token=4ZcyscDBCla9RMWuKj7aKb82v%2FqHQmpOTgSCiZacRizNvexuk5CzQm69sndhvJ6BGF18yNSNvVoM9ejK%2BXtomWYiVWPOGodCBnSDfcHqm1I%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=139254" target="_blank">countries worldwide</a>, providing evidence of community spread. On July 23, 2022, the WHO declared this outbreak of mpox a public health emergency of international concern [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p>The first cases of mpox in this outbreak were identified in the United Kingdom in mid-May 2022. These were not associated with recent travel to an endemic area or close contact with a person known to have mpox. Although mpox was identified in the UK in a person with recent travel to Nigeria on May 7, 2022, the cases did not appear to be related [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p>Nontravel-related cases of mpox were subsequently reported in other parts of Europe [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. As an example, in Portugal, five confirmed cases and more than 20 suspected cases of mpox were reported in May 2022. All were in young men in Lisbon and the Tagus Valley. Spain also reported several suspected cases around this time [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p>In the United States, the first mpox case was also reported in May 2022 [<a href="#rid31">31,32</a>]. Genome sequencing results from virus recovered from this patient displayed similarities to other published genomes in this outbreak from Europe and are related to the mpox outbreak in Nigeria that occurred from 2017 to 2018. (See <a class="local">'Central and West Africa'</a> above and <a class="local">'Virology'</a> above.)</p><p>Thousands of confirmed mpox/orthopoxvirus cases in dozens of countries were subsequently reported. In the United States, the reported number of new cases peaked in early August 2022 [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. In Montreal, there were two peaks of cases (early June and July) followed by a decline by October 2022 [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].

In a report of 528 cases of confirmed human mpox infection from 16 countries, 98 percent of the persons were MSM [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the United States, 769 cisgender women aged ≥15 years were identified, representing 2.7 percent of all reported mpox cases; the majority reported sexual activity or close intimate contact as the likely route of exposure [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. One report of 74 cisgender women and 62 transgender women found that transgender women were exposed to mpox by sexual contact to a greater extent than cisgender women, and the infection coexisted more frequently with HIV infection [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Other modes of transmission have also been reported in women; as an example in a report from Spain, almost 10 percent of cases in women were linked to a tattoo studio [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Household transmission to young children has also been reported [<a href="#rid39">39,40</a>]. However, the incidence of such transmissions is rare. In the United States, children under age 15 represent only 0.21 percent of cases [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Association with sexual activity</strong> – In the 2022 outbreak, most patients diagnosed with mpox reported high-risk sexual behavior (eg, sex with multiple partners) as a potential risk factor. Many early cases occurred in people who had attended an international pride event held on the Spanish island of Gran Canaria that was linked to transmission chains in several European countries [<a href="#rid30">30,42-44</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, by the end of May, locally acquired infections and community transmission became predominant in all affected countries [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. Some of the patients diagnosed with mpox have reported having multiple or anonymous sexual partners in the previous two weeks, attending 'sex-on-premises' venues (eg, gay bathhouses, backrooms, clubs) or 'group sex' sessions, and using recreational drugs during sex. About 40 percent of patients infected with monkeypox virus are people taking pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent acquiring HIV [<a href="#rid35">35,45</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113426.html" rel="external">"HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis", section on 'Indications based upon risk'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although most of the initial cases during this outbreak have been associated with close contact in the context of sexual activity, anyone who has direct skin-to-skin contact or live in a home with someone who has mpox is at risk, and there have been cases of mpox in household contacts. (See <a class="local">'Human-to-human transmission'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Concomitant sexually transmitted infections have been reported in a range of 16 to 29 percent of individuals tested in the published cohorts of the 2022 outbreak with gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis being the most common infections.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Association with HIV</strong> – In the published cohorts of the 2022 outbreak, the percentage of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is high, ranging from 36 to 42 percent among cases diagnosed with mpox infection [<a href="#rid35">35,46,47</a>]. It is not yet known whether HIV infection affects a person's risk for acquiring mpox; however, the risk of progressing to severe disease has been reported to be higher in those with low CD4 counts [<a href="#rid48">48,49</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Other complications'</a> below and <a class="local">'Prognosis and risk for severe disease'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Role of prior smallpox vaccination</strong> – Previous smallpox vaccination provides some protection against severe disease, but it does not provide lifelong protection from getting infected and infecting someone else. During the 2022 outbreak, several people who were infected with monkeypox virus had previously been vaccinated against smallpox decades earlier [<a href="#rid43">43,44,46</a>]. In a report of 181 cases of confirmed mpox in Spain, 32 (18 percent) had a history of smallpox vaccination in their childhood [<a href="#rid46">46</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H243697717"><span class="h4">2003 United States outbreak</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Between May 15 and June 2003, an outbreak of 71 cases (confirmed and probable) of human mpox in six states (Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin) was investigated by the CDC; 35 cases were laboratory confirmed [<a href="#rid8">8-10</a>]. Prior to this cluster of cases, mpox had not been previously found in the Western hemisphere.</p><p>The investigation demonstrated that the onset of a febrile illness, with subsequent appearance of a pustular rash, had developed in patients who had recently purchased or had contact with pet prairie dogs. The prairie dogs appeared to have acquired the virus from African rodents from Ghana when the two species were housed at a distribution center in Illinois.</p><p>Mpox was confirmed by DNA sequences obtained from skin lesions from 9 of 10 patients from Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin and in lymph node tissue of one pet prairie dog that died [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Direct exposure to animals (including exposure to ill prairie dogs' urine and feces) without personal protection equipment (PPE) was felt to be the likely source of transmission [<a href="#rid50">50</a>], although person-to-person transmission could not be entirely excluded. Of the cases reported in Wisconsin, the veterinary staff who were exposed to an outbreak-associated prairie dog were at particularly high risk, with an attack rate of 23 percent (range 7 to 67 percent) [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].</p><p>Because of this outbreak, the transportation, sale, or release into the wild of prairie dogs and animals from Africa (including tree squirrels, rope squirrels, dormice, brush-tailed porcupines, and striped mice in addition to Gambian giant rats) was subsequently prohibited by the CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. There have been no other United States outbreaks related to imported animals since the time of this prohibition.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1324171606"><span class="h4">Sporadic cases related to travel from endemic countries</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several sporadic cases of mpox have been reported after travel to endemic areas [<a href="#rid52">52-56</a>]. In one study evaluating the 2017 outbreak in Nigeria, a small pool of related isolates was the likely source for the exported infections [<a href="#rid57">57</a>].</p><p>Between 2018 and 2021, seven cases of mpox were diagnosed in the United Kingdom; four cases were related to travel from endemic countries, two cases resulted from household transmission from one of the index cases, and one case occurred in a health care worker who acquired infection nosocomially [<a href="#rid58">58,59</a>].</p><p>In July 2021, a patient was diagnosed with mpox in Dallas, Texas [<a href="#rid60">60,61</a>].

As such, mpox can spread during activities that include close, personal contact with an infected individual. Transmission may be facilitated by a breach in the skin or mucosa of the recipient. (See <a class="local">'Pathophysiology'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">During the ongoing worldwide outbreak of mpox reported beginning in May 2022 in nonendemic countries, close contact with infectious material from skin lesions or lesions on mucous membranes (eg, occurring during sexual and/or close intimate contact) is considered the main risk factor for acquisition [<a href="#rid11">11,37,65</a>].

In one report that investigated respiratory isolation rooms, viral DNA was found in rooms, bathrooms, anterooms, and on nontouch surfaces (eg, &gt;1.5 meters from the bed) as well as on health care workers' PPE [<a href="#rid71">71</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">It is unclear whether contact through fomites is a common source of transmission however, the widespread surface contamination of the patient care environment calls for a systematic approach to the use of infection prevention precautions in the home and healthcare settings, which is discussed elsewhere.

During the 2022 outbreak a study evaluating 181 mpox cases found that samples from skin lesions contain much more viral DNA than do those from the throat [<a href="#rid46">46</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Activities resulting in resuspension of dried material from lesions (eg, shaking contaminated linens) may also present a risk and should be avoided.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vertical transmission</strong> – The virus can cross the placenta from the mother to her fetus, which can lead to congenital mpox, although the rate of transmission or risk by trimester is not known [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]. In a report of four pregnant women with mpox from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, one gave birth to a healthy infant, two had miscarriages in the first trimester, and one had fetal death with the stillborn showing diffuse cutaneous maculopapular skin lesions consistent with vertical transmission [<a href="#rid72">72</a>].

In one report from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the secondary attack rate in households has been reported to be as high as 9 percent [<a href="#rid82">82</a>]. By contrast, a very limited number of transmission chains have been linked to households during the 2022 outbreak. As an example, in a study of 528 mpox cases from multiple countries, 0.8 percent were likely due to nonsexual close contact, and 0.6 percent were due to household contact [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Similarly, in another study of 181 cases from Spain, 3 percent of infections resulted from household contact [<a href="#rid46">46</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>In congregate living situations</strong> – There are limited data on the risk of monkeypox virus transmission in congregate living situations. In March 2022, an outbreak of mpox was described among 28 persons in a prison in Nigeria [<a href="#rid83">83</a>]. By contrast, in a report from the United States, no known cases developed in 57 jail residents who had a potential intermediate-risk exposure to a resident with mpox, even though monkeypox virus DNA was detected on at least one surface in the living quarters [<a href="#rid84">84</a>]. However, in this report there was loss of follow-up in about a third of the residents and receipt of post-exposure vaccination among almost a third of those who were followed.

During the 2003 outbreak in the United States, there were no instances of nosocomial transmission in health care facilities.

As an example, in a prospective study of 181 patients with mpox, higher viral DNA loads were found on skin than on pharyngeal swabs [<a href="#rid46">46</a>].

In an analysis of 1663 samples taken from 77 patients during the 2022 outbreak, the median time from symptom onset to viral clearance was 25 days in the skin lesions, 16 days in the oropharynx, 16 days in the rectum, 13 days in semen, and 1 day in blood; the time from symptom onset to viral clearance was approximately 40 days for 90 percent of cases [<a href="#rid88">88</a>]. In a different report, which followed seven patients who were hospitalized with moderate-to-severe mpox in the United Kingdom between 2018 and 2021, PCR positivity in blood and upper respiratory tract samples was detected for at least three weeks in three of the patients [<a href="#rid59">59</a>].

The type of infection depends on the species of orthopoxvirus and the route of entry. Generalized disease usually manifests as a diffuse rash.

The pathogenesis of human mpox following skin inoculation is felt to be similar to that of smallpox and other orthopoxviruses. Several orthopoxviruses can cause infection in animals after being introduced through the skin as well; this includes monkeypox virus and variola virus in nonhuman primates and ectromelia virus (ECTV) in mice [<a href="#rid92">92</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Using a monkeypox virus animal model, after subcutaneous inoculation of a West African strain, viral replication was observed only in the skin and lymphatic system, while intranasal inoculation resulted in diffuse viral replication throughout the body tissues, including the lungs [<a href="#rid91">91</a>]. Human data are limited to those obtained from accidental or intentional skin inoculations of the vaccinia virus or variola virus (ie, variolation), which was observed to result in locally restricted lesions around the point of entry [<a href="#rid92">92</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Infection via respiratory route</strong> – Monkeypox viruses can enter through the respiratory system in experimental models [<a href="#rid91">91,93,94</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Human-to-human transmission'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Using a nonhuman primate model of respiratory monkeypox virus with histopathological examinations at several time points postchallenge, it was demonstrated that during the incubation period, the virus is first seen in respiratory bronchioles and alveoli in the lungs (postchallenge day 4) [<a href="#rid94">94</a>]. The virus then spreads to the regional lymph nodes and organs of the reticuloendothelial system (day 6), including the tonsils, spleen, liver, and colon, where it replicates. Virus was ultimately detected in the blood on day 8, and its concentration increased through day 10 along with widespread lesions in the skin.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2346505841"><span class="h2">Immunology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Monkeypox virus infection stimulates an adaptative immune response comprising activated effector CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells [<a href="#rid95">95</a>]; neutralizing antibodies (IgM and IgG); and the production of Th1-inflammatory cytokines (gamma interferon [IFN-γ], IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF) [<a href="#rid96">96</a>]. These immune responses restrict viral replication and induce prolonged immunity in recovering patients.

In the center of the lesion, a vesicle affecting the entire epidermis is formed by ballooning degeneration of keratinocytes and accumulation of intercellular fluid [<a href="#rid97">97</a>]. A mixed inflammatory infiltrate is present at the dermal-epidermal junction at the base of the vesicle composed of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils.</p><p>The lesion develops into a pustule containing apoptotic keratinocyte debris, a few viable keratinocytes, and inflammatory cells. Viable keratinocytes may be multinucleated or exhibit cytopathic damage, such as eosinophilic inclusion bodies, prominent nucleoli, and "ground glass" chromatin. A mixed inflammatory infiltrate is also present in the perivascular, perieccrine, and dermal regions. Finally, the pustule becomes desiccated and forms a crust.</p><p>Immunohistochemistry shows no virus in the nonaffected epidermis, but the virus is present in the cytoplasm all keratinocytes within the affected epidermis.

Similar to mpox, it is caused by a poxvirus and is transmitted through direct skin contact or fomites. Molluscum contagiosum infection in the genital region may result from transmission during sexual activity. This infection most commonly presents as single or multiple small, skin-colored papules with central umbilication  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef138524 graphicRef55247 graphicRef68001 graphicRef56699 graphicRef81042 graphicRef59150 graphicRef57836" href="/z/d/graphic/138524.html" rel="external">picture 11A-G</a>).

A case of tanapox infection was diagnosed using electron microscopy and DNA analysis (PCR testing) of a biopsied skin lesion in an American college student who had worked in the Republic of the Congo for eight weeks caring for chimpanzees; none of the others working with these animals developed the infection [<a href="#rid135">135</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Orf and bovine stomatitis (also caused by parapoxviruses) can produce localized skin lesions similar to those of mpox but are difficult to distinguish clinically. It is possible to differentiate between these conditions based on their epidemiological characteristics and previous animal contact history. In research laboratories, they can be differentiated by an experienced microscopist by morphologic features on electron microscopy. Parapoxvirions are slightly smaller than orthopoxvirus virions and have a more regular surface pattern than orthopoxviruses.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

(See <a class="local">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Monkeypox virus is an orthopoxvirus that is in the same genus as variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox) and vaccinia virus (the virus used in the available smallpox vaccines). Distinct strains of monkeypox virus exist in different geographic regions. The strain isolated from West Africa appears to be less virulent than the one from Central Africa. (See <a class="local">'Virology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Geographic distribution</strong> <strong>–</strong> Historically, most cases of mpox have occurred in Central and West Africa. However, since May 2022, there has been a global outbreak of mpox in many nonendemic countries. On July 23, 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Prior to 2022, most cases in nonendemic countries were reported in travelers who were returning from endemic regions. There was also an outbreak of human mpox in the United States in 2003 associated with infected prairie dogs who were exposed to imported animals from Africa. (See <a class="local">'Geographic distribution'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Transmission</strong> – Human-to-human transmission of monkeypox virus can occur through several routes. These include (see <a class="local">'Human-to-human transmission'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Close contact with infectious skin lesions. The current global outbreak in nonendemic countries has been primarily associated with close intimate contact, such as during sexual activity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Indirect contact with infectious fluid (eg, on contaminated linens).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Percutaneous inoculation via needlestick injuries from supplies used to collect cutaneous lesion samples.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Large respiratory droplets. For this to occur, prolonged face-to-face contact may be required (eg, within a six-foot radius for ≥3 hours in the absence of personal protection equipment [PPE]). Activities resulting in resuspension of dried material from lesions (eg, shaking contaminated linens) may also present a risk and should be avoided.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Monkeypox virus can also been acquired through contact with an infected animal's bodily fluids or through a bite. Monkeys and humans are incidental hosts; the reservoir is likely to be certain rodents. (See <a class="local">'Animal-to-human transmission'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical features</strong> – In patients with mpox, the incubation period from time of exposure to clinical illness is usually 5 to 13 days. During the global mpox outbreak in 2022, the incubation period has generally ranged from 7 to 10 days. (See <a class="local">'Incubation period'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients often present with a systemic illness that includes fevers, chills, and myalgias followed by a characteristic rash. The rash typically begins as macules and evolves to papules, vesicles, and then pseudo-pustules. The lesions eventually crust over, and these crusts dry up and then fall off. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation during the 2022 outbreak'</a> above and <a class="local">'Clinic presentation during previous outbreaks'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">During the current outbreak of mpox, some patients have presented with genital, rectal, and/or oral lesions without the initial prodrome  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef138910" href="/z/d/graphic/138910.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Patients have also presented with proctitis, tonsillitis, ocular disease, and/or other complications (eg, encephalomyelitis). (See <a class="local">'Rash'</a> above and <a class="local">'Proctitis/tonsillitis'</a> above and <a class="local">'Ocular manifestations'</a> above and <a class="local">'Other complications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Disease course</strong> – Most patients with mpox have a self-limited illness. In the 2022 global outbreak, rare deaths have been reported. By contrast, in Central Africa, where infection is caused by a different strain (clade 1), the fatality rate has been reported to be as high as 10 percent. (See <a class="local">'Prognosis and risk for severe disease'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation and</strong> <strong>diagnosis</strong> – The diagnosis of mpox should be suspected in patients who present with a rash or other symptoms that could be consistent with mpox <strong>and</strong> have epidemiologic risk factors for infection  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef138741" href="/z/d/graphic/138741.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A diagnosis of monkeypox virus infection can be made through demonstration of orthopoxvirus DNA (eg, by polymerase chain reaction [PCR] testing or next-generation sequencing of a clinical specimen) or through isolation of monkeypox virus in culture from a clinical specimen.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> – When evaluating a patient with suspected mpox, varicella zoster virus (presenting as chickenpox or herpes zoster), herpes simplex, smallpox, and other poxvirus infections should be included in the differential diagnosis.
