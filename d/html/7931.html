It can keep patients alive through volume and oxygen transport replacement while other methods of bleeding source control such as surgery, interventional radiology, endoscopy, uterine packing, or liver replacement are carried out, and then it can replace lost blood volume to facilitate recovery and healing. </p><p>Massive transfusion has been arbitrarily defined as the replacement by transfusion of ≥10 units of whole blood (WB) or red blood cells (RBCs) in 24 hours as an approximation of the replacement of at least one blood volume (see <a class="local">'Definitions and jargon'</a> below). It identifies groups of patients across multiple medical specialties with significant failure of vascular integrity and is also a situation in the transfusion service where the administrative constraints around issuing blood can delay patient care.</p><p>This topic discusses the epidemiology, practical aspects, and complications of massive transfusion, including an overview of the evolving Advanced Trauma Life Support approach to massive transfusion [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7948.html" rel="external">"Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusion in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1615.html" rel="external">"Use of blood products in the critically ill"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1050889758"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS AND JARGON</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Massive transfusion</strong> – Massive transfusion was historically defined as transfusion of ≥10 units of whole blood (WB) or red blood cells (RBCs) in 24 hours. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">This is an arbitrary definition. Patients who receive 9 units are not fundamentally different from those who receive 10, whereas those who receive 10 units over 30 minutes are very different from those who receive the same volume spaced over the course of a day. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Likewise, 10 units of RBCs in a child who weighs 30 pounds, which replaces their blood volume five times, is very different from 10 units of RBCs in an adult who weighs 300 pounds, which may only replace half of their original blood volume. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients who die of uncontrolled hemorrhage before they can receive 10 units of RBCs are missed by this definition, an argument for having massive hemorrhage protocols rather than massive transfusion protocols.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ultra-massive transfusion</strong> – Ultra-massive transfusion has been defined as using ≥20 units of RBCs in 24 or 48 hours [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. It has been used to study the outcomes of patients who use very large amounts of blood resources in a short period of time. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Outcome is highly dependent on the clinical situation, survival being excellent after liver transplantation and very poor after gastrointestinal variceal bleeds. As a result, hyper-massive transfusion is not a useful measure or marker of clinical futility. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The definition has all the same problems as simple massive transfusion, being nonspecific and susceptible to changing patterns of care.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Critical Administration Threshold for 1 hour (CAT-1)</strong> – CAT-1 is an alternative functional definition for acute catastrophic bleeding, in which the administration of ≥3 units of RBCs over one hour identifies patients with substantial immediate blood use [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Extension into subsequent hours of care (CAT-2, CAT-3, and so on) identifies patients whose hemorrhage control is not immediate and whose high-volume blood use is ongoing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Resuscitation Intensity (RI) Score</strong> – The RI score is similar to the CAT but uses ≥4 blood components (any components) in 30 minutes as a starting point and appends a number when more units are used (RI-6 or RI-12 and so on) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The RI score is more sensitive in identifying patients needing rapidly issued or prepositioned blood products for treating shock and preventing rapid hemorrhagic death.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hemorrhage control resuscitation</strong> – Hemorrhage control resuscitation involves giving plasma and platelets early in resuscitation to avoid dilutional coagulopathy that occurred with the historic use of crystalloid fluids for volume resuscitation and RBCs in additive solution to maintain oxygen-carrying capacity [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">First described by in a population of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurisms, it typically involved a massive transfusion protocol (MTP) in which the blood bank issued coolers containing 4 units of RBCs, 4 units of plasma, and a pool of platelets, and with Cryoprecipitate and additional platelets guided by thromboelastography (TEG). The term is widely used in the European literature. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Damage control resuscitation</strong> – Damage control resuscitation is the American military version of hemorrhage control resuscitation, with additional attention to hypothermia, acidosis, and fibrinolysis, as occurs in trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC). Damage control resuscitation is the term typically used in the American trauma literature, either alone or in conjunction with damage control surgery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Historically, damage control resuscitation used RBCs, plasma, and platelets in a 1:1:1 ratio when platelets were available, and fresh whole blood (WB) when they were not available in austere settings in the Southwest Asian military theater [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>1:1:1</strong> – This describes the unit ratios of RBCs to plasma and platelets suggested in early papers for both hemorrhage control and damage control resuscitation. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The order of the components is not standardized. In the title of the Pragmatic Randomized Optimal Plasma and Platelets Ratio (PROPPR) trial paper, the ratios are given as 1:1:1 versus 1:1:2, listing the RBC fraction last. Generally, it would make more sense if the ratios had been given as 1:1:1 versus 1:0.5:0.5, listing the RBC fraction first and showing that relatively fewer units of plasma and platelets had been given in the second arm of the trial.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Another problem with 1:1:1 as a description of blood component ratios is that most platelet units in the United States are obtained by apheresis rather than prepared from WB donations. One apheresis unit is equivalent to five or six WB-derived units. The pooled units available in Canada and Europe have lower numbers of platelets and would have a different equivalency. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Most apheresis units available from the American Red Cross are pathogen-reduced and are associated with a 44 percent reduction in platelet recovery. Platelets in additive solution have had two-thirds of their plasma removed and replaced with a saline-based solution. It may be harder to achieve hemostatic concentrations of platelets and plasma coagulation factors using currently available components than in the past because of these changes. Benefits and limitations are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7929.html" rel="external">"Pathogen inactivation of blood products", section on 'General principles of pathogen inactivation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Coagulopathy</strong> — Coagulopathy is a general term for reduced hemostasis caused by reduced platelet number or function, reduced coagulation factor concentrations or function, other interference with coagulation or platelet function, or accelerated clot breakdown. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Trauma-associated coagulopathy describes a constellation of findings in trauma patients. (See <a class="local">'Trauma-associated coagulopathy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Simple measures of coagulation such as the platelet count and prothrombin time with international normalization ratio (PT/INR) are strong linear predictors of death in trauma across their normal range and the full range of injury severity. Coagulopathy is thus a relative term to be considered in the balance of burden of injury and coagulation capacity. (See <a class="local">'Hemostatic abnormalities'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Appropriate care requires knowing the blood products available at the local facility and how to put them together to achieve therapeutic goals. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1029172"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The need for massive transfusion depends on the patient population. </p><p>In a 2016 review of all 97,000 episodes of transfusion of ≥10 red blood cell (RBC) units in consecutive two-day periods over 25 years in two countries (Sweden, population 10 million, and Denmark, population 5 million), the most common clinical situations leading to massive transfusion were cardiac and vascular surgery accounting for almost 40 percent of all massive transfusions [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p>Other situations leading to massive transfusion, such as gastrointestinal hemorrhage, liver transplant, trauma, and obstetric catastrophes, were less frequent in the 2016 review [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. While trauma and obstetric bleeding are considered classic causes of massive transfusion, they represented only 15 and 2 percent of all such episodes in the Swedish/Danish experience.</p><p>Indications were similar in a study involving 1300 episodes of ultra-massive transfusion of ≥20 units of RBCs in consecutive two-day periods in six hospitals in four countries [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. </p><p>Trauma is the most studied example from among indications for massive transfusion. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a 2021 review of experience in a major trauma center during the years 2011 to 2018 involving 47,471 patients, 18 percent received RBC transfusions, 2 percent received &gt;10 units of RBCs in 24 hours, and 1 percent received &gt;20 units in the first 24 hours [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 2012 multiple trauma center study reported that the fraction of all patients receiving RBC transfusions who received ≥10 units of RBCs has decreased by 40 percent, coinciding with the practice of earlier transfusion of plasma and platelet units [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p>Taken together, these data suggest that most injured patients never need massive transfusion and can be treated based on physical assessment and results of early laboratory tests. However, approximately 6 percent of the most severely injured individuals will require activation of a massive transfusion protocol, 2 percent will receive a massive transfusion, and 1 percent will receive ultra-massive transfusion. Appropriate rapid response has led to reduced blood use.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1483743245"><span class="h1">DATA FOR SPECIFIC PATIENT POPULATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1563597294"><span class="h2">Trauma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Approximately 6 percent of trauma patients appear to be at risk of requiring massive transfusion based on vital signs, physical findings, or mechanism of injury. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Risk of massive hemorrhage is high in the following groups:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adults with systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt;70 mm Hg</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adults with pulse &gt;110 per minute and SBP &lt;90 mm Hg</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Penetrating injury or major fractures</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fluid in body cavities likely to be blood</p><p></p><p>Replacement with plasma, platelets, and red blood cells (RBCs) or whole blood (WB) should be started early. Extrapolation of observational studies carried out in the combat setting has driven significant interest in examining the impact of fixed transfusion ratios of plasma to platelets to RBCs on patient outcomes. </p><p>Results from several observational studies suggested that patients with severe trauma and coagulopathy requiring massive blood replacement were more frequently and successfully resuscitated when the ratio of transfused units of plasma to platelets to RBCs approached 1:1:1 [<a href="#rid6">6,11-18</a>]. In evaluating these studies it is important to remember the problem of survival bias, meaning that patients may have died because they did not receive plasma, or they may not have received plasma because they died [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. This 1:1:1 resuscitation approach is referred to as "damage control resuscitation". (See <a class="local">'Definitions and jargon'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113837.html" rel="external">"Initial management of moderate to severe hemorrhage in the adult trauma patient"</a>.)</p><p>Observational studies were the impetus for a large randomized control trial in 680 trauma patients (the PROPPR [Pragmatic Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios] trial), which evaluated the outcomes of blood resuscitation protocols using a ratio of 1:1:1 (1 unit of RBCs for each unit of plasma and platelets) versus 1:1:2 (2 units of RBCs for each unit of plasma and platelets) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. This was the first large randomized trial in blood-product-based trauma resuscitation ever sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and, in retrospect, it was significantly underpowered.</p><p>The PROPPR trial found no statistically significant difference in 24-hour and 30-day mortality with the 1:1:1 versus the 1:1:2 component ratios [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Planned secondary end-points showed higher rates of anatomic hemostasis and fewer deaths due to exsanguination at 24 hours in participants assigned to the 1:1:1 arm. However, as noted in a separate commentary, death by exsanguination alone was combined with death by exsanguination and other causes, which possibly overstated the impact of benefit of the 1:1:1 approach [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>].</p><p>Although the benefit of a fixed 1:1:1 ratio resuscitation approach in massively bleeding trauma patients lacks the highest level of quality evidence, the approach has been widely adopted clinically and applied to trauma as well as other massive bleeding situations including obstetric, vascular, and liver transplant. Hemostatic resuscitation has been associated with reduced blood use and fewer deaths in these health care settings. However, the reason 1:1:1 therapy was adopted rapidly by the surgical community was that it avoided the major problem of crystalloid resuscitation, with massive tissue edema leading to delayed wound closure and prolonged ventilator requirements, and it directly addressed the problem of coagulopathy. Limiting crystalloid use in turn translates into fewer ventilator days and shorter hospital stays. It has become part of the National Academy of Medicine's "Zero Preventable Trauma Deaths" program [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Component ratio (1:1:1)'</a> below.)</p><p>Additional aspects of transfusion and other interventions for trauma management are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113837.html" rel="external">"Initial management of moderate to severe hemorrhage in the adult trauma patient"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1258021283"><span class="h2">Cardiac surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cardiac surgery is the most common use of massive transfusion. However, even in patients with a substantial burden of surgery-related injury such as those undergoing repeat midline sternotomy and multivessel grafting or valve replacement, in the Red Cell Storage Duration Study (RECESS), only 145 of 1098 participants (13 percent) received ≥8 units of RBCs [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p>In a subset analysis involving 324 cardiac surgery patients who participated in RECESS, those receiving &gt;5 units of RBCs had better outcomes (survival, preservation of organ function) when they received higher ratios of plasma and platelets to RBCs [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Mortality at day 7 was 1.7 percent in those who received at least 5 units of plasma per 5 units of RBCs, versus 7.2 percent in those who received lower ratios of plasma to RBCs (p = 0.0318). </p><p>Based on these improved outcomes with balanced resuscitation, we suggest using the 1:1:1 ratio to treat active bleeding in these individuals, in conjunction with laboratory testing. (See <a class="local">'Laboratory monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Other details of management are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/122792.html" rel="external">"Achieving hemostasis after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1705362235"><span class="h2">Obstetric hemorrhage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pregnancy and the postpartum period are hypercoagulable states with compensatory increased fibrinolysis. When vascular disruption leads to massive bleeding, those with low fibrinogen are at increased risk for bleeding [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Guidelines from the College Nationale Gynecologie et Obstetrics Francais (CNGOF) suggest maintaining the fibrinogen ≥200 mg/dL [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. </p><p>Expert opinion from multiple groups reflects the data for trauma and suggest use of a 1:1:1 ratio for treating massive hemorrhage in obstetric patients.</p><p>Other details of management are presented separately.

This is compounded by reduced hepatic clearance of activation fragments of coagulation factors, which can act as competitive inhibitors of coagulation enzymes [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Anticoagulant factors such as protein S and protein C are also reduced. As a result, laboratory values are difficult to interpret, and the effectiveness of conventional therapies may be reduced. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13932.html" rel="external">"Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with liver disease"</a>.)</p><p>In patients with severe liver disease and active hemorrhage, attempts to normalize platelet number and plasma coagulation factor concentrations are probably helpful, with the caveats that increased blood volume will increase portal pressure, and increasing platelet counts in the face of splenomegaly is difficult. In liver transplant, balanced transfusion ratios may be helpful [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Approach to volume and blood replacement'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients who require massive (or ultra-massive) transfusion (&gt;5 units of RBCs in a day or &gt;3 units in 2 hours), we suggest blood component resuscitation rather than crystalloid (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Crystalloid versus blood products'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For individuals treated with blood component resuscitation, we suggest a ratio of 1:1:1 (plasma to platelets to pRBCs) rather than other ratios (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Component ratio (1:1:1)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hemoglobin &lt;6 g/dL should be avoided (&lt;7 or 8 g/dL in selected individuals). (See <a class="local">'Rationale for target hemoglobin'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring</strong> – Attention must be paid to hemoglobin, platelet count, hemostasis, and metabolic status. This includes complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count after each 5 units, along with coagulation testing. Standard tests of coagulation include the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and fibrinogen concentration; if available and clinicians are familiar with use, a viscoelastic test such as thromboelastography (TEG) (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55087" href="/z/d/graphic/55087.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) can be used instead. Ionized calcium and other metabolic parameters should be monitored and treated systematically. (See <a class="local">'Laboratory monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complications</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Hemostatic</strong> – Plasma (2 to 8 units) is transfused if the PT or aPTT exceed 1.5 times the control value due to dilutional coagulopathy. Platelets (1 apheresis unit or 6 units of WB-derived platelets) are transfused if the platelet count decreases to &lt;50,000/microL. Cryoprecipitate or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9082" href="/z/d/drug information/9082.html" rel="external">fibrinogen concentrate</a> can be used for fibrinogen &lt;100 mg/dL (&lt;200 for obstetric bleeding). (See <a class="local">'Hemostatic abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Metabolic</strong> – Hypocalcemia can be caused by citrate toxicity; symptomatic hypocalcemia is treated with intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9186" href="/z/d/drug information/9186.html" rel="external">calcium chloride</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9190" href="/z/d/drug information/9190.html" rel="external">calcium gluconate</a> (2 to 5 mL of a 10 percent calcium chloride solution per unit of WB or pRBCs plus plasma; maximum 10 mL). Acid-base abnormalities and hyperkalemia should be treated if present.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Hypothermia</strong> – Hypothermia can exacerbate bleeding, cause arrythmias, and lead to other complications. A high-capacity commercial blood warmer should be used to warm blood components toward body temperature when &gt;2 units are transfused. (See <a class="local">'Hypothermia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3888116688"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff gratefully acknowledges the extensive contributions of Arthur J Silvergleid, MD, to earlier versions of this and many other topic reviews.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">British Committee for Standards in Haematology, Stainsby D, MacLennan S, et al.
