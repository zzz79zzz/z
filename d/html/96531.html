Several image-guided bronchoscopy (IGB) techniques are available for the biopsy of PPLs.</p><p>This review discusses the use of IGB techniques in the diagnosis of PPLs. The general management of patients with a solitary pulmonary nodule, the types, indications, contraindications, and procedures associated with conventional flexible bronchoscopy are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6986.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic evaluation of the incidental pulmonary nodule"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4398.html" rel="external">"Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106085.html" rel="external">"Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Associated diagnostic and therapeutic procedures"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4400.html" rel="external">"Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Indications and contraindications"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H108630582"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY OF PERIPHERAL PULMONARY LESIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The incidence of PPLs in the general population is unknown. Lung cancer computed tomographic (CT) screening studies of smokers at high risk for malignancy report a prevalence of nodules as high as 50 percent, with other CT studies in the general population reporting a prevalence of incidental nodules at 31 percent [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7566.html" rel="external">"Screening for lung cancer"</a>.)</p><p>The incidence of PPLs detected by CT will likely increase in the future. There are an estimated 10 to 12 million CT scans of the chest performed per year in the United States and low-dose CT scans are being increasingly performed for lung cancer screening [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. In addition, newer generation CT scanners can detect very small pulmonary lesions not readily visible on older generation CT scanners. Thus, an increasing need for image-guided bronchoscopic (IGB) modalities capable of obtaining tissue safely from such lesions is predicted.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1607935371"><span class="h1">DEFINITION AND ETIOLOGY OF PERIPHERAL PULMONARY LESIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A PPL (also known as peripheral lung lesion [PLL]) is a pulmonary nodule (typically &lt;3 cm) that is located in the lung periphery. It can be solid or subsolid, benign or malignant  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62644" href="/z/d/graphic/62644.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), and in general is traditionally hard to biopsy using conventional flexible bronchoscopy. A more detailed definition and etiology of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6986.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic evaluation of the incidental pulmonary nodule", section on 'Definitions'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6986.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic evaluation of the incidental pulmonary nodule", section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H490524696"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H105545143"><span class="h2">Biopsy of peripheral pulmonary lesion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Image-guided bronchoscopy (IGB) techniques are most commonly used to biopsy PPLs since the diagnostic yield of conventional bronchoscopy is poor for such lesions. This indication is the focus of this topic. (See <a class="local">'Image-guided bronchoscopy techniques'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106085.html" rel="external">"Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Associated diagnostic and therapeutic procedures"</a>.)</p><p>While some of the IGB techniques are capable of providing guidance to central lymph nodes or masses (ie, close to major airways), this is not typically done due to the excellent yield and relative ease of performing convex probe endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration (CP-EBUS-TBNA) for central lesions, the details of which are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4385.html" rel="external">"Endobronchial ultrasound: Technical aspects", section on 'Lymph nodes'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2533292971"><span class="h2">Marking the position of peripheral pulmonary lesion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Therapeutic applications of IGB techniques are uncommon. These include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fiducial marker placement</strong> – IGB techniques can be used to place fiducial markers (ie, a marker that can be imaged) into peripheral pulmonary malignancies so that stereotactic ablative radiotherapy can be delivered in a targeted fashion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tattooing</strong> – Since small PPLs are sometimes hard to identify manually, tattooing a PPL with dye or contrast agent preoperatively with IGB techniques can facilitate visual localization of the PPL in the operating room at the time of surgical resection [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2783754257"><span class="h2">Investigational</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>IGB techniques are also being investigated in malignant pulmonary nodules to deliver therapeutic tools such as cryotherapy, brachytherapy, radiofrequency ablation, and microwave ablation directly at the nodule location.

In addition, their use is limited to centers with skilled expertise. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4400.html" rel="external">"Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Indications and contraindications", section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1212620092"><span class="h2">Specific</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>One relative contraindication unique to IGB is the use of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) and some robotic bronchoscopy (RB) systems in the setting of cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators. The presence of a pacemaker or defibrillator has been considered a relative contraindication to IGB techniques that involve the use of an electromagnetic field due to concerns that pacemaker or defibrillator function could be affected. However, a study of 24 patients with pacemakers and defibrillators who underwent ENB reported that none of the patients suffered any arrhythmia or disruption of pacemaker function and that the procedure was safely completed in all patients [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Additional data in larger series are required to confirm these findings. Although practice among institutions is variable, we typically consult with cardiology subspecialty experts to determine whether settings need to be changed prior to the procedure; following ENB, we also have the pacemaker interrogated to make sure that the device is functioning properly. (See <a class="local">'Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy'</a> below.)</p><p>These techniques do not require contrast such that allergies to contrast are not a contraindication.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3996664650"><span class="h1">IMAGE-GUIDED BRONCHOSCOPY TECHNIQUES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several image-guided bronchoscopy (IGB) techniques are available to assist in the biopsy of PPLs. In general, the use of these techniques is limited to centers with expertise, and they require specific training for their use. The diagnostic yield ranges from 44 to 88 percent, typically varying with lesion size, location, and equipment used as well as other factors including the presence of a bronchus sign and biopsy technique.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H715859800"><span class="h2">Virtual bronchoscopy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Virtual bronchoscopy (VB) is a noninvasive form of bronchoscopy. It is not an endoscopic procedure, but rather an imaging modality that uses non-contrast-enhanced CT images to reconstruct the airways in a three-dimensional manner producing images that appear similar to those visualized during invasive bronchoscopy. While VB itself cannot acquire samples, it can be used to preplan future procedures or as a navigational tool for biopsy (VBN). Further details regarding VB are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4398.html" rel="external">"Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Overview", section on 'Virtual bronchoscopy'</a> and <a class="local">'Virtual bronchoscopic navigation'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1847824648"><span class="h2">Navigation bronchoscopy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Navigation bronchoscopy (NB) uses a navigational system to guide instruments (eg, flexible or ultrathin bronchoscope) through the airways to a target lesion for biopsy. Navigational systems can be virtual (VBN; usually non-contrast-enhanced CT) or electromagnetic (ENB). ENB is the most common IGB technique used to biopsy PPLs.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H64693412"><span class="h3">Virtual bronchoscopic navigation</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H773068636"><span class="h4">Technique</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Virtual bronchoscopic navigation (VBN; also known as virtual navigational bronchoscopy [VNB]) is a technique that utilizes VB CT imaging to guide the bronchoscope to a peripheral target lesion in the lung  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107755" href="/z/d/graphic/107755.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Planning phase</strong> – First, CT scan images are acquired with a specialized CT protocol and transferred to a computer workstation where specific software is used to create a virtual bronchoscopic pathway to the target lesion.

(See <a class="local">'Radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (RP-EBUS)'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4385.html" rel="external">"Endobronchial ultrasound: Technical aspects", section on 'RP-EBUS-guided transbronchial biopsy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Several commercially available systems are available. The accuracy of these systems depends upon the quality of the CT data; thus, thin-slice CT scan data and recent CT data from VB-specific protocols are preferred.</p><p>Among the available systems, none incorporate real-time tracking of instruments during the navigation procedure and therefore do not confirm the location of the operating instrument or visualize the target nodule. Thus, RP-EBUS and fluoroscopy can all be used in conjunction with VBN to increase the chances of biopsying the target PPL. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106085.html" rel="external">"Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Associated diagnostic and therapeutic procedures"</a> and <a class="local">'Ultrathin bronchoscopy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2410718825"><span class="h4">Efficacy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnostic yield from VBN has only been reported from centers with expertise and ranges from 67 to 80 percent:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A pooled analysis of 13 studies reported an overall diagnostic yield of 74 percent for procedures utilizing VBN assistance to biopsy PPLs [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].

The guide and sheath together are placed through the working channel of the flexible bronchoscope and are advanced together in real time based on the computers provided guidance of direction and distance (similar to a global positioning system for vehicles) until the target lesion is reached. The PPL is then biopsied using:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>ENB alone – Once the lesion is reached, the ENB locator guide is removed and the working guide sheath is left in place through which standard biopsy instruments can be passed (eg, brush, transbronchial biopsy [TBBX]) to obtain a sample. TBBX and brushing procedures are the same as those described for routine flexible bronchoscopy (with or without fluoroscopy). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106085.html" rel="external">"Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Associated diagnostic and therapeutic procedures"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">Some studies report that using a catheter aspiration (also known as catheter suctioning) technique is superior to the traditional forceps biopsy of peripheral lung lesions [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].

Thus, when available, some experts combine ENB with RP-EBUS to verify the lesion location which may increase the diagnostic yield for PPL biopsy. The RP-EBUS probe is passed through the working guide sheath, the PPL location is confirmed, the probe removed, and the lesion is biopsied as for routine flexible bronchoscopy (with or without fluoroscopy).

Experience with this system is more limited. This system also incorporates an option for transthoracic needle aspiration or biopsy (TTNA/TTNB) using the same electromagnetic and CT guidance data with a trackable percutaneous needle. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6986.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic evaluation of the incidental pulmonary nodule", section on 'Transthoracic needle biopsy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In some specialized centers, cone-beam CT can also be used similar to RP-EBUS to confirm that the biopsy instruments are within the target PPL.

ENB is endorsed by the American College of Chest Physicians' clinical practice guidelines for evaluation of patients with pulmonary nodules at intermediate risk of malignancy, the details of which are discussed separately [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6986.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic evaluation of the incidental pulmonary nodule", section on 'Nonsurgical biopsy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89115.html" rel="external">"Procedures for tissue biopsy in patients with suspected non-small cell lung cancer", section on 'Enhanced, image-guided bronchoscopic techniques'</a>.)</p><p>Although large randomized trials are lacking, ENB has a similar yield to other IGB techniques, ranging from 44 to 75 percent (average approximately 65 percent) [<a href="#rid3">3,10-19</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Epidemiology of peripheral pulmonary lesions'</a> above and <a class="local">'Definition and etiology of peripheral pulmonary lesions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications and contraindications</strong> – IGB techniques are most commonly used to biopsy PPLs. Their use is limited to centers with skilled expertise. Contraindications are similar to conventional bronchoscopy. (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> above and <a class="local">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Techniques and efficacy</strong> – The diagnostic yield of IGB techniques ranges from 44 to 88 percent, typically varying with lesion size, location, and equipment used as well as other factors including the presence of a bronchus sign and biopsy technique. IGB techniques include the following (see <a class="local">'Image-guided bronchoscopy techniques'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Virtual bronchoscopy (VB)</strong> – VB is a noninvasive form of bronchoscopy that reconstructs the airways in a three-dimensional manner, producing images that appear similar to those visualized during invasive bronchoscopy. VB cannot biopsy lesions per se but can be used to navigate (VBN) conventional bronchoscopes and other biopsy equipment to the target PPLs. (See <a class="local">'Virtual bronchoscopy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Virtual bronchoscopic navigation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB)</strong> – ENB is the most common IGB technique. It incorporates VB imaging with an electromagnetic field, an additional navigational tool, to guide biopsy equipment (eg, forceps, brush, guide sheath) to the target lesion. ENB can be used alone or in combination with radial probe endobronchial ultrasonography (RP-EBUS) to biopsy PPLs. (See <a class="local">'Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Robotic bronchoscopy (RB)</strong> – RB is a rapidly evolving technique that utilizes navigational techniques as well as robotic bronchoscopes that can be driven to peripheral lesions. Standard biopsy instruments are used through the RB to obtain specimens. One system allows for a real-time camera view at the tip of the instrument during biopsy. (See <a class="local">'Robotic bronchoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>RP-EBUS</strong> – RP-EBUS is an adjunctive imaging tool used to visualize the target lesion prior to biopsy. It can be used together with conventional bronchoscopy as well as with navigational tools (virtual or electromagnetic), to facilitate biopsy of PPLs. Neither RP-EBUS nor ENB provide actual real-time biopsy visualization as the ultrasound or navigation probes must be removed in order to pass the biopsy instruments. (See <a class="local">'Radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (RP-EBUS)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Other techniques, including CT bronchoscopy and ultrathin bronchoscopy (UTB) are rarely used and their role remains largely investigational. (See <a class="local">'Other'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Choosing a biopsy modality</strong> – For patients with PPLs in whom nonsurgical biopsy is indicated (eg, PPLs of intermediate risk of malignancy), when expertise is available, IGB techniques are appropriate alternatives to transthoracic needle biopsy, particularly in patients who are at high risk of pneumothorax. Choosing among the options is individualized and depends upon factors including lesion size, location, presence of emphysema, suspected diagnosis, and institutional expertise. (See <a class="local">'Choosing a biopsy modality'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6986.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic evaluation of the incidental pulmonary nodule", section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sedation</strong> – IGB procedures can be performed with moderate sedation. However, deep sedation/general anesthesia is often required, particularly when complex and lengthy procedures are expected. (See <a class="local">'Sedation'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/264.html" rel="external">"Procedural sedation in adults in the emergency department: General considerations, preparation, monitoring, and mitigating complications"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complications</strong> – IGB techniques are generally well tolerated with reported complication rates ranging from 0 to 8 percent. Similar to standard bronchoscopy, the spectrum and rate of complications are procedure related (eg, pneumothorax and bleeding) and/or sedation related (eg, hypotension). (See <a class="local">'Complications'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/105799.html" rel="external">"Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Preparation, procedural technique, and complications", section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Gould MK, Tang T, Liu IL, et al.
