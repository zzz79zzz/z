It can present as an acute, life-threatening emergency or a chronic, subclinical process, depending on the degree and tempo of the process and the contribution of morbidities from the underlying cause. Identifying DIC and the underlying condition responsible for it are critical to proper management.</p><p>This topic discusses DIC in adults. </p><p>Separate topic reviews discuss:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>DIC in children</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5915.html" rel="external">"Disseminated intravascular coagulation in infants and children"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>DIC in pregnancy</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4460.html" rel="external">"Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) during pregnancy: Clinical findings, etiology, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1367.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with a suspected bleeding disorder"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88648.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to suspected TTP, HUS, or other thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H255168"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7833596"><span class="h2">Intravascular coagulation and fibrinolysis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Normal hemostasis ensures formation of a blood clot at the site of vessel injury, followed by resolution of the clot to allow tissue repair. There are multiple feedbacks built into this system to prevent activation of coagulation in the absence of vessel injury and restrict the clot to the site of injury. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1371.html" rel="external">"Overview of hemostasis"</a>.)</p><p>In DIC, the processes of coagulation and fibrinolysis become abnormally (and often massively) activated, leading to ongoing systemic coagulation and fibrinolysis.</p><p>A typical sequence of events includes the following  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98047" href="/d/graphic/98047.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Procoagulant exposure</strong> – Blood is exposed to one or more procoagulants, such as tissue factor (TF), from which it is normally protected. Sources and components of these procoagulants depend on the underlying condition. As examples:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Some bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharides, can activate coagulation [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In meningococcal sepsis, microparticles containing TF are found in the circulation [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>"Cancer procoagulant" generally refers to TF produced by cancer cells. It can also be a proteolytic enzyme produced by some mucinous tumors and placenta that is capable of activating factor X [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1353.html" rel="external">"Cancer-associated hypercoagulable state: Causes and mechanisms", section on 'Procoagulant proteins'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In trauma, damage to the vascular endothelium and tissues may cause release of procoagulant enzymes or phospholipids.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In severe intravascular hemolysis, such as an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR) caused by ABO mismatch, coagulation is activated by a combination of processes including TF release (likely by monocytes), generation of cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 1 (IL-1), and reduced nitric oxide (NO) function [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In patients with inherited or acquired protein C deficiency, an imbalance between thrombin generation and fibrinolysis may be responsible for overwhelming normal mechanisms that protect against inappropriate coagulation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Neutrophils may contribute to the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which have procoagulant properties. (See <a class="local">'Extracellular DNA and NETs'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Coagulation</strong> – Activation of the coagulation cascade leads to the production of thrombi consisting of fibrin and platelets  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90873" href="/d/graphic/90873.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). These can occur in the microvasculature and/or larger vessels. Extensive formation of thrombi in turn leads to consumption of endogenous coagulation factors, producing a "consumption coagulopathy"; and of platelets and anticoagulant factors (eg, protein S, protein C, antithrombin).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fibrinolysis</strong> – Fibrinolysis is activated at sites of thrombus formation, with generation of fibrin degradation products (FDP) that, when present in significant amounts, interfere with both fibrin clot formation and platelet aggregation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1326.html" rel="external">"Thrombotic and hemorrhagic disorders due to abnormal fibrinolysis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Compensatory changes</strong> – DIC is a dynamic process. The acuity and magnitude of ongoing intravascular coagulation determine whether consumption of coagulation factors and platelets can be compensated adequately by ongoing synthesis of coagulation factors and generation of new platelets in the bone marrow. The two ends of the spectrum between inadequate and adequate compensation are sometimes referred to as acute and chronic DIC.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Acute DIC</strong> – Acute (decompensated) DIC can develop when blood is exposed to large amounts of tissue factor (or other procoagulant substances) over a brief period of time, with significant generation of thrombin. This leads to rapid consumption of coagulation factors that outpaces their production. The fibrin degradation products (FDPs) that are generated in turn disrupt normal fibrin polymerization and fibrinogen binding to platelet surface αIIbβ3 (GPIIbIIIa), thus interfering with both fibrin clot formation and platelet aggregation, and effectively operating as pathologic anticoagulant and anti-platelet agents.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The consumption coagulopathy, combined with the high concentration of FDPs, leads to the severe bleeding diathesis seen in decompensated DIC, and accounts for the clinical observation that supportive therapy with Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and platelet transfusions by themselves are generally insufficient to completely correct the bleeding diathesis. Clotting times become prolonged and the potential for clinically important bleeding increases [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Acute DIC is typically seen in settings such as sepsis, trauma, or acute promyelocytic leukemia. (See <a class="local">'Acute DIC'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Chronic DIC</strong> – Chronic (compensated) DIC can develop when blood is continuously or intermittently exposed to smaller amounts of tissue factor (or other procoagulant substances). Coagulation factors and platelets are consumed, but production is able to compensate, and the liver is able to clear the FDPs. Clotting times may be normal, and thrombocytopenia may be mild or absent. Thrombosis generally predominates over bleeding, although many patients are asymptomatic with laboratory-only evidence of increased thrombin generation and fibrinolysis [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Chronic DIC is typically seen in patients with advanced malignancy, especially pancreatic, gastric, ovarian, and brain tumors. (See <a class="local">'Chronic DIC'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1353.html" rel="external">"Cancer-associated hypercoagulable state: Causes and mechanisms"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>End organ damage</strong> – Tissue or organ damage may result from reduced perfusion, thrombosis, and/or bleeding. Often, contributions from DIC itself and the condition that precipitated it are intertwined. Organ failure may result in significant morbidity and mortality. (See <a class="local">'Organ dysfunction'</a> below and <a class="local">'Recovery and prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Other vascular factors that may contribute to the pathogenesis of DIC include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Endothelial damage, which can result in the release of procoagulant substances and the loss of endothelial antithrombotic properties.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduced local blood flow, which slows diffusion of procoagulant and anticoagulant factors away from the site.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduced organ perfusion, which may delay hepatic clearance of coagulation byproducts. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduced levels of nitric oxide, causing increased vascular tone and enhanced platelet aggregation and activation.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Involvement of other blood cells. As an example, monocytes are known to secrete TF when stimulated by pathogens.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In trauma or sepsis, acidosis and hypothermia may interfere with appropriate coagulation because the enzymatic functions of the coagulation factors are pH and temperature-dependent [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2877027455"><span class="h2">Extracellular DNA and NETs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Increasing evidence suggests that damage-associated pattern molecules (DAMPs, also called "alarmins") including cell-free DNA (cfDNA), extracellular histones, and DNA-binding proteins play a critical role in the pathogenesis of DIC [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. DAMPs are released from dying cells or secreted from immune cells in response to infection or tissue injury. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13572.html" rel="external">"An overview of the innate immune system", section on 'Interaction of innate and adaptive immunity'</a>.)</p><p>Elevated levels of circulating extracellular cfDNA, normally found at approximately 1 mcg/mL in healthy people, are found in various pathologic conditions including sepsis, trauma, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. Often there is extensive formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are web-like structures composed of decondensed chromatin coated with a variety of cellular proteins such as myeloperoxidase, neutrophil elastase, histones, and high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) that are released from dead or dying neutrophils [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>NET formation (NETosis) is a complex and incompletely characterized process in which nuclear chromatin becomes decondensed and released into the cytoplasm, followed by rupture of the plasma membrane and expulsion of the cellular contents into the extracellular space. NETosis accompanies a form of lytic cell death distinct from apoptosis and necrosis. Under normal conditions, NETosis appears to be a highly regulated component of innate immunity that is protective against microbial pathogens, but it becomes dysregulated in severe inflammatory conditions. The cfDNA and other nuclear proteins released during NETosis are cytotoxic and play an important role in the pathogenesis of DIC.</p><p>NETosis is highly procoagulant. It activates the clotting cascade and influences primary and secondary hemostasis via a number of mechanisms:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Delivery of tissue factor</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Activation of the contact phase of coagulation by cfDNA</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cytotoxicity of cfDNA, which activates cell surface Toll-like receptor (TLR9)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Induction of platelet aggregation by cfDNA</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Proteolytic degradation of anticoagulants such as tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) via neutrophil elastase</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cytotoxicity to endothelial cells from DNA binding proteins that are normally excluded from the circulation, such as histones and HMGB1</p><p></p><p>NET formation has been shown to play an important role in the development and propagation of pathological venous thrombosis [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. An antibody directed at histone proteins has been shown to reduce sepsis-related mortality in animal models [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>In a 2015 study involving 199 patients with DIC and 20 healthy controls, elevated plasma levels of DNA-histone complexes and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), considered to be in vivo markers of NETosis, correlated with the severity of coagulopathy in DIC and were independent prognostic factors [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1847677094"><span class="h2">ANG-TIE pathway</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pathway </strong>– The angiopoietin-tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and EGF homology domains (ANG-TIE) pathway is involved in lymphatic and blood vessel development during embryogenesis and controls vascular permeability, inflammation, and physiologic and pathologic responses in adult tissues [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Proteins</strong> – Angiopoietins 1 and 2 (ANG1 and ANG2) are ligands that bind to the TIE1 and TIE2 (also called TEK) receptors, a subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases on endothelial cells in this cell signaling pathway. ANG1 is a paracrine ligand expressed by mesenchymal cells and a strong TIE2 agonist that supports endothelial cell survival, vessel stability, and endothelial barrier function, whereas ANG2, expressed by endothelial cells and stored in their Weibel-Palade bodies, acts as a context-dependent weak TIE2 agonist or antagonist and inhibits the ANG1-TIE2 signaling axis. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Role in DIC</strong> – Proteomics analysis on plasma samples from septic patients with DIC showed that the circulating ANG2 level was strongly correlated with traditional DIC markers that indicate sequelae of DIC and more accurately predicted patient mortality than these markers [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. This observation was replicated in a murine endotoxin sepsis model. In that same model, TIE2 activation normalized the prothrombotic responses in the endothelium by inhibiting endothelial tissue factor and phosphatidylserine exposure. Disruption of the ANG-TIE2 axis preceded the development of overt DIC, suggesting that it plays a central role in the pathogenesis of DIC. Targeting the ANG-TIE2 pathway may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of sepsis-associated DIC [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13563746"><span class="h2">DIC versus other TMAs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>DIC is associated with microvascular thrombi that contain fibrin as well as platelets.</p><p>In contrast, some of the other thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs), such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and complement-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), are characterized by platelet-rich microthrombi without significant fibrin clot formation or consumption coagulopathy. Thus, other TMAs generally present with thrombocytopenia and normal coagulation studies.</p><p>In some cases, other TMAs are caused by clearly defined endothelial defects:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>TTP is caused by deficiency of the ADAMTS13 protease, which results in accumulation of very long "ultra-large" von Willebrand factor multimers on the endothelial surface that are capable of binding platelets.

Schistocytes are formed as red blood cells (RBCs) pass through fibrin strands and microthrombi and become mechanically sheared  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81610" href="/d/graphic/81610.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>).
