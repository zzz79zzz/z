Familial CRC is a result of interactions among genetic and lifestyle factors; the amount of increased risk varies widely depending on specifics of the family history [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. For a small proportion of people, genetic predisposition is the dominant risk factor. For most people, lifestyle factors (eg, diet, exercise, smoking, and obesity) are stronger risk factors [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p>This topic review describes assessment of the degree of CRC risk using information obtained from the family history, and CRC screening approaches based on the level of risk due to family history.</p><p>Strategies for screening of average-risk patients, tests available for screening, other CRC risk factors, CRC prevention strategies, and molecular genetics of CRC are described in detail separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7565.html" rel="external">"Screening for colorectal cancer: Strategies in patients at average risk"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7576.html" rel="external">"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2606.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and risk factors for colorectal cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2485.html" rel="external">"Molecular genetics of colorectal cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph utd-adt-cnt utd-adt-pathwys">●</span><span class="utd-adt-cnt utd-adt-pathwys utd-content-120417">(Related Pathway(s):  <a class="utd-content-120417" href="/pathway/120417?topicRef=7572&amp;source=see_link">Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening: Asymptomatic patients with no history of colon polyps</a>.)</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph utd-adt-cnt utd-adt-pathwys">●</span><span class="utd-adt-cnt utd-adt-pathwys utd-content-120416">(Related Pathway(s):  <a class="utd-content-120416" href="/pathway/120416?topicRef=7572&amp;source=see_link">Colon polyps: Surveillance after colon polyp resection</a>.)</span></p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H119741995"><span class="h1">ASSESSING RISK DUE TO FAMILY HISTORY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A family history of colorectal cancer (CRC) is common. Among the general population, 5 to 10 percent of United States adults aged 20 to 79 years report having a first-degree relative (FDR), defined as a close blood relative (ie, parent, full sibling, or child) with CRC [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Some countries have higher rates, with a study from the Netherlands finding that 11.7 percent of adults aged 30 to 70 years reported at least one FDR with CRC [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>Each component of the family history (eg, recognized familial genetic syndromes, the number of FDRs with CRC and their ages at diagnosis, and the family history of documented advanced adenomas or serrated lesions) helps to determine whether the patient’s risk of CRC is increased and the magnitude of the impact of the family history on the individual’s risk of developing CRC.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2749532068"><span class="h2">Familial colorectal cancer history (non-syndromic)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The family history should include the number of FDRs with CRC and their ages at diagnosis. Just knowing that there is some family history, without determining age of onset, degree of relatedness, and number of affected family members, is not a strong predictor of who will develop CRC.</p><p>For most people, if a family member had CRC, it was a “nonsyndromic familial” (also called “familial”) CRC, rather than a high-risk genetically heritable familial cancer syndrome. Risk for familial CRC is highest if there are multiple FDRs with CRC or an FDR who developed CRC at age &lt;50 years [<a href="#rid6">6-10</a>]. The increase in lifetime risk with familial CRC ranges from about two- to sixfold. Estimates of these risks are shown in a figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59834" href="/d/graphic/59834.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Among patients who have CRC, 25 percent have a family history that placed them at increased risk [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>A study of screening colonoscopy among people aged 45 to 75 years found that 11 percent of people with an FDR with CRC had advanced neoplasia, compared with 6 percent of those without an FDR with CRC (odds ratio [OR] 2.41; [95% CI 1.69-3.43]) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Other studies have found similar results and also found that risk is somewhat higher if the index case was female or had distal CRC [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In another study, risk for CRC is greater for relatives of patients with colon, rather than rectal, cancer [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>Although CRC occurring only in distant relatives has been associated with an increased risk of CRC in family members, the magnitude of the increase in risk (relative risk [RR] 1.82, 95% CI 1.47-2.25) is not large enough to warrant more screening than is recommended for the general population [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>].</p><p>Although direct evidence from prospective studies is not available, we believe that for people who have one or more FDRs with CRC at any age, colonoscopy-based CRC screening should start at age 40 years or 10 years before the earliest diagnosis of CRC in the family and be done every five years [<a href="#rid9">9,14,15</a>]. For individuals not willing to undergo colonoscopy, FIT or MT-DNA stool test may be a reasonable substitute [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H280079841"><span class="h2">Family polyp history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Having an FDR with an adenomatous colon polyp increases the patient’s risk for adenoma and for CRC [<a href="#rid17">17-22</a>]. Several studies suggest that a family history of an advanced adenoma increases risk of CRC, regardless of the age at diagnosis of the relative. In a population-based study of 126,936 patients who underwent colonoscopy, an elevated risk of CRC was found in FDRs (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.25-1.46), second-degree relatives (SDRs; RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.07-1.23) of adenoma cases, and FDRs of advanced adenoma cases (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.29-2.18) compared with controls [<a href="#rid20">20,23</a>]. There is no evidence that a family history of non-advanced adenoma significantly increases risk to the patient [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>].</p><p>A systematic review found that having an FDR with an adenoma was associated with CRC (RR 1.99 [95% CI 1.55-2.55]) compared with having no family history of adenoma [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. However, the magnitude of risk due to a family polyp history may have been overestimated because of increased efforts to look for cancer in families who already have a history of colorectal neoplasia.</p><p>The US Multi-Society Task Force (MSTF) on Colorectal Cancer recommends that, if there is documentation that an FDR had an advanced adenoma (adenoma ≥1 cm, or with high-grade dysplasia, or with villous elements) or polyp requiring surgical excision, this should be weighted the same as having an FDR with CRC when suggesting screening programs [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. The yield of screening colonoscopy in patients with FDRs who had advanced adenomas is substantially increased. However, the MSTF no longer recommends that patients undergo intensified colon screening without clear documentation that an FDR’s polyp was advanced; in the absence of documentation that an FDR’s polyp was advanced, it should be assumed it was not advanced. In our experience, patients often do not know what type of polyp their relative had, which is consistent with the finding that individuals often do not know what type of polyp they had in the past [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p>MSTF recommends that if an FDR had a documented advanced serrated lesion (SSP ≥10 mm, SSP with cytologic dysplasia, or traditional serrated adenoma ≥10 mm), screening should be similar to that of a patient whose FDR had documented advanced adenoma, although there is no clear evidence as to how to proceed unless the FDR meets criteria for serrated polyposis [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2594.html" rel="external">"Overview of colon polyps", section on 'Sessile serrated polyps and traditional serrated adenomas'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2594.html" rel="external">"Overview of colon polyps", section on 'Serrated polyposis syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H613408537"><span class="h2">High-risk familial colorectal cancer syndromes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A small proportion of people with a family history of CRC have one of the high-risk genetically heritable familial cancer syndromes that substantially increase the risk of CRC. Some of these syndromes increase the risk of other cancers too. A pattern suggesting the possibility of a high-risk genetically heritable familial cancer syndrome (eg, Lynch syndrome [hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)] or familial adenomatous polyposis [FAP]) may become apparent when obtaining a family history. Patients may recognize the name of an inherited syndrome, if asked.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lynch syndrome-related cancers often occur at an early age (commonly in the 30s and 40s, with median onset at age 61 years in mutation-positive relatives)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58291" href="/d/graphic/58291.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. Lynch syndrome is characterized by a strong family history (eg, multiple family members, across generations, developing CRC and other cancers at an early age). However, CRC patients without obvious family histories can still have the syndrome and carry a pathogenic variant in a Lynch syndrome gene [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">With Lynch syndrome, polyps have an increased tendency to develop into CRC and an increased rate of progression to CRC. Although polyps do not occur more frequently, they can occur at an early age [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Lynch syndrome is caused by autosomal dominant, highly penetrant genetic mutations. Genetic testing for Lynch syndrome is warranted if an FDR has been diagnosed with Lynch syndrome. However, a patient may have an FDR with Lynch syndrome and not know it. Although genetic testing for Lynch syndrome is widely recommended for patients diagnosed with CRC, this testing is not universally performed [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]; additionally, the patient may be unaware of an FDR’s diagnosis. Additional indications for testing for Lynch syndrome are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2605.html" rel="external">"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Indications for germline testing'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Lynch syndrome and related cancers are described in detail separately.

Hundreds to thousands of polyps occur throughout the colon, beginning as early as adolescence  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59413" href="/d/graphic/59413.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). FAP is caused by autosomal dominant, highly penetrant genetic mutations. There is also an attenuated form of FAP that presents with fewer polyps and a later age of onset than seen in the classical form.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">FAP is described in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2593.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Another hereditary syndrome that increases CRC risk is <em>MUTYH</em>-associated polyposis (MAP). Individuals with MAP have multiple colorectal adenomas and estimated lifetime CRC risk of 70 to 75 percent. Approximately 60 percent of patients with MAP have CRC at presentation. MAP is an autosomal recessive polyposis syndrome. Among patients with CRC, &lt;1 percent are homozygous for MAP. Heterozygotes (1 to 2 percent of the general population) have only marginally increased CRC risk of 5 to 7 percent. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/86140.html" rel="external">"<i>MUTYH</i>-associated polyposis"</a>.)</p><p>Additional high-risk hereditary syndromes that increase CRC risk (eg, juvenile polyposis syndrome [JPS], Cowden syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, attenuated FAP [AFAP], Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, serrated (hyperplastic) polyposis syndrome, and others detected by cancer gene panels) are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15805.html" rel="external">"Juvenile polyposis syndrome"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16543.html" rel="external">"PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes, including Cowden syndrome"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14255.html" rel="external">"Li-Fraumeni syndrome"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2592.html" rel="external">"Familial adenomatous polyposis: Screening and management of patients and families", section on 'AFAP'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2533.html" rel="external">"Peutz-Jeghers syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2594.html" rel="external">"Overview of colon polyps", section on 'Serrated polyposis syndrome'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/17039.html" rel="external">"Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications", section on 'Cancer screening and management'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H559984707"><span class="h2">When to assess family history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Assessment of family history of CRC or colon polyps among FDRs should begin at the initial visit. Although there are no studies addressing frequency of reassessment, some clinicians reassess every three to five years as long as the patient is eligible for continued screening based on their age and any comorbidities.</p><p>We assess family history before age 40 years to identify patients who warrant screening earlier than the usual starting age for average-risk patients, and those who also warrant genetic testing.</p><p>Family history evolves over time; thus, assessment of family history should be repeated periodically. Family members may develop cancers that affect the suggested frequency of screening for the patient. For example, a study using a United States population-based cancer registry found that at age 30 years, 2.1 percent of participants met criteria for more aggressive screening based upon a family history of CRC, whereas at age 50 years, 7.1 percent met the criteria for high-risk screening [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Screening approach'</a> below.)</p><p>Obtaining a family history of CRC to guide screening may be cost-effective, with a cost per year of life gained similar to that of other widely accepted technologies [<a href="#rid34">34,35</a>]. However, family history is often not elicited or incorporated into patient care. In a survey of patients aged 35 to 55 years, 39 percent reported that they had not been asked about family history, 46 percent with a strong family history did not know they should be screened at an earlier age, and 55 percent with a strong family history had not received appropriate screening [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H82732953"><span class="h2">Limitations of narrative histories and prediction tools</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The patient's age, family size (which, if small, can mask recognition of a genetic mutation as the cause of cancer in a family), as well as the possibility of uncertain paternity, should be taken into account when interpreting a narrative history or results from a prediction tool.</p><p>Studies show that a patient's report of family history may be inaccurate. In a population-based study in Connecticut, people were asked about CRC family history among FDRs and SDRs, and a sample of the responses was confirmed using registries, Medicare databases, medical records, and death records. The sensitivity of patient report about their relatives was 27.3 percent, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 53.5 percent overall (86 percent for FDRs and 44 percent for SDRs) [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. In another study, comparing patient self-reports of their own polyp history with medical record data, the positive predictive value for self-reported polyp was 80.9 percent and the negative predictive value was 85.8 percent [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].</p><p>Prediction tools are not commonly used to assess the impact of family history on CRC risk.

We suggest colonoscopy every five years. If the patient declines colonoscopy, annual fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) or MT-DNA testing at least every three years should be offered.</p><p></p><p>If the <strong>only</strong> family history is an FDR with a polyp <strong>NOT clearly documented</strong> as an advanced adenoma or serrated lesion, we suggest that the patient be screened as an average-risk patient, because of the potential inaccuracy of the family history. This is in contrast to patients whose FDR has a <strong>documented</strong> history of an advanced adenoma or serrated lesion, who should be screened similarly to those with a family history of CRC, as indicated above. (See <a class="local">'Family polyp history'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3532825723"><span class="h2">Age to begin screening</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We initiate screening at age 40 years or 10 years before youngest FDR’s diagnosis (or in the case of an advanced polyp, at the age of diagnosis of the advanced polyp if that is earlier), as part of enhanced screening recommendations. (See <a class="local">'Indications for enhanced screening'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients with a family history, the rationale for beginning screening at age 40 years or 10 years before the age of diagnosis of the youngest FDR is that CRCs in such patients may occur early in life, not uncommonly in the 40s or even the 30s  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57102" href="/d/graphic/57102.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. The patient’s risk at age 40 years is therefore generally comparable to an average-risk person's risk at age 50 years, which is the usual age at which average-risk people begin screening. Relative risk is greatest in the 30s and 40s and decreases as a person ages  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104863" href="/d/graphic/104863.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>) [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. Beginning to screen 10 years before the age the cancer was diagnosed in the affected relative takes into account the additional risk related to early-onset CRC in the family member.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2393833323"><span class="h2">How often to screen</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We screen with colonoscopy every five years. We note that in the case of an additional personal history of advanced polyps without high-risk endoscopic features for invasive cancer, the 2023 NCCN guidelines recommend repeating screening in three years, and then, if the subsequent colonoscopy is negative, in five years [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. For people with a history of nonadvanced polyps, we screen every five years. For patients with no personal history of colon polyps, due to lack of evidence supporting a specific screening interval and based on expert opinion, we screen every five years [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].</p><p>There is evidence that colonoscopy for screening should be repeated at five-year intervals in people with a family history of CRC. In the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, colonoscopy screening reduced CRC risk for only five years for those with an FDR with CRC [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. For individuals with an FDR with CRC, CRC risk was reduced within five years of colonoscopy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.44 [95% CI, 0.30-0.66]); however, CRC risk returned essentially to baseline beyond five years (HR 0.91 [95% CI, 0.55-1.52]), whereas for average-risk individuals with a negative family history, there was no difference in CRC risk less than or more than five years after colonoscopy (HR 0.42 [95% CI, 0.35-0.51] and 0.43 [95% CI, 0.32-0.58], respectively). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7576.html" rel="external">"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer", section on 'Colonoscopy'</a>.)</p><p>If the patient declines colonoscopy, FIT or MT-DNA test is used for screening. We recommend that for FIT it is performed annually and every three years for MT-DNA testing. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7576.html" rel="external">"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer", section on 'Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for blood'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3387122727"><span class="h2">Choosing a screening test</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Colonoscopy is the preferred test for patients at higher risk, as defined above (see <a class="local">'Indications for enhanced screening'</a> above). Among screening tests, colonoscopy has the highest sensitivity for CRC and for adenomas  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116366" href="/d/graphic/116366.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>). If the patient refuses colonoscopy, FIT testing or MT-DNA stool testing may be attractive alternatives because they are noninvasive. FIT is considered by the US Multi-Society Task Force (MSTF) to be a “tier 1” test for CRC screening, is the suggested alternative and is performed annually [<a href="#rid26">26,43,44</a>]. Specifics of tests for screening for CRC are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7576.html" rel="external">"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer", section on 'Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for blood'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7576.html" rel="external">"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer", section on 'Colonoscopy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7565.html" rel="external">"Screening for colorectal cancer: Strategies in patients at average risk", section on 'Choosing a screening test'</a>.)</p><p>Colonoscopy has better sensitivity than FIT stool testing for advanced adenomas and, in some studies, for CRC as well [<a href="#rid16">16,45</a>]. In a meta-analysis, one-time FIT sensitivity for CRC was 79 percent and, for advanced adenoma, 30 percent [<a href="#rid26">26,43,44</a>]. In one study, in which the threshold for a "positive" FIT in a quantitative assay was set intentionally low (≥10 micrograms hemoglobin/gram of feces), annual FIT for three years detected all CRC but only 61 percent of advanced adenomas in FDRs of patients with CRC [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. However, in another study, 572 asymptomatic individuals with a positive family history for CRC, but without a suspected or known familial polyposis syndrome or Lynch syndrome, underwent screening by both one colonoscopy and one FIT [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. Endoscopists were blinded as to FIT results. FIT was found to have low sensitivity (adenoma 9.5% [95% CI, 5.7-15.3], advanced neoplasm 35.1% [95% CI, 20.7-52.6], and CRC 25.0% [95% CI, 1.3-78.1]). Among patients who were FIT-negative, colonoscopy detected 24 advanced neoplasms (4.7 percent of individuals who were FIT-negative) and three CRCs (0.6 percent of individuals who were FIT-negative).</p><p>Patients who refuse to undergo colonoscopy should be encouraged to undergo CRC screening with another screening test. For such patients, FIT or MT-sDNA stool test may be attractive alternatives because they are noninvasive [<a href="#rid26">26,43,44</a>]. However, maintaining the screening schedule can be a challenge because FIT should be repeated annually. A positive FIT or MT-sDNA stool test requires timely follow-up with colonoscopy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7576.html" rel="external">"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer", section on 'Advantages and disadvantages'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2477096616"><span class="h2">When to stop screening</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although there is no direct evidence to guide when to end CRC screening among people with a family history, the MIcrosimulation SCreening Analysis (MISCAN)-Colorectal Cancer Model suggested that CRC screening should end at age 79 among persons with one FDR diagnosed after age 50, and end at age 85 for persons with two or more FDRs diagnosed before age 40 [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], unless the patient has a life expectancy less than 10 years. The US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer suggests that discontinuation of screening can be considered when patients who are up to date with screening and have had negative screening tests, particularly colonoscopy, reach age 75 years [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Continuing to screen until age 80 or 85 years is reasonable because the absolute risk of CRC attributable to family history increases with age, since the risk is cumulative [<a href="#rid8">8,41</a>]. For example, the risk of a 70-year-old developing CRC in the next 10 years is about 9 percent if that person has at least two FDRs with CRC, compared with 3 percent in the general population [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3107530000"><span class="h1">HIGH-RISK SYNDROME SCREENING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Enhanced colon cancer screening and consideration of genetic testing are warranted for patients with a personal or family history of certain high-risk genetic syndromes.</p><p>Cancer screening strategies, genetic testing, and colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention for each of the following syndromes are discussed in detail separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer [HNPCC])</strong> (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2605.html" rel="external">"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15804.html" rel="external">"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Cancer screening and management"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)</strong>  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59413" href="/d/graphic/59413.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2592.html" rel="external">"Familial adenomatous polyposis: Screening and management of patients and families"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong><em>MUTYH</em></strong><strong>-associated polyposis (MAP)</strong> (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/86140.html" rel="external">"<i>MUTYH</i>-associated polyposis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS)</strong> (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15805.html" rel="external">"Juvenile polyposis syndrome"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cowden syndrome</strong> (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16543.html" rel="external">"PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes, including Cowden syndrome"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Li-Fraumeni syndrome</strong> (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14255.html" rel="external">"Li-Fraumeni syndrome"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Attenuated FAP (AFAP)</strong> (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2592.html" rel="external">"Familial adenomatous polyposis: Screening and management of patients and families"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Peutz-Jeghers syndrome</strong> (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2533.html" rel="external">"Peutz-Jeghers syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Serrated (hyperplastic) polyposis syndrome</strong> (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/86140.html" rel="external">"<i>MUTYH</i>-associated polyposis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1417830776"><span class="h1">RISK FACTOR MODIFICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is prudent to make a special effort to modify behavioral risk factors in people already at increased risk due to family history of colorectal cancer (CRC).
