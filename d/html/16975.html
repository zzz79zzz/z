For most children, atherosclerotic vascular changes are minor and can be minimized or even prevented with adherence to a healthy lifestyle. However, in some children, the atherosclerotic process is accelerated because of the presence of identifiable risk factors (eg, obesity and hypertension) and/or specific diseases that are associated with premature ASCVD (eg, familial hypercholesterolemia and diabetes mellitus)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109927" href="/z/d/graphic/109927.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>Primary prevention measures to minimize the risk of developing atherosclerosis in childhood will be reviewed here. In addition, the primary care assessment to identify the child at risk for premature atherosclerosis and, by extension, ASCVD will also be discussed. Risk factors for early atherosclerosis in childhood and the management of the child at risk for atherosclerosis are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5781.html" rel="external">"Overview of risk factors for development of atherosclerosis and early cardiovascular disease in childhood"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5753.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of the child or adolescent at risk for atherosclerosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1258227"><span class="h1">CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH PROMOTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The two primary goals of cardiovascular health promotion in children are [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To prevent the development of risk factors associated with atherosclerosis (primordial prevention) with measures that focus on adherence to a healthy lifestyle</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To identify and manage children and adolescents at risk for early atherosclerosis based on the presence of established risk factors including obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5781.html" rel="external">"Overview of risk factors for development of atherosclerosis and early cardiovascular disease in childhood", section on 'Traditional ASCVD risk factors'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1258262"><span class="h1">PROMOTING A HEART-HEALTHY LIFESTYLE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H777386236"><span class="h2">Overview</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors should be addressed in the pediatric primary care office by promoting a healthy lifestyle for the individual child and on a population level through advocacy (eg, promoting tobacco smoke and nicotine avoidance, improving school lunch, encouraging smaller portion sizes, and increasing public awareness on healthy dietary choices). The rationale for these approaches is that an adult population with a lower burden of atherosclerosis, as a result of pediatric preventive care, will have a lower burden of CVD [<a href="#rid1">1,3,4</a>].</p><p>Pediatric routine health care supervision should promote and reinforce positive health behaviors, focusing on the following areas to reduce the risk of developing atherosclerosis [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Heart-healthy diet</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Physical activity</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Healthy sleep habits</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoiding tobacco and nicotine exposure</p><p></p><p>The construct of ideal cardiovascular health, well developed in the adult literature, has been adapted for children and adolescents and includes tobacco exposure, weight status (body mass index [BMI] (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13415.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a> and <a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13412.html" rel="external">calculator 2</a>)), physical activity, nutrition (healthy diet score), cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, and blood pressure [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Ideal cardiovascular health in childhood and young adulthood has been associated with a lower prevalence of ASCVD risk factors in adulthood in several large longitudinal pediatric and young adult cohorts [<a href="#rid5">5-8</a>]. Increasing numbers of ideal cardiovascular health measures in youth were associated with a reduced risk of hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and dyslipidemia (ie, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and decreased carotid artery and aortic intima-media thickness (IMT) in early adulthood [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1258283"><span class="h2">Heart-healthy diet</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Good nutrition, beginning at birth, has profound health benefits, including a potential to decrease the risk of ASCVD by preventing or ameliorating obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance/diabetes mellitus. Several United States health organizations (the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Heart Association, American Dietetic Association, and United States Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services) have issued dietary guidelines for children and adolescents that are generally consistent with one another. These are summarized in the table (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79084" href="/z/d/graphic/79084.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) and are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2866.html" rel="external">"Dietary recommendations for toddlers and preschool and school-age children", section on 'General guidance'</a>.)</p><p>Important aspects of a heart-healthy diet for infants, children, and adolescents include the following [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Breastfeeding</strong> – Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months after birth and continued breastfeeding to at least 12 months of age is strongly supported by many governmental and medical professional organizations. Breastfeeding is linked to a decrease in the prevalence of future obesity and dyslipidemia, two important CVD risk factors. These issues and other benefits of breastfeeding are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5013.html" rel="external">"Infant benefits of breastfeeding", section on 'Limited evidence for benefit'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fat intake</strong> – A specific limit for total fat intake to reduce ASCVD risk has not been established. Rather, we emphasize that fat intake should be primarily plant-based and consist of monosaturated and polyunsaturated fat. In the absence of a medical indication, fat intake should not be restricted during infancy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Monosaturated and polyunsaturated fat – The majority of fat intake should be composed of a combination of monosaturated and polyunsaturated fat  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80214" href="/z/d/graphic/80214.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Saturated fat – We suggest limiting saturated fat to 7 to 10 percent of total calories and dietary cholesterol to &lt;300 mg/day  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80214" href="/z/d/graphic/80214.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Support for this recommendation is based on the Special Turku Coronary Risk Factor Intervention Project for Children (STRIP) trial that demonstrated modest improvements in fasting lipid profiles in infants whose parents received counseling regarding a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet compared with those whose parents did not receive any dietary counseling [<a href="#rid7">7,9-12</a>]. At 14 and 19 years of age, the group that received repeated dietary counseling for a low-saturated fat diet had lower saturated fat intakes and serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol than the control group [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. As noted above, the intervention group was more likely to have ideal cardiovascular health metrics as compared with the control group, which correlated with a decreased aortic IMT and improved elasticity [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Importantly, there was no difference in neurodevelopmental outcomes, which effectively addressed an initial concern that a low-fat diet may adversely affect neurodevelopment. This diet primarily relied on fruit and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat and nonfat dairy products, beans, fish, and lean meat [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Trans fats – Trans fats should be eliminated from the diet.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Protein and carbohydrate intake</strong> – Approximately 15 to 20 percent of caloric intake should be derived from protein and 50 to 55 percent from carbohydrates, primarily in the form of whole grains.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other dietary measures</strong> – Other heart-healthy dietary advice for pediatric patients includes:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Encourage the intake of dietary fiber in the form of naturally fiber-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, as supported by longitudinal data following children into adolescence and young adults into middle adulthood [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Reduce the intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and foods – In infants between 6 and 12 months of age, only 100 percent juice should be allowed and the intake should not exceed 4 ounces per day.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In children ≥1 year old, if cow's milk is introduced, decisions regarding the milk's fat content should be based upon the child's growth, appetite, BMI, ASCVD risk factors, and intake of other sources of fat- and calorie-dense foods. The medical provider may decide that low-fat dairy is appropriate as early as 12 months. By two years of age, saturated fat should be limited to 8 to 10 percent of the daily caloric intake and milk should be provided as 1 percent fat or skim.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A daily minimum intake of vitamin D supplementation (600 international units/day) is recommended for all children. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14590.html" rel="external">"Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in children and adolescents", section on 'Recommended vitamin D intake'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>For families with children with identified ASCVD risk factors, ongoing nutritional counseling by a registered dietician can help children adopt and sustain a diet that provides adequate nutrition and reduces ASCVD risk. A behavioral approach that engages the child and family has been shown to be the most effective method for achieving dietary change [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Dietary counseling should be tailored to each child and family based on diet patterns, social setting, and patient sensitivities, such as lactose intolerance and food allergy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5129625"><span class="h2">Physical activity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Routine physical activity should be encouraged throughout childhood. Regular physical activity is associated with decreased risk of atherosclerosis and ASCVD. However, the optimal type and level of physical activity are uncertain.</p><p>Based on the available data, we suggest the following age-based approach  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75748" href="/z/d/graphic/75748.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1,18</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>All children &gt;5 years of age should participate in moderate to vigorous activity for at least 60 minutes per day. The activity should be vigorous on at least three days of the week. Examples of moderate activity are brisk walking, hiking, and games that mostly involve throwing and catching (eg, baseball, softball, catch); examples of vigorous activity are running, biking, jumping rope, dancing, martial arts, and games involving running or chasing (eg, tag, soccer, basketball, flag football).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For infants and preschool-aged children, parents should allow for unlimited active playtime in a safe and supportive environment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Limit leisure screen time to less than two hours per day in children. In children under two years of age, screen viewing should be entirely discouraged [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p></p><p>Evidence supporting these recommendations come from studies in adults demonstrating that daily vigorous activity decreases the risk of ASCVD and type 2 diabetes mellitus, reduces blood pressure, and improves fasting lipid profiles. These data are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1510.html" rel="external">"Exercise and fitness in the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease"</a>.)</p><p>Although data of similar quality are limited in children, there are several reports demonstrating beneficial effects of physical activity on reducing the risk of atherosclerosis in children and adolescents.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the STRIP study, lower amounts of physical activity among adolescents (as determined by questionnaire) correlated with more subclinical atherosclerosis (ie, increased mean aortic IMT and decreased endothelial function as measured by flow-mediated dilation) [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]. Sedentary adolescents who increased their level of physical activity decreased the progression of IMT compared with adolescents who remained sedentary. In persistently active adolescents, the progression of IMT was attenuated compared with those who became sedentary. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5781.html" rel="external">"Overview of risk factors for development of atherosclerosis and early cardiovascular disease in childhood", section on 'Evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In another report from the STRIP study, sedentary adolescents were at an increased risk for clustered metabolic risk factors compared with more physically active peers [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Physical activity was based on self-report, and the cluster risk factors were BMI, lipid profile, and blood pressure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a report from the longitudinal Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns study that recruited children from ages 3 to 18 years, low physical activity was associated with accelerated IMT progression over 27 years of follow-up [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Data from the International Children's Accelerometry Database demonstrated that increasing time for moderate to vigorous activity was associated with better cardiometabolic risk factors regardless of the amount of sedentary time [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Higher mean time spent in moderate to vigorous activity correlated with reductions in mean waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, fasting insulin, and fasting triglycerides and increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the Dietary Intervention Study in Childhood, higher self-reported levels of physical activity were associated with lower systolic blood pressure [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Several small studies have shown that exercise programs that improve physical fitness resulted in a reduction of CVD risk factors including lowering BMI, blood pressure, and arterial stiffness and improving lipid profiles [<a href="#rid26">26-29</a>].</p><p></p><p>In addition, there is evidence that physical activity patterns established in childhood continue into adulthood [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Other benefits of physical activity in children are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6474.html" rel="external">"Physical activity and strength training in children and adolescents: An overview", section on 'Physical activity'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2888742954"><span class="h2">Healthy sleep habits</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In adults, abnormal sleep duration (both too little and too much) and sleep disordered breathing (eg, obstructive sleep apnea) have been linked to increased risk of ASCVD. These associations are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7715.html" rel="external">"Insufficient sleep: Definition, epidemiology, and adverse outcomes", section on 'Cardiovascular morbidity'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7705.html" rel="external">"Obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease in adults"</a>.) </p><p>There are fewer data establishing a link between sleep problems in childhood and risk of premature ASCVD. Nevertheless, we emphasize the importance of establishing healthy sleep habits  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52760 graphicRef120097" href="/z/d/graphic/52760.html" rel="external">table 5A-B</a>), including appropriate duration of sleep  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106597" href="/z/d/graphic/106597.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), as part of a heart-healthy lifestyle. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6357.html" rel="external">"Assessment of sleep disorders in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1262290"><span class="h2">Avoid tobacco and nicotine exposure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pediatric health care clinicians should provide ongoing counseling on the benefits of a tobacco-free environment for the child and family.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6375.html" rel="external">"Secondhand smoke exposure: Effects in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14583.html" rel="external">"Prevention of smoking and vaping initiation in children and adolescents"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16634.html" rel="external">"Overview of smoking cessation management in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1517.html" rel="external">"Cardiovascular effects of nicotine"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1256953"><span class="h1">IDENTIFYING CHILDREN AT RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1262598"><span class="h2">Rationale</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Screening is a routine part of pediatric care and aims to identify conditions that, if untreated, increase risk of disease sequelae and for which there is an available cost-effective intervention. When deciding whether screening should be performed, the test's sensitivity and specificity, prevalence of the screened condition, cost of the screening test, and potential benefits and harms of screening and intervention must be considered. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2872.html" rel="external">"Screening tests in children and adolescents", section on 'Overview'</a>.)</p><p>Data are not available regarding whether and how to best assess individual risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in pediatric practice. Because ASCVD occurs decades after childhood exposures and early atherosclerosis is generally asymptomatic, it is generally not feasible to conduct randomized controlled trials to assess the effectiveness of different pediatric screening practices. Thus, the United States Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient data to recommend for or against screening children for lipid or blood pressure abnormalities [<a href="#rid30">30-34</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16972.html" rel="external">"Dyslipidemia in children and adolescents: Definition, screening, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>By contrast, there are multiple large prospective population-based studies involving adults that assessed individual risk for cardiovascular events and are used to guide risk reduction strategies in adult patients (eg, Framingham or Reynolds Risk Score). This approach directly links risk factors to cardiovascular events and is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1546.html" rel="external">"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention in adults: Our approach"</a>.)</p><p>Despite the paucity of evidence from randomized controlled trials in children, pediatric risk factors for accelerated atherosclerosis (and, by extension, ASCVD) have been identified through direct evidence from autopsy studies and indirect evidence using methods that detect vascular changes that have been associated with increased risk of CVD in adults  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109927" href="/z/d/graphic/109927.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).
