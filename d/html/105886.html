         Gout, also known as monosodium urate crystal deposition disease, is a type of crystalline arthropathy that can cause recurrent episodes of inflammatory arthritis. In patients with gout, an excess of urate can cause monosodium urate crystals to precipitate in joints or other tissues where they elicit an inflammatory response. Thus, therapy for patients with chronic gout aims to reduce serum urate concentration to a level where crystals are less likely to form. While pharmacotherapy is required to achieve this for most patients, nonpharmacologic treatment strategies can also play an important adjunctive role in lowering serum urate concentration for people with gout.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will review the role of nonpharmacologic strategies for the prevention and treatment of gout, including treatment of comorbid conditions, consideration of medications that affect urate balance, optimization of dietary composition, and patient education. Other aspects of the diagnosis and management of gout are reviewed separately:

         Symptoms of gout are driven by monosodium urate crystal deposition in tissues and subsequent inflammation. Maintaining the serum urate at a level below the threshold where crystals form can reduce the risk of gout flares and even help dissolve preexisting tophi.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lowering serum urate can be achieved using both pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy as well as nonpharmacologic strategies. Most patients with gout require urate-lowering pharmacotherapy as the primary approach to treatment. This is because most of the factors that contribute to elevated serum urate levels, including various causes of increased urate production  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80891" href="/z/d/graphic/80891.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ) and decreased urate excretion  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66799" href="/z/d/graphic/66799.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ), are not modifiable. As an example, the main driver of serum urate level is renal urate underexcretion related to genetic variants [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. However, there is also a role for nonpharmacologic strategies, which focus on reducing serum urate by addressing modifiable risk factors  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef98500" href="/z/d/graphic/98500.html" rel="external">
          table 3

          Treatment of comorbid conditions
         </strong>
         – Some comorbid conditions are associated with an increased risk of gout (eg, obesity). Treating them may reduce the risk of developing gout and of subsequent gout flares. (See

          Addressing medications that affect urate balance

         – Certain medications affect serum urate, including

          aspirin

         and certain types of diuretics, and can sometimes be modified to reduce the risk of gout flares. (See

         <strong>
          Modifying diet

         – Many modifiable aspects of diet can affect serum urate, such as intake of purines and alcohol. (See

         <strong>
          Exercise

         – Participating in an exercise program that is appropriate for a patient's age and physical status can help improve overall health and achieve or maintain an optimal weight.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Certain nonpharmacologic strategies that address modifiable risk factors, such as dietary changes, are sometimes called "lifestyle modification." However, some strategies may be outside of a patient's control and may require a multidisciplinary team of providers (eg, subspecialist management of comorbidities, nutrition and social work for education about and access to healthy food choices).
        </p>
        <p>
         Nonpharmacologic treatment strategies are only one component of a comprehensive gout management program. Pharmacologic therapy is important for treatment of acute flares as well as prevention of future flares by lowering serum urate. Sometimes prophylactic therapy is required to reduce the risk of gout flares while starting urate-lowering therapy. These issues are discussed separately. (See

         <strong>
          Patients with gout
         </strong>
         – Nonpharmacologic treatment strategies are rarely sufficient to control serum urate in patients with gout. However, they may be the primary focus for patients who do not have a current indication to start urate-lowering pharmacotherapy or patients who cannot tolerate pharmacologic therapy. Additionally, they are an important adjunct for patients who are on urate-lowering therapy.

          Patients at risk of developing gout

         – Nonpharmacologic treatment strategies may reduce the risk of developing gout for patients who have asymptomatic hyperuricemia or who have other significant risk factors for the development of gout (eg, strong family history). More information on the evaluation and management of asymptomatic hyperuricemia can be found elsewhere. (See

         The optimal timing to start nonpharmacologic therapies may vary based on the type of treatment strategy and the complexity of the clinical situation. Certain nonpharmacologic treatment strategies, such as optimizing use of medications that contribute to hyperuricemia, are relatively quick to change and can easily be addressed in the immediate period following the diagnosis of gout. Other strategies, such as weight loss for comorbid obesity or dietary changes, require a significant investment of time and resources for both the provider and the patient. It may not be feasible to focus on these components when a patient has been newly diagnosed with gout. Instead, it may be preferable to wait until an "intercritical period" between gout flares.

         It is important to discuss nonpharmacologic interventions in a sensitive and nonjudgmental way, as was informally recommended by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) gout management guideline panel [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Patients with gout may feel guilty or judged by others, which can lead to suboptimal care by making patients hesitant to report symptoms and/or participate in care [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>

         </span>
         In patients with overweight or obesity, we provide counseling about how weight reduction may decrease their risk of developing gout and reduce urate levels, thereby decreasing risk of flares and tophi. Specifically, we discuss the goal of gradual weight loss (at a rate of three to five pounds per month) towards ideal body weight (
         <a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13489.html" rel="external">
          calculator 1

         ). The specific weight reduction strategies depend on the patient and their other comorbidities but typically include dietary changes and increased exercise. An overview of the management of obesity is provided separately. (See

        <p>
         Increased adiposity and weight gain are risk factors for incident gout [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16
         </a>
         ]. A large, long-term, prospective cohort study of males without gout at baseline showed that the risk of incident gout was higher among males with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         or greater, and the magnitude of the association became larger with increasing BMI [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Males who had gained 13.6 kg or more had a twofold increased risk of incident gout compared with men who maintained their weight.
        </p>
        <p>
         Data from observational studies have shown that weight reduction towards ideal body weight is associated with a reduced risk of incident gout and possibly an improvement in the symptoms of established gout [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,17-22
         </a>
         ]. In the large cohort study of males without gout cited above, males who had a weight loss of greater than 4.5 kg had a reduced risk of incident gout compared with those who maintained their weight [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Weight loss for patients with gout with overweight or obesity may also reduce the risk of flares. A systematic review of longitudinal studies found low-quality evidence that weight loss reduced the serum urate level and risk of gout attacks among patients with gout with overweight or obesity [

         When starting antihypertensive therapy for a patient who has gout or who is at high risk of developing gout, it may be reasonable to use medications known to decrease the serum urate level (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9574" href="/z/d/drug information/9574.html" rel="external">
          losartan

          hydrochlorothiazide
         </a>
         ). For patients with gout who are already taking an antihypertensive medication that is associated with hyperuricemia, various approaches may be reasonable depending on the clinical context. These include potentially decreasing or stopping the antihypertensive medication that increases serum urate or substituting or adding an alternative antihypertensive therapy that reduces serum urate. As an example, the increase in serum urate caused by low doses of hydrochlorothiazide is relatively small  (

         There are several limitations to consider when advising patients about the potential impact of dietary changes on the risk of gout or gout flares. Diet plays a limited role overall in reducing serum urate levels and therefore should be just one component of a comprehensive plan to manage gout. This may be a contrast to common public perceptions of gout, which often portray gout as the result of poor dietary choices. In addition, evidence to support most dietary changes is limited, since most studies are observational and randomized controlled trials are rare. It is inherently challenging to study the impact of a specific dietary component, as the effect may be modified by the source, preparation, and overall context of the food (eg, the role of raw plant-based protein as part of a vegetarian diet).

         For patients who have established gout or are at risk of developing gout, we suggest reducing dietary purine intake, especially purines derived from animal sources (eg, red meat). Reduction of dietary purine intake is supported by the ACR recommendations for gout management [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. We additionally counsel patients about ways to ensure they obtain adequate daily protein when they reduce purine intake, since some common high-purine foods are also rich in proteins (eg, red meat, seafood). In patients with gout have a serum urate at or below their goal level on stable urate-lowering therapy, purine rich foods may not trigger flares or promote disease progression.
        </p>
        <p>
         Purines are aromatic, nitrogen-containing, heterocyclic molecules and include adenine and guanine. Purine metabolism produces urate. Certain foods have higher concentrations of purines, including red meat, organ meats, certain kinds of seafood (eg, sardines, shellfish), and certain vegetables (eg, green peas, spinach, asparagus), though the purine content in vegetables is much lower than in animal sources.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is an increased risk of gout among patients with higher intake of purine-rich foods, including proteins that contain high levels of purines. Protein intake itself is not associated with an increased risk of gout [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51

         In a prospective cohort study of 633 patients with gout that compared the level of purine intake in the two days preceding a gout flare, the risk of gout flare was increased almost fivefold for patients who scored in the highest quintile of purine intake compared with those in the lowest quintile (odds ratio [OR] 4.76) [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52

As an example, in a prospective observational study of 47,150 male health professionals without gout, patients in the highest quintile of meat consumption had an increased risk of incident gout compared with those in the lowest quintile (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.41, 95% CI 1.07-1.86) [

         In people with hyperuricemia, purine-restricted diets can modestly reduce serum urate levels. Prior to the availability of urate-lowering pharmacotherapy, severely purine-restricted diets were used to treat gout and could reduce daily urinary urate excretion by 200 to 400 mg/day. However, mean serum urate concentrations decrease only approximately 1 mg/dL (59 micromol/L) [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ]. Diets that severely restrict purines may be unpalatable and impractical to implement and are therefore usually reserved for patients who have limited therapeutic options (eg, patients who do not tolerate pharmacotherapy).
        </p>
        <p>
         Reducing purine intake may have a limited role in patients who have achieved goal serum urate through other means. A small trial randomly assigned patients with gout to a control intervention or an educational intervention that focused on reducing purine intake [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>

         For patients with established gout or who are at risk for developing gout, we suggest limiting alcohol intake. If patients with gout have a serum urate at or below their goal level on stable urate-lowering therapy, small amounts of alcohol may be unlikely to trigger flares or promote disease progression for most patients. If patients report unhealthy or risky use of alcohol beverages, we counsel the patient about the risks of alcohol intake to their health and refer them for professional assistance. (See

        <p>
         Alcohol intake can increase the risk of developing gout. As an example, a large, prospective cohort study of health professional males without gout found an increased risk of incident gout among those consuming beer or hard liquor compared with those not consuming alcohol (relative risk [RR] per 12 ounce serving of beer per day 1.49, 95% CI 1.32-1.70, and RR per drink or shot per day 1.15, 95% CI 1.04-1.28) [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ]. The risk of incident gout was not different for those consuming moderate amounts of wine (two or more four-ounce glasses); this may be because of confounding since wine consumption is often associated with healthy lifestyle behaviors.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with gout, drinking alcohol increases the risk of flare compared with abstaining from alcohol [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58,59
         </a>
         ]. In a case-crossover study of people with gout, all forms of alcohol (beer, liquor, and wine) were associated with an increased risk of flare within 24 hours when compared with no alcohol consumption [

          59

The relationship between alcohol intake and gout flare was dose-dependent: when compared with people who did not drink within 24 hours, those reporting more than one to two drinks had an OR of gout flare of 1.36 (95% CI 1.00-1.88), while those reporting more than two to four drinks had an OR of 1.51 (1.09-2.09). People who reported alcohol use together with high purine consumption and/or diuretic use also had a higher risk of flares. By contrast, the risk was attenuated for people who drank alcohol while taking

         Intake of high-fructose corn syrup and sugar-sweetened beverages can increase serum urate and the risk of incident gout. We counsel patients about reducing the intake of such foods. This is consistent with recommendations from multiple medical organizations, including the ACR and the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR, formerly known as the European League Against Rheumatism) [

         Intake of simple sugars like fructose can increase serum urate. A study that gave patients 1 g of fructose per kg of body weight found that the serum urate level increased by 1 to 2 mg/dL after two hours [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61
         </a>

         <a href="#rid62">
          62
         </a>
         ] and reduced renal urate excretion. There is also a genetic variant in the renal urate/glucose/fructose transporter (
         <em>
          SLC2A9
         </em>
         ) that favors a hyperuricemic response to sucrose intake among individuals with gout [
         <a href="#rid63">
          63

         ]. Elevated BMI may mediate the relationship between intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and serum urate; urate excretion was reduced after a fructose load in patients who had a high BMI compared with those who had a normal BMI [

         – Evidence from the DASH trials have suggested that the diet can lower serum urate levels and the risk of incident gout; however, it has not been studied extensively in patients with gout. The original trial compared the DASH diet with a control diet in prehypertensive or stage 1 hypertensive persons without gout. A small ancillary analysis noted that the DASH diet led to lower serum urate levels when compared with the control diet; the effect was more pronounced in eight patients with high baseline urate (≥7 mg/dL) (mean reduction of 1.3 mg/dL, 95% CI -2.5 to -0.08) [

In addition, several cross-sectional studies in people without gout have shown that dairy product intake is associated with lower serum urate levels [

          53,74,75

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         For patients with established gout, there is no strong evidence to suggest that intake of low-fat dairy products reduces gout flares. In a trial in which patients with recurrent gout flares (ie, ≥2 flares in the preceding four months) were randomly assigned to one of three dietary supplements (control supplement with lactose, standard skim milk powder [SMP, equivalent increase of two servings of low-fat dairy per day], or enriched SMP containing "anti-inflammatory" milk fractions) for three months, there was no significant difference in the change in gout flares between standard SMP supplementation and the lactose control [

Limited evidence suggests that n-3 PUFA may reduce the risk of gout flares.

A small pilot feasibility trial in which adults with gout were randomly assigned to take omega-3 fatty acids or placebo (olive oil capsules) while initiating urate-lowering therapy did not demonstrate a difference in flares over 28 weeks; this could be because the study was not powered to detect a difference in flares [

          Treatment of comorbid conditions
         </strong>
         – Certain comorbid conditions (eg, obesity, chronic kidney disease) increase the risk of developing gout and may contribute to the risk of subsequent gout flares and disease severity in patients with gout. Treating such conditions may mitigate these risks. (See

         In patients with overweight or obesity, we provide counseling about how weight reduction may decrease their risk of developing gout and reduce urate levels, thereby decreasing risk of flares and tophi. Specifically, we discuss the goal of gradual weight loss (at a rate of three to five pounds per month) towards ideal body weight (

         – When starting antihypertensive therapy for a patient who has gout or who is at high risk of developing gout, it may be reasonable to use medications known to decrease the serum urate level (eg,

When patients require low-dose aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prevention, we continue aspirin and adjust urate-lowering therapy as needed. We also counsel patients to take aspirin daily as prescribed to avoid fluctuations in serum urate that may trigger gout flares. (See

         <strong>
          Modifying diet
         </strong>
         – Foods that can increase serum urate or the risk of gout flares generally should be minimized (or even avoided when possible) for patients who have or are at high risk for developing gout. In addition, adopting certain dietary practices, such as healthy whole-diet approaches, may be beneficial in reducing the risk of gout or gout flares. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Overview of dietary modification'

         <strong>
          Reduce purine intake
         </strong>
         – For patients who have established gout or are at risk of developing gout, we suggest reducing dietary purine intake (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ), especially purines derived from animal sources. We additionally counsel patients about ways to ensure they obtain adequate daily protein when they reduce purine intake, since some common high-purine foods are also rich in proteins (eg, red meat, seafood). In patients with gout have a serum urate at or below their goal level on stable urate-lowering therapy, purine-rich foods may not trigger flares or promote disease progression. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Reduce purine intake'

         <strong>
          Limit alcohol intake
         </strong>
         – For patients with established gout or who are at risk for developing gout, we suggest limiting intake of all forms of alcoholic beverages (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). In patients with gout have a serum urate at or below their goal level on stable urate-lowering therapy, small amounts of alcohol may be unlikely to trigger flares or promote disease progression for most patients. (See

          Reduce intake of high-fructose corn syrup and sugar-sweetened beverages
         </strong>
         – Intake of high-fructose corn syrup and sugar-sweetened beverages can increase serum urate and the risk of incident gout and other diseases. We counsel patients about reducing the intake of such foods. (See
