          Anatomy
         </strong>
         – Understanding the anatomy of the eye is clinically useful in triaging the severity of the injury and in communicating the nature of the injury to sub-specialists. Eye anatomy is discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/104455.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Injury classification
         </strong>
         – Ocular injuries are classified as open globe, closed globe, and periocular (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/104455.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of eye injuries in the emergency department", section on 'Injury classification'
         </a>
         ). Frequently, ocular and periocular injuries occur together. Any periocular injury should raise concern for a coexisting ocular injury.

         </span>
         The initial approach to eye injury must first address life-threatening injuries prior to assessing periocular and ocular damage. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6572.html" rel="external">
          "Approach to the initially stable child with blunt or penetrating injury"

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Once life-threatening injuries are addressed, the clinician should identify threats to vision using an organized approach  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104435" href="/z/d/graphic/104435.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Rapid recognition and treatment of chemical eye exposure, orbital compartment syndrome (OCS), open-globe injury, or traumatic hyphema increase the chance that vision can be preserved. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Manage vision-threatening injury'

         <strong>
          Timing and location
         </strong>
         – The timing and location (eg, home, street, or work) of injury are also important factors. Patients who present soon after injury have a lower risk of infection and are most likely to benefit from specific interventions. The physical setting may risk-stratify patients. As an example, motor vehicle accidents are concerning for airbag trauma and glass foreign bodies, whereas injuries during gardening may involve organic matter.

         <strong>
          Contact lenses
         </strong>
         – It is important to determine if the patient was wearing contact lenses at the time of injury. Visual acuity can be checked with the contact lenses in place, but the remainder of the exam should be conducted after removal of the contact lenses as they will stain intensely with

         <strong>
          Past ocular history
         </strong>
         – Pre-injury vision status is important for predicting the likelihood of visual recovery. Past intraocular surgery such as cataract, glaucoma procedures, and retinal surgery may increase the risk of open-globe injury through wound dehiscence [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. If the injury occurs in the good eye of a monocular patient, extra vigilance is warranted.

         OCS is a clinical diagnosis with signs that include eye pain, swelling, proptosis, "rock hard" eyelids, a relative afferent pupil defect, and (when feasible to obtain) decreased visual acuity. OCS is a true ophthalmologic emergency that requires lateral canthotomy and inferior cantholysis to decompress the orbit [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ]. If the patient does not have findings to suggest an open-globe injury, measure intraocular pressure to establish a baseline. Even though authors cite a pressure ≥40 mmHg as an indication for lateral canthotomy, evidence supporting this strict cutoff does not exist, and the pressure needs to be interpreted in the context of how the eye is functioning [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. If at any pressure ≥30 mmHg the eye can see no better than hand motion or light perception or has an rAPD, then the eye is at risk for permanent damage. On the other hand, if the eye is functioning well, it may be able to tolerate a pressure of 40 to 50 mmHg for several hours. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Open globe'

         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8

          Complications
         </strong>
         – In most instances, the potential benefit of canthotomy and cantholysis for patients with OCS outweighs the risk of complications. Lateral cantholysis may cause drooping of the lower eyelid with ectropion. This can be cosmetically repaired by a surgeon with oculoplastic expertise once the OCS has been fully managed [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Patients should be watched carefully for infection and abscess formation. Fibrosis related to infection or poor healing can limit extraocular movement.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The physician should avoid directing of the scissors superiorly during canthotomy because injury to the lacrimal artery and gland or the levator aponeurosis with ptosis may result if the incision is performed in the wrong direction [

Excellent visual acuity does not preclude the possibility of an open globe.

         Decreased visual acuity (20/40 [6/12] or worse) in patients with prior normal vision or, for patients with abnormal vision, a decrease of more than one line on the Snellen visual chart from baseline indicates a serious loss of vision.

         Eyelids that are taut ("rock hard") and difficult to open in combination with proptosis or decreased retropulsion (loss of the normal ability to push the globe deeper into the orbit) indicate the presence of OCS. This condition is a true emergency that requires emergency lateral canthotomy and cantholysis to preserve vision. (See

         In patients with upper eyelid lacerations, the clinician should assess eyelid excursion (the difference in lid position between upgaze and downgaze).

         Based upon studies in animals, topical anesthetics can be toxic to the epithelium and delay healing, which may increase the risk of corneal infection and scarring when used repeatedly. Thus, the eye examination is best performed without topical anesthesia, when the patient can tolerate it. However, in children, topical anesthesia is frequently needed for cooperation. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90922.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For the patient who is too uncomfortable to cooperate with examination, a quick penlight examination to confirm that there is no evidence of penetrating trauma should be performed, and then one drop of topical anesthetic (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9824" href="/z/d/drug information/9824.html" rel="external">
          proparacaine

          tetracaine
         </a>
         0.5 percent ophthalmic solution) may be instilled to facilitate the measurement of visual acuity and the subsequent examination. The patient will obtain drastic relief within 10 seconds of the instillation; the topical anesthetic may be repeated every 10 to 20 minutes up to two times to facilitate eye examination. After that, the clinician should provide alternative forms of analgesia. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90922.html" rel="external">
          "Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Management", section on 'Pain control'

        <p>
         In young children, the extent of ocular injury often cannot be assessed by the emergency clinician due to poor cooperation. In these cases, an examination by an ophthalmologist should be performed. Examination under anesthesia in the operating room may be necessary.

          Conjunctival foreign bodies

         – Conjunctival foreign bodies typically cause a foreign body sensation and tearing. If the conjunctival foreign body is embedded under the upper lid, it may cause corneal abrasions with associated pain (especially on blinking and eye movement) and photophobia  (

         ). It can also arise in patients with post-traumatic cavernous sinus thrombosis or carotid-cavernous fistula. Because the venous system of the eye and orbit drain into the cavernous sinus, elevated pressure within this structure leads to ocular and orbital congestion. In patients with this condition, the ocular surface vessels appear tortuous (termed "corkscrew") and dilated with concomitant chemosis (edema of the conjunctiva)  (

          Anterior chamber
         </strong>
         – The clinician should inspect the anterior chamber for a hyphema, which appears as a layering of red blood cells that may be grossly apparent with a penlight, especially with the patient in a sitting position  (

         In the absence of an extensive hyphema, the examiner can also make a quick assessment of anterior chamber depth by shining a penlight at eye level from the lateral aspect (temporal or lateral canthus). In the normal patient, the iris is flat and will be fully illuminated. In patients with a shallow anterior chamber, which can be a sign of an anterior open-globe injury, the iris will be only partially illuminated with a shadow cast nasally. In the case of a posterior rupture, the anterior chamber may appear very deep.

         Traumatic iritis may accompany a traumatic hyphema. Inflammation of the iris causes pain, photophobia, alteration in pupillary sphincter response to light, and perilimbal conjunctival injection. White blood cells and flare may be seen on slit lamp examination of the anterior chamber. (See

         When visualization cannot be obtained, evaluating the red reflex can be helpful for ruling out serious posterior segment pathology.

         Prior to measuring the intraocular pressure, the clinician must be certain that globe is not open because any undue pressure risks extrusion of intraocular contents.

         The role of bedside ultrasonography for patients with eye injuries is evolving. When performed by properly trained and experienced emergency physicians, bedside ultrasonography of the globe and orbit in adults may provide rapid detection of serious eye injuries. However, ocular ultrasound should not be performed in cases of known open-globe injury. In a single-center, prospective, observational study of 232 patients (351 eyes) with suspected traumatic eye injury, bedside ultrasound by an emergency physician had high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of lens dislocation, retrobulbar hematoma, and vitreous hemorrhage when either CT or beside ocular examination by an ophthalmologist was used as the gold standard [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Unrecognized open globe and retinal detachment were also detected. In addition, bedside ultrasonography may be useful in cases of suspected intraocular foreign bodies [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. If performed, the ultrasound operator must be careful to avoid excess pressure on the eye, which could extrude intraocular contents in patients with an unrecognized open-globe injury. Furthermore, when serious eye injury is discovered, bedside ultrasound findings should be confirmed by CT and bedside eye examination by an ophthalmologist.

          Injury classification
         </strong>
         – Ocular injuries are classified as open globe (full break of the eye wall), closed globe (no full-thickness break in the eye wall), and periocular. Frequently, ocular and periocular injuries occur together. Any periocular injury should raise concern for a coexisting ocular injury. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Basic Principles'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Initial stabilization and organized approach
         </strong>
         – The emergency clinician must first manage life-threatening injuries prior to assessing periocular and ocular damage. Once life-threatening injuries are addressed, the clinician should use an organized approach to identify time-sensitive threats to vision  (

          Emergency eye assessment
         </strong>
         – This initially consists of a focused history, measurement of visual acuity, and a penlight examination to evaluate for the presence of a relative afferent pupillary defect. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Emergency assessment'

         In a patient with a high likelihood of an open globe based upon mechanism of injury (eg, penetrating eye injury) or physical findings, the clinician should
