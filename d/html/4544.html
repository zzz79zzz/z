         Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with characteristic recurrent acquired chromosomal abnormalities. Many reflect reciprocal chromosomal translocations, which generate a fusion gene that encodes a chimeric protein that contributes to the pathophysiology of AML. Other cytogenetic abnormalities involve partial or complete loss or gain of a chromosome. Cytogenetic findings are important for the diagnosis and classification of AML, and some are associated with distinctive clinicopathologic features, have prognostic significance, and/or influence the choice of therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will review cytogenetic abnormalities in AML and their association with particular clinicopathologic features.

         <strong>
          Chromosomal banding
         </strong>
         – Chromosomal banding refers to analysis of the karyotype using a chromosomal banding technique, in which Giemsa stain is used to produce a pattern of alternating light and dark segments (so-called, G-banding) that is unique to each pair of chromosomes  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef130075" href="/z/d/graphic/130075.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). Chromosomal banding is able to detect changes that affect relatively large regions of chromosomes, such as translocations, deletions, and aneuploidy.

         <strong>
          Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
         </strong>
         – FISH uses fluorescently-labeled DNA sequences that hybridize to complementary sequences of specific chromosomes and are visualized by fluorescence microscopy  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef130076" href="/z/d/graphic/130076.html" rel="external">
          picture 2

         ). FISH is a more sensitive technique than chromosomal banding, but it only detects findings that correspond to the chromosomal sequences of the probe.

         <strong>
          Translocation (t)
         </strong>
         – Chromosomal translocation (t) is the process by which genetic material is exchanged between at least two different chromosomes. Reciprocal translocation refers to an exchange in
         <strong>
         </strong>
         which there is no obvious overall loss of chromosomal material. Rearranged chromosomes are identified in part by which chromosome has retained its centromere (the so-called derivative [der] chromosome). Standard nomenclature is to include the translocation in one set of parentheses and the breakpoints in a second set of parentheses. As an example, t(8;21)(q22;q22.1) describes a balanced translocation between chromosomes 8 and 21 that generates the
         <em>
          RUNX1::RUNX1T1
         </em>
         fusion gene.

         <strong>
          Deletion (del)
         </strong>
         – Chromosomal deletion (del) describes loss of chromosomal material. An interstitial deletion results from two breaks in a single chromosome, with the loss of intervening material. An example is del(5q), in which a variable portion (often the segment between bands q14 and q33) of the long arm of chromosome 5 is lost.

         <strong>
          Inversion (inv)
         </strong>
         – Chromosomal inversion (inv) requires two breaks in the same chromosome with rotation of the intervening material. An example is inv(16)(p13.1q22), wherein the
         <em>
          MYH11

         and
         <em>

         Using standard banding techniques, 50 to 60 percent of patients with de novo AML have abnormal karyotypes [

          Pathogenesis
         </strong>
         – Many cytogenetic abnormalities (and their corresponding genetic changes) contribute to the pathogenesis of AML. Typically, chromosomal abnormalities associated with AML are
         <strong>
          recurrent
         </strong>
         (ie, non-random),
         <strong>
          acquired
         </strong>
         (ie, not inherited), and
         <strong>
          characteristic
         </strong>
         (not associated with non-myeloid malignancies).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Most of these karyotypic abnormalities reflect one of the following mechanisms:

         <strong>
          Rearrangements
         </strong>
         – Most cytogenetic changes in AML reflect a balanced reciprocal chromosomal rearrangement, in which an exchange of genetic material creates a fusion gene; the resultant chimeric protein is required, but is not sufficient, to cause leukemia. In most cases, the rearrangement involves two distinct chromosomes, such as t(8;21) or t(15;17); others are caused by an inversion of a single chromosome, such as inv(16) or inv(3).

         <strong>
          Deletions
         </strong>
         – In some cases, karyotypic abnormalities reflect loss of a large amount of chromosomal material, such as del(5q) or del(7q). In such cases, the chromosomal deletion contributes to leukemogenesis through loss of one or more tumor suppressor genes or other critical regulators of growth, differentiation, or cell death.

         Some cases of AML do not display karyotypic abnormalities; instead, they are associated with chromosomal alterations below the threshold for detection by conventional cytogenetic techniques (ie, so-called submicroscopic abnormalities) and/or gene mutations. These findings are detectable by next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels or other molecular techniques. Mutations that contribute to the pathogenesis of AML are discussed separately. (See

         – Chromosomal gains and losses are seen in most types of AML, but certain abnormalities are more common with specific disorders. Any chromosome can be affected, but some chromosomes are more likely to be affected by a gain or loss. In a study of 354 patients with AML, the most common abnormalities were a gain of chromosome 8 (trisomy 8, 13 percent), and loss of chromosome 7 (9 percent); gain of chromosome 7 was rarely seen. Abnormalities of chromosome 7 are particularly characteristic of therapy-related AML associated with alkylating agents and/or radiation therapy [

         – Complex karyotypes (≥3 numerical or structural chromosomal abnormalities) are frequently observed in AML with multilineage dysplasia or AML evolving from myelodysplastic syndromes/neoplasms (MDS) or myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), particularly in older patients. Deletion of chromosome 5, loss or deletion of chromosome 7, and loss of a whole chromosome 17 or 17p has a stronger negative impact on prognosis than other patterns of complex karyotypes in AML.

          Description
         </strong>
         – Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with characteristic chromosomal abnormalities. Many of these abnormalities reflect reciprocal chromosomal translocations that generate a fusion gene, whereas others involve gain or loss of portions of chromosomes or entire chromosomes.
        </p>

         <strong>
          Prevalence
         </strong>
         – More than half of cases of de novo AML have an abnormal karyotype when using standard banding techniques. The frequency of specific findings is presented above. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Significance
         </strong>
         – Cytogenetic abnormalities associated with AML are generally
         <strong>
         </strong>
         recurrent (ie, non-random),
         <strong>
         </strong>
         acquired (ie, not inherited), and
         <strong>
         </strong>
         characteristic (not associated with non-myeloid malignancies). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Significance of abnormalities'

         <strong>
          Diagnosis and classification
         </strong>
         – Cytogenetic analysis is an essential aspect of diagnosis and classification of AML according to contemporary classification schemes: the World Health Organization
         <sup>
         </sup>
         5th edition (WHO5) system and the International Consensus Classification of Myeloid Neoplasms and Acute Leukemias (ICC). Certain chromosomal rearrangements, such as t(8;21), t(16;16), or t(15;17) are sufficient to diagnose AML, independent of the blast count in bone marrow or blood.

         <strong>
          Treatment, prognosis, and pathophysiology
         </strong>
         – Cytogenetic and molecular findings are also important for selection of therapy, prognosis, and understanding the pathobiology of AML.

          Recurrent translocations
         </strong>
         – Reciprocal translocations that generate fusion proteins are commonly associated with specific categories of AML. The clinical, prognostic, pathologic, cytogenetic, and molecular features of the most common recurrent translocations are described above. (See

          Chromosomal gain or loss
         </strong>
         – Gain or loss of specific chromosomes and/or complex karyotypes (ie, ≥3 numerical or structural chromosomal abnormalities) are common. Chromosomal gains and losses are seen in most subtypes of AML. Any chromosome can be affected, but some chromosomes are more likely to be affected by a gain (eg, chromosome 8) or loss (eg, chromosome 7). (See
