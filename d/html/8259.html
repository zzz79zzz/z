Thrombolytic therapy is used in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) to rapidly dissolve the embolic burden and improve cardiorespiratory hemodynamics. However, thrombolytic therapy is associated with bleeding which can be catastrophic. Thus, careful patient selection is critical to the success of this therapy.</p><p>The indications, contraindications, and adverse effects of thrombolytic therapy in acute PE are discussed here. Thrombolysis for deep vein thrombosis of the upper and lower extremities are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/121197.html" rel="external">"Catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy in deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremity: Patient selection and administration"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8211.html" rel="external">"Primary (spontaneous) upper extremity deep vein thrombosis", section on 'Thrombolytic therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2731956934"><span class="h1">MAKING THE DECISION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because the adverse effects of bleeding can be devastating, only compromised patients in whom the diagnosis of acute PE is highly suspected or confirmed and in whom risk/benefit appears favorable should be considered for thrombolytic therapy. In most patients, the diagnosis is made by computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA). However, ventilation perfusion scanning or pulmonary arteriography, which often immediately precedes catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy (CDT), may also be confirmatory [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Occasionally, thrombolytic therapy is administered when a diagnosis is made with bedside echocardiography. Thrombolytic therapy can be administered using an empiric clinical diagnosis during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but it is rarely successful in refractory pulseless electrical activity arrest. The diagnosis of PE is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8261.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism", section on 'Hemodynamically unstable patients'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8261.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism", section on 'Computed tomography pulmonary angiography'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3743654320"><span class="h2">Pulmonary embolism response team</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because the decision to administer thrombolysis is fraught with difficulty, we support a multidisciplinary approach that comprises a team of experts including pulmonologists, intensivists, cardiologists, thoracic surgeons, interventional radiologists, vascular surgeons, emergency department clinicians, and/or pharmacists. Many centers have created PE response teams (PERTs) to facilitate rapid diagnosis and management of patients with PE who may be candidates for thrombolysis or other interventions [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. When making the decision regarding whether, when (immediate or delayed), and how (systemic, catheter-directed, with or without mechanical clot lysis) to administer thrombolytic therapy, most experts consider early involvement of PERT or other similar teams as critical. Data that support PERT are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8265.html" rel="external">"Treatment, prognosis, and follow-up of acute pulmonary embolism in adults", section on 'Pulmonary embolism response teams (PERT)'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4202107682"><span class="h2">Factors that influence the decision</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Experts should evaluate the risk of death from PE  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef127558" href="/d/graphic/127558.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and the risk of bleeding from the thrombolytic agent  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95035" href="/d/graphic/95035.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). We believe that the importance placed on the risk of bleeding is relative to the strength of the indication (ie, the risk of death from PE). As an example, the risk of bleeding from surgical trauma has greater weight if the indication for systemic thrombolytic therapy is, for example, mild right ventricular (RV) hypokinesis with normal biomarkers (intermediate-low-risk PE), than if the indication is shock or cardiac arrest (high-risk PE). As another example, while a patient with PE-induced shock who is unconscious requiring very high doses of vasopressors (high-risk PE) is likely to benefit from immediate intravenous (IV) systemic thrombolytic therapy, the indication is not as apparent in a patient who has low blood pressure for 20 minutes but is awake, alert, and comfortable with low oxygenation requirement. Despite a paucity of supporting data, PERTs help individualized decision-making. (See <a class="local">'Pulmonary embolism response team'</a> above.)</p><p>Once the decision is made to proceed with thrombolysis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82171" href="/d/graphic/82171.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), the clinician needs to decide the optimal mode and timing of administration. While this evaluation is ongoing, patients should be anticoagulated with IV <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8518" href="/d/drug information/8518.html" rel="external">unfractionated heparin</a> or low molecular weight heparin.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H997009503"><span class="h3">Assessing risk of death from pulmonary embolism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinician should thoroughly evaluate each individual for any one or more of the following factors that are thought to increase the risk of death from PE. Other than refractory hypotension and shock due to PE in patients with a low bleeding risk, <strong>none</strong> of the listed factors by itself is an absolute indication for thrombolytic therapy. Rather, all other factors are considered <strong>collectively</strong> so that the risk of death from PE can be assessed appropriately. These risk factors are summarized in the tables  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef127558" href="/d/graphic/127558.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90549" href="/d/graphic/90549.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8265.html" rel="external">"Treatment, prognosis, and follow-up of acute pulmonary embolism in adults", section on 'Prognostic factors'</a>.)</p><p>When considering patients for thrombolysis, most expert clinicians use a combination of clinical variables and their overall gestalt to <strong>stratify</strong> patients according to the risk of death from PE as the following [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>High risk</strong> – Patients in this category are considered hemodynamically unstable, the definition of which is discussed separately (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8261.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism", section on 'Hemodynamically unstable patients'</a> and <a class="local">'Hemodynamically unstable patients (high-risk pulmonary embolism)'</a> below). However, it needs to be acknowledged that significant heterogeneity exists among this group (eg, ranging from marginal hypotension to refractory hypotension, shock, and cardiac arrest). Nonetheless, patients at high risk of death from PE are generally considered good candidates for thrombolytic therapy, assuming that the bleeding risk is low. (See <a class="local">'Hemodynamically unstable patients (high-risk pulmonary embolism)'</a> below and <a class="local">'Cardiopulmonary resuscitation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intermediate risk</strong> – The intermediate-risk group is the most challenging and is the most heterogeneous. Within this category, significant variation of the derived benefit from thrombolysis is likely. Thus, selecting those most likely to benefit requires additional assessment. As a general rule, most experts consider intermediate-risk PE as acute PE that is associated with biochemical, echocardiographic, and/or imaging evidence of RV dilation or hypokinesis <strong>without</strong> systemic hypotension. Accordingly, while not absolute, many patients in this category typically have a simplified pulmonary embolism severity index (sPESI) score &gt;0  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90549" href="/d/graphic/90549.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). While many patients in this category do not need thrombolysis, a select group may benefit. Thus, some experts have subdivided this group into patients on the high end of the intermediate-risk category (intermediate-high) and patients on the low end of the intermediate-risk category (intermediate-low). We believe that patients in the intermediate-low-risk category are unlikely to benefit from thrombolytic therapy and should simply be anticoagulated in the vast majority of cases, while patients in the intermediate-high risk-category may benefit from thrombolytic therapy. The distinction between intermediate-high-risk and intermediate-low-risk patients involves the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Intermediate-low-risk PE – Abnormal RV function <strong>or</strong> elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or troponin</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Intermediate-high-risk PE – Abnormal RV function <strong>and</strong> elevated BNP or troponin</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A patient with an sPESI &gt;1 also meets definition for intermediate-risk PE, but we believe that such patients must have abnormal RV function <strong>and</strong> an elevated BNP or troponin before considering thrombolytic therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, this risk stratification needs further validation and cannot be utilized as the only measure to definitively decide whether or how thrombolytic therapy is administered. Thus, careful clinical assessment and gestalt are often necessary to supplement the available information. For example, clinical features that should be taken into consideration during this assessment include the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Evidence of RV dysfunction may be present despite a calculated sPESI of 0, and such patients may potentially benefit from thrombolysis if they meet other high-risk criteria  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef127558" href="/d/graphic/127558.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Certain older adult patients, or those with underlying cardiac disease or on beta blockers, may have an inappropriately low heart rate response to the stress of PE.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Some patients with acute PE may have an oxygen saturation of &gt;90 percent at rest but desaturate significantly with exertion (eg, sitting up in bed) or have postural hypotension. These features are not accounted for in the sPESI.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">While patients with extensive clot burden have been defined by some groups as "moderate PE," this definition is not consistent in the medical literature and not every patient with extensive clot burden has RV dysfunction or needs thrombolysis [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Intermediate-high-risk pulmonary embolism'</a> below and <a class="local">'Extensive clot burden'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Low risk</strong> – Patients with low-risk PE do not require thrombolytic therapy and should be treated with anticoagulation alone. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/95336.html" rel="external">"Venous thromboembolism: Initiation of anticoagulation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The location of the emboli (eg, peripheral, central) should also be assessed at this time since the location may affect methods chosen for clot removal (eg, bulky central emboli may require additional ablation locally [eg, surgical or mechanical clot extraction], clot in transit may also require specific expertise).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2945263553"><span class="h3">Assessing risk of bleeding and contraindications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Absolute contraindications to systemic thrombolytic therapy in acute PE include an intracranial neoplasm, recent (ie, &lt;2 months) intracranial or spinal surgery or trauma, history of a hemorrhagic stroke, active bleeding or bleeding diathesis (eg, severe thrombocytopenia), or nonhemorrhagic stroke within the previous three months. Relative contraindications include severe uncontrolled hypertension (ie, systolic blood pressure &gt;200 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;110 mmHg), non-hemorrhagic stroke more than three months prior, surgery within the previous 10 days, pregnancy, and others that are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95035" href="/d/graphic/95035.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>Thrombolytic therapy may cause moderate bleeding in menstruating women, but it has rarely been associated with major hemorrhage. Therefore, menstruation is not a contraindication to thrombolytic therapy.</p><p>Agents such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> or dual antiplatelet therapy increase the risk of bleeding but, in isolation, are not contraindications to thrombolytic therapy.</p><p>Caution is advised in patients who have had PE-induced syncope with resultant head trauma, even if brain CT shows no hemorrhage; in such cases, the risk of bleeding may be increased due to the trauma that may be undetected by head CT.</p><p>For those in whom contraindications or high bleeding risk truly prohibit thrombolytic therapy, an inferior vena cava filter and catheter/mechanical or surgical embolectomy are options, provided that the necessary resources and expertise are available; additional details are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8265.html" rel="external">"Treatment, prognosis, and follow-up of acute pulmonary embolism in adults", section on 'Embolectomy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8265.html" rel="external">"Treatment, prognosis, and follow-up of acute pulmonary embolism in adults", section on 'Inferior vena cava filters'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8265.html" rel="external">"Treatment, prognosis, and follow-up of acute pulmonary embolism in adults", section on 'Inferior vena cava filter'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H659974591"><span class="h2">Timing and method of administration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In most patients, thrombolytic therapy is administered immediately when the indication is clear (eg, shock due to PE or high-risk PE without a contraindication). However, in some cases when the indication is uncertain (eg, intermediate-risk PE or high-risk with a relative contraindication), some experts, including our group, observe the response to anticoagulation during the first 24 hours following the diagnosis. If during that time the patient improves (based on vitals, oxygenation, tissue perfusion), we do not proceed with thrombolytic therapy. In contrast, if during that period, patients have persistent or worsening signs of distress (eg, severe tachycardia, borderline blood pressure, poor oxygenation and tissue perfusion), we may proceed with thrombolytic therapy since the benefits likely outweigh the risk, at that point.</p><p>Once it is decided that thrombolytic therapy is indicated, the method of administration (eg, catheter-directed versus systemic) and dosing (full or reduced dose, infusion versus bolus) depend on factors including hemodynamic instability, risk of bleeding, available expertise, oxygen requirement, and extent of the emboli. Further details on our preferred method of administration are provided in the individual sections below. (See <a class="local">'Hemodynamically unstable patients (high-risk pulmonary embolism)'</a> below and <a class="local">'Hemodynamically stable patients'</a> below and <a class="local">'Special populations'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H613644316"><span class="h1">HEMODYNAMICALLY UNSTABLE PATIENTS (HIGH-RISK PULMONARY EMBOLISM)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with a low bleeding risk, the only widely accepted indication for full-dose intravenous (IV) systemic thrombolysis is acute PE (PE first or recurrent event) causing shock or persistent hypotension (ie, a systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg, need for vasopressors, or a decrease in the systolic blood pressure by ≥40 mmHg from baseline for 15 minutes or longer despite resuscitation)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82171" href="/d/graphic/82171.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Evidence from randomized and retrospective observational studies indicate that systemic thrombolytic therapy leads to early and rapid hemodynamic improvement (eg, improved pulmonary arterial blood pressure, right ventricular [RV] function, and pulmonary perfusion). Most experts believe that the benefit of rapid resolution of emboli causing shock or near-shock, is sufficient to justify thrombolytic therapy despite the increased risk of major or catastrophic bleeding. This strategy applies to patients who present with unstable PE. (See <a class="local">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>However, it may also be considered in those with intermediate-high-risk PE who deteriorate while on anticoagulant therapy (eg, worsening gas exchange, falling blood pressure without meeting the shock or hypotension definition criteria, rising heart rate), although most experts would prefer catheter-directed thrombolysis or catheter/mechanical embolectomy in this population. (See <a class="local">'Catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients at moderate or high risk of bleeding who are unstable due to PE, societal guidelines suggest catheter-directed therapies (eg, ultrasound, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a>, rotational device, suction) with or without thrombolysis [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>] rather than full-dose systemic thrombolytic therapy. However, reduced-dose systemic thrombolysis may be an alternative if catheter-directed approaches are unavailable. While patients in this category may not be ideal for any form of thrombolytic therapy, some experts administer catheter-directed thrombolytics when the benefit is believed to outweigh the risk (eg, life-threatening unstable PE in patients with a minor fracture or compressible surgical wound). Catheter-based therapies are also an option for those in whom systemic thrombolysis fails (to reverse shock), provided that the necessary local expertise is available [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>In patients with hemodynamically unstable PE in whom thrombolysis is contraindicated, surgical or catheter-directed embolectomy are options. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8265.html" rel="external">"Treatment, prognosis, and follow-up of acute pulmonary embolism in adults", section on 'Embolectomy'</a>.)</p><p>While the American College of Chest Physicians support the administration of catheter-directed therapies with or without thrombolysis as an option in hemodynamically unstable patients in whom death is likely to occur before systemic thrombolysis can manifest effectiveness (ie, within hours), we believe that implementing systemic thrombolysis, even delivered over two hours, is, in fact, nearly always faster than a catheter-directed approach [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>].</p><p>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a useful adjunct for supporting patients with refractory shock, hypoxemia from PE, or after cardiac arrest [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1625.html" rel="external">"Extracorporeal life support in adults in the intensive care unit: Overview"</a>.)</p><p>We prefer that a specialist in anesthesia perform intubation in these patients, if feasible, since a sudden increase in pressure from intubation and mechanical ventilation and hypotension from sedatives may have significant adverse effects of the already compromised RV and precipitate RV shock.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2068220038"><span class="h2">Systemic infusion (full-dose thrombolytic)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In hemodynamically <strong>unstable</strong> patients with low bleeding risk, we and others prefer systemic thrombolysis with, typically, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA); this preference is based on the widespread availability and clinical experience with this agent, as well as the rapidity with which it can be administered in life-threatening situations [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. IV access needs to be secure, and central access is not required.</p><p>Necessary invasive procedures (eg, IV access) should be quickly performed while the infusion is being prepared and all other invasive procedures delayed until after the infusion is complete.

No agent has proven to be superior. However, SK and UK are no longer available for this indication in the United States. This, coupled with a shorter infusion time, has resulted in tPA (in particular alteplase) being the most common agent used for patients with acute PE.

However, none of these regimens has been directly compared with a two-hour infusion of tPA. Evidence from small randomized trials suggests that shorter infusions (ie, ≤2 hours for tPA) achieve more rapid clot lysis and are associated with lower rates of bleeding than longer infusions (ie, ≥12 to 24 hours for UK and SK, respectively) [<a href="#rid5">5,9</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Anticoagulation following thrombolysis'</a> below.)</p><p>Considerable clinical judgment is needed when patients have bleeding while on thrombolytic therapy. Minor bleeding during thrombolytic therapy is common and is not generally an indication to stop therapy. However, the definition of minor bleeding is unclear. In our opinion, minor bleeding is that which occurs at sites of invasive procedures such as venipuncture or arterial puncture sites or in the skin and gums [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. Bleeding from vascular puncture sites should be controlled with manual compression followed by a pressure dressing. Many experts also tolerate bleeding from menstruation and bleeding that can be controlled at compressible sites (eg, epistaxis or wounds). Minor bleeding from the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract may also be managed by following clinically (eg, vital signs and hemoglobin).</p><p>However, signs of major bleeding (eg, hemodynamic compromise, mental status changes, significant reductions in hemoglobin [eg, by 1 to 2 g/dL], need for transfusion, and copious amounts of bleeding) are indications to immediately stop the infusion and treat the bleeding. If intracranial bleeding is suspected clinically, infusion of the thrombolytic agent should be <strong>immediately</strong> discontinued; following stabilization, a non-contrast-enhanced CT scan of the brain and emergent neurologic/neurosurgical consultation should be obtained.

After the thrombolytic infusion is complete, some experts start a heparin infusion without a bolus. However, to minimize the risk of bleeding, most would check an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and resume UFH without a loading dose when the aPTT is less than twice its upper limit of normal. If the aPTT exceeds this value, we repeat it every four hours until it is less than twice its upper limit of normal, at which time, we resume a heparin infusion.

Many of the trials are limited by issues including small sample size and patient crossover between the groups. In addition, many studies included variable populations of patients with PE (unstable, stable) and had variable types of thrombolysis agents, methods of administration, and dosing. Nonetheless, a consistent finding among studies is that thrombolytic therapy leads to early hemodynamic improvement and, although a mortality benefit may exist, it occurs at a cost of increased major bleeding [<a href="#rid14">14-21</a>].

Choosing how many catheters to place, whether a bolus of thrombolytic agent is administered before the infusion, and whether lysis should be combined with other clot removal procedures is individualized and dependent on the operator, their experience, and the location and volume of emboli. For example, the presence of large central main pulmonary artery embolus in addition to significant peripheral segmental/subsegmental embolus might prompt debulking with percutaneous clot extraction devices followed by infusion with CDT lysis. This is individual preference, and no randomized data exist to support this approach. In contrast, for those with just central main pulmonary artery embolus or right atrial clot in transit, mechanical clot extraction alone may be enough. For thrombolytic infusions, one catheter is typically placed per affected lung (ie, two for bilateral PE and one for unilateral PE). In addition, we prefer shorter duration infusions with lower doses to reduce the risk of bleeding. An example would be 1 mg/hour per lung over four to six hours (ie, 12 mg tPA [<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8478" href="/d/drug information/8478.html" rel="external">alteplase</a>] total) [<a href="#rid48">48</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">There are no universally accepted anticoagulation protocols for CDT.

For patients in whom thrombolytic therapy is being considered, we support a multidisciplinary approach (eg, PE response team). The approach should integrate several clinical factors that stratify the risk of death from acute PE (low, intermediate, high risk)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef127558" href="/d/graphic/127558.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and the risk of bleeding from the agent  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95035" href="/d/graphic/95035.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).

(See <a class="local">'Hemodynamically unstable patients (high-risk pulmonary embolism)'</a> above and <a class="local">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In unstable patients due to acute PE in whom systemic thrombolytic therapy is indicated, the following approach to administration is appropriate:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Dosing and infusion times</strong> – We prefer short infusion times (ie, infusion of 100 mg tissue plasminogen activator [tPA; <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8478" href="/d/drug information/8478.html" rel="external">alteplase</a>] over ≤2 hours) since this strategy is associated with lower rates of bleeding compared with longer infusion times. (See <a class="local">'Systemic infusion (full-dose thrombolytic)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Anticoagulation</strong> – We typically discontinue anticoagulation during the infusion, when feasible, although this is not universally performed by all experts. During the infusion, the patient should be monitored closely for stability or improvement of vital signs and oxygenation, development of neurologic signs, and hemodynamic or other obvious signs of bleeding. Clinical improvement is typically noted within the first hour of the infusion. Signs of major bleeding (eg, hemodynamic compromise, mental status changes, reduction in hemoglobin [eg, 1 to 2 g/dL], need for transfusion, and copious amounts of bleeding) are indications to immediately stop the infusion and investigate, locate, and treat the source. Following thrombolysis, patients should be fully anticoagulated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8518" href="/d/drug information/8518.html" rel="external">unfractionated heparin</a> (UFH) infusion without a bolus; we prefer to wait until the activated partial thromboplastin time is less than twice its upper limit of normal before starting the UFH infusion. (See <a class="local">'Anticoagulation during thrombolysis'</a> above and <a class="local">'Monitoring and management of bleeding'</a> above and <a class="local">'Anticoagulation following thrombolysis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><strong>Patients who are unstable and are at moderate risk of bleeding</strong> – For patients who are unstable due to PE and are at moderate risk of bleeding, we suggest catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) or catheter-directed thrombectomy if expertise is available rather than systemic thrombolysis (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). This approach is based on limited data that suggest similar rapid clot resolution but lower bleeding rates than that seen with systemic thrombolysis. In some cases, CDT may be combined with a clot extraction procedure (eg, mechanical, ultrasound, or jet <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> lysis). (See <a class="local">'Catheter-directed approaches'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><strong>Patents with contraindications</strong> – For those who are unstable due to PE and have contraindications to thrombolysis or are at high risk of bleeding or for patients who fail systemic thrombolysis, catheter-directed clot extraction procedures or surgical embolectomy are appropriate options. (See <a class="local">'Catheter-directed approaches'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8265.html" rel="external">"Treatment, prognosis, and follow-up of acute pulmonary embolism in adults", section on 'Embolectomy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Stable patients</strong> – For <strong>most</strong> patients who do not have hemodynamic compromise due to acute PE, we recommend <strong>against</strong> thrombolytic therapy (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_3" rel="external">Grade 1C</a>). However, thrombolysis may be administered on a case-by-case basis in those assessed to be at the highest risk of death from PE, in whom the benefits are considered by the clinician to outweigh the risk of hemorrhage  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef127558" href="/d/graphic/127558.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). For example:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Patients with</strong> <strong>intermediate-high-risk PE</strong> – Patients with intermediate-high-risk PE may benefit from thrombolysis. This population typically comprises acute PE associated with biochemical and echocardiographic (or CT pulmonary angiographic) evidence of right ventricle (RV) dilation or hypokinesis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The rationale for thrombolysis in this population is based on the observation that severe RV dysfunction is associated with a worse prognosis than mild or no RV dysfunction. However, randomized trials have not shown a convincing or consistent mortality benefit from thrombolytic therapy in patients with RV dysfunction. This may be because this heterogeneous population constitutes a fairly wide spectrum such that selecting patients at highest risk of death from RV dysfunction due to PE is likely critical to the benefit of thrombolytic therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">For those in whom thrombolytic therapy is selected, we suggest CDT rather than systemic therapy, provided that the expertise is available and bleeding risk is low (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Our preference for CDT is based on our clinical experience and the likelihood of a lower risk of bleeding with this method of administration compared with systemic thrombolysis since lower doses of agent are administered during CDT. Full-dose systemic thrombolytic therapy is a suitable alternative if local expertise is not available or the patient is not suitable or cannot be transferred for CDT; while there are relatively few data, reduced-dose systemic tPA may also be a reasonable option when CDT is not available. (See <a class="local">'Intermediate-high-risk pulmonary embolism'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Patients who do not improve or deteriorate despite anticoagulation</strong> – Patients who do not improve or deteriorate despite anticoagulation may be considered for thrombolysis (systemic or CDT), an indication that is supported by guidelines. Patients assessed to have a high clot burden and/or severe hypoxemia are sometimes considered for thrombolysis, particularly when these features are combined with other high-risk factors for death from PE. However, these populations are poorly defined and robust data to support either an increased mortality from PE or a reduction in mortality with thrombolytic therapy are lacking. The mode of administration is preferably CDT, based on the same rationale as for those with intermediate-high risk PE. (See <a class="local">'Other'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Special populations</strong> – Thrombolytic therapy in select populations requiring special consideration includes those who present with cardiac arrest or clot-in-transit, patients who fail systemic thrombolytic therapy, and pregnant women. The approach to thrombolysis should be individualized in these populations. (See <a class="local">'Special populations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bleeding</strong> – Bleeding rates vary among studies. In general, rates of major bleeding range from 10 to 20 percent for systemic agents, while lower rates in the region of 4 percent or less have been reported for CDT. Similarly, approximately 2 to 5 percent may experience intracranial hemorrhage with systemic agents, while rates of &lt;1 percent are reported in those who receive CDT.
