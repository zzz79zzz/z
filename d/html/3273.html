         Dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) is one of the most common procedures performed in obstetrics and gynecology. As a general term, D&amp;C describes a procedure in which cervical dilators are used to facilitate the introduction of instruments into the uterus, and the endometrial cavity is either sampled or emptied with a curette. D&amp;C can be used for therapeutic and diagnostic indications and in both the nonpregnant and pregnant uterus.
        </p>
        <p>
         The D&amp;C procedure will be reviewed here. Office sampling procedures and diagnostic approaches to evaluation of the endometrium are discussed elsewhere. (See

         D&amp;C performed for a pregnancy-related indication is sometimes also referred to as suction D&amp;C, aspiration D&amp;C, or dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E). There is some regional variation in use of the term D&amp;E; in clinical institutions in some places, it is used for any procedure involving suction at any gestation, whereas in other areas, it is used to refer only to procedures in the second trimester. For the purposes of this topic, we will focus on procedures in the first trimester and use the term aspiration D&amp;C.

         When evaluating AUB or endometrial thickening, diagnostic D&amp;C should be done in conjunction with hysteroscopy to obtain a visual image of the endometrial cavity and to exclude focal disease. Hysteroscopy thus turns a "blind" procedure into one allowing directed biopsy or visual confirmation of pathology. This helps to prevent missing unsuspected polyps and ensures that the most visibly abnormal areas are sampled. Hysteroscopy may be better able to detect abnormalities than blind endometrial sampling alone in the evaluation of AUB [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. In addition, a combined procedure with hysteroscopy may provide options for definitive treatment of AUB (such as polypectomy or resection of submucosal fibroids). (See

         Due to anticoagulant therapy – Decisions about holding anticoagulants prior to D&amp;C need to be made on an individual basis along with other members of the patient's care team (eg, the prescribing physician and anesthesiologist). Considerations include the indications for anticoagulation (therapeutic versus prophylactic), risk of complication/thrombosis if anticoagulants are stopped temporarily, and bleeding risk specific to the patient's case. For example, patients who are on long-term anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation can often have their anticoagulants held for several days without significant risk, whereas patients with recent thromboembolic disease or with artificial heart valves are at much higher risk of complication if their anticoagulation is held. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1312.html" rel="external">
          "Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants"

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Additionally, in pregnancy-related suction D&amp;C, the primary physiologic mechanism for cessation of bleeding is uterine contractility, and thus these cases can often be done without holding anticoagulants without complication [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Typically, even when patients are fully anticoagulated, no additional bleeding is encountered, and additional measures are not needed. Uterotonics may be used if needed per usual practice.

         Scheduled or elective D&amp;C should generally be avoided in the patient with a known cervical or uterine infection. D&amp;C performed in the presence of infection may result in further ascending infection, pelvic inflammatory disease, or development of intrauterine adhesions. If the procedure can be delayed, the infection should be treated prior to any instrumentation. There are, however, exceptions to this:

         Osmotic dilators (laminaria or Dilapan-S) are another method of cervical preparation that are mainly used for induced abortion. Placement requires an additional visit the day before the scheduled surgery and may be uncomfortable for patients. Since significant dilation is not usually needed for D&amp;C alone, osmotic dilators are not commonly used.

         Each provider should use the instruments available and appropriate to their setting and experience. We prefer use of thin tapered dilators (eg, Hanks or Pratt dilators) compared with blunt tip dilators (eg, Hegars) because of the enhanced tactile feedback during dilation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55448" href="/z/d/graphic/55448.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). In addition, Hanks and Pratts have smaller intervals between each size compared with standard Hegars. We suggest use of tapered dilators rather than blunt dilators. Tapered dilators require less force and may therefore minimize risk of uterine perforation [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. In particular, we find this helpful in patients with tortuous, nulliparous, or postmenopausal cervical canals. However, some surgeons prefer blunt tip dilators.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dilator sizes commonly start at 13 French for Pratt, 9 French for Hanks, and 3 mm diameter for standard Hegars. French scale measurements are equivalent to circumference in millimeters (or the diameter multiplied by pi [3.14]).

         If the smallest of the usual gynecologic dilators does not easily pass into the cervical canal, some surgeons will use lacrimal duct probes or narrower metal cervical dilators (as small as 1 mm diameter) to access the cervix. Care should be taken when inserting these since a narrower dilator may be more likely to pass through tissue rather than into the cervical canal or uterine cavity, and can result in injury or the creation of a "false passage" that may make finding the true cervical canal more difficult. Another option is use of flexible plastic "os finders" (eg, Comfort-Flex Cervical Dilator Set) that come with both gently and sharply tapered tips for dilation up to approximately 3.8 mm before transitioning to the traditional dilator sizes.

         Sharp metal curettes are typically selected for diagnostic D&amp;C procedures (eg, for postmenopausal bleeding). These curettes have a long handle and open teardrop shape at the tip, often with a sharp edge along the superior convex aspect  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68468" href="/z/d/graphic/68468.html" rel="external">
          picture 2

         ). Metal curettes come in various sizes corresponding to the largest diameter at the tip, including #00 (3 mm), #0 (5 mm), #1 (7 mm), #2 (8 mm), #3 (9 mm), and larger. We prefer metal curettes that are malleable, allowing the operator to adjust the curvature of the device to facilitate access to the fundus in the case of severe uterine flexion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Plastic curettes, also called cannulas, are used in suction D&amp;C and are typically used when large amounts of endometrial tissue are anticipated, such as aspiration D&amp;C associated with pregnancy or in a patient with heavy active bleeding or known retained clot.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the nonpregnant patient, a plastic curette diameter between 7 to 10 mm should be sufficient for evacuation of clot or endometrial tissue. Plastic curettes may be straight or curved, rigid or flexible; we typically use curved rigid cannulas for electric suction aspiration procedures, though the choice of cannula should be guided by surgeon comfort and experience  (

         Electric suction aspiration provides continued negative pressure to quickly evacuate the uterine contents and thus minimize additional bleeding. This has traditionally been used as the aspiration source for a therapeutic suction D&amp;C procedure. However, the pump and unit require a clinic or procedure area with adequate space and resources.
        </p>
        <p>
         Manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) refers to a handheld device that is "locked," then utilizes a large attached syringe that is withdrawn to create negative pressure  (

          picture 4
         </a>
         ). Once connected to the curette in position inside the uterus, the lock is released to allow use of the negative pressure to evacuate the uterus, collecting tissue in the syringe. The standard MVA device has a double lock, whereas a device with a single lock, or with a locking syringe (sometimes referred to as a Karman device), generates a lower level of negative pressure. The Karman devices are sufficient for diagnostic purposes, such as examination for villi in evaluation of pregnancy of unknown location, but cannot reliably be used for therapeutic purposes.

          10

         If indicated for evaluation of cervical dysplasia, perform endocervical curettage prior to dilation or intrauterine procedures to avoid contamination of the endocervical specimen with endometrial cells. To perform endocervical curettage, an endocervical curette (eg, Kevorkian curette) is inserted into the external cervix and curettage performed in all four quadrants  (

          figure 1

         ). With training, surgeons learn to sense this landmark as the loss of mild resistance with application of steady pressure. Typically, the dilator is held lightly between the thumb and first digit of the dominant hand, with the remaining fingers spread laterally to provide a backstop against the perineum for any sudden loss of resistance. Do not apply fundal pressure with the tip of the dilators. If resistance is encountered and then suddenly lost with the dilator advancing notably beyond previous dilators, the clinician should suspect a uterine perforation. Another sign of perforation is losing a feeling of resistance at the level of the uterine fundus, either with the dilator or when checking with a uterine sound.

         Curettage should continue until a gritty texture (rather than smooth or slippery texture) is palpable at the tip of the curette, corresponding to successful removal of overlying endometrium. If a plastic curette is used for therapeutic suction D&amp;C, then additional use of a metal curette is generally not needed if the gritty texture of the uterus is noted with the plastic curette and there is no concern for retained tissue or abnormally adherent tissue.

         Cervical stenosis is common, and indeed, an unsuccessful attempt at endometrial biopsy in the office due to stenosis may be the sole indication for bringing a patient to the operating room for D&amp;C.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cervical stenosis can be caused by congenital anomalies (eg, due to in utero diethylstilbestrol exposure), prior surgery or other trauma to the cervix (eg, loop electrosurgical excision procedure [LEEP], cone biopsy, obstetric laceration, or cerclage placement), infection, or menopause. Anatomical variations such as severe uterine anteversion/retroversion or uterine fibroids may also impede access to the uterine cavity by causing deviation of the cervical canal. In a series of over 31,000 patients undergoing office hysteroscopy, cervical stenosis was documented in 29.9 percent of premenopausal patients and 70.1 percent of postmenopausal patients [
         <a href="#rid12">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         When stenosis is known or anticipated, measures should be taken to facilitate cervical dilation and avoid cervical or uterine injury. While we do not use cervical preparation with prostaglandins or osmotic dilators for most D&amp;C procedures, these may be considered in some cases of known cervical stenosis or obstruction (ie, history of LEEP, cervical fibroids), nulliparous patients, adolescents, or some induced abortion procedures. Of note, there are no studies that have demonstrated successful use of cervical ripening agents such as

        <p>
         Intraoperative ultrasound guidance can be extremely useful by providing visualization and facilitating access to the cervix and uterine cavity. To perform a D&amp;C under ultrasound guidance, the bladder should be back-filled through a urethral catheter with at least 200 to 300 mL of sterile water or

         to allow transabdominal views of the uterus and cervical canal. Direct visualization of dilators in the cervical canal and then into the endometrial cavity during placement can aid navigation of tortuous cervical canals and avoid creation of false passages [

         Applying cautious blunt pressure to the external cervical os to release adhesions. A narrow dilator may be used or the narrow end of an Adson forceps. Care should be taken to avoid creating a false tract rather than passing the dilator into the cervical canal. Of note, if ultrasound guidance is used, the external os and lower cervical canal may be difficult to define since having a speculum in place will cause interference with the image.

         Occasionally, a flexible hysteroscope can be passed through the cervical canal, but further dilation with rigid dilators is unsuccessful. In such cases, a small flexible plastic cannula and suction aspiration may be attempted instead of malleable metal instruments. This may be a successful approach because the straight tips of the smallest plastic cannula are often narrower in diameter than the smallest metal curettes, and the flexible design can accommodate abnormal anatomy.

         In selected cases, surgeons have described use of hysteroscopic techniques (with a miniature loop, bipolar tip, or scissors) to resect endocervical tissue or adhesions under direct visualization [

        </p>
        <p>
         When accessing the cavity is difficult, the possibility of an undiagnosed uterine anomaly or intrauterine adhesion should be considered. If intraoperative ultrasound and the above attempts fail, the D&amp;C attempt should be abandoned, and imaging with a different modality, such as magnetic resonance imaging or saline-infusion sonography, may be useful to better define the anatomy.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the above maneuvers are unsuccessful and it is important to sample the endometrium, an option is to perform ultrasound-guided biopsy through the cervix or myometrium. This can be done with an extra-long 18- or 20-gauge spinal needle to aspirate intrauterine contents or fluid and obtain a sample for pathologic examination [

         Uterine perforation is the most common immediate complication of D&amp;C. Rates of perforation depend on the indication for D&amp;C. The highest rate of uterine perforation appears to be in the setting of postpartum hemorrhage (5.1 percent) compared with a lower rate in diagnostic curettage (0.3 percent in the premenopausal patient and 2.6 percent in the postmenopausal patient) [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15
         </a>
         ]. Perforation rates overall are higher in the pregnant than the nonpregnant uterus due to softening of the uterine wall and enlargement of the uterine cavity. In general, perforation rates tend to increase with increasing uterine size (lowest in the first trimester and highest in the postpartum uterus).
        </p>
        <p>
         Uterine perforation may be unrecognized perioperatively, as found in one series of 706 patients undergoing laparoscopic tubal ligation after a first-trimester surgical abortion [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16

         Injury to the cervix during D&amp;C can occur in the form of an injury to the external cervix from the tenaculum or internal damage to the cervical canal or stroma from dilation or passage of instruments through the cervical canal.
        </p>
        <p>
         The most common cervical injury is a laceration to the cervical lip when too much traction is applied to a sharp-toothed tenaculum. Most of these injuries can be managed expectantly or become hemostatic with the application of pressure,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9888" href="/z/d/drug information/9888.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         (Monsel solution), though in some cases a suture may be needed.
        </p>
        <p>
         To avoid cervical laceration, some providers prefer atraumatic tenacula or application of a single-toothed tenaculum in the vertical orientation with one tooth in the internal os. This places the force of the tenaculum perpendicular to the circular muscle fibers of the cervix, though this may be more challenging to place the tenaculum in this position if the external os is narrow (eg, postmenopausal patient or cervical stenosis). Also, if an injury occurs with the tenaculum in the vertical configuration, suturing can be done in the transverse direction, which may be technically easier. When the cervix is enlarged and softer as in the case of pregnancy evacuation in the late first and second trimester or postpartum period, we routinely use an atraumatic grasper such as the Bierer tenaculum or a ring forceps to minimize cervical trauma.
        </p>
        <p>
         Internal cervical lacerations are less common but can occur in the setting of a dilator or curette making a false passage or perforation. To reduce the risk of internal cervical injury, excessive force should be avoided during dilation. There is a risk of laceration of a cervical branch of the uterine artery, which may result in significant bleeding. Internal cervical injuries can be controlled with pressure or direct suture application if injury is relatively minimal. If there is more severe bleeding, options include balloon tamponade with or without therapeutic embolization if bleeding is more significant. Rarely, with high internal cervical injuries, bleeding may extend abdominally or retroperitoneally, requiring further surgical exploration.

         Infection associated with D&amp;C is rare. Very little is known about the incidence or risk factors for infection at the time of diagnostic D&amp;C. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis for gynecologic procedure do not specifically address diagnostic D&amp;C; however, for similar procedures such as endometrial biopsy or procedures often done in concert with D&amp;C including hysteroscopy and endometrial ablation, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended [

         D&amp;C may be complicated by an incomplete procedure, either due to need to abort the procedure or as manifested by retained products of conception after a pregnancy-related suction D&amp;C.
        </p>
        <p>
         Diagnostic procedures may need to be aborted in the event of severe cervical stenosis or in the event of complications such as hemorrhage or perforation. In cases of unsurmountable cervical stenosis, a repeat procedure may be considered at another time if preprocedure cervical preparation had not previously been used, or other surgical procedures such as hysterectomy may be required.
        </p>
        <p>
         D&amp;C procedures done in concert with hysteroscopy may need to be aborted if perforation occurs and uterine distension is lost or if there is excessive absorption of distending fluid. In cases of uterine perforation, if there is no accompanying hemorrhage or other instability, careful curettage under ultrasound guidance may still be performed if the boundaries of the endometrial cavity can be carefully ensured. Otherwise, the uterine perforation should be allowed to heal for at least one to two weeks, and then repeat procedure may be performed, preferably with ultrasound guidance.

         Management of retained products of conception after pregnancy termination is discussed elsewhere. (See

        <p>
         Cramps are the most common side effect. They usually subside soon after the procedure but may last for a day or two. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs provide adequate analgesia. Light bleeding can persist for several days. Heavy bleeding, such as saturating a sanitary pad within one hour more than once, is abnormal.
        </p>
        <p>
         The patient should call the surgeon if she has fever (more than 100.4°F), cramps lasting longer than 48 hours, increasing pelvic or abdominal pain, prolonged or heavy bleeding, or a foul-smelling vaginal discharge.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most surgeons recommend pelvic rest for some duration of time, ranging from three days to two weeks, to prevent bleeding and/or infection. There is no evidence to support any specific recommendations.

         Dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) describes a procedure in which cervical dilators are used to facilitate the introduction of instruments into the uterus and the endometrial cavity is either sampled or emptied with a curette. D&amp;C can be used for therapeutic and diagnostic indications and in both the nonpregnant and pregnant uterus. (See
         <a class="local">

         There are many indications for D&amp;C, some of these include unsuccessful office endometrial biopsy, further evaluation for endometrial neoplasia after office biopsy, temporary management of patients with abnormal uterine bleeding, and evacuation of products of conception in induced or spontaneous abortion. (See
         <a class="local">

         Desired ongoing pregnancy is an absolute contraindication to D&amp;C, and D&amp;C should be performed with precautions for patients with risks of increased bleeding including those on anticoagulation or with bleeding diatheses, pelvic infection, or cervical or cesarean scar pregnancy. (See

         or osmotic dilators for cervical preparation may reduce the need for mechanical dilation; however, they have potential side effects or limitations that do not support routine use prior to D&amp;C. (See

         We suggest use of tapered dilators for D&amp;C rather than blunt dilators (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Tapered dilators require less force. (See

         Cervical stenosis is common. A variety of intraoperative techniques, including use of ultrasound guidance, may facilitate successful D&amp;C and therefore reduce the risk of uterine perforation or creation of a false passage in the cervix. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Cervical stenosis'

         Complications of D&amp;C are rare and may include uterine perforation, cervical injury, infection, hemorrhage, or incomplete procedure. (See
