         Hemoglobin (Hb), the abundant oxygen-carrying protein found within red blood cells (RBCs), is a tetramer composed of two alpha-like and two beta-like globin chains, each globin chain having an associated heme group. The hemoglobinopathies are a complex group of inherited blood disorders in which one or more genetic abnormalities results in a change in the amount, structure, or function of one or more of the globin chains. In contrast, abnormalities in heme synthesis result in sideroblastic anemias and porphyrias.
        </p>
        <p>
         The most common hemoglobinopathies include the thalassemias (alpha- and beta-) and sickle cell disease (SCD), but hundreds of abnormalities in the globin genes have been described.
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies requires clear understanding of the genetics and structure of the globin chains and Hb. Timely and accurate diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies is important to inform optimal management in affected individuals and to offer genetic counseling and reproductive options in carriers.

         Human Hbs are tetrameric proteins composed of two pairs of globin chains, each of which contains one alpha-like (α-like) chain and one beta-like (β-like) chain. Each globin chain is associated with an iron-containing heme moiety  (

          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Throughout life, the synthesis of the alpha-like and the beta-like (also called non-alpha-like) chains is balanced so that their ratio is relatively constant and there is no excess of either type [

         Hemoglobinopathies include a heterogeneous group of variants caused by genetic alterations in one or more of the different globin genes and their regulatory regions. Many of the clinically important hemoglobinopathies are caused by missense mutations in the coding sequence of a globin gene (single nucleotide substitutions that alter the amino acid sequence of the resulting protein). Copy number variation (eg, deletion, duplication, insertion) is also a common genetic cause of Hb disorders, and complex rearrangements and globin gene fusions can also occur. Mutations in the non-coding (regulatory) regions of the globin genes or their locus control regions that impair the transcription, splicing, and post-transcriptional stability of the messenger RNA are common causes of thalassemia. Over a thousand specific mutations have been described; a listing is available on the
         <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fglobin.cse.psu.edu%2F&amp;token=W%2FMNZorEFI2EtNnE4Oqza%2BLSzyNbNNPsEL85T2QwNbbfeKuzf3vos5FVncGUXy64&amp;TOPIC_ID=13941" target="_blank">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Hemoglobinopathies can be broadly classified into structural Hb variants (qualitative defects), in which the genetic defect gives rise to a structural and often a functional change in Hb; and thalassemias (quantitative defects), in which the genetic defect leads to a quantitative change in the amount of globin chain produced  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65311" href="/z/d/graphic/65311.html" rel="external">
          figure 3
         </a>
         ). The disease mechanisms and clinical expression of the hemoglobinopathies also vary. In general, most clinically significant Hb structural variants cause hemolysis in peripheral blood. In contrast, beta thalassemias are predominantly characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and destruction of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow. Some conditions, like Hb H disease (a form of alpha thalassemia), cause both hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis. Anemia may be severe, such as in transfusion-dependent alpha or beta thalassemia (TDT; formerly called thalassemia major). Sickle cell disease (SCD) also causes vaso-occlusive phenomena. In addition to these clinical differences, there are also differences in the approach to diagnostic testing for suspected hemoglobinopathies, which are discussed below. (See

          Hb variants
         </strong>
         – Hb structural variants are qualitative defects that cause a change in the structure (primary, secondary, tertiary, and/or quaternary) of the Hb molecule. The majority of Hb variants do not cause disease and are most commonly discovered either incidentally or through newborn screening. A subset of Hb variants can cause severe disease when inherited in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state in combination with another structural variant or a thalassemia mutation. Clinical consequences include anemia of several causes (hemolysis, ineffective erythropoiesis, decreased Hb oxygen affinity) or polycythemia due to increased Hb oxygen affinity. Common examples of hemoglobin variants associated with hemolysis include sickle Hb (Hb S) and Hb C. Hb variants can usually be detected by protein-based assay methods; however, DNA-based methods may be required for variants with ambiguous or unusual results from protein-based testing. (See
         <a class="local">

          Change in oxygen affinity

         – High or low oxygen affinity Hb variants are more likely than normal to adopt the relaxed (R, oxy) state or the tense (T, deoxy) state, respectively. High oxygen affinity variants (R state) may cause relative erythrocytosis (eg, Hb Chesapeake, Hb Montefiore). Some low oxygen affinity variants can cause anemia (although tissue oxygen delivery is normal) and even cyanosis due to desaturation. Examples include Hb Kansas and Hb Beth Israel. (See

          Thalassemias
         </strong>
         – Thalassemias are quantitative defects that lead to reduced levels of one type of globin chain, creating an imbalance in the ratio of alpha-like chains to beta-like chains. As noted above, this ratio is normally tightly regulated to prevent excess globin chains of one type from accumulating. The excess chains that fail to incorporate into Hb form nonfunctional aggregates that precipitate within the RBC. This can lead to premature RBC destruction in the bone marrow (especially in beta thalassemia) and/or in the peripheral blood (especially in alpha thalassemia). (See

          Alpha thalassemias
         </strong>
         – Alpha thalassemias are characterized by reduced levels of alpha globin chains. The majority of alpha thalassemias are caused by large deletions of one or both of the alpha globin genes (
         <em>
          HBA1
         </em>
         and
         <em>
          HBA2)
         </em>
         , which are located in tandem on chromosome 16  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65642" href="/z/d/graphic/65642.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). With a normal total of four alpha globin genes, the alpha thalassemias are broadly classified based upon numbers of genes deleted or mutated. One- and two-gene deletions are the most common and are manifested as either the silent carrier state (αα/–α) or alpha thalassemia trait (-α/-α, αα/--). Given their high frequency, it is not uncommon for gene deletions of
         <em>
          HBA1
         </em>
         or
         <em>
          HBA2

         and

         on the same chromosome are prevalent in individuals with Southeast Asian ancestry, and when these large deletions are co-inherited with a single alpha gene deletion from the other parent, the result is Hb H disease (three total gene deletions or pathogenic variants; -α/--). Hemoglobin H is a tetramer composed of four beta globin chains. Homozygous inheritance of large deletions involving both alpha globin genes (ie, loss of all four alpha genes) results in alpha thalassemia major or "hydrops fetalis." (See

         The thalassemias are genetically complex and heterogeneous, so the above classification is simplistic. Some other causes of thalassemia include variants that result in altered Hb structure. An example is Hb Lepore, a fusion Hb in which the 5’ δ-globin sequences are fused to 3’ β-globin sequences with deletion of the intergenic DNA, which places the δβ-fusion gene under the transcriptional control of the inefficient δ-globin promoter, causing low expression of the fusion globin. Examples of mutations that create an amino acid change and an aberrant splice site include Hb E, Hb Knossos, and Hb Malay; such mutations produce both qualitative and quantitative abnormalities. Other types of mutations cause "hyper-unstable" globins, in which the nascent globin chains are highly unstable and undergo rapid proteolytic degradation, resulting in a secondary quantitative (thalassemic) disorder [

         ]. These methods can be broadly divided into protein-based (protein chemistry) and DNA-based (molecular genetic) methods. An overview of the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches is presented in the table  (

         Historically, gel-based electrophoresis methods were used to evaluate many common hemoglobinopathies. Electrophoresis can resolve many normal and abnormal Hbs, such as Hb A, Hb A
         <sub>

         , Hb F, Hb S, and Hb C. Gel-based electrophoresis is routinely used in many laboratories; however, high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC; also called high performance liquid chromatography), capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), and isoelectric focusing (IEF) have increasingly become the first-line methods of choice. HPLC and CZE are most commonly employed in high-volume laboratories due to their ability to process large numbers of samples in relatively small amounts of time.

        <p>
         Information from the family history and parent testing including complete blood count (CBC), reticulocyte count, and peripheral blood morphology combined with one or more protein-based methods, is often sufficient for diagnosis of common Hb variants, but not always. DNA-based methods are especially important for diagnosing alpha thalassemias and beta thalassemias. Indeed, they have high clinical utility for the diagnosis of all types of hemoglobinopathies (thalassemias and structural variants).

         Advantages of HPLC and CZE include excellent resolution of Hb fractions (both normal and variant Hbs), high reproducibility, capacity for automation, requirement for a very small blood sample, and rapid turnaround time. These advantages have led to the widespread adoption of these techniques. HPLC and CZE can be used as complementary methods to resolve ambiguous results, and Hbs that are not detectable by one method may be resolved by the other. IEF and gel electrophoresis are less quantitative and thus less useful for accurately quantifying Hbs present in low concentrations. However, they function well for identifying several common hemoglobinopathies.

         ). HPLC permits presumptive identification of many more Hb variants than can be distinguished by gel-based electrophoresis (but not CZE). HPLC can quantify normal and abnormal variants and can incorporate internal controls for the most common variants, and results can be compared with an available reference library of unusual variants (retention times for any given Hb can differ across HPLC platforms, so one must refer to each manufacturer's specific documentation for Hb identification).
        </p>
        <p>
         In HPLC, Hbs are adsorbed to a negatively charged resin column (stationary phase) and then eluted from the column by a positively charged solution that is added in increasing concentration and competes for binding to the negatively charged resin. Hbs are thus differentially eluted at a rate related to their affinity for the column and detected by a photometer. The resulting elution patterns (Hb peaks) are graphically represented in defined "windows" based on their relative time to appearance in the eluate (retention time). Retention times for different Hb fractions differ based on the HPLC equipment and software that is used; one should consult the manufacturer's specific reference for each instrument to identify Hb fractions based on retention times. The size of the Hb fractions can be quantified by computing the area under the curve for each peak.

         HPLC is a preferred method to identify beta thalassemia because it accurately quantifies Hb A

         and Hb F. HPLC is also suitable for population screening for hemoglobinopathies because it can be greatly automated. An example is prenatal screening for hemoglobinopathies (as performed in the United Kingdom) or primary newborn screening, especially in populations with high frequencies of beta thalassemia or alpha thalassemia. HPLC is suitable for beta thalassemia carrier detection because it can easily quantify Hb A
         <sub>
          2

         and Hb F. HPLC is also effective for settings in which quantification is important, such as assessing Hb S and Hb F percentages in individuals receiving transfusion or

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Disadvantages of HPLC include overlap (poor resolution; very similar or identical retention times) of some Hbs. As an example, Hb E, Hb Korle-Bu, and Hb Lepore may all overlap with Hb A
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         , so accurate quantification of each fraction cannot be performed. Hb A

          2
         </sub>
         may also be falsely elevated in the presence of Hb S (due to post-translational Hb adducts). Separation of Hbs varies somewhat between instruments, reagents, and programs used for HPLC. The presence of glycosylated or acetylated Hbs and artifacts may yield complex patterns, and interpretation should be performed by experienced laboratory personnel.
        </p>
        <p>
         Rather than separation of intact Hb tetramers, cation-exchange HPLC (and the electrophoretic techniques discussed in the next section) resolve or separate different Hbs as dimers (alpha:beta and alpha:gamma dimers). To individually resolve alpha, beta, gamma, and other globin monomers, reverse-phase HPLC can be used. This is referred to as globin chain separation. Globin chain separation may be useful in the investigation of certain non-deletional forms of HPFH (to determine the relative abundance of the Gγ globin and Aγ globin chains). (See

         Capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) can also be used as a first-line testing for hemoglobinopathies, for primary newborn screening, or as a complementary method to detect and quantify abnormal Hbs and to resolve ambiguous results from another protein-based method. CZE can be performed on red blood cell (RBC) hemolysates from dried blood spots, cord blood, or whole blood samples, making it potentially useful for newborn screening. CZE is comparable to HPLC in its resolution, ability to quantify low-abundance Hbs, ability to be automated, and speed (multiple samples can be run together with an eight-minute run time). CZE lacks interference from most posttranslationally modified (eg, glycated) globin chains. CZE is also a preferred method to identify beta thalassemia because it accurately quantifies Hb A

         CZE is a type of electrophoresis that uses a liquid buffer rather than a gel to separate and quantify normal and abnormal Hbs. Hb variants are separated by electro-osmotic flow using negatively charged silica capillaries and a high voltage current. The resulting tracing is divided into 15 zones in which normal and variant Hbs are displayed as peaks, which can be quantified  (

         IEF is an electrophoretic technique for separating Hbs based on their net charge within a pH gradient on a gel medium (eg, polyacrylamide, thin-layer agarose). Hbs migrate through a pH gradient to a point at which their net charge is zero (ie, isoelectric point [pI])  (

         Disadvantages of IEF are that it cannot be used to distinguish Hb E from Hb C-Harlem or Hb O-Arab, and it cannot distinguish Hb G-Philadelphia from Hb Lepore.

         Electrophoresis is the classical method used to separate Hb proteins based on their net charge. An electric field is applied to a gel medium at a specific pH. The gel can be run at alkaline pH (cellulose acetate) or acidic pH (citrate agar). At alkaline pH, Hbs with a greater net negative charge will migrate more rapidly towards the positively charged anode of an electrical field  (

         Mass spectrometry (MS) is also being investigated or used for the diagnosis or newborn screening of hemoglobinopathies. There are a number of MS techniques, all of which can be used to infer the peptide sequences (normal and variant) of globin chains of interest. This allows even the identification of "silent" variants that cannot be resolved or discriminated by HPLC and CZE. The proportion (relative abundance) of different globin chains can also be assessed to infer the presence of some thalassemic mutations. Considerable expertise and sometimes custom-built equipment are required.

         Genetic testing is not a single entity. There are different genetic testing methods, each with specific strengths and limitations. For all the genetic techniques, it is necessary for the clinician to understand the methods that are used to properly interpret the results. For hemoglobinopathies, sequencing alone may be inadequate, and copy number variation analysis is often necessary. For example, sequence analysis done by itself will not detect large deletions (eg, hemizygosity for the Hb S mutation, as in Hb S/gene-deletion-HPFH, will appear by sequence analysis to be homozygosity for the Hb S mutation, although these two conditions are vastly different, and their distinction has important implications for genetic counseling and other aspects of management). Moreover, analysis of both alpha and beta globin loci (both sequence analysis and copy number variation analysis of both loci) is often necessary to explain or predict the phenotype. It may not be apparent a priori which patients "require" genetic testing (and/or which type of genetic testing), arguing for comprehensive genetic testing for all patients with suspected hemoglobinopathies.

         Rather than the globin protein's amino acid composition, DNA testing (also referred to as genotyping or molecular genetic testing) determines the nucleotide sequence of one or more globin genes as well as the presence of copy number variations (eg, deletions, duplications) and complex rearrangements. These tests analyze the DNA in white blood cells (WBCs), which carry all of the individual's germline DNA sequence, rather than red blood cells (RBCs), which are anucleate. There are a number of available methods, and it is possible to analyze one gene or multiple genes at a time, depending on the method and equipment used  (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         DNA-based methods are rarely used as a screening test for a hemoglobinopathy, although the role of first-line DNA testing is evolving. Incorporating DNA testing into routine use as a second-tier testing method is becoming the standard of care. Molecular methods are especially useful for confirming clinically significant disease in patients with suspected thalassemia, and in the setting of prenatal and newborn screening. Potential advantages of DNA testing in newborns includes the ability to identify defects in globin chains before these chains are expressed (eg, identification of beta globin defects during early infancy, when the predominant beta-like chain has not yet shifted from gamma globin to beta globin)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109086" href="/z/d/graphic/109086.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). By contrast, diagnosis using protein-based methods may require waiting until the infant is three months of age or older and producing predominantly adult Hbs. Earlier identification of thalassemia in these settings offers the possibility of early diagnosis, genetic counseling, and early institution of appropriate treatment. DNA-based analysis has shown clinical utility as a component of newborn screening for sickle cell disease (SCD) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Other advantages of DNA-based testing include rapid turnaround time (hours) for some methods, high reliability, potential for automation, continually decreasing costs, and ongoing protocol improvements. In addition, introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) techniques may allow broader screening for multiple hemoglobinopathies simultaneously. (See

         The choice of DNA testing method depends on the type of variant suspected. Traditional (Sanger) sequencing and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are used to detect point mutations and to evaluate breakpoint mutations when a deletion has been identified. Gap-PCR, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) are used to detect copy number variations such as deletions, duplications, and fusion genes.
        </p>
        <p>
         All of the DNA-based methods can be performed on DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes. For prenatal diagnosis, amniotic fluid cells or chorionic villus samples can be used. The DNA is typically amplified by PCR (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2896.html" rel="external">
          "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)"
         </a>
         ) and then genotyped for a definitive diagnosis. Use of these methods on cell-free fetal DNA in the maternal circulation for hemoglobinopathy diagnosis remains investigational. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/458.html" rel="external">
          "Prenatal screening for common aneuploidies using cell-free DNA"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         There are some general limitations to DNA-based testing, which depend on the specific testing method used. As examples, certain sequencing and PCR methods may fail to identify large gene deletions due to absent (deleted) primer annealing sites. This can be circumvented by performing initial testing at the protein level (CZE, HPLC, or IEF) or by using DNA-based methods specifically designed to identify large deletions (see
         <a class="local">
          'Gap-PCR and MLPA'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">
          'Array CGH'
         </a>
         below). Primer annealing sites may also be polymorphic, which may lead to failure of amplification. If this is suspected, alternative primer pairs can be used. Another disadvantage of DNA-based methods is the cost of equipment and reagents, which remain significantly higher than for most of the protein-based techniques.

         DNA sequencing determines the nucleotide sequence of a gene or genes. Traditional (Sanger) sequencing is the gold standard for DNA sequencing. It is often used when a specific type of globin gene defect (eg, alpha or beta thalassemia variant) is suspected based on preliminary testing or family history, in which case it can be targeted to one or more of the affected globin genes, as shown in the figure  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75837" href="/z/d/graphic/75837.html" rel="external">
          figure 11
         </a>
         ). However, the phenotype of thalassemias in particular and hemoglobinopathies in general is determined by the interaction of both the alpha globin and beta globin gene clusters, so a correct, definitive diagnosis often requires testing of both loci.
        </p>
        <p>
         Allele-specific assays can be used to target the presence or absence of a specific allele. Allele-specific PCR employs a set of manufactured oligonucleotide primers that hybridize to and specifically amplify sequences of DNA containing the target alleles of interest (eg, Hb A, Hb S, Hb C, Hb D, Hb E and Hb O-Arab). Analysis of the PCR products generated can be done by electrophoresis based on the length of the fragments generated. Alternatively, restriction enzymes can be used to cut DNA at specified sequences that are present only in certain variants, followed by electrophoresis for the restriction enzyme products; this is referred to as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sanger sequencing can also be used to scan for a spectrum of point mutations causing the most common Hb variants and beta thalassemia genotypes using an automated 96-well format in which overlapping PCR fragments and universal tagged primers are employed. Such screening techniques only detect the subset of Hb mutations for which they are designed, so negative or normal results should be interpreted with caution.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sanger sequencing can be used to determine the full coding sequence (and noncoding/regulatory sequences of interest) of any of the globin genes. Therefore, this method can be used to identify definitively any hemoglobinopathy caused by a sequence variant (point mutation) or a small insertion/deletion. It is important to consider simultaneous copy number variation (deletion/duplication) analysis because of the high frequency of large deletions, duplications, and other rearrangements as a cause of hemoglobinopathies.

         Gap-polymerase chain reaction (gap-PCR) techniques are used to test for large deletions in the alpha globin or beta globin genes that cannot be detected by DNA sequencing (because one or both primer-annealing sites are deleted). This method is particularly useful for detection of common alpha thalassemia deletions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Gap-PCR is a variation of PCR, but unlike PCR used for gene sequencing, gap-PCR is used to identify deletion breakpoints. This is done with PCR primers that flank a known deletion breakpoint rather than a normal gene sequence. Thus, the primers will only generate a product if the patient's DNA contains the unique sequence characteristic of that gene deletion. The most common example is alpha thalassemia, for which primers specific for the most common deletions can be combined; an example is shown in the figure  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55893" href="/z/d/graphic/55893.html" rel="external">
          figure 12
         </a>
         ). Gap-PCR is also routinely used to detect deletions in the delta and beta globin genes that result in a delta/beta hybrid variant known as Hb Lepore (see
         <a class="local">
          'Types of abnormalities'
         </a>
         above), as well as globin gene deletions causing HPFH and alpha globin gene duplications. Products of gap-PCR are analyzed by gel electrophoresis and compared with known positive control samples; the presence of the abnormal band on the gel is indicative that the individual carries the particular deletion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Gap-PCR is not as useful for evaluating unusual or uncharacterized thalassemia deletions, because it will only detect deletions for which the breakpoints are known.

         Gap-PCR will not detect alpha gene triplication (and higher-order copy number gains), which can have a major impact on clinical phenotype (beta thalassemia heterozygotes with alpha triplication may have clinically significant anemia).
        </p>
        <p>
         Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) is increasingly used to detect large deletions and duplications within the globin genes, similar to the indications for gap-PCR. However, unlike gap-PCR, which can only identify deletions for which breakpoints are known, MLPA can also identify deletions with unknown breakpoints, especially large deletions in the alpha or beta globin genes. MLPA is a variation of PCR in which a pair of ligated probes rather than the target gene sequences are amplified by PCR. A pair of probes will only be amplified when they hybridize close enough together on the target gene in the patient's DNA to be ligated by DNA ligase, and they will only hybridize close together on the target gene when the full gene sequence is present. Thus, failure to generate a PCR product indicates deletion of a region of DNA in that part of the gene. Further, the relative amounts of the PCR products can be used to determine whether the deletion is homozygous (absence of the product) or heterozygous (50 percent reduction in the amount of the product). Copy number gains can be identified similarly.
        </p>
        <p>
         While MLPA is a useful tool to screen for deletions, it does not define the exact deletion breakpoints; if necessary, determination by traditional sequencing or NGS is required. Identification of the exact deletion breakpoints may be helpful in predicting phenotype and determining if the patient has a deletion that arose de novo and/or was not previously described.

         Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH; also known as fine tiling array) is another molecular approach to confirming thalassemia defects comprehensively across the alpha and beta globin genes. Besides point mutations and small deletions, aCGH also detects copy number variations (CNVs), inversions, insertions, deletions, and other complex rearrangements, most of which are not detected by standard DNA sequencing.
        </p>
        <p>
         aCGH is primarily used to characterize a deletion that has been detected by MLPA, such as when MLPA identifies that a deletion is present in an alpha or beta globin gene but does not allow determination of the exact breakpoint. In this setting, aCGH may be less time-consuming and cumbersome than gap-PCR to characterize deletions and duplications caused by recombination (eg, delta-beta thalassemias).
        </p>
        <p>
         In aCGH, the patient's genomic DNA is hybridized to a microarray containing tens to hundreds of thousand overlapping oligonucleotide probes, each approximately 60 to 80 nucleotides in length. Custom, high resolution tiling arrays are available for thalassemia diagnosis in which the collection of probes represents the majority of the DNA sequence in the complete alpha and beta globin gene clusters as well as the neighboring regions. Thus, aCGH can identify any areas of either gene, including coding regions and regulatory regions (such as introns) that are present in normal levels, reduced levels, excess levels, or completely absent.
        </p>
        <p>
         The major disadvantages of aCGH include cost, need for trained personnel, and longer turnaround time.

A small amount of blood, most commonly obtained as a finger (or heel) stick sample, is processed on a piece of cellulose paper in alkaline buffer housed within a micro-engineered plastic chip, wherein cellulose acetate electrophoresis is performed using a battery-powered electric field to separate Hbs  (

The results of this assay are reported as the partial pressure of oxygen at which Hb is 50 percent saturated with oxygen (the p50). A low p50 indicates increased oxygen affinity. A high p50 indicates decreased oxygen affinity. This test can aid in the diagnosis of inherited conditions that affect Hb oxygen affinity (eg, hemoglobinopathies and other intrinsic RBC abnormalities), which may present with anemia, polycythemia, or cyanosis.

         Heinz bodies are Hb precipitates inside the RBC that form when Hb denatures and heme dissociates from the heme pocket and binds elsewhere in the partially denatured globin chains (hemichrome formation).

         Hb H is an insoluble tetramer of beta globin chains that precipitates inside the RBC when there are insufficient alpha globin chains with which to pair. Hb H is produced in individuals with alpha thalassemia. Hb H can be visualized by staining with new

         (a chemical dye related to methylene blue) or brilliant cresyl blue as a type of RBC inclusion. Hb H staining is nonspecific, as other protein or nucleic acid precipitates (including Hb Barts, a tetramer of gamma globin chains) are also stained. The presence of typical inclusions provides supportive evidence for a presumptive diagnosis of Hb H disease. The absence of Hb H inclusions does not eliminate the possibility of alpha thalassemia trait. Hb H staining may also be useful for identification of the Alpha Thalassemia X-linked Intellectual Disability (ATR-X) syndrome, caused by pathogenic variants in the

         The sickle cell prep is a method for detecting Hb S-containing RBCs that involves treating a blood sample with a reducing agent such as sodium metabisulfite or dithionite; these agents reduce the oxygen tension in the sample and promote sickling, which is then examined visually. It does not distinguish sickle cell trait from disease. This method is not recommended for clinical use and is generally of historical interest. There are a few exceptions:

         The sickle cell solubility test can be useful to detect sickling variants that are caused by a second mutation in addition to the Hb S mutation (on the same allele) but show a different pattern from that of Hb S on electrophoresis and HPLC.

         Other individuals may have a known variant or thalassemia in combination with an unknown or uncharacterized variant (eg, a patient may be heterozygous for a sickle Hb mutation plus another variant or mutation that cannot be further characterized by initial testing methods) [

         Other important information to be incorporated into the diagnostic evaluation includes results of the complete blood count (CBC), reticulocyte count, and red blood cell (RBC) morphology, as well as geographic ancestry and the results of testing of first-degree relatives (eg, parents, siblings).

         Results of hemoglobinopathy testing should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical picture. Additional information, including transfusion history, geographic ancestry, and relevant hematologic studies are extremely helpful in guiding the approach to laboratory diagnostic testing. (See

         Recent blood transfusion may interfere with the interpretation of hemoglobin analysis using protein-based methods. In this setting, the options are to wait until &gt;3 months have elapsed since the last transfusion, or to use molecular genetic (DNA-based) methods, which are unaffected by recent transfusion. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Molecular genetic (DNA-based) methods'

         An initial abnormal test result suggestive of thalassemia or Hb variant is typically confirmed using an alternative method, especially when the initial testing method is protein-based (eg, high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC], isoelectric focusing [IEF], capillary zone electrophoresis [CZE]). A common practice is to use HPLC for newborn screening followed by IEF for confirmation, or vice versa (see
         <a class="local">
          'Available testing methods'
         </a>
         above). Confirmation by a separate technique is likely to clarify ambiguous results and guide the decision regarding whether further evaluation using molecular testing methods is required for definitive diagnosis, especially in the thalassemias. This practice of using a separate confirmatory test is also important when the variant is uncommon or its clinical significance is unclear.

         Co-inherited alpha thalassemia may alter the proportion of variant Hbs, which may make interpretation more challenging. As a general rule, concomitant alpha thalassemia reduces the levels of abnormal beta globins such as Hb S, Hb C, and increases levels of abnormal alpha globins.

         Concomitant iron deficiency may alter the findings on the blood smear as well as the ratios of normal Hbs. In adults being evaluated for thalassemia, it is usually appropriate to perform iron studies to aid in the interpretation of protein-based hemoglobinopathy testing. An exception may be an individual being evaluated for thalassemia trait who has a relatively normal CBC.

         In the United States and many other high-resource countries, newborns are routinely screened for hemoglobinopathies from a blood spot specimen obtained by heel puncture, often using HPLC. Hb S is one of the most commonly detected findings from the screening. In some populations, thalassemias are more prevalent. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4980.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         HPLC is particularly useful in the newborn period for diagnosing Hb H disease. Normally, the major Hb in the newborn is Hb F (a tetramer of two alpha and two gamma chains [α2γ2]). In Hb H disease, there is marked deficiency of alpha globin chain production, and the excess gamma globin chains form a tetramer known as Hb Barts. Elevated levels of Hb Barts (eg, &gt;25 percent) within 12 to 48 hours after birth is the hallmark of Hb H disease in the newborn. The threshold for detection is based on validation data from a reference population; this may differ by region depending on which mutations are common in the population [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. The timing is also important because Hb Barts levels fall rapidly after birth. Newborn screening programs may also detect some cases of alpha thalassemia trait by identifying low levels of Hb Barts.
        </p>
        <p>
         All abnormal newborn screening results require confirmatory testing on a second sample, regardless of the initial screening test used and the clinical findings. For patterns consistent with SCD and beta thalassemia (Hb S or Hb F-only pattern, respectively), this may involve a second protein-based test. A complementary method is used to ensure that no methodologic or clerical errors were made. Molecular testing is required to make a definitive diagnosis in newborns with suspected alpha thalassemia, suspected coinheritance of two beta thalassemia mutations, or suspected Hb E in combination with a beta thalassemia mutation. Some infants are retested after several months, especially those born prematurely who have very low levels of Hb A or only Hb F (see
         <a class="local">
          'Normal hemoglobins'
         </a>
         above) or infants who receive a blood transfusion prior to collection of the initial newborn screening specimen. Alternatively, DNA-based methods may be used at any age. DNA-based testing has been demonstrated to be useful as a component of newborn screening for SCD [

         Patients may be suspected of having thalassemia based on a known family history, results of prenatal testing, symptoms of anemia, or characteristic findings on the CBC (eg, microcytic anemia high RBC count, low reticulocyte count) and blood smear (varying degrees of microcytosis, target cells, and other bizarre forms depending on disease severity)  (

        </p>
        <p>
         The major differential diagnosis in individuals with suspected thalassemia is iron deficiency anemia; both conditions cause microcytic anemia. Iron deficiency can also affect (lower) the Hb A
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         level, potentially making diagnosis of thalassemia more challenging [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24-26
         </a>
         ]. Thus, testing for iron deficiency is often indicated. In some cases, testing for iron deficiency (and, if needed, treatment) precedes testing for thalassemia; this would be the case for an adult with microcytic anemia and possible blood loss. In other cases, testing for iron deficiency is performed concurrently with testing for thalassemia trait. This would be the case for an individual in whom prenatal testing demonstrates microcytic anemia. Various calculations that take into account the RBC indices and RBC count have been used to predict the likelihood of thalassemia trait versus iron deficiency (eg, ratio of mean corpuscular volume [MCV] to RBC count [Mentzer index]), although none of these is diagnostically robust for an individual patient [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27-31
         </a>
         ]. In practice, it may be easier and more cost-effective to test for iron deficiency and thalassemia trait simultaneously. (See

Thus, a combination of methods to detect deletions and sequence variants is critical. Gap-polymerase chain reaction (gap-PCR) can detect approximately 80 percent of alpha thalassemia deletions; alternatively, multiplex ligation-dependent amplification (MLPA) can be used instead. (See

         – Human hemoglobins (Hbs) are tetrameric proteins composed of two pairs of globin chains  (

         ). Hemoglobinopathies include a heterogeneous mixture of conditions caused by genetic alterations that affect one or more of the alpha-like (α-like) globin chains, the beta-like (β-like) globin chains, or some combination of these. They can be broadly classified into structural hemoglobin variants (qualitative defects), and thalassemias (quantitative defects). (See

          Testing methods
         </strong>
         – Protein-based methods remain the method of choice for initial qualitative and quantitative Hb analyses. Routinely used techniques include high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC; also called high performance liquid chromatography), capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), isoelectric focusing (IEF), and gel electrophoresis. Molecular genetic (DNA-based) methods listed above are not commonly used as a first-line or screening test for a hemoglobinopathy, although this role is evolving and entering standard comprehensive diagnostic practice. Advantages and disadvantages of the various methods are listed in the table  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). Several innovative, protein-based point-of-care tests are under development that can be used directly at the place and time of patient evaluation, particularly in limited-resource settings without access to a specialized clinical laboratory  (

          Settings in which testing is appropriate
         </strong>
         – Hb testing may be used for general population screening (eg, prenatal testing, newborn screening) as well as diagnostic evaluation for a suspected clinical condition. The appropriate testing strategy depends on the indication for testing (population screening versus clinical diagnostic evaluation), the type of hemoglobinopathy being investigated, the associated clinical findings, and the available resources. The diagnostic evaluation also incorporates review of the peripheral blood smear, results of the complete blood count (CBC), reticulocyte count, and red blood cell (RBC) morphology, as well as racial/ethnic background and the results of testing of first-degree relatives. (See

          Approach to choosing a test
         </strong>
         – Common approaches to newborn screening and the laboratory evaluation of suspected sickle cell disease (SCD), suspected thalassemia, and unknown hemoglobin variants are described above. Typical Hb patterns in these conditions are listed in the table  (

         <strong>
          Advanced testing
         </strong>
         – Analysis by a reference laboratory is generally indicated if an abnormality cannot be characterized using routine testing, or if an abnormal hemoglobin is suspected on clinical grounds but cannot be detected by routine methods (eg, Heinz body hemolytic anemia, unexplained erythrocytosis, unexplained cyanosis, or unexplained anemia for which other testing is unrevealing), or when the phenotype of the disease differs from the results of first-line clinical testing. Contact information for reference laboratories in the United States is listed above. (See
