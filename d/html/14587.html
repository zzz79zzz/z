         Tricuspid valve (TV) atresia is a cyanotic congenital heart lesion that is characterized by congenital agenesis or absence of the TV, resulting in

         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. If untreated, TV atresia has a high mortality rate, with a survival rate as low as 10 percent at one year of age, depending on the type of TV atresia and the presence of other cardiac lesions [

         Although all of the variants are hemodynamically similar, it is important to distinguish the valvular and Ebstein subtypes from the others because of differing surgical approaches. In patients with the Ebstein and valvular subtypes, the surgical approach entails excision of the malformed valve and prosthetic valve replacement, whereas in the other variants, surgical management consists of palliative interventions including the Fontan procedure.

          8

         <a href="#rid8">
          8,13

         ]. Subdivision within the first two categories is based on pulmonary blood flow, and the presence and size of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) is also used to categorize subtypes. Surgical management is generally based on the anatomy of the great arteries  (

         The pathogenesis of TV atresia is unknown. It is thought that most cases of TV atresia (muscular, membranous, and valvular subtypes) are derived from a similar disruption of normal development of the atrioventricular valves from the endocardial cushions and delamination of the ventricular myocardium.

         In TV atresia, the only exit of blood from the right atrium is through an interatrial communication. This obligate right-to-left atrial shunting is necessary for survival as it allows deoxygenated systemic venous blood to enter the left atrium and subsequently, the left ventricle (LV). As a result of the mixing of systemic and pulmonary venous blood in the left atrium, some level of cyanosis is always present  (

         Pulmonary blood flow in patients with TV atresia depends on the anatomy of the great arteries and the presence and size of a ventricular septal defect (VSD)  (

         In patients with a VSD (subtypes Ib and Ic), the left-to-right flow of blood from the LV to RV across the VSD is the source of pulmonary blood flow. The size of the VSD and the degree of pulmonary stenosis dictate the amount of pulmonary blood flow, which in turn can manifest as pulmonary overcirculation (excessive pulmonary blood flow) or cyanosis (restrictive pulmonary blood flow). In some patients with restricted blood flow, a PDA is critical for survival. Systemic blood flow is derived directly from the LV.

         In patients with type II TV atresia with transposed great arteries, pulmonary blood flow is derived directly from the LV and systemic blood flow from the RV. In these patients, a VSD is critical as the RV, which provides the systemic circulation through the aorta, is dependent on blood flowing from the LV through the VSD. The presence of a restrictive or closing VSD and/or RV infundibular narrowing results in obstruction of systemic blood flow. If the obstruction is critical (severe), this results in diminished systemic circulation, leading to hypotension and, possibly, cardiogenic shock. In these patients, a PDA is critical for survival.

         Advances in ultrasound technology have enabled antenatal screening between 18 and 22 weeks gestation to accurately make the diagnosis of TV atresia  (

         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. TV atresia is compatible with fetal survival, but there are significant changes in fetal heart circulation. In the normal fetal heart, the right ventricle (RV) is the dominant ventricle, with distribution of approximately 65 percent of the combined cardiac output, whereas the left ventricle (LV) distributes 35 percent of the output, which has entered the left atrium through the foramen ovale  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66765" href="/z/d/graphic/66765.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). The blood flow in the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is normally right-to-left from the RV to the descending aorta. In contrast, in fetuses with TV atresia, the LV assumes a dominant role as all of the systemic venous return crosses the foramen ovale from the right atrium to left atrium and, subsequently, the LV  (

          figure 3
         </a>
         ). The presence of reverse (left-to-right flow) blood flow in the PDA suggests inadequate pulmonary outflow, which in turn indicates the need for postnatal initiation of prostaglandin therapy to maintain ductal patency required for adequate pulmonary blood flow and for survival. (See

          Transposition of the great vessels
         </strong>
         – In patients with D-transposition of the great arteries (type II), the aorta arises from the hypoplastic RV. Since there is mixing of systemic and pulmonary circulations through an atrial level communication, postnatal circulation is similar to fetal circulation. As a result, patients present with cyanosis or decreased oxygen saturation. These patients may develop symptoms of pulmonary overcirculation (eg, tachypnea, increased work of breathing). However, in patients with aortic arch hypoplasia, coarctation may develop as the PDA closes because of constriction of ductal tissue in the affected region of the aorta. As a result, maintenance of ductal patency may be required to preserve flow into the aorta.

Additional evaluation by fetal echocardiography should include assessment of the ventricular septum, relationship of the great arteries, status of pulmonary outflow, direction of flow in the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), patency of the atrial level communication, and assessment for presence of fetal hydrops. As noted above, the presence of reverse flow (left-to-right flow) in the ductus arteriosus suggests inadequate pulmonary outflow, which in turn indicates the need for postnatal initiation of prostaglandin infusion to maintain a PDA for adequate pulmonary blood flow and for survival.

         Echocardiography should also assess the location and relationship of the great arteries, the presence and size of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) including the degree of left-to-right shunting, the presence of pulmonary outflow obstruction, and the atrial level communication to rule out restriction to systemic and pulmonary venous mixing. In the presence of D-transposition of the great arteries (type II), the aortic arch must be assessed by two-dimensional and color Doppler imaging to determine whether there is coarctation of the aorta.

         Neonates with TV atresia should be cared for at a tertiary medical center with experience in managing complex congenital heart disease. When an antenatal diagnosis is made, maternal transfer should be performed so that neonatal care can be given immediately after birth.

         The goal of staged single-ventricular palliation is to ensure adequate pulmonary and systemic blood flow with eventual separation of the two circulatory systems. As is true for most univentricular conditions (eg, hypoplastic left heart syndrome), the surgical management of TV atresia consists of three staged palliative procedures. (See

         The first stage of surgery is performed in the neonatal period. The goals of the initial palliation are to ensure that blood exiting the right atrium is unimpeded, provides adequate pulmonary blood flow, protects the pulmonary artery bed from high pressures that could result in higher risk for subsequent operations, and ensures unobstructed flow from the left ventricle (LV) to the aorta. The choice of initial palliative intervention depends on the anatomic variant  (

         Diminished pulmonary blood flow (types Ia and Ib) – With diminished pulmonary blood flow, the initial intervention soon after birth aims to restore a reliable source of pulmonary blood flow. This can be achieved through placement of a stent in the ductus arteriosus or with a modified Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt (also commonly called the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt [mBTS]). The mBTS uses a synthetic graft (typically a 3.5-mm Gore-Tex tube) to connect the innominate artery to the pulmonary artery  (

         Unobstructed pulmonary blood flow (type Ic) – If pulmonary blood flow is unobstructed, a pulmonary artery band may be placed in early infancy to restrict the amount of pulmonary blood flow and protect the pulmonary bed from high systemic pressures. Some infants who have unobstructed pulmonary flow through a ventricular septal defect (VSD) at birth may not require pulmonary artery banding, since the vast majority of VSDs decrease in size over time and restrict pulmonary blood flow. Pulmonary artery banding is generally restricted to patients who are symptomatic despite maximal medical therapy for pulmonary congestion/heart failure. Furthermore, a pulmonary artery band may stimulate ventricular hypertrophy that may more rapidly reduce the size of the VSD.

         After the initial stage of palliation, the infant should be followed with close cardiac monitoring for signs of progressive cyanosis or congestive heart failure if necessary. Prior to stage II and stage III, a comprehensive evaluation including echocardiography and cardiac catheterization is undertaken to evaluate for hemodynamic and anatomic suitability. Interventions to address any residual anatomic lesions such as branch pulmonary artery stenosis, aortic coarctation, and coiling aortopulmonary collaterals can be undertaken during these catheterizations. Interstage management is discussed in greater detail separately. (See

         The second palliative procedure for both type I and type II lesions is a cavopulmonary anastomosis (bidirectional Glenn procedure). This stage of palliation is typically performed at three to six months of life when infants experience progressive cyanosis as they begin to outgrow their neonatal shunt. This surgery involves removal of the original shunt and direct anastomosis of the superior vena cava to the right pulmonary artery. The Glenn procedure relies on passive venous drainage from the superior vena cava directly into the pulmonary artery. However, there is persistent systemic desaturation due to continued inferior vena cava flow into the right atrium. Surgical mortality following a traditional bidirectional Glenn procedure is low (between 1 and 2 percent). Outcomes following the bidirectional Glenn procedure in patients with single-ventricle physiology are discussed in greater detail separately. (See

         </span>
         The third stage (the Fontan procedure) creates a venous pathway (total cavopulmonary connection) that directs the inferior vena caval flow into the pulmonary arteries, resulting in the entire systemic venous return flowing passively into the pulmonary arteries  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95320" href="/z/d/graphic/95320.html" rel="external">
          figure 5

         ). This creates a system with a single ventricle pumping blood into separate, in-series systemic and pulmonary circulations, thereby relieving cyanosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Several variants of the Fontan procedure have been used in the final stage of palliation for TV atresia  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95320" href="/z/d/graphic/95320.html" rel="external">
          figure 5
         </a>
         ). In the classic atriopulmonary Fontan connection, the right atrium is directly anastomosed to the pulmonary arteries [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,27
         </a>
         ]. Subsequent modifications include the use of a lateral tunnel or an extracardiac conduit [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. As a result of the Fontan procedure, the blood returning to the common (left) atrium is fully oxygenated and the single LV serves as the systemic pump (in contrast to hypoplastic left heart syndrome, in which the right ventricle [RV] is the systemic ventricle). Timing of surgery is variable but is usually at two to five years of age when there is progressive cyanosis due to increased physical activity. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116293.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Long-term complications associated with the classic right atrium to pulmonary artery anastomosis include right atrial enlargement, refractory atrial arrhythmias, poor exercise capacity, failing ventricular function, and protein-losing enteropathy [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>

          29-31

          Anatomy and pathophysiology
         </strong>
         – Tricuspid valve (TV) atresia is characterized by congenital agenesis or absence of the TV with no direct communication between the right atrium and ventricle. There is a spectrum of anatomic variants based on the morphology of the atresia and the presence of other cardiac structural lesions (eg, ventricular septal defect [VSD] and abnormal anatomy of the great arteries). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Anatomy'

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In all forms of TV atresia, the only exit of blood from the right atrium is through an interatrial communication. This obligate right-to-left atrial shunting is necessary for survival. In some patients, ductal patency may be required to maintain adequate pulmonary blood flow. (See

          Prevalence
         </strong>
         – TV atresia is the third most common cyanotic heart condition, with an estimated prevalence of 0.5 to 1.2 per 10,000 live births. (See

         <strong>
          Clinical presentation
         </strong>
         – Patients can present prenatally as routine antenatal screening with echocardiography can accurately make the diagnosis of TV atresia in fetuses  (

          Diagnosis
         </strong>

          Management
         </strong>
         – Neonates with TV atresia should be managed at a center with experience in managing complex congenital heart disease. When an antenatal diagnosis is made, delivery should be planned at a facility with a level III neonatal intensive care unit and pediatric cardiology expertise. If this is not feasible, transport arrangements should be established in advance of delivery. (See
