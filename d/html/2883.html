         Lasers are devices that emit a single, coherent wavelength of electromagnetic radiation that is used to cut, coagulate, or ablate tissue for a variety of clinical applications. Laser systems produce a variety of wavelengths of varying pulse duration and energy levels. Computer-based imaging and guidance systems allow procedures to be performed precisely, quickly, and with greater control. Although lasers are commonly used superficially for cutaneous and ocular applications, smaller, efficient laser delivery systems are available for minimally invasive applications, including endoscopy, bronchoscopy, laparoscopy, and endovenous ablation.
        </p>
        <p>
         The safe and appropriate use of lasers requires a trained clinician with a working knowledge of laser delivery systems and laser-tissue interactions to achieve the desired clinical effect while minimizing complications.
        </p>
        <p>
         The basic principles of medical lasers will be reviewed here. The use and effectiveness of lasers for specific clinical indications are discussed in separate topic reviews. (See

         Light is electromagnetic radiation within the range of wavelength that is visible to the human eye. Medical lasers produce photons of electromagnetic energy that can be within, above, or below this range (

         Lasers are devices that rely upon the stimulated emission of radiation to produce a beam of light. The word laser is an acronym for

          r

         adiation. Lasers are comprised of an energy source, a resonant chamber, and an active medium (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67991" href="/z/d/graphic/67991.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         In the unexcited state, electrons orbit the nucleus at their lowest energy level or ground state, occupying orbits that are closer to the nucleus. However, absorption of energy causes the electrons to become excited, moving to a higher orbit (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61725" href="/z/d/graphic/61725.html" rel="external">
          figure 3
         </a>
         ). As the electrons return from the excited state back to ground state, they spontaneously emit photons of energy (electromagnetic radiation). In other words, they stimulate emission of radiation [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The radiation that is produced has unique properties, including monochromaticity, coherence, and collimation.
        </p>

          ●
         </span>
         Monochromatic means that all the photons in a laser beam are of the same wavelength. Thus, the laser beam achieves sufficient intensity to destroy tissue, the degree to which is based upon its wavelength and the scattering, reflection, and absorption coefficients of the target tissue. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Tissue ablation'
         </a>

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Coherence refers to the synchronization of the laser beam in time and space. The photons of the beam are in-phase or coherent. By comparison, the photons in conventional light travel randomly.

         </span>
         Collimation indicates that the elements of the laser beam are nearly parallel. Because there is little divergence, laser beams can be focused to a small area. This property differs from conventional light, which diverges substantially. Because of collimation, the energy emitted from a laser source can be captured and delivered through flexible optical fibers.

         The source of external energy, known as the pump source, used to excite the electrons can be electrical, optical, or chemical. In medical applications, the energy source is most commonly electrical (eg, electric current flowing through a laser medium) or optical (eg, from another laser). Chemical energy is often used in industrial applications. The pump power can be maintained continuously or switched on only for short intervals, which may help to limit the damaging thermal effects of the laser. (See

         The resonant chamber or cavity contains the active laser medium and reflective mirrors. Photons reflect back and forth between mirrors. Since one of the mirrors is highly reflective and the other is only partially reflective, some of the laser light that is produced is permitted to exit the device and is directed to the tissues. (See

         The active medium contains the atoms that produce the electromagnetic radiation. The type of active medium usually gives the laser its name and, for medical applications, includes gas, solid crystalline materials, semiconductor materials, and liquid dye solutions.

         Argon ion – Argon ion gas produces blue-green light at a wavelength of 488 to 514 nm (

         Excimer – The excimer laser uses an active medium composed of excited dimers, which are a combination of a noble gas (eg, argon, krypton, or xenon) and a reactive gas (eg, fluorine or chlorine). The excimer laser emits ultraviolet radiation with enough energy to break chemical bonds between molecules but with no to little thermal damage. The excimer laser is used to remove surface material with almost no heating, and these lasers are often referred to as "cool" lasers. A good example is laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis, otherwise known as LASIK.

         Solid-state lasers use an active medium that is a solid. Semiconductor-based lasers are also in the solid state but are generally considered as a separate class from solid-state lasers. (See
         <a class="local">

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Generally, the active medium of a solid-state laser consists of a glass or crystalline material (eg, sapphire, ruby) that is doped with neodymium, chromium, erbium, or other ions. Neodymium doped: yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) lasers are perhaps the most commonly used solid-state laser. The medium is a rod composed of neodymium ions and crystals of yttrium-aluminum-garnet. Nd:YAG lasers emit light at mid-infrared wavelengths (1320 nm, 1064 nm) with pulse durations in the millisecond range (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59189" href="/z/d/graphic/59189.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The longer wavelength of the Nd:YAG laser penetrates deeper into the tissue and can cause collateral thermal damage.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other solid-state lasers emitting radiation with millisecond pulse durations include the potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) and alexandrite lasers. KTP lasers emit green light at 532 nm corresponding to the second oxyhemoglobin peak and overlapping the absorption peak of melanin. Alexandrite lasers emit red light at a wavelength of 755 nm, which is absorbed by deoxygenated hemoglobin and melanin.

         Semiconductor lasers (ie, laser diode) use an active medium that is formed by doping a thin layer on the surface of a crystal wafer to form a p-n junction, which comprises a diode. Semiconductor lasers are injection laser diodes as compared with the optically pumped laser diodes (solid-state lasers) described above. Diode lasers emit light at wavelengths between 800 and 900 nm (

         Dye lasers have liquid active medium. A fluorescent organic dye in liquid solution is injected into a tube. Pulse dye lasers (PDLs) emit yellow light at 585 and 595 nm, which corresponds to the second oxyhemoglobin peak (

         The composition and design of the laser device produces a coherent beam of electromagnetic radiation as a result of the following sequence of events [

         Atoms within the resonant chamber absorb energy from the energy source. As atoms in high-energy states spontaneously return to ground state, they release energy, some of which is absorbed by other atoms, causing them to achieve a high energy state. This phenomenon is known as "pumping." As more and more atoms become excited and then return to ground state, more and more energy is produced (amplification of stimulated emission). Eventually, stimulated emission of radiation becomes the primary source of energy within the chamber and eventually produces population inversion, meaning that there are more atoms in a high-energy state than in a low-energy state within the resonant chamber. The energy reflects between the mirrors in the chamber and becomes coherent and collimated. But, since one mirror in the chamber is only partially reflective, some energy is allowed to escape as a bright, monochromatic, coherent beam of laser radiation.

         Continuous-wave lasers emit a continuous laser beam, provided the pump source is switched on by the operator. Examples of continuous-wave lasers include the argon, krypton, and some CO

         lasers. Long periods of continuous exposure to the laser beam or insufficient cooling time can lead to excessive tissue heating. Automated scanning devices have been developed to move the laser beam in predetermined patterns to minimize excessive exposure, but these are not always effective. As a result, continuous-wave lasers have been largely replaced by pulsed lasers.

         Pulsed lasers emit energy in the form of brief pulses rather than continuously. The power output of short-pulse lasers is in the megawatt-to-gigawatt range, heating the target so quickly that the tissue is disrupted mechanically by shockwaves. Long-pulse lasers produce peak powers in the kilowatt range, damaging collateral tissue minimally.

Nanosecond-pulse, high-energy laser beams are produced with Q-switched solid-state lasers, including ruby, alexandrite, and Nd:YAG lasers. Excimer lasers produce nanosecond ultraviolet laser energy.

         Quasi-continuous-wave operation refers to a mode for which the pump source is automatically switched on and off. The laser is optically in a state of continuous-wave operation. The interval of time over which the pump source is turned on, which may only be a small percentage of the total time, is short enough to decrease tissue heating and negative thermal effects but long enough to maintain the laser at a steady state. Quasi-continuous-wave lasers include the potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) lasers.

         Absorption of light is necessary for the laser to have any effect upon the tissue. Molecules that absorb light are called chromophores (the part of a molecule responsible for its color) and include melanin, oxyhemoglobin, bilirubin, and water (

         – Photochemical reactions occur following laser treatment of tissue after injection of a photosensitizer of a specific wavelength. Although the photosensitizer is absorbed by other cells in the body, it is preferentially absorbed by malignant cells that maintain levels of the photosensitizer after the agent has left normal cells. Exposure of the tissue to the photosensitizer wavelength selectively destroys the malignant cells through chemical reactions (usually production of oxygen radicals) or activation of the immune system. Photosensitizers can also be applied to the surface of tissues to achieve a photochemical effect, such as in dental bleaching [

         When laser energy strikes the tissue surface, energy can be absorbed, reflected, transmitted, or scattered. The effect of the interaction between the laser and tissue depends upon the active medium, wavelength, power density, properties of the target tissue, and duration of tissue exposure [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Wavelength and pulse duration are the most important laser parameters that govern the effects of laser light on the tissue. Fluence, power, and spot size are additional laser settings that influence clinical effectiveness. With optimal laser settings, laser energy can be directed precisely to a target chromophore, avoiding damage to healthy tissue.

         <strong>
          Wavelength
         </strong>
         – The wavelength of the laser beam determines the degree of tissue penetration, absorbed energy, and scattered energy. Longer wavelengths penetrate more deeply (near infrared&gt;red&gt;yellow&gt;green&gt;blue&gt;ultraviolet) (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70045" href="/z/d/graphic/70045.html" rel="external">
          figure 6
         </a>
         ). Scattering is the laser energy that is directed away from the original laser target. Light scattering decreases with increasing wavelength. A laser with a low scattering coefficient makes an excellent scalpel because the laser energy is absorbed in a confined area. By comparison, a laser with a high scattering coefficient may result in good photocoagulation. The laser wavelength should be chosen to be near the maximum absorption of the target chromophore, long enough to penetrate to the depth of the target and away from the target range of competing chromophores.

         <strong>
          Pulse duration
         </strong>
         – The optimal pulse duration is determined from the thermal relaxation time of the target chromophore. The thermal relaxation time is the time needed for the tissue temperature to return to its baseline temperature after heating [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. If a tissue is heated for a period less than or equal to its thermal relaxation time, the accumulated heat and subsequent damage is confined to the target object, whereas if a target is heated for longer than its thermal relaxation time, heat conduction leads to heating of surrounding structures.

          Spot size

         – Spot size is the diameter of the beam emitted from the laser as it strikes the tissue surface. Energy entering the target tissue is attenuated more rapidly with a small spot size compared with a larger spot size because scattering is greater with small spot size.

         <sup>

         </sup>
         ) due to the amount of tissue that needs to be heated to achieve thermal coagulation. Although fluence is commonly used in discussing pulsed lasers, power density (ie, irradiance) is preferred for continuous wave devices.

         Confocal microscopy uses a low-energy laser to provide a pinpoint light source that increases spatial resolution for tissue imaging. This technology requires tissue fluorescence and intravenous or topical contrast agents depending upon the type of tissue being studied. The pinpoint laser is focused to a particular tissue depth, and fluorescent light reflected from that plane passes through the confocal aperture, whereas scattered light from above or below that plane is not detected.

         In contrast to most industrial applications of laser in which the laser beam is enclosed, medical and research use of lasers can expose the user and other people in the vicinity to potentially hazardous laser radiation. Adverse health effects of exposure to laser radiation are theoretically possible across the entire optical spectrum, but the risk of retinal injury due to radiation in the visible and near-infrared regions is of particular concern [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. The biological effects induced by optical radiation are essentially the same for both coherent and incoherent sources for any given wavelength, exposure site and area, and duration. However, laser radiation is a special case because the radiant exposures and irradiances that can be achieved are potentially much higher compared with conventional optical sources [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Thus, most states have training regulations for personnel who use lasers [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The eye and skin are the most susceptible to damage by laser radiation. As with other tissues, the biological effects of laser on the eye vary depending upon the wavelength and exposure duration [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Thermal injury to the retina is the predominant effect for exposure durations &lt;10 seconds due to pigmented epithelial injury [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Photochemical injury predominates in the ultraviolet spectral region and is also the principal type of injury from lengthy exposure (&gt;10 seconds) to short-wavelength visible radiation (principally "blue light") [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Pulsed lasers of &lt;0.1 msec duration can lead to hemorrhagic injury from thermoacoustic mechanisms, and optical breakdown and plasma formation become important with sub-nanosecond exposures.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because of these mechanisms, eye protection is essential when operating lasers. In the workplace, eye protection is required by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) [

          Lasers
         </strong>
         – Lasers rely on the stimulated emission of radiation to produce a single, coherent wavelength within the ultraviolet, visible, or infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Lasers are comprised of an energy source, a resonant chamber, and an active medium. The active medium determines the wavelength produced. Laser beam production can be continuous, pulsed, or quasi-continuous depending upon the characteristics of the active medium and switching mechanism of the device. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Laser principles'
         </a>
         above.)

          Laser delivery
         </strong>
         – Lasers in medicine are used predominantly as a source of energy to cut, coagulate, or ablate tissue, but also provide a coherent energy source for phototherapy or confocal microscopy, which allows for real-time imaging of tissues. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Mechanisms of tissue ablation
         </strong>
         – Lasers destroy tissue through production of heat (photothermal), disruption of chemical bonds (photoablative), or reactions with a photosensitizer (photochemical). Selective photothermolysis describes the use of specific wavelengths of laser energy to target specific chromophores and thus minimize damage to adjacent tissues. The interaction between the laser and tissue depends upon the wavelength, power, duration of exposure, and properties of the target tissue. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Tissue ablation'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Clinical utility
         </strong>
         – Lasers are used in a variety of clinical applications commonly related to external structures that are easily reached, such as the skin and cornea. However, minimally invasive technology allows access to deeper structures including the gastrointestinal mucosa, biliary tree, bronchial structures, and urinary tract via endoscopy, and hollow or solid organ surfaces via laparoscopy and thoracoscopy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical utility of lasers'

         <strong>
          Laser safety
         </strong>
         – The eye and skin are the organs that are most susceptible to damage by laser radiation. The biological effects induced by nonionizing radiation are similar for coherent and incoherent sources; however, laser radiation produces greater radiant exposures. Complications related to laser treatments are reduced with guidance systems that allow lasers to be applied more precisely and with greater control. In the workplace, eye protection is required by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). (See
         <a class="local">
