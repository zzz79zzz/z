         Stroke is a common and potentially devastating manifestation of sickle cell disease (SCD) that can affect children and adults. Stroke prevention requires intensive risk assessment and closely monitored interventions for those with increased risk. For many patients, risk reduction involves indefinite chronic transfusion therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The approach to the prevention of a first or recurrent ischemic stroke (primary and secondary stroke prevention) in individuals with SCD is presented here.
        </p>
        <p>
         Related aspects of SCD management are discussed in detail separately:

          Stroke
         </strong>
         – A stroke is an acute neurologic injury of the brain, retina, or spinal cord that occurs as a result of ischemia or hemorrhage. Stroke is distinct from hypoxic ischemic and traumatic brain or spine injury. Typical stroke symptoms include sudden onset of focal neurologic signs such as paresis, visual loss, speech and language impairment, gait disturbance, and cerebellar ataxia; seizures, headache, and/or change in level of consciousness are not uncommon. In most cases, stroke symptoms and signs last for at least 24 hours and are associated with corresponding neuroimaging findings. Ischemic strokes may sometimes undergo hemorrhagic transformation. The term cerebrovascular accident has fallen out of favor but is still used in some publications.

         <strong>
          Silent cerebral infarction
         </strong>
         – A silent cerebral infarct (SCI), also known as a silent brain infarction or silent stroke, is defined as a lesion visible in at least two planes of T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images and at least 3 mm in greatest linear dimension, with no associated findings on neurologic exam [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>

          Transient ischemic attack
         </strong>
         – Transient ischemic attack (TIA) refers to a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction. Historically, stroke symptoms or signs that last &lt;24 hours have been defined as a TIA. However, with modern brain imaging, 33 percent of patients with stroke symptoms lasting &lt;24 hours are found to have an infarct when appropriate neuroimaging is completed [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. This has led to a new, tissue-based definition of TIA, which is a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction seen on neuroimaging [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3

          Sickle cell disease

         ) allele along with a second altered beta globin allele. The second beta globin allele may also carry the sickle mutation (Hb SS), a beta-thalassemia mutation (resulting in sickle beta-thalassemia), the hemoglobin C mutation (resulting in Hb SC disease), or others.

          Transcranial Doppler
         </strong>
         – TCD is a noninvasive ultrasound-based method of measuring the flow rate of blood in intracranial arteries such as the internal carotid arteries and the arteries of the circle of Willis, including the middle cerebral circulation. TCD readings are not always a marker for intracranial stenosis, but elevated blood flow velocity on TCD is a strong predictor of stroke risk, and they have become standard of care as a screening test for stroke risk in children 2 to 16 years with SCD.

         Individuals with SCD are at risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ischemic stroke is typically due to border zone ischemia secondary to both anemia and cerebral hemodynamic alterations [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6
         </a>
         ] or to vascular occlusion caused by intimal proliferation rather than thromboembolic disease [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Ischemic stroke is most often associated with occlusion or stenosis of the large intracranial arteries [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8-12
         </a>
         ]. However, some children with strokes will have normal brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), particularly those with stroke in the cerebral border zone or watershed area between large artery territories.
        </p>
        <p>
         Children with strokes who do not have evidence of MRA-defined vasculopathy often have acute clinical events that decrease oxygen delivery to the brain such as acute chest syndrome or parvovirus B19 infection with reticulocytopenia [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Regardless of whether an ischemic stroke occurs with evidence of MRA-defined vasculopathy or is temporally associated with an antecedent or concurrent medical event, the initial two years after a stroke is the period with the highest rate of stroke recurrence, even with regular blood transfusion therapy [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In SCD, evidence to support altered cerebral hemodynamics as the main cause of overt ischemic and silent cerebral infarcts includes:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         The association of acute ischemic strokes with acute drops in hemoglobin levels, decreases in oxygen saturation, or both [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Based on the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke in SCD, indefinite regular blood transfusion therapy is the mainstay of treatment for secondary prevention in children and adults with SCD. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke (secondary stroke prophylaxis)'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The mechanisms of vasculopathy in SCD include vaso-occlusion triggered by abnormal interactions between white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC), platelets, and the vascular endothelium. These abnormal interactions, along with aberrant endothelial regulation by nitric oxide and other signaling molecules, result in abnormal intimal proliferation and progressive stenosis, which in turn produces ischemia in the cerebral microcirculation [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         There may also be injury to the arterial endothelium and impaired vascular autoregulation, especially in areas of high flow rate [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Some individuals may develop a moyamoya syndrome characterized by unilateral or bilateral stenosis or occlusion of the arteries around the circle of Willis (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50288" href="/z/d/graphic/50288.html" rel="external">
          figure 1

          "Moyamoya disease and moyamoya syndrome: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Mechanisms underlying hemorrhagic stroke are less well understood; contributing factors may include rupture of weakened primary vessels or fragile collateral vessels [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. There is also a possible association between SCD and the incidence of intracranial aneurysms.

         In a cohort of 709 pediatric and adult SCD patients who had neuroimaging performed, 19 (2.7 percent) had aneurysms. The prevalence of aneurysms was significantly higher among adults (10.8 percent) compared with children (1.2 percent). Ten of the 19 patients had multiple aneurysms, with a mean of 2.3 aneurysms per patient, and the location of aneurysms was often atypical relative to patients without SCD [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ].

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         In another cohort of 251 pediatric patients with SCD, a first intracranial hemorrhage and/or neuroimaging evidence of intracranial aneurysm was present in 7 (2.8 percent), consistent with an estimated risk for a hemorrhagic event of 0.33 per 100 patient-years, which is considerably higher than the estimated risk in the general pediatric population of 0.002 per 100 patient-years [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. It was hypothesized that common mechanisms of vascular injury may underlie both vessel stenosis and wall weakening.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         These studies suggest that aneurysms may contribute to the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in patients with SCD.

         The incidence of a first stroke varies with the type of SCD, patient age, and comorbidities. It has been estimated that without intervention, by age 20 years, 11 percent of patients with SCD will have a clinically apparent stroke, and by age 45 years, one-fourth of patients with SCD will have a stroke [

         The most extensive information on the incidence of stroke and the relative frequency of ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke comes from the United States Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD), which followed 4082 individuals with all types of SCD for a mean of over five years [

         Ischemic stroke was most common in children between the ages of two and nine years, uncommon between the ages of 20 and 29, and showed a second peak in adults over age 29. Hemorrhagic stroke was most frequently seen in individuals between the ages of 20 and 29.

         Transient, clinically acute silent cerebral ischemic events (ASCIE; acute ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted MRI sequences without a corresponding neurologic finding) have been observed in asymptomatic children with SCD [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42,43
         </a>

         <a href="#rid42">

        <p>
         These limited data suggest that children with SCD have relatively frequent acute asymptomatic cerebral ischemic events. Some of these acute lesions may resolve spontaneously, while others persist as SCI. The significance of these findings remains to be established. However, a publication from 2018 showed progressive loss of brain volume on MRI over a three-year period in children with SCD and pre-existing SCI, raising concern that subtle brain injury occurs frequently in individuals with SCD even without the appearance of new SCI [

         The primary method of stroke risk assessment in children is transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening, a noninvasive ultrasound-based procedure that can be used to measure the mean blood flow velocity in the large intracranial vessels [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. TCD velocity can be measured through several bone windows, including transtemporal, suboccipital, and transorbital approaches, and at various depth settings [

         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         Children with SCD have TCD velocities that are 40 to 50 percent higher than those in unaffected comparison groups. Blood flow velocity is inversely proportional to arterial diameter, so narrowing of a vessel lumen in the setting of vascular stenosis can be identified by increased flow velocity in the affected segment [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. A focal increase in velocity usually suggests localized arterial stenosis, whereas a bilateral increase may indicate bilateral arterial disease, or increased blood flow unrelated to intracranial stenosis, perhaps related to cerebral hemodynamic compensation [

In multivariate analysis, abnormal TCD velocities were correlated with upper or lower airway obstruction (hazard ratios [HR]: 1.47 and 1.76, respectively per year of obstruction), and elevated absolute reticulocyte count (HR: 1.82 per rise of 20,000/microL). Elevated hemoglobin F (Hb F) was protective on multivariate analysis.

Time-averaged mean of the maximum velocities (TAMMV) in the internal carotid artery (ICA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) correlated strongly with stroke risk and with narrowing on cerebral angiography. There was no absolute threshold above which stroke became more likely, but in an extension study, the incidence of stroke in those with TAMMV &lt;170 cm/sec was 2 percent, that in patients with velocities between 170 and 200 cm/sec was 7 percent, and that in patients with velocities &gt;200 cm/sec was 40 percent (

         The utility of TCD screening in patients over the age of 16 years has not been established in controlled trials. In one study, the mean TCD velocity of adults with SCD was significantly higher than that seen in healthy controls (110.9 ± 25.7 cm/sec versus 71.1 ± 12.0 cm/sec) but lower than that reported in children with SCD, indicating that the TAMMV thresholds established for stroke risk classification in children would not apply to adults [

          53

         ]. In a subsequent report, 50 patients with SCD who were &gt;16 years old were evaluated by both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/MRA and TCD to determine the association between abnormal findings on these imaging studies and TCD velocities [
         <a href="#rid54">

         ]. Among these patients, 36 (72 percent) had stenosis or tortuosity of the ICA or MCA on MRA, and these patients had significantly higher TCD velocities than those with normal MRA results. These results suggest that TCD screening of adults with SCD could be useful in adults, but they do not establish its utility in predicting the onset of cerebral vasculopathy or in preventing stroke.

Additionally, children who have repeated unevaluable TCD studies may benefit from a screening MRA study. There are, however, no evidence-based guidelines to be followed in this situation.

         Despite the evidence supporting a correlation between TCD velocities and stroke risk, abnormal TCD velocities are only a surrogate measure for vasculopathy and stroke risk. A small proportion of patients with normal and conditional TCD velocities do experience ischemic strokes [
         <a href="#rid52">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         TCD velocities may also vary over time for the same individual, as was demonstrated both in the STOP cohort and in a longitudinal study [
         <a href="#rid63">
          63,64
         </a>
         ]. On the first TCD measurement, the majority of children in the longitudinal cohort (84 percent) had a normal TCD result. Among this group, 25 of 153 (16 percent) converted to a conditional result. An additional four patients (3 percent) converted directly from a normal to an abnormal result. These data illustrate the importance of continued monitoring of patients regardless of prior TCD results.
        </p>
        <p>
         Additional caveats with TCD screening include the dependence of quality and reliability on operator training and experience, the transient elevation of TCD velocities during intercurrent illness, and the transient lowering of TCD velocities by recent transfusion. Routine TCD screening should be performed by experienced operators and should be deferred if the patient is experiencing any illness or received a transfusion in the preceding two weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many children with SCD are not screened with TCD, despite the established value of TCD-based interventions to reduce stroke risk. Impediments include lack of access to centers where TCD is performed, lack of access to chronic transfusion therapy should screening identify an abnormal TCD velocity, and the costs and burdens of regular screening and interventions, which may be substantial [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65,66
         </a>
         ]. One approach to improving access to TCD screening is to make it routinely available on the same day as a regular clinic visit. In a study from a tertiary center that instituted this approach, 99 percent of patients at risk for stroke were able to be screened [

         TCD screening is ineffective in identifying increased risk for silent cerebral infarction (SCI). In a cohort study of participants in the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) and STOP studies, there was a discordance rate of 29 percent between TCD and MRI results, with only 5 out of 17 patients with abnormal MRI findings also having abnormal TCD results [

         SCI are an independent risk factor for both overt strokes and additional SCI. Further, children with SCI are at risk for cognitive impairment, further neurologic injury, and grade failure at school. In untreated children with SCI and normal or conditional TCD measurement, the incidence rate of infarct recurrence was 4.8 events per 100 person years. Even with regular blood transfusion therapy, the infarct recurrence rate was 2 events per 100 person years in the Silent Cerebral Infarct Trial (SIT) [

The number needed to treat with regular blood transfusion therapy to reduce the incidence of SCI is 13, a value that some parents, caregivers, and clinicians may consider too high to initiate regular blood transfusion therapy. Regardless of whether transfusion therapy is chosen or not, detection of SCIs can facilitate other interventions to improve cognitive outcomes.

         For children at increased risk of stroke based on two transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocity measurements ≥200 cm/sec within a one- to two-week period, we recommend chronic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion therapy for primary stroke prevention. This is considered the standard approach and is consistent with recommendations from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 2014 guidelines, the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2020 guidelines for management of cerebrovascular disease, and practices in other countries [

         Chronic transfusion therapy may also be appropriate for children with abnormally low flow velocities (&lt;50 to 70 cm/sec), especially if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows silent infarctions and/or if magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) demonstrates large artery stenosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The goals of chronic transfusion therapy are to lower and maintain the hemoglobin S level at 30 percent or less of total hemoglobin and to maintain a pretransfusion hemoglobin concentration of approximately 9 g/dL. Of note, patients should not be transfused to a post-transfusion hemoglobin concentration &gt;12.5 g/dL due to the risk of hyperviscosity and decreased tissue oxygen delivery with increasing hematocrit [

         Most clinicians do not continue TCD screening for primary stroke prevention after a patient has been placed on chronic transfusion therapy; this is because regular blood transfusion therapy dramatically decreases the incidence rate of strokes to less than 1 per 100 person years. In the STOP trial, among 88 children with serial TCD data after starting regular blood transfusion therapy, TCD measurements remained abnormal in 21.6 percent of the children, with none of the children developing a stroke. Thus, in children with an abnormal TCD measurement who are started on blood transfusion therapy, the presence of persistently abnormal TCD measurements does not appear to predict future strokes.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are no clear evidence-based guidelines for the management of children with normal or conditional TCD velocities who have other findings of concern such as neurocognitive deficits or seizures. At a minimum, all such patients should undergo MRI and MRA imaging of the brain to screen for parenchymal or vascular abnormalities and should be considered for chronic transfusion therapy if significant abnormalities, such as SCI or severe vasculopathy, are identified.

The trial was terminated prematurely at a mean follow-up of 20 months due to a marked reduction in strokes in the prophylactic transfusion group (

          69

There were significantly fewer events in the transfusion group (one stroke and five new or enlarged SCIs [6 percent]) compared with the observation group (seven strokes and seven new or enlarged SCIs [14 percent]). This translated to an incidence of new brain lesions of 2.0 versus 4.8 per 100 years at risk (incidence ratio 0.41, 95% CI 0.12-0.99). There were an additional three TIAs, all in the observation group. There were no significant changes in cognitive function.

          Risks and burdens of chronic transfusion
         </strong>
         – Despite the benefits noted above, chronic transfusion therapy poses certain risks, including alloimmunization, transfusion reactions, and iron overload, as well as a significant investment of time and resources. In practice, few patients are able to continue chronic prophylactic transfusions into adulthood because of the development of alloantibodies, iron overload, and other costs and burdens of this approach. These risks and burdens, and strategies to reduce their frequency and severity, are presented separately. (See

         The conclusion drawn from the study was that

         can be considered as a substitute therapy for the maintenance of TCD velocities (and by extension, the minimization of stroke risk) in selected children after a period of transfusion therapy. The study also demonstrated that phlebotomy could be a viable alternative to pharmacologic chelation to address transfusional iron overload in patients with a good response to hydroxyurea therapy.

         Although persistence of abnormal TCD velocities was not an exclusion criterion, the vast majority of patients on both arms of the TWiTCH trial had a significant reduction of TCD velocities on chronic transfusion [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37

         , with a mean hemoglobin concentration maintained at 9.1 ± 1.1 g/dL and a mean Hb F of 24.4 ± 7.9 percent of total hemoglobin.

         The published duration of follow-up in the TWiTCH trial was relatively short (24 months). Therefore, it is not possible to exclude the possibility of longer-term progression of SCD vasculopathy and increased stroke risk in patients on

        </p>
        <p>
         In a French cohort of 92 patients with abnormal TCD velocities who were treated with a period of transfusion therapy, 76 (83.5 percent) had normalization of TCD velocities after a mean duration of transfusion of 1.4 ± 1.3 years [
         <a href="#rid80">
          80

          hydroxyurea

         therapy (mean duration of preceding transfusion, 2.7 ± 1.7 years; mean age, 6.4 ± 1.9 years), with a period of overlap between transfusion and hydroxyurea during escalation to maximum tolerated dose. Of these 45 patients, 13 (29 percent) had reversion to abnormal TCD velocities within 1.1 ± 1.1 years of transitioning to hydroxyurea (range, 0.2 to 3.9 years). Patients who had reversion to abnormal TCDs were once again placed on chronic transfusion therapy, and none were reported to have worsened clinical status. Multivariate regression analysis of potential risk factors for TCD reversion identified a baseline absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) &gt;400,000/microL before the age of three years, higher white blood count (WBC) on hydroxyurea, and lower maximum tolerated dose of hydroxyurea as independent risk factors for reversion.

          Transfusions versus observation
         </strong>
         – Observational studies have demonstrated a reduced risk of recurrent stroke in children treated with regular transfusions compared with observation. As an example, in a retrospective cohort of 137 children treated with chronic transfusions over a 10-year period, 31 (22 percent) had a second stroke, for a rate of 2.2 per 100 patient-years [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. By comparison, the prevalence of recurrent stroke without transfusion has been estimated at 47 percent to over 90 percent [
         <a href="#rid90">
          90
         </a>
         ]. A number of additional smaller series have also demonstrated a reduced risk of recurrent stroke with regular transfusions compared with observation, with typical reductions in recurrent stroke rate from approximately two-thirds of patients to below 10 percent [
         <a href="#rid87">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Whether chronic transfusion therapy can be stopped after a longer period of transfusions in a patient with a prior stroke remains unclear. Evidence from the primary prevention setting (see
         <a class="local">
          'Evidence for chronic transfusion'

          95
         </a>
         ]. In the SWiTCH trial, 133 children and adolescents with SCD who had a history of stroke and had received at least 18 months of transfusion therapy were randomly assigned to transition to a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of hydroxyurea with phlebotomy or to continue transfusions with iron chelation. The primary endpoint was a composite of noninferiority for stroke prevention and superiority for reduction of liver iron content. The trial was terminated early at the first scheduled interim analysis for futility for the composite endpoint, which required superiority of phlebotomy over iron chelation for reducing excess iron stores. The incidence of stroke on the hydroxyurea plus phlebotomy arm was higher (7 of 67 patients; 10.4 percent) than in the transfusion plus chelation arm (1 of 66 patients; 1.5 percent). The results of this trial indicate that transition to hydroxyurea therapy is inferior to continued chronic transfusion for secondary stroke prevention.

          Transfusions after TIA
         </strong>
         – The role of transfusion therapy as a prophylactic measure for patients with SCD following a transient ischemic attack (TIA) has not been studied in a systematic fashion. Despite the lack of such studies, guidelines published by the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association recommend chronic transfusion therapy for such patients [
         <a href="#rid96">
          96
         </a>
         ]. The 2014 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Guidelines do not recommend prophylactic transfusions following TIA [
         <a href="#rid62">
          62
         </a>
         ]. The 2020 American Society of Hematology (ASH) central nervous system disease guidelines recommend chronic transfusions for secondary prevention after TIA but do not specify the duration of therapy [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. A reasonable approach in a patient with no recurrence of TIAs on chronic transfusion and no evidence of significant cerebral vasculopathy or silent infarcts on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies would be to consider a gradual transition to
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8543" href="/z/d/drug information/8543.html" rel="external">
          hydroxyurea
         </a>
         therapy after 6 to 12 months of chronic transfusion therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Transfusions are titrated to achieve and maintain a pretransfusion hemoglobin S (Hb S) level of ≤30 percent. In the setting of an acute ischemic stroke, it is critical to rapidly lower the hemoglobin S level below this threshold by emergent automated exchange transfusion, as discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5926.html" rel="external">
          "Acute stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) in children and adults with sickle cell disease"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsequently, transfusions can be performed every three to six weeks to maintain the pretransfusion Hb S level at ≤30 percent, the pretransfusion total hemoglobin concentration at approximately 9 g/dL, and the post-transfusion hemoglobin concentration no higher than 12.5 g/dL. These thresholds are based on the values used in some of the landmark studies and trials in this area. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Evidence for chronic transfusion'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Efforts have also been made to reduce the frequency and volume of chronic transfusions (eg, by raising the target for percent Hb S). However, the clinical utility of increasing the target Hb S percentage is not well defined and is counter to the evidence that lower Hb S levels have a larger effect on lowering transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities than raising the hemoglobin level [
         <a href="#rid97">

         Children and adolescents enrolled in a chronic transfusion program for stroke should continue to have surveillance MRI with MRA because progressive vasculopathy, recurrent strokes, and silent cerebral infarcts (SCI) may occur despite regular transfusion therapy. This need for continued surveillance was demonstrated in two observational studies:

         In a multicenter observational study of children on regular blood transfusions for secondary stroke prevention after first overt stroke, when followed over five years, 45 percent of children (18 of 40) had a new infarct recurrence (overt or SCI) and of these the majority, 14 of 18 (78 percent), had significant cerebral vasculopathy [

         In a retrospective review of 44 patients with SCD who had a stroke and received chronic transfusions for secondary stroke prevention, 18 (41 percent) had a recurrent stroke over six and a half years of observation [
         <a href="#rid98">
          98
         </a>
         ]. The rate of recurrent stroke was higher in those with moyamoya-like collateral vessels than in those who lacked these findings (11 of 19 [58 percent] versus 7 of 25 [28 percent]; hazard ratio [HR] 2.40, 95% CI 0.85-6.75).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who develop neurologic symptoms suggestive of stroke or SCI while receiving chronic transfusions should be evaluated and treated for the possibility of a new stroke. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5926.html" rel="external">
          "Acute stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) in children and adults with sickle cell disease"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients receiving chronic transfusion require attention to excess iron stores, which can become a severe problem. As an example, the median hepatic iron levels in the SWiTCH trial were 13 mg/gram dry weight and the median serum ferritin level was 3164 ng/mL [
         <a href="#rid99">
          99
         </a>
         ]. Our approach to monitoring and treating excess iron stores with chelation therapy as well as discussions of other potential complications of chronic transfusion such as alloimmunization and transfusion reactions are presented separately. (See

        <p>
         The ASH 2020 guidelines on transfusion therapy in SCD recommend exchange transfusion (apheresis) for all patients on chronic transfusion therapy. Exchange transfusion offers several advantages over simple transfusion, including better control of anemia and hemoglobin S fraction and less iron loading, but is more resource-intensive [

         Although regular transfusions are the preferred therapy for secondary stroke prevention in most patients with SCD, some individuals will not be able to tolerate this approach, and some may not have access to regular transfusions due to complications (eg, alloimmunization) or lack of resources. Others may have recurrent stroke despite chronic transfusions. Alternative therapies for such patients include

         SCI are infarctions identified only by neuroimaging with no accompanying clinical history of stroke or TIA. They are not truly silent because they are likely to contribute to neuropsychologic deficits in individuals with SCD. (See

          58

        <p>
         Results from the SIT trial, as discussed above, suggest that a chronic transfusion program in patients found to have SCIs can reduce the risk of stroke, the progression of SCIs, and the development of new SCI lesions. (See

         It is reasonable to perform cognitive testing in patients with SCI to evaluate the clinical impact of the lesions and the need for other educational or rehabilitative interventions. (See

         Some individuals with SCD develop moyamoya syndrome, characterized by unilateral or bilateral stenosis or occlusion of the arteries around the circle of Willis, with prominent arterial collateral circulation. The clinical manifestations of moyamoya include transient ischemic attack, ischemic infarction, and rarely, intracerebral hemorrhage. (See

         Small observational studies suggest that revascularization surgery can be beneficial in reducing the risk of subsequent stroke [

         In a retrospective study of 14 pediatric patients with SCD and moyamoya syndrome on chronic transfusion therapy, the rate of stroke prior to revascularization procedures was 1 per 7.8 patient-years compared with 1 per 39.3 patient-years after revascularization [

         In a retrospective cohort study of 29 patients with SCD and moyamoya syndrome, the calculated stroke rates were 1 per 5.37 patient years in those who received chronic transfusion therapy alone, compared with 1 per 23.14 patient-years in those who underwent revascularization procedures [

         The 2020 ASH guidelines for cerebrovascular complications of SCD reviewed all of the available literature concerning revascularization procedures and SCD [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. The panel was unable to pool published studies due to the heterogeneity of the five different neurosurgery procedures (pial synangiosis, encephalo-duro-arterio-myo-synangiosis, encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis, encephalo-myo-arterio-synangiosis, multiple burr holes), and the absence of rigorous postoperative assessment with prospective evaluation of neurologic outcomes, including assessment of the brain for new cerebral lesions or neurologic assessment (surveillance of MRI of the brain and neurology assessment for infarct recurrence). Additionally, a review of the one-month postoperative period revealed a high rate of events associated with ischemic injury of the brain.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ultimately, the ASH committee recommended that patients with moyamoya disease and a history of stroke or TIA be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team for revascularization surgery in addition to regular blood transfusions, albeit as a conditional recommendation with low certainty in evidence about effect [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. Ideally, individuals who are treated surgically should do so as part of a regional or national protocol that allows for systemic collection of data and ongoing assessment of the risks and benefits.

         There is very little evidence for effective primary or secondary prophylaxis of hemorrhagic strokes in patients with SCD, other than those established for the general population. The potential benefits of chronic transfusion or

         Management of unruptured brain aneurysms in individuals with SCD, including criteria for intervention, should generally follow the approaches in individuals without SCD, which is presented separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1132.html" rel="external">
          "Unruptured intracranial aneurysms"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         There is a high rate of cerebral aneurysms in adults with SCA (approximately 9 to 10 percent) compared with the general population (approximately 3 percent), and the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in SCD increases with age [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,33,117-120
         </a>
         ]. This suggests that obtaining a single noncontrast magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head in young adulthood to screen for aneurysms is reasonable [
         <a href="#rid120">
          120
         </a>
         ]. However, the clinical history of aneurysm in adults with SCD is poorly defined. Thus, even when aneurysms are identified, consultation with a neurosurgeon is encouraged to determine individualized management. The time interval for any follow-up screening is unknown and should be individualized.

         Although numerous studies have been performed, drawing conclusions from cognitive and behavioral evaluations of children with SCD has been difficult. Limitations include challenges related to controlling for socioeconomic and other variables and limitations of available testing for subtle deficits in intelligence, attention, and other behavioral complications of stroke and silent cerebral infarct (SCI) [
         <a href="#rid121">
          121-126
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The impact of stroke and SCI on intelligence quotient (IQ) in children with SCD was addressed in a 2016 meta-analysis [
         <a href="#rid127">
          127
         </a>
         ]. This found that children with a prior stroke had a mean IQ score 10 points lower than those with SCIs, while children with SCIs had a mean IQ score 6 points lower than those with no detectable abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Importantly, children with SCD and normal MRIs also had IQ scores significantly lower than healthy controls, indicating that other biological and environmental factors contribute to neuropsychological impairment in SCD.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to this, the impact of stroke on cognitive and behavioral function was illustrated in the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD), which evaluated 135 children with SCD using MRI and neuropsychologic testing [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. On most measures of neuropsychologic evaluation, children with a history of stroke had significantly worse performance compared with children with normal MRIs or SCI alone (without overt stroke). In turn, children with SCI alone had worse performance on tests of mathematics, vocabulary, and visual-motor speed and coordination than children with no MRI abnormalities. Other studies have reported similar findings [
         <a href="#rid128">
          128
         </a>
         ]. The location of the infarct is the primary determinant of neuropsychologic impairment [
         <a href="#rid128">
          128-131
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Additional data on SCI were reported in the SIT trial, which randomly assigned children with SCI to transfusions or observation. Testing of full-scale IQ in 150 children in the trial showed that SCI was associated with a 5.2 point decrease in IQ, a reduction similar to that seen with absence of college education for the head of household in the same population [
         <a href="#rid132">
          132
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The 2020 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines for cerebrovascular complications of SCD recommend screening by a pediatrician with validated tool or referral for formal screening by a psychologist if there are concerns about developmental delays in preschool-age children or concerns about neurodevelopmental disorders in school-age children with SCD, including academic or behavioral problems, or symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. For adults with SCD, the ASH guideline panel recommended surveillance for cognitive impairment and formal referral to a psychologist for a more in-depth cognitive evaluation if concerns are identified.
        </p>
        <p>
         Regardless of whether there is a history of stroke or SCI, all individuals with neurocognitive and/or behavioral dysfunction should receive a cognitive and medical evaluation to diagnose any related disorders and to identify modifiable risk factors for cognitive impairments [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. Those with impaired cognition should be offered age-appropriate educational resources, and the cognitive domain-specific evidence-based guidelines for these conditions should be followed to provide appropriate interventions such as cognitive rehabilitation. (See

          Primary stroke prophylaxis

         – TCD velocity ≥200 cm/sec is associated with ischemic stroke in up to 40 percent of children. Chronic transfusion can lower risk substantially (to as low as 2 percent per 20-month period). For children at increased risk of a first ischemic stroke based on two TCD velocity measurements ≥200 cm/sec within a one- to two-week period, we recommend chronic transfusion therapy rather than no treatment (
