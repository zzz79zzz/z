         Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is the term used for a group of genetic disorders of connective tissue that are characterized by skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and/or tissue fragility  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118193" href="/z/d/graphic/118193.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). The management of patients with EDS depends largely upon common principles and practices, with an emphasis on patient education for the prevention and early recognition of injuries and complications. Management of EDS also includes monitoring and additional interventions tailored to the particular manifestations or complications that may occur with each form of EDS [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         There are no medical treatments that can reverse or "cure" EDS, and most other interventions used in these patients have not been evaluated in randomized trials. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Common management approaches'
         </a>
         below and

         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         An overview of the approach to the management, monitoring, and prognosis of patients with EDS will be presented here. The information provided in this topic review is intended to allow primary care providers and other non-EDS specialists to educate and support patients with EDS and to coordinate care and referrals to appropriate specialists, depending upon the type and severity of EDS. Patients with EDS should be managed in collaboration with an expert in clinical genetics. (See

         Some major issues are common to several or most forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS); the preventive management strategies and interventions for such issues are generally the same regardless of the EDS type, and are discussed in this section. The particular approaches specific to each type of EDS are described below. (See

         The primary care provider should work collaboratively with the geneticist and other EDS specialists to coordinate care for the patient with appropriate consultants (eg, experts in cardiovascular, orthopedic, rheumatologic, dermatologic, and behavioral health care). Additionally, the clinical geneticist and other EDS specialists have a role in educating the other members of the health care team, given the relative rarity of these disorders in most practice settings.

         Patients with vascular EDS should be advised to obtain a medical alert device, such as a bracelet or necklace, which indicates their diagnosis and possible complications to facilitate appropriate emergency medical care. Other patients with risk of vascular and other acute events, including patients with the classical and kyphoscoliosis types (cEDS and kEDS), may also benefit from use of such a device. Patients in North America can enroll in MedicAlert by calling (800) 432-5372 or through the internet at

         We suggest that patients who experience difficulty coping with the physical limitations or pain posed by EDS be referred for appropriate psychological counseling and support. We try to help patients to maintain a positive attitude, follow recommendations for joint protection and pain management, and choose physical activities that are appropriate for their condition (see
         <a class="local">
          'Joint protection and function'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">
          'Musculoskeletal pain'
         </a>
         below). Patients also benefit, in our experience, from reassurance that EDS may be associated with chronic pain, which is "real" and not "all in their head."
        </p>
        <p>
         Many patients may be adversely affected by the limitations posed by EDS (eg, those whose work or recreational activities requires heavy lifting). Patients who have pursued activities enhanced by their hypermobility (eg, professional ballerinas, competitive dancers, gymnasts, college athletes dependent upon sports scholarships) may be in particular need of psychosocial support.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with chronic pain, anxiety, and depression, which are more common in individuals with joint hypermobility, may benefit from a multidisciplinary treatment program emphasizing functional recovery that includes cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, physical therapy, and education regarding their condition [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Such strategies may help to improve physical function, self-efficacy, and mood, and may reduce the need for analgesics. Participation in psychotherapeutic group interventions may also improve patient wellbeing. As an example, in one study a group of 12 women with generalized joint hypermobility were offered interventions including physical and cognitive-behavioral therapy as a group program; this program included an inpatient rehabilitation program with testing, physical therapy, group discussions, and lectures, followed by in-home physical therapy, then a brief inpatient stay for testing and retraining [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Participants reported improved performance of daily activities, increased muscle strength and endurance, and decreased kinesophobia (fear of movement and injury or re-injury), although self-reported pain levels were not significantly changed. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14612.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of psychotherapies", section on 'Cognitive and behavioral therapies'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Since anxiety and other neuropsychological conditions appear to be increased in EDS, assessment for these is required [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].

         Patients with joint hypermobility should be referred for physical and occupational therapy evaluation and management; in addition, we advise patients regarding steps they can take on their own to optimize function, relieve symptoms, and prevent injury  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91738" href="/z/d/graphic/91738.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). An important objective for many patients, particularly those with the classical and hypermobility forms of EDS, should be to "preserve and protect" joint function, with the goal of preventing recurrent joint dislocations, chronic joint pain, and early onset of osteoarthritis. Prevention is of particular value because orthopedic procedures and other surgery may take longer than expected to heal, and many patients undergo repeated orthopedic procedures as their connective tissues increase in laxity [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The complication rate and surgical outcomes for patients with EDS undergoing orthopedic procedures appear to be worse than for non-EDS patients. In one study, a complication rate of 91 percent, including continued pain, subluxations and dislocations, instability, pain associated with hardware, and increased infections has been reported [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A low-impact muscle-strengthening program for joint protection and appropriate use of assistive devices (such as a cane or lightweight collapsible walking stick; or lightweight orthoses, such as braces or splints) can be of particular benefit. Evaluation by a pedorthist or podiatrist is of benefit to assess the need for arch supports or other orthotics. In one series of 79 patients in Belgium with hypermobile EDS, of the half who were enrolled in a physical therapy program, 63 percent reported benefit [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Patients with hypermobile EDS reported improved quality of life after physical therapy, especially the effect of respiratory muscle training on their exercise capabilities [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients can take a number of precautions and other actions in their daily activities, including measures to optimize function, relieve symptoms, and prevent injury  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91738" href="/z/d/graphic/91738.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ), in addition to participating in physical and occupational therapy. These measures should be individualized according to the patient's clinical manifestations. Activities which are joint-sparing, such as swimming, should be encouraged; by contrast, contact sports and repetitive activities which stress the joints, such as running and weightlifting, should be avoided. Patients may also be attracted to activities in which their flexibility is a particular advantage, such as gymnastics, but these activities increase the risk of joint injury and earlier development of arthritis. For patients with EDS, the opposite of "no pain, no gain" is true; sports and activities which may have already contributed to joint damage at the time of diagnosis should be replaced with noncompetitive biking, swimming, and walking. Additionally, patients with substantial joint laxity and/or recurrent dislocations should avoid carrying items weighing more than about 5 pounds (about 2.25 kg). These strategies are useful, in our experience, but have not been systematically evaluated in clinical trials.
        </p>
        <p>
         "Mind-body" techniques, such as tai chi, may also be useful for enhancing function and reducing pain. Although they have not been systematically evaluated inpatient with EDS, they appear to be helpful in patients with other disorders, such as fibromyalgia and low back pain. (See

         In patients with joint hypermobility, preventive strategies and nonopioid pain management are important in the management of musculoskeletal pain, which may become chronic and difficult to treat. Pharmacologic treatment of joint pain involves the use of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen
         </a>
         and, if necessary, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); but the latter agents, which may diminish platelet function, should generally be avoided in patients with easy bruising.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain benefit from use of meditation or other relaxation techniques. Those with symptoms and findings compatible with fibromyalgia syndrome, such as chronic widespread pain, fatigue, nonrestorative sleep, and cognitive disturbance, may benefit from treatments used in this condition.

         Because wound healing is abnormal and there is an increased risk of dehiscence, experts generally suggest that skin wounds should be closed in two layers, when possible, and there should be generous suturing of deep wounds to aid in wound healing. Sutures should generally remain in for twice as long as is typical for a given procedure. Taping can help prevent stretching of the scar.

         The management strategies required in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) differ to some degree between EDS types, and should be individualized depending upon the severity of disease and the specific manifestations caused by the underlying genetic disorder. Some of these issues will impact the approach to usual medical care for other comorbid illnesses. Other management strategies may be common to most forms of EDS, but should still be tailored to the type of EDS and individual manifestations. (See

Premature delivery due to cervical insufficiency or premature rupture of membranes is common, and patients with EDS should be considered at high risk and followed by a maternal-fetal-medicine specialist for these and other potential complications. Patients with vascular EDS are at high risk for uterine and vascular ruptures. (See

         EDS generally results in slowly progressive changes. The prognosis depends upon the type of EDS and the severity with which the individual patient is affected. The lifespan for patients with the classical and hypermobility forms is not decreased; by contrast, survival is shortened in forms of EDS with vascular involvement (eg, vascular and kyphoscoliosis EDS), and 80 percent of patients with vascular EDS experience a major adverse disease-related event by age 40. (See
