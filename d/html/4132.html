         Incorrect.
        </p>
        <p>
         On further inquiry, you learn that the patient has type 1 diabetes. She presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and had a second episode of DKA six years ago when she had pneumonia. Age is not a criterion for diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, which can have its onset at any age. One cannot assume that an older patient treated with insulin has type 2 diabetes. She needs an intermediate or long-acting insulin at all times.
        </p>
        <p>
         Her metabolic control was satisfactory at home. It has been rendered unstable in the hospital by the use of an insulin sliding scale as the sole source of insulin. An insulin sliding scale without provision of a basal (intermediate or long-acting) insulin is not a satisfactory method of treatment in a patient with type 1 diabetes and in many insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the patient is now eating and has received
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9030" href="/z/d/drug information/9030.html" rel="external">
          regular insulin
         </a>
         to treat the blood glucose of 363 mg/dL on the day you see her, it is appropriate to resume her usual insulin regimen. On the reduced insulin doses you recommend, the blood glucose level is 209 mg/dL before dinner and 202 mg/dL at bedtime. The glucose values remain in the mid-200 mg/dL range the next day, and the patient's insulin doses are then restored to those she took before admission. She is discharged on December 7.
        </p>
        <p>
         Use of reduced doses of NPH insulin and an insulin sliding scale when the patient is on her usual diet is likely to perpetuate the patient's hyperglycemia and apparent metabolic instability (when high blood glucose values are covered by
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9030" href="/z/d/drug information/9030.html" rel="external">

         ).
