Susceptibility to MH and administration of anesthesia to MHS patients are discussed elsewhere.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/403.html" rel="external">"Susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia: Evaluation and management", section on 'Prevalence'</a>.)</p><p>MH episodes have been estimated to occur in the general population in 1:100,000 administered anesthetics [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/6">6</a>]. This is probably an underestimate because unrecognized, mild, or atypical reactions occur due to variable penetrance of this autosomal dominant inherited trait.</p><p>An MH event does not necessarily occur every time an MH susceptible individual is exposed to an anesthetic triggering agent. Approximately one-half of patients who develop acute MH have had one or two uneventful exposures to triggering agents [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/7,8">7,8</a>]. In one confirmed case (with mutation analysis) reported to the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States (MHAUS) hotline, the patient had undergone approximately 30 general anesthetics prior to triggering MH. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/403.html" rel="external">"Susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia: Evaluation and management", section on 'Anesthetic history'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H87579301"><span class="h2">Epidemiology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>MH occurs in all ethnic groups in all parts of the world. Reactions occur more frequently in males than females (2:1) [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/6,7,9">6,7,9</a>]. Children under 19 years account for 45 to 52 percent of reported events [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/7,9">7,9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H647215659"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>MH-susceptible (MHS) patients have genetic skeletal muscle receptor abnormalities that allow excessive myoplasmic calcium accumulation in the presence of certain anesthetic triggering agents. The specific mechanisms by which anesthetics interact with these abnormal receptors and trigger an MH crisis have not been defined, but appear to involve impaired magnesium inhibition of SR calcium release and extracellular calcium entry [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/4,5,10,11">4,5,10,11</a>]. </p><p>During an episode of MH, the clinical manifestations occur as a result of calcium overload within the skeletal muscle cell that leads to sustained muscular contraction and breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), cellular hypermetabolism, anaerobic metabolism, acidosis, and their sequelae.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Normal muscle physiology</strong> – Depolarization spreads throughout the muscle cell via the transverse tubule system, which activates dihydropyridine (DHP) receptors located within the t-tubule membrane  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58185" href="/d/graphic/58185.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). These receptors are coupled to ryanodine receptors (<em>RYR1</em>), which regulate the passage of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the intracellular space [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/12,13">12,13</a>]. Calcium combines with troponin to cross-link actin and myosin, resulting in muscle cell contraction. Reuptake of calcium by the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) leads to muscle cell relaxation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Malignant hyperthermia physiology</strong> – Mutations encoding for abnormal RYR1 or DHP receptors have been found in a majority of MHS patients; exposure to triggering agents in these patients may lead to unregulated passage of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the intracellular space combined with transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) mediated transsarcolemmal Ca2+ influx, leading to an acute MH crisis [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/12-24">12-24</a>]. This process is shown in a figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58185" href="/d/graphic/58185.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The unregulated accumulation of myoplasmic calcium causes sustained muscle contraction. Accelerated levels of aerobic and anaerobic metabolism sustain the muscle for a time, but produce carbon dioxide and cellular acidosis, and deplete oxygen and adenosine triphosphate [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/25-27">25-27</a>]. This causes the early signs of MH: hypercarbia, tachycardia, and in some cases, muscle rigidity. A change to anaerobic metabolism worsens acidosis with the production of lactate, resulting in a mixed respiratory/metabolic acidosis. Once energy stores are depleted, rhabdomyolysis occurs and results in hyperkalemia and myoglobinuria. Clinically evident hyperkalemia (ie, electrocardiogram [ECG] changes) from rhabdomyolysis may occur early after <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9952" href="/d/drug information/9952.html" rel="external">succinylcholine</a> or later with progression of the MH episode.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Over time, sustained muscle hypermetabolism generates more heat than the body is able to dissipate, aggravated by cutaneous vasoconstriction. Hyperthermia may occur early or may be delayed following the initial onset of symptoms. In some cases, core body temperature rises as much as 1°C every few minutes. Accelerated hyperthermia (above 41.5°C [106.7°F]) causes widespread vital organ dysfunction. These extremely high body temperatures are associated with the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation, a poor prognostic indicator and often terminal event [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/28">28</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Mortality'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The only known therapy for MH, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9322" href="/d/drug information/9322.html" rel="external">dantrolene</a>, binds to the RYR1 receptor to inhibit the release or leak of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum; this reverses the negative cascade of effects [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/29-31">29-31</a>]. Dantrolene's effect requires the presence of calmodulin and sufficient magnesium [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/32">32</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The mechanism whereby certain anesthetic agents trigger these events in MHS patients is unclear [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/10,11">10,11</a>]. Prolonged RYR1 channel opening or channel leak has been demonstrated in experimental models of MH susceptibility [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/33">33</a>]. Volatile anesthetics potentiate sarcoplasmic calcium release in patients with MHS [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/34">34</a>]. Increased sarcolemmal influx of calcium via TRPC6 and TRPC3 cationic channels is as important as dysregulated SR calcium leak/release in MH pathophysiology. The threshold for SR calcium overload induced calcium release (SOICR) is lower with MH-causal RYR1 mutations, and further lowered by inhalation anesthetics. Increased mitochondrial calcium may produce reactive oxygen species which also increases SR calcium leak [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/35,36">35,36</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The mechanism whereby <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9952" href="/d/drug information/9952.html" rel="external">succinylcholine</a> administration can initiate acute MH has not been elucidated. Succinylcholine is an analog of acetylcholine and stimulates the motor endplate to initiate muscle depolarization, which may be prolonged in MHS patients. In MHS patients, succinylcholine may result in generalized muscle rigidity or masseter muscle rigidity. (See <a class="local">'Clinical signs'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">MH TRIGGERS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The vast majority of cases of MH have occurred while the patient was receiving a volatile anesthetic agent (eg, halothane, enflurane, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8992" href="/d/drug information/8992.html" rel="external">isoflurane</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9887" href="/d/drug information/9887.html" rel="external">sevoflurane</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8891" href="/d/drug information/8891.html" rel="external">desflurane</a>) with or without administration of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9952" href="/d/drug information/9952.html" rel="external">succinylcholine</a> [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/7">7</a>].</p><p>MH has been reported following administration of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9952" href="/d/drug information/9952.html" rel="external">succinylcholine</a> in the absence of an inhalation agent (eg, to facilitate endotracheal intubation or treat laryngospasm). The majority of such cases were reported in two publications. One was a series of 129 patients who were biopsy- proven MH-susceptible (MHS), 20 of whom manifested their signs of MH with succinylcholine alone without coadministration of a volatile agent [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/37">37</a>]. The second publication reported 14 cases of MH triggered by succinylcholine alone among 477 MH cases reported to the North American MH Registry (NAMHR) between 1987 and 2010 [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/38">38</a>]. </p><p>MH has been reported to occur during or when coming off cardiopulmonary bypass; the most common presenting signs include unexplained tachycardia, hypercarbia, and acidosis [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/39">39</a>].</p><p>An acute and sometimes fatal MH-like syndrome (ie, rigidity, rhabdomyolysis, etc) has been reported in MHS children and adults in the absence of exposure to triggering anesthetic agents. The patients who have developed this syndrome were usually, but not always, exposed to heat stress or exercise (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/403.html" rel="external">"Susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia: Evaluation and management", section on 'Exertional rhabdomyolysis'</a>), and were either previously known to be MHS (ie, ryanodine receptor [<em>RYR1</em>] mutation positive) or subsequently shown to be on postmortem analysis [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/40-42">40-42</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3372933393"><span class="h1">PREPAREDNESS FOR MH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The supplies necessary to treat MH must be immediately available wherever general anesthetic triggering agents (ie, volatile gases and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9952" href="/d/drug information/9952.html" rel="external">succinylcholine</a>) are used  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67323" href="/d/graphic/67323.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/43-45">43-45</a>].

SAMBA recommends that patients who are known to be MHS should not be cared for at facilities that stock succinylcholine but do not stock dantrolene.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The European Malignant Hyperthermia Group guidelines recommend that <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9322" href="/d/drug information/9322.html" rel="external">dantrolene</a> should be available wherever volatile anesthetics or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9952" href="/d/drug information/9952.html" rel="external">succinylcholine</a> are used [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/48">48</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The sequence and timing of the clinical manifestations of MH vary from patient to patient, and most patients do not develop all signs of MH  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119718" href="/d/graphic/119718.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H684556526"><span class="h2">Timing of presentation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial signs of MH may occur soon after induction with general anesthetic triggering agents (ie, volatile agents and/or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9952" href="/d/drug information/9952.html" rel="external">succinylcholine</a>) or any time during the maintenance phase of the anesthetic.

Some cases are indolent, and others are more accelerated in nature, such as the occurrence of sudden life-threatening arrhythmias from hyperkalemia related to rhabdomyolysis.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sequence of clinical signs</strong> – The most reliable initial clinical sign heralding the development of acute MH is an <strong>unexplained</strong> increase in end-tidal carbon dioxide<sub> </sub>(ETCO<sub>2</sub>), tachypnea, or breathing over the ventilator, despite minute ventilation that would usually maintain normocarbia. Other initial signs of acute MH may include sinus tachycardia, or masseter or generalized muscle rigidity, which may occur or persist despite paralysis with a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/7,54">7,54</a>].
