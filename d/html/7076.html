         Hemolytic anemia is defined as anemia due to a shortened survival of circulating red blood cells (RBCs) due to their premature destruction. There are numerous causes of hemolytic anemia, including inherited and acquired conditions, acute and chronic processes, and mild to potentially life-threatening severity. Occasionally the cause will be obvious from the history, physical examination, or findings on the peripheral blood smear, but often the ultimate diagnosis requires a synthesis of all of this information and additional laboratory testing.
        </p>
        <p>
         The key clue that suggests that hemolysis is the cause of the anemia is an increase in the reticulocyte count that is not explained by recent bleeding or recent correction of iron or other nutrient deficiency, or other causes (pregnancy, acclimatization to altitude). Reticulocytosis should be expressed as an absolute number rather than a percentage, and it should be related to the hemoglobin and hematocrit values. Patients may also have evidence of RBC destruction including increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and unconjugated bilirubin, decreased haptoglobin, and RBC shape changes on the peripheral blood smear.

         The causes of hemolytic anemia and a diagnostic approach to the adult with unexplained hemolytic anemia are discussed here. Other topic reviews present general approaches to determining the cause of anemia and diagnosis of specific types of hemolytic anemia:

         Causes of hemolysis can be categorized in various ways, including whether the abnormality is intrinsic or extrinsic to the red blood cell (RBC) (intracorpuscular versus extracorpuscular defects), whether the condition is inherited or acquired, whether the hemolysis is acute or chronic, whether the mechanism involves immune destruction due to antibodies (immune versus non-immune mechanism), and whether the hemolysis occurs in the vasculature or in the reticuloendothelial macrophages in the liver and spleen (intravascular versus extravascular hemolysis). Most of the inherited conditions are intracorpuscular, and most of the hemolysis by an immune mechanism is extravascular.

         The typical lifespan of a red blood cell (RBC) is approximately 110 to 120 days (four months). During this time, RBCs are subject to remarkable mechanical stresses as they traverse capillaries and splenic cords much smaller than their diameter, which requires repeated cycles of deformation and elastic recoil. This happens many millions of times over the course of the RBC lifespan.
        </p>
        <p>
         The properties of the RBC that allow it to withstand this stress include a highly deformable membrane and underlying cytoskeleton, an optimal surface-to-volume ratio, and an enzymatic system that continually restores the proper redox environment of the cell. The optimal membrane surface is approximately 40 percent greater than that of a perfectly spherical cell of equivalent volume. RBC volume is regulated by ion pumps and channels that control the entry of water and cations including sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Metabolic enzymes generate ATP needed by the cation pumps; 2,3-BPG, which regulates oxygen uptake and release by hemoglobin; and reducing capacity (eg, glutathione, NADPH), to protect the oxygen-rich RBC from oxidant injury [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Normal aging of RBCs results in age-dependent RBC destruction. This typically occurs at a rate of approximately 1 percent of RBCs daily. The percentage of RBCs that are cleared from the circulation can be increased dramatically in hemolytic states, especially when an enlarged spleen is contributing to hemolysis [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7082.html" rel="external">
          "Red blood cell survival: Normal values and measurement"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Hemolysis occurs when the RBC is unable to maintain its intact structure during passages through the circulation and reticuloendothelial system. Hemolysis by any mechanism stimulates a compensatory increase in RBC production via increased erythropoietin (EPO) secretion by the kidney. EPO in turn stimulates the bone marrow to produce more RBC precursors, which is followed within a few days by an increase in the reticulocyte count and within an additional one to two days by an increase in the hemoglobin level and hematocrit. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7161.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The occurrence of anemia and its severity is determined by the balance between the extent of hemolysis and the capacity of the bone marrow to amplify RBC production. This balance is illustrated in the following calculations and clinical examples:

         RBC survival and turnover rate can be calculated under steady state conditions (eg, when the secretion and response to EPO are intact) from the percentage of reticulocytes and the reticulocyte lifespan (RLS). The RLS increases proportionally as the hematocrit decreases and reticulocytes enter the circulation at progressively earlier stages in their maturation (when the hematocrit is lower, reticulocytes are released earlier from the bone marrow). In the steady state without anemia the typical RLS is approximately one day, after which the cell becomes a mature RBC. In severe anemia, reticulocytes can be released from the bone marrow as much as 1.5 days early ("shift cells"), giving a RLS of 2.5 days.

         ). For an individual without hemolysis who has a hematocrit of 40 and a reticulocyte count of 1 percent, RBC survival is calculated to be approximately 100 days (100 ÷ [1 ÷ 1] = 100). Corrections for the increased RLS can be made in patients with severe anemia to reflect the degree of reticulocytosis more accurately. (See

         Reticulocytosis (increase in the production of new RBCs, evidenced by appearance of reticulocytes in the peripheral blood) requires adequate iron and vitamins (B12, folate) for RBC production, along with a normally functioning bone marrow and adequate erythropoietin production. Reticulocytosis may not occur in individuals who are deficient in iron, vitamin B12, or folate; those with concomitant bone marrow abnormalities (from infection or primary bone marrow disorders); and those with inadequate erythropoietin production (from chronic kidney disease). (See

         There are several free applications that calculate the reticulocyte index from the reticulocyte percentage and hematocrit, allowing identification of inadequate bone marrow compensation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Additionally, a bone marrow responsiveness index (BMRI) has been calculated as ([absolute reticulocyte count] × [patient Hb/normal Hb]) to discriminate an anemia with effective erythropoiesis from those with ineffective erythropoiesis, such as in congenital dyserythropoietic anemia. The BMRI has been extended to other hemolytic conditions including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and hereditary spherocytosis [

         Classifying hemolytic anemias according to whether the abnormality resides within the RBC itself (intracorpuscular) versus external to the RBC (extracorpuscular) is helpful because it incorporates the patient history; it also allows the clinician to determine whether the hemolysis is reversible, whether transfused RBCs will also be affected, and whether the treatment should be directed at a specific RBC defect or at another condition (eg, an infection or drug).

         Immune hemolysis generally refers to RBC destruction by antibodies and/or complement proteins bound to the RBC surface. Immune hemolysis is characterized by a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT; also called direct Coombs test) and/or a positive indirect antiglobulin test (also called indirect Coombs test, or, in the setting of pretransfusion testing, referred to as an antibody screen).

         The site of hemolysis can be intravascular (within the circulation) or extravascular (via the reticuloendothelial macrophages and monocytes of the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes). The site often determines the clinical severity and immediate management needs of the patient. This is because the site of RBC destruction determines whether the byproducts of RBC destruction such as free hemoglobin will be routed through the reticuloendothelial system or will be liberated directly into the circulation.

         If products of hemolysis are liberated into the circulation, they will appear as free serum hemoglobin or heme and urinary hemoglobin, heme, or hemosiderin. The serum and urine may be pink or darker brown. (See

         Free hemoglobin or heme in the circulation can cause significant damage to the kidney, causing acute renal failure, and can trigger DIC or increase the risk of thrombosis [

         The site of RBC destruction is one of the main determinants of clinical severity. As an example, RBC destruction in AIHA is generally extravascular, as reticuloendothelial macrophages progressively phagocytize small pieces of RBC membrane that are opsonized with autoantibodies. In contrast, in hemolysis from mechanical trauma (eg, prosthetic heart valve, marching, bongo drums), the lysis can be immediate and complete within the circulation, before the RBCs reach the reticuloendothelial system. Likewise, in conditions in which the membrane attack complex (MAC) of complement creates a hole in the RBC membrane (eg, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [PNH], paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria [PCH], and severe forms of cold agglutinin disease) a large component of intravascular hemolysis is likely. Generally, extravascular hemolysis is less severe than intravascular one.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, in many cases there is a component of both intravascular and extravascular hemolysis, especially when hemolysis is severe. The site of RBC destruction thus is helpful in determining the cause of hemolysis and the need for more aggressive therapy but typically is not diagnostic of a specific condition.

          Definition and clinical findings
         </strong>
         – Intravascular hemolysis refers to hemolysis that occurs primarily within the vasculature. This occurs when there is a considerable amount of structural damage to the RBC membrane (eg, mechanical shearing, complement MAC) or when the reticuloendothelial system becomes overwhelmed [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. When severe, intravascular hemolysis is characterized by pink or brown serum and dark urine with free serum and urine hemoglobin [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. The pink color is due to oxyhemoglobin and the brownish color is due to the oxidized form, methemoglobin.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Free hemoglobin binds to haptoglobin, and the hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex is rapidly removed by the liver, leading to a reduction in plasma haptoglobin, often to undetectable levels (see
         <a class="local">
          'High LDH and bilirubin; low haptoglobin'
         </a>
         below). Dimers of alpha-beta globin that are not bound by haptoglobin are small enough (molecular weight 34,000 daltons) to be filtered by the glomerulus and appear in the urine as hemoglobinuria.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Urine hemosiderin may be seen several days after an episode of intravascular hemolysis, as renal tubular cells take up the heme, degrade it, store it as hemosiderin, and eventually are shed into the urine. Urine hemosiderin is detected using Prussian blue staining (iron stain) of the urine sediment. (See

         Extravascular hemolysis refers to hemolysis that occurs primarily via macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. Severely damaged RBCs, especially those coated with complement, are primarily destroyed in the liver, an organ that receives a larger proportion of the cardiac output than the spleen. Poorly deformable RBCs such as spherocytes or sickled cells are primarily destroyed in the spleen, in the cords of Billroth. These unique vascular channels end blindly, unlike other vascular channels in the body. The only way for a RBC with a diameter of 7 to 8 microns to escape from these cords and return to the general circulation is to deform sufficiently to pass through 2 to 3 micron slits in the walls of the cords  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53105" href="/z/d/graphic/53105.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>
         ). Senescent or damaged RBCs remain in the cords and are phagocytosed by monocytes and macrophages.
        </p>
        <p>
         RBCs destroyed in the spleen are usually phagocytosed in their entirety and digested within phagosomes of macrophages. Most of the hemoglobin is degraded to release heme, with each molecule of heme converted to equimolar amounts of biliverdin, iron, and carbon monoxide via the action of microsomal heme oxygenase [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13-16

         The biliverdin is immediately reduced to unconjugated bilirubin by the enzyme biliverdin reductase and is released into the plasma. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3622.html" rel="external">

         Under normal circumstances, the iron is efficiently released from macrophages into the plasma, mediated by the iron export protein ferroportin. It is transported to the bone marrow and used in the production of new RBCs. In patients with the anemia of chronic disease/inflammation, iron release is impaired due to the action of hepcidin, resulting in impaired iron mobilization for new RBC production. (See

         The carbon monoxide formed from heme breakdown initially binds to the hemoglobin of intact RBCs as carboxyhemoglobin. It is subsequently released in the pulmonary capillaries and excreted into the expired air.

         Some patients with especially severe anemia (hemoglobin &lt;6 g/dL) or other worrisome findings may require immediate life-saving interventions before hemolysis has been diagnosed and/or the cause identified [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Importantly, life-saving interventions such as transfusion for severe anemia; plasmapheresis for possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP); or vigorous hydration and diuresis for an acute transfusion reaction should not be withheld while confirming the diagnosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Immediate management issues before the cause is identified'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Recognizing and diagnosing hemolytic anemia in patients with a classic presentation is straightforward. However, for many patients, the exact timing of the onset of anemia may be unclear, the red blood cell (RBC) morphology may be unrevealing, or there may be several possible diagnoses under consideration. Other patients may have more than one cause of anemia, one of which may blunt the normal reticulocyte response to hemolysis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of hemolytic anemia is suspected in a patient with chronic or new onset symptoms of anemia (eg, fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath), a low hemoglobin level, and an increased reticulocyte count that is not explained by accelerated RBC production due to recent bleeding; repletion of iron, vitamin B12, folate, or copper; or administration of erythropoietin. Reticulocytosis (expressed as absolute number) may be absent or inadequate to Hb levels in conditions with lack of bone marrow compensation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Additional laboratory testing is often used to confirm the diagnosis of hemolytic anemia and to determine the likely cause. Testing to confirm hemolysis may be done simultaneously (increased unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], and decreased haptoglobin) with testing to determine the cause, or sequentially. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Laboratory confirmation of hemolysis'

         Once the diagnosis of hemolytic anemia is relatively certain, our approach to determining the cause and providing immediate interventions is as follows  (

         Other laboratory testing that reveals one of the specific causes of hemolysis is also strongly supportive and in many cases sufficient for diagnosis (see

          'Post-diagnostic testing to determine the cause'

        </p>
        <p>
         Hematologic consultation should be obtained in virtually all patients with a new onset of hemolysis, since sudden and life-threatening worsening of anemia may occur, requiring urgent coordination between treating clinicians, clinical pathologists, and transfusion medicine or blood bank personnel for appropriate management. Hemolysis may also be the first sign of an underlying systemic disorder (eg, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and may require an urgent intervention to prevent death or disease-related complications.

         All patients for whom the diagnosis of hemolytic anemia is considered will have had a complete blood count. In the majority of cases, this will include a white blood cell (WBC) count, platelet count, and RBC indices. Hemolysis will be associated with some degree of anemia in the majority of cases, especially when it first occurs, when there is a delay in the production of new RBCs to compensate for hemolysis, and, if it is severe, when the bone marrow cannot fully compensate.

         An initial evaluation for the cause of anemia may have already occurred in some individuals for whom the likelihood of hemolysis was thought to be low or for whom hemolysis was not considered initially. The discussion herein presumes that other common causes of anemia have been evaluated or excluded based on the clinical history, examination, or laboratory testing. (See

         A high reticulocyte count implies an accelerated production of RBCs in the bone marrow. Increased reticulocytes is a typical finding in hemolytic anemia but is not specific for hemolysis; the bone marrow can also increase RBC production in response to bleeding, nutrient repletion (eg, vitamin B12,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8475" href="/z/d/drug information/8475.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         , iron), or erythropoietin administration. The absence of reticulocytosis does not eliminate the possibility of hemolysis, as some individuals have concomitant bone marrow suppression or reduced bone marrow function that interferes with production of reticulocytes. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Hemolysis without reticulocytosis'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The degree of reticulocytosis can be estimated from the peripheral blood smear, as reticulocytes are larger than mature RBCs, lack central pallor, and have a bluish tint (polychromasia)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67042" href="/z/d/graphic/67042.html" rel="external">
          picture 3
         </a>
         ). The count can be quantified from a manual count on a peripheral blood smear stained for reticulin  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74294" href="/z/d/graphic/74294.html" rel="external">
          picture 4
         </a>
         ) or by an automated counter. Many counters automatically provide the reticulocyte count. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4430.html" rel="external">
          "Automated complete blood count (CBC)", section on 'Reticulocytes'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Reticulocytes can be expressed as a percentage of RBCs or as an absolute number; these numbers can be corrected for the degree of anemia and the lifespan of the reticulocytes in the circulation. In cases of markedly increased reticulocytosis or failure of the bone marrow to produce reticulocytes, any of these measures is likely to be a relatively good indicator of the degree of reticulocytosis. However, the corrections make the count more accurate, and in some cases are essential to determining whether reticulocytosis is truly increased:

          Reticulocyte percentage
         </strong>
         – The reticulocyte percentage conveys the percentage of all RBCs that are reticulocytes. Since it is relative to the total RBC count, it may be artificially increased in severe anemia and artificially decreased if the patient is not anemic. The normal reticulocyte percentage in a patient without hemolysis is in the range of 1 to 2 percent. In patients with hemolysis and an otherwise intact bone marrow, reticulocyte percentage is at least 4 to 5 percent, and often considerably higher. This was illustrated in case series such as the following:

         – The reticulocyte percentage is a relative number. For any given number of reticulocytes, a lower the total number of RBCs (the denominator) will raise the percentage of these RBCs that are reticulocytes. Thus, the reticulocyte percentage can be multiplied by the patient's hematocrit divided by a normal hematocrit (eg, 45 percent) to give a corrected reticulocyte percentage. As an example, if reticulocytes are 10 percent in a patient with a hematocrit of 22.5 percent, the corrected count can be calculated as follows:

         <a href="#rid19">
          19,20
         </a>
         ]. The normal absolute reticulocyte count is between 25,000 to 75,000/microL (ie, approximately 1 percent of an absolute RBC count of 5,000,000 cells/microL). An example of the utility of this measure is a severely anemic patient with a hematocrit of 18 percent, a RBC count of 2,000,000/microL, and reticulocyte count of 3 percent. While the reticulocyte count of 3 percent appears high, the absolute reticulocyte count is only 60,000/microL (ie, 3 percent of 2,000,000), which is in the normal range and does not reflect an adequate bone marrow compensation.

         – The more severe the anemia, the younger the reticulocytes are when they are released into the circulation, and hence the longer their lifespan in the circulation. The absolute reticulocyte count can be corrected for the reticulocyte lifespan (RLS), also called the reticulocyte maturation time (RMT). The RLS is 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, or 2.5 days at hematocrits of 45, 35, 25, and 15 percent, respectively  (

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In a patient with a hematocrit of 18 percent and an absolute reticulocyte count of 60,000/microL, the RLS is approximately 2.5 days; thus, the corrected absolute reticulocyte count is (60,000 ÷ 2.5 = 24,000/microL), which is inappropriately low.

         There are several free applications that calculate the reticulocyte index from the reticulocyte percentage and hematocrit, allowing the identification of inadequate bone marrow compensation. A bone marrow responsiveness index (BMRI) has been calculated as [(absolute reticulocyte count) × (patient Hb/normal Hb)] to discriminate an anemia with effective erythropoiesis from those with ineffective erythropoiesis, such as congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA). The BMRI has then been extended to other hemolytic conditions including AIHA and hereditary spherocytosis [

         The other major typical finding in hemolytic anemia aside from reticulocytosis is evidence of RBC destruction from breakdown products. Hemolysis releases lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and hemoglobin from RBCs. Hemoglobin is bound by circulating haptoglobin, which facilitates heme recycling; hemoglobin is converted to bilirubin as part of the degradation and heme recycling process  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65197" href="/z/d/graphic/65197.html" rel="external">

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, high LDH and bilirubin and low haptoglobin are all consistent with hemolysis as summarized in the table  (

         <strong>
          LDH and bilirubin

         – High LDH and bilirubin are not very specific for hemolysis, as there are numerous other possible causes of these abnormalities  (

          Haptoglobin
         </strong>
         – The normal range for serum haptoglobin is wide. A low haptoglobin is likely to be due to hemolysis, and an undetectable haptoglobin level is almost always due to hemolysis. In a series of 100 patients with various medical conditions, a haptoglobin level of 25 mg/dL provided the best cutoff between hemolytic and non-hemolytic disorders [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. The sensitivity and specificity of a haptoglobin ≤25 mg/dL were 83 and 96 percent. However, a normal or increased haptoglobin does not eliminate the possibility of hemolysis because haptoglobin is an acute phase reactant that can be increased in the setting of inflammation (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7483.html" rel="external">
          "Acute phase reactants"
         </a>
         ). Other causes of low haptoglobin include hepatic insufficiency, abdominal trauma, and congenital ahaptoglobinemia [

         – It is important to have a sense of the rate of decline in the hemoglobin level to manage the patient properly. Individuals with a very slow decline in hemoglobin may be able to adapt to and tolerate severe anemia without end organ ischemia, whereas those with brisk hemolysis and a rapid drop in hemoglobin level may be quite symptomatic and require more aggressive treatment and accelerated evaluation, even if the absolute hemoglobin level is not that low.

          Transfusion

         – Patients with severe anemia (hemoglobin &lt;6 g/dL, higher hemoglobin in some cases with heart or lung disease) should be transfused with RBCs, especially if there is active bleeding, symptoms of organ ischemia, or ongoing brisk hemolysis. It may be appropriate to obtain a pre-transfusion blood sample that can be stored for later analysis, particularly if an inherited cause of hemolytic anemia is suspected. For patients with possible immune-mediated hemolysis for whom crossmatch compatible blood cannot be identified, blood designated for immediate release can be transfused.

         In some cases, the cause of hemolysis may be less clear. As examples, the presence of numerous spherocytes could indicate autoimmune hemolytic anemia or hereditary spherocytosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         For such individuals, we use the direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test (DAT) to distinguish between hemolysis due to an immune mechanism (eg, AIHA) and hemolysis that is less likely to be due to an immune mechanism  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108335" href="/z/d/graphic/108335.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The DAT is used to determine whether patient RBCs are coated with IgG, complement, or both. The assay is performed by taking washed patient RBCs and incubating them with anti-human IgG and anti-human C3d antibodies. In AIHA, anti-human antibodies and/or anti-C3d antibodies form bridges (agglutination) between red cells by binding the human antibodies on the patient's red cells. Agglutination is graded visually as negative to 4+, as is illustrated in the figure  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100639" href="/z/d/graphic/100639.html" rel="external">
          figure 3
         </a>
         ). Less frequently, RBC may be coated with IgM or IgA, and their presence is revealed by specific antisera.
        </p>
        <p>
         A DAT should be obtained in all patients who present with anemia, laboratory evidence of hemolysis (ie, increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased indirect/unconjugated bilirubin, reduced haptoglobin), and an absence of schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear. It is important to distinguish between warm-AIHA and cold agglutinin disease. (See

          Warm AIHA
         </strong>
         – Warm AIHA is generally due to an IgG that binds to RBCs at a temperature around 37°C, and the DAT is typically positive with anti-IgG antisera or IgG plus complement at low titer.

         <strong>
          Cold agglutinin disease
         </strong>
         – Cold agglutinin disease is due to an IgM autoantibody that has an optimum temperature of reaction at 4° C (thermal range 4 to 34°C) and strongly activates complement. The DAT is positive with anti-complement antisera and a high titer of cold agglutinins is found in the serum  (

          Mixed AIHA
         </strong>
         – Mixed forms of AIHA show common characteristics of warm and cold autoantibodies, with a DAT positive for both IgG and complement, along with high titer cold agglutinins. As an exception, paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH) is due to an IgG that binds to RBCs in the cold but causes severe intravascular hemolysis at 37°C. PCH is diagnosed with the Donath-Landsteiner test. (See

         </strong>
         – AIHAs due to IgM with a thermal range close to body temperature (warm IgM) are rare and cause extremely serious AIHA that is potentially fatal. These IgM antibodies are able to strongly activate complement in vivo and cause massive intravascular hemolysis. They may appear weakly positive for complement on the DAT or may be DAT negative, possibly delaying diagnosis.

         – The DAT can be performed with various methods, the most classic being the test tube with polyspecific and monospecific antisera (anti-IgG, anti-complement, anti-IgA, and anti-IgM). More sensitive tests can reveal smaller amounts of antibodies bound to RBCs; these tests include microcolumn and solid phase tests; these are widely used in routine diagnosis. More sophisticated methods involve washing RBCs with low ionic strength solutions (LISS), improving the ability to detect low affinity autoantibodies, and experimental tests such as immunoradiometric assays, ELISA, and cytometry. Despite these methodological improvements, 5 to 10 percent of AIHAs remain DAT-negative, making diagnosis especially challenging.

         Hemolysis without anemia can be seen if the bone marrow capacity to increase RBC production is sufficient to overcome the anemia caused by the hemolysis. (See

        <p>
         Despite a normal hemoglobin and hematocrit, hemolysis can still be detected from increased reticulocyte count, increased serum LDH, and decreased serum haptoglobin. An estimate of RBC turnover from the reticulocyte count in non-anemic patients should yield a value of ≤5 or ≤8 percent per day in adults and children, respectively.

          Types of hemolysis
         </strong>
         – Hemolytic anemias can be classified according to whether the abnormality is intrinsic or extrinsic to the RBC (intracorpuscular versus extracorpuscular defects), whether the condition is inherited or acquired, whether the hemolysis is acute or chronic, whether the mechanism involves antibody-mediated destruction (immune versus non-immune mechanism), and whether the hemolysis occurs in the vasculature or in the reticuloendothelial macrophages in the liver and spleen (intravascular versus extravascular hemolysis).

         <strong>
          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of hemolytic anemia is suspected in a patient with chronic or new onset anemia with reticulocytosis and not due to another obvious cause. There is no single specific diagnostic test for hemolytic anemia. Most experts consider the diagnosis to be accepted if there is reticulocytosis not explained by recent bleeding, nutrient repletion, or administration of erythropoietin; with high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and unconjugated bilirubin, low haptoglobin, and in some cases other laboratory findings  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126234" href="/z/d/graphic/126234.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). Once the diagnosis is relatively certain, the cause is determined using information from the history and physical examination and directed laboratory testing  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108335" href="/z/d/graphic/108335.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). (See

         <strong>
          Immediate interventions
         </strong>
         – Certain interventions may be required before the cause of hemolysis is known, including transfusions, plasma exchange, hydration, and hemodynamic support. Life-saving interventions should not be delayed while awaiting the results of diagnostic testing. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Immediate management issues before the cause is identified'

         <strong>
          Further testing
         </strong>
         – In some of the obvious/classic presentations, it may make sense to proceed directly to specific diagnostic testing to determine the specific cause. If the underlying cause is less obvious, we use the direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test (DAT) to distinguish between immune and non-immune hemolysis, and for those with a negative DAT, we perform directed laboratory testing based on the patient and family history, physical examination; pace and severity of hemolysis; and RBC morphology  (

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Involvement of specialists with expertise in hemolytic anemias, laboratory diagnosis, or genetic testing may be helpful. (See
