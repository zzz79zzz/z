They consist of embryonic globin chains including zeta and epsilon and are named Gower I, Portland, and Gower II. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7072.html" rel="external">"Structure and function of normal hemoglobins"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fetal</strong> – By approximately the 14<sup>th</sup> week of gestation, embryonic Hbs are completely replaced by fetal Hb (Hb F; a tetramer of two alpha globin chains and two gamma globin chains [alpha2gamma2]). Hb F has a higher oxygen affinity than adult Hb (Hb A; alpha2beta2), which allows preferential transfer of oxygen from the maternal circulation to the fetal circulation.

Variants can be classified into the clinical phenotype (anemia, polycythemia, cyanosis, clinically silent) by the type of hematologic changes they produce (hemolysis, reduced expression, altered oxygen affinity, sickling), by which globin chain is affected (alpha, beta, or gamma), and by the type of genetic variation (point mutation causing a single amino acid change, insertion or deletion affecting protein sequence or abundance). Many clinically silent variants are identified with newborn screening for hemoglobinopathy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13941.html" rel="external">"Methods for hemoglobin analysis and hemoglobinopathy testing", section on 'Population screening (eg, routine newborn screen)'</a>.)</p><p>The tables summarize selected clinical disorders  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61649" href="/z/d/graphic/61649.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and selected classes of DNA changes  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62517" href="/z/d/graphic/62517.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2528668057"><span class="h2">Protection against malaria</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some of the higher prevalence variants are thought to have evolved because the heterozygous states offer partial protection against malaria and generally are not associated with significant adverse clinical complications. Thus, evolutionary pressures favored their selection and/or did not favor their elimination. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7099.html" rel="external">"Protection against malaria by variants in red blood cell (RBC) genes"</a>.)</p><p>Examples of common variants that are highly represented in regions with a high malaria burden include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sickle hemoglobin</strong> – Most common in Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, and India  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106077" href="/z/d/graphic/106077.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), as well as certain Mediterranean regions and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Alpha thalassemia</strong> – Most common in Southern China, India, and Southeast Asia. Heterozygous alpha thalassemia is present at high prevalence throughout all tropical and subtropical regions, including most of Southeast Asia, the Mediterranean area, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, and Africa. Overall, alpha thalassemia variants have reached frequencies of approximately 5 percent worldwide. Frequencies of 70 percent and up to 90 percent have been reported in Melanesia and in parts of Nepal [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Beta thalassemia</strong> – Most common in Africa, Southeast Asia, Italy, Iran, and Greece.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hb C</strong> – Most common in Burkina Faso; also in Mali, Ghana, Togo, and Benin [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hb E</strong> – The highest frequencies are observed in India, Bangladesh, and throughout Southeast Asia; it is particularly high in Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Southern China. Demographic mobility has resulted in high frequencies in California and other coastal regions [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. </p><p></p><p>Increased migration around the world has expanded the distribution of all of these variants. Race, ethnicity, or country of origin <strong>cannot</strong> be used to diagnose or exclude the presence of a variant.</p><p>Other variants that have prevalences of approximately 1 to 2 percent in the population may be the result of a founder effect, but they do not have a clear association with evolutionary selective pressures. Examples include Hb D-Punjab (also called Hb D-Los Angeles), Hb G-Philadelphia, and Hb Hasharon. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4031976035"><span class="h2">Age at presentation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Individuals with variants affecting globin chains may come to medical attention for different reasons. Variants affecting beta globin present later in infancy, after the switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin. (See <a class="local">'Presenting findings'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Newborn screening</strong> – Newborn screening typically includes hemoglobin analysis. Newborn screening has been implemented to identify individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) for early intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality. However, other symptomatic and asymptomatic variants are detected with screening. This evaluation may be done using a protein-based method or a DNA-based method. The method determines which variants will be identified. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4980.html" rel="external">"Overview of newborn screening"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13941.html" rel="external">"Methods for hemoglobin analysis and hemoglobinopathy testing", section on 'Common clinical scenarios'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptomatic presentations</strong> – Many individuals are symptomatic in childhood, but in some cases the initial presentation may occur later in adolescence or in adulthood. Symptomatic individuals are typically homozygous or compound heterozygous for a clinically significant variant(s), but some are heterozygous. Examples are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61649" href="/z/d/graphic/61649.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and include: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Anemia</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Microcytosis</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hemolytic anemia</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Erythrocytosis</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Cyanosis</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Jaundice</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Sickling complications</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Incidental finding</strong> – Some individuals may become aware of a variant when a complete blood count (CBC), hemoglobin analysis, or genetic testing is done for a reason other than clinical symptoms (evaluation for another condition, reproductive testing and counseling). These individuals are typically heterozygous for an autosomal recessive variant. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Family history</strong> – Some hemoglobin variants are inherited in a recessive fashion (eg, SCD, thalassemia). However, some variants, such as those that create an unstable hemoglobin, are autosomal dominant, and the family history may be positive.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H995684721"><span class="h2">Presenting findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Presenting findings differ depending on which globin chain is affected and how the variant affects hemoglobin production and properties. General findings include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Age of onset</strong> – Variants affecting beta globin chains that are symptomatic will present with clinical symptoms after four to six months of age. Variants affecting alpha and gamma globin chains that are symptomatic will present with symptoms at (or before) birth. (See <a class="local">'Age at presentation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sickle cell syndromes</strong> – SCD due to homozygous Hb SS or Hb S beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia typically presents in infancy (age six months to one year, as beta globin production increases) with vaso-occlusive pain (dactylitis) or hemolytic anemia. Before the era of early disease identification, patients presented with acute splenic sequestration crisis or pneumococcal sepsis. Other compound sickle cell syndromes (sickle-beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia or Hb SC disease) may have milder presentations or present at a later age, usually after six months of age or older. Hb SE disease is usually asymptomatic, but over time at least one-third experience vaso-occlusive events [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7115.html" rel="external">"Overview of compound sickle cell syndromes"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In SCD, there is reticulocytosis and findings of hemolysis. The blood smear in Hb SS often demonstrates red blood cells (RBCs) with Howell-Jolly bodies, target cells, nucleated RBCs, and irreversibly sickled cells. Many of these characteristic changes are less prominent in the less anemic sickle variants. In Hb SC disease, the RBCs demonstrate a predominance of target cells, microcytosis, and elevated mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), but irreversibly sickled cells are not often seen. The Hb S-beta thalassemia syndromes produce a microcytic, hypochromic anemia with target cells, basophilic stippling, and Pappenheimer bodies. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Sickle cell trait (heterozygosity for the sickle variant with a normal sequence at the other <em>HBB</em> allele) is essentially an asymptomatic carrier state with minimal clinical implications for most individuals. However, clinically significant complications can occur. The CBC and blood smear in sickle cell trait are usually normal. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7119.html" rel="external">"Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7115.html" rel="external">"Overview of compound sickle cell syndromes"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7145.html" rel="external">"Sickle cell trait"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Conditions that can result in symptoms of SCD include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Hb SS disease</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Hb SC disease</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Hb SE disease</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Hb S beta thalassemia</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Hb SD-Punjab/Los Angeles</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Hb S plus Hb O Arab</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Hb C plus Hb C-Harlem or Hb S plus Hb C-Harlem</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other conditions with the sickle variant cause minimal or no sickling symptoms:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hb S with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thalassemias</strong> – Genetic variants associated with alpha or beta thalassemia cause reduced hemoglobin expression; they do not change the amino acid composition of hemoglobin. An exception is Hb Constant Spring, an alpha thalassemic variant that produces an elongated alpha chain and a hemoglobin tetramer with abnormal migration on electrophoresis. (See <a class="local">'Hb Constant Spring'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Alpha thalassemia</strong> – The age of presentation and clinical severity depend on the number and type of alpha chains affected (of four total), ranging from hydrops fetalis or severe anemia in early infancy to mild anemia or isolated microcytosis discovered incidentally during adulthood. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7116.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of thalassemia (adults and children)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Key aspects of the clinical presentation are:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Microcytic anemia present at birth</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Hb Barts on the newborn screen</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Other findings include an increased RBC count, decreased mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and decreased mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). The blood smear shows microcytosis and hypochromia. Hb Barts (a tetramer of gamma globin chains) is detected in newborn screening. When the individual has a three gene deletion, Hb H may appear on Hb electrophoresis. Hb Constant Spring (which accounts for 20 percent of alpha thalassemia variants in Southeast Asia), while more severe than deletional alpha thalassemia in general, does not cause significant microcytosis. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Beta thalassemia</strong> – The age of presentation and severity depend on whether one or both beta chains are affected and whether the variant(s) reduce beta globin production (beta<sup>+</sup>) or abolish it completely (beta<sup>0</sup>). Heterozygosity for a beta thalassemia variant may cause mild anemia, microcytosis, and occasionally splenomegaly. Individuals with beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia are homozygous or compound heterozygous for beta globin gene variants that produce no Hb A. This condition presents in infancy as beta globin production increases and gamma globin production decreases. Usually, severe transfusion-dependent anemia and signs of extramedullary hematopoiesis occur, and transfusion therapy is required. In general, individuals who are double heterozygotes with beta<sup>0</sup>/beta<sup>+</sup> or beta<sup>+</sup>/beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia have a less severe phenotype, but variability exists. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7116.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of thalassemia (adults and children)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Key aspects of the clinical presentation are:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Microcytic anemia after six months of age</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Increased hemoglobin A<sub>2 </sub>after six months of age</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hb C</strong> – Homozygosity for Hb C (Hb CC disease) can present in infancy, older childhood, or adulthood, depending on other factors that affect clinical severity. Hb CC disease causes mild hemolytic anemia and often splenomegaly without vaso-occlusive manifestations. More severe disease can occur when Hb C is combined with a severe beta globin variant. Heterozygosity for Hb C is an asymptomatic carrier state. (See <a class="local">'Hb C'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In suspected Hb C disease, the blood smear may show cells with Hb C crystals inside contracted cells and classic RBC shape changes that suggest the likely diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61082" href="/z/d/graphic/61082.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Hb C in combination with beta thalassemia may result in a mild microcytic anemia. More severe disease can occur when Hb C is combined with a severe beta mutation (sickle variant or a severe beta thalassemia variant). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hb E</strong> – Individuals who are homozygous for Hb E have mild microcytic anemia. Hb E in combination with beta thalassemia can range from mild to moderate to severe depending on the other beta globin variant. Over half of individuals with Hb E plus beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia are transfusion dependent. Heterozygosity for Hb E is an asymptomatic carrier state.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hb M and low oxygen affinity variants</strong> – M Hbs, which cause congenital methemoglobinemia, and low oxygen affinity Hb variants can cause cyanosis in infancy or early childhood.
