         Patients treated with medication and psychotherapy for a psychiatric disorder may be treated by a single clinician, typically a psychiatrist, or by two clinicians, one prescribing medication and the other providing psychotherapy. Provision of the two modalities by two clinicians is often referred to as “split” treatment, while provision by one clinician is described as “integrated” care.
        </p>
        <p>
         The prevalence of split mental health care appears to have risen in recent decades. Potential hazards of split treatment can occur when psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are not well coordinated. They can be avoided if the prescribing physician and the psychotherapist proactively communicate with one another and establish procedures to support an effective collaboration. There are no data from clinical trials comparing the quality or outcomes of care between split versus integrated treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Provision of a patient’s care by two or more clinicians is not unique to mental health care. Care is typically split between primary care and other medical specialists, as well as between physicians and nonmedical clinicians such as physical therapists. This topic emphasizes issues encountered in providing mental health care.

         This topic describes challenges associated with split treatment, and describes approaches to collaboration under this model of care. Other features of the clinician-patient relationship in mental health care are discussed separately. (See

         Split mental health care occurs when a patient receives two or more modalities of treatment from two or more clinicians. Split treatment is most commonly delivered by a:

         – The psychiatrist or other physician (often in primary care) who prescribes medication for the patient’s psychiatric disorder. In some jurisdictions, clinicians other than physicians might be prescribing medications (eg, nurses).

        <p>
         Split treatment has become increasingly common in our experience and supported by limited research. In surveys conducted by the American Psychiatric Association, psychiatrists reported that their patients were additionally treated by a second mental health professional in approximately 5 to 10 percent of cases in the 1980s, 30 to 40 percent in the 1990s [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. In a 2010 survey of psychiatrists, limited by a low response rate, two thirds of respondents’ patients received both medication and psychotherapy, about half from one clinician (the responding psychiatrist) and half in split treatment with the psychiatrist and another clinician [

         Split treatment may also be adopted due to particular treatment considerations. As an example, a psychiatrist providing psychodynamic psychotherapy may prefer to concentrate primarily on the therapy (including the transference generated in that therapy) and leave the complex issue of making prescribing decisions to someone else.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Split treatment is typically contrasted with integrated treatment, where pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are delivered by one clinician, generally a psychiatrist. Integrated treatment avoids the structural challenges to communication and coordination encountered by two clinicians providing care. A clinician who provides both medication and psychotherapy is better situated to understand and address the effects of each, positive and negative. However, there are no clinical trials or rigorous data analyses comparing the quality or outcomes between split and integrated mental health care.

         The prescriber and therapist work at the same ambulatory clinic or single-site group practice. They typically share a number of patients and practice under a common set of expectations. They may be members of a clinical team that treats patients in tandem, participate in a common clinical meeting, and use a single administrative system to schedule and record the completion of encounters. They share a common medical record to document treatment.

         The two clinicians practice at different locations and may never meet face to face. They both are employed by the same organization, such as a health plan or provider network, which integrates one or more aspects of the clinical care they provide. This may be an electronic medical record that allows them to read one another’s progress notes, look up appointments and medications, and leave each other messages. Other components of their respective practices operate independently.

          Differences in clinical presentation

         – The patient may present differently to each clinician. As an example, a depressed patient may appear sadder, more tearful, and hopeless with one, and more positive, energetic, and motivated with the other. These differences could be transient or due to lapses of time between visits or other factors such as transference issues (feelings, attitudes, desires, or fantasies that one person displaces (eg, subconsciously projects) onto another person. In certain types of patients, eg, those with borderline personality disorder, “splitting” can occur, whereby the patient sees significant others in either ideally positive or intensely negative terms.

Health care privacy regulations in the United States allow a clinician or practice to release protected health information upon receiving a request for information from another clinician or practice. We believe that when feasible, clinicians should go beyond this minimal requirement and discuss the sharing of information with the patient before it occurs. Obtaining and documenting the patient’s consent can prevent later disruptions of treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Even after confidentiality has been waived, clinicians should exercise judgement in what personal information (especially from psychotherapy) is shared based on treatment relevance and clinical risk. As an example, certain promiscuous, impulsive, or illegal behaviors from the remote past may not need to be revealed to the other clinician unless this history influences the patient’s current risk status. If the behaviors have recently recurred or changed in frequency or degree, then it is essential to share the information. This should be understood by the patient, and the patient should be notified if such information is going to be shared. Clinicians might ask themselves, “If I were the other treater in this collaboration, what is important for me to know or understand about the patient at this time?”

         The two clinicians under optimal circumstances would have an initial discussion to arrive at some common understanding of the patient. This should include diagnosis, goals of treatment including target symptoms for each modality, and sharing of information about the patient’s current substance use, suicidality, or involvement in an abusive relationship. Furthermore, clinicians should agree on how they will manage nonadherence to either treatment.

         The rise of the internet has provided many new modes through which clinicians can collaborate. Despite these advances, nothing quite replaces face-to-face meetings, which seems the most useful if not the most efficient. Face-to-face meetings allow clinicians to more clearly convey a wider, more complex range of information through body language, tone of voice, posture, and appearance. Even if subsequent meetings occur electronically, an initial, face-to-face meeting between collaborating clinicians can give each a better view of the other. However, a face-to-face meeting is not essential for a successful collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are many more recent, electronic means to collaborate, from telephone calls to video, e-mail, and a shared electronic medical record (EMR) [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Some EMRs allow a clinician to “tag” a clinical note to be sent automatically to other clinicians.
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinician receiving information needs to acknowledge receiving it, and to respond as needed within a reasonable amount of time. In setting up a collaboration, it is important for clinicians to discuss the form(s) of their communications and expectations with respect to response time. Another consideration of electronic communications is to ensure that they remain private and secure.

         The clinicians should make it clear between themselves and communicate to the patient which of the two of them the patient should call in an emergency, during a crisis, or amid a medication change. In some patients, particularly those with personality disorders, these may be complicated issues that need to be discussed in psychotherapy.

         The prescribing physician and the therapist will ideally have or achieve a shared understanding of the effectiveness and limitations of treatments for an individual patient.
        </p>
        <p>
         As an example, the number of medication trials undertaken can sometimes become a matter of disagreement between clinicians [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,28
         </a>
         ]. Patients can be very sensitive to these disagreements.
        </p>
        <p>
         The prescribing physician should in most circumstances undertake a careful and organized series of medication trials to treat distressing symptoms that do not respond to the initial medication. The therapist and patient should understand that once reasonable medication options have been tried the patient will be maintained on the medication and dose that led to the best results.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinical issues that arise may not have an established answer, but need to be resolved for each patient individually. As an example, a patient who is on the medication regimen found to be most effective for their experiences periods of symptom exacerbation every few months and calls one or both clinicians for help. The most effective clinical response is unlikely to be the result of which clinician is reached first (eg, medication and support from the prescribing physician or a psychotherapeutic intervention and support from the therapist). The clinicians would want to discuss and, with the patient, come to a common understanding of factors underlying these crises and the most effective clinical response, with a resulting agreement on which clinician would be contacted and under what circumstances.

          Characteristics of split care

         <strong>
          Efficacy of split care
         </strong>
         – There are no data from clinical trials comparing the quality or outcomes of care between split versus integrated treatment. (See

         The prevalence of split mental health care appears to have risen in recent decades. Limited study has found split treatment to be associated with significant gaps in communication and poor coordination between the prescribing physicians and psychotherapists treating the same patient. (See

          Potential hazards
         </strong>
         – Potential hazards of split treatment stem from inadequate communication between clinicians and insufficient sharing of information about the patient’s clinical status and treatment. Clinicians may have differing perspectives on a shared patient due to the following factors:
