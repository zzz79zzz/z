         Pelvic pain due to endometriosis can be treated with medical therapy, surgical intervention, or a combination of both. In most cases, women with chronic pelvic pain (CPP) thought to be due to endometriosis are initially treated empirically with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5435.html" rel="external">
          "Chronic pelvic pain in adult females: Treatment"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         If these medications do not resolve the pain, laparoscopy is usually performed to determine a definitive diagnosis. If the diagnosis of endometriosis is confirmed at laparoscopy, conservative surgery involving excision, fulguration, or laser vaporization of endometriotic implants and adhesiolysis is often attempted. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16673.html" rel="external">
          "Endometriosis: Surgical management of pelvic pain"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Pain can continue after conservative surgery. Recurrence of endometriosis is estimated as 21.5 percent at two years and 40 to 50 percent at five years after surgery [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. For women with persistent pain or selected patients who have not responded to empiric treatment with NSAIDs or oral contraceptives [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ], administration of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is usually effective.
        </p>
        <p>
         Side effects of GnRH agonists, such as vasomotor symptoms and accelerated bone loss, limit treatment duration to six months. However, treatment can be extended beyond six months if add-back therapy is combined with the GnRH agonist.

         Compared with eutopic endometrium, endometriotic implants are characterized by overproduction of prostaglandins and local production of estrogens and cytokines, which synergize the activities of each other, promote implantation of ectopic endometrium, and cause the pain associated with endometriosis [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. In addition, aromatase overactivity results in increased COX2 expression favoring prostaglandin E production, which, in turn, upregulates estrogen synthesis pathways. Interventions that reduce ovarian estrogen production reduce this synergistic process, thereby reducing or eliminating endometriosis-related pain. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7384.html" rel="external">
          "Endometriosis in adults: Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical impact"

        </p>
        <p>
         The most effective methods for suppressing ovarian estrogen production in women of reproductive age are bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and treatment with a GnRH agonist.

         <strong>
          Salpingo-oophorectomy
         </strong>
         – Bilateral oophorectomy results in a rapid, deep reduction in estrogen to menopausal levels. Cohort studies indicate that hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is highly effective for treatment of pelvic pain caused by endometriosis [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6
         </a>
         ]. However, this procedure induces severe menopausal symptoms and results in sterility. Thus, it is not a practical treatment option for most young women.

         <strong>
          GnRH agonists
         </strong>
         – GnRH agonists are the most widely used hormonal method for suppressing ovarian estrogen production, which is reduced to values found in oophorectomized women. They are highly effective for treatment of pelvic pain caused by endometriosis and have the advantage that their hypoestrogenic effects are largely reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. Menses typically return 60 to 90 days after cessation of intramuscular therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In the United States, three GnRH agonists are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of pelvic pain caused by endometriosis:
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9549" href="/z/d/drug information/9549.html" rel="external">
          leuprolide

          nafarelin

         , and
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8500" href="/z/d/drug information/8500.html" rel="external">
          goserelin
         </a>
         . They are approved for six months of continuous use for this indication but may be repeated or continued for an additional six months. The six-month limitation is due to concern about the significant bone loss that occurs with GnRH agonist therapy. Additional GnRH agonists (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10018" href="/z/d/drug information/10018.html" rel="external">
          triptorelin
         </a>
         ) are available for treatment of prostate cancer; some of these drugs are approved for therapy of endometriosis in other countries (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8867" href="/z/d/drug information/8867.html" rel="external">
          buserelin

         in Canada). Recommended doses for GnRH-agonists are listed in the table  (

         </span>
         GnRH agonists are derived from native GnRH by substituting a D-amino acid for the native L-amino acid at position 6 of the native decapeptide  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73733" href="/z/d/graphic/73733.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). This substitution makes the agonist resistant to degradation by endopeptidases, thereby increasing the half-life and resulting in prolonged receptor occupancy [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         During the first 10 days of treatment with these agents, binding to the GnRH receptor stimulates the pituitary to produce luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Paradoxically, chronic treatment leads to a decrease in pituitary secretion of LH and FSH due to down-regulation of the GnRH receptor and pituitary desensitization. The fall in pituitary LH and FSH secretion suppresses ovarian follicular growth and ovulation, resulting in low levels of circulating estradiol and progesterone. Women chronically treated with clinically effective doses of parenteral GnRH agonists have circulating estradiol concentrations in the range of menopausal women, approximately 15 pg/mL.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, GnRH agonists may have direct effects on the endometrium. GnRH receptors are present in endometrial cells and a study in cultured endometrioma cell lines reported increasing concentrations of

         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Signs and symptoms include amenorrhea, vasomotor symptoms, sleep disturbance due to hot flashes, urogenital atrophy, and accelerated bone loss. Over 80 percent of women treated with leuprolide report vasomotor symptoms, approximately 30 percent report vaginal symptoms (eg, vaginitis) and 30 percent report headaches [

          Bone loss
         </strong>
         – The potential for bone loss is a major concern, as accelerated bone loss during treatment of women in their 20s and 30s may increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures when these women reach their 60s and 70s.

         <strong>
          Concern for cardiovascular effects
         </strong>
         – In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning that men receiving GnRH agonists for prostate cancer were at a small increased risk for diabetes, heart attack, stroke, and sudden death [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. There is no evidence that these drugs have similar risks in women being treated for endometriosis. Women being treated for endometriosis are much younger than men being treated for prostate cancer, and the doses of GnRH agonists used to treat endometriosis are lower than those used to treat prostate cancer. Given the low baseline risk of cardiovascular disease in young women, a small increase in risk from use of GnRH agonists would be difficult to detect, even in large epidemiological studies. Nonetheless, given the FDA advisory, treating for no longer than a year with hormonal add-back and six months without hormonal add-back would seem prudent.

         Treatment with a GnRH agonist reduces endometriosis disease activity as objectively measured by pretreatment and posttreatment surgical staging, and subjectively decreases pelvic pain [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,14-19
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in one trial, 52 women with surgically proven endometriosis and pelvic pain were randomly assigned to receive
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9549" href="/z/d/drug information/9549.html" rel="external">
          leuprolide

         acetate (3.75 mg intramuscularly) or a placebo injection every four weeks for six months [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Eighty-two percent of women treated with leuprolide acetate completed the trial and 85 percent of these women reported a significant decrease in dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, and dyspareunia. By comparison, 95 percent of women treated with placebo left the clinical trial because of continuing pelvic pain.

         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. However, the side effect profile of danazol is worse than that of GnRH agonists. This was illustrated in a trial of 213 women with surgically proven endometriosis who were randomly assigned to receive danazol (800 mg orally) or one of two doses of nasal

         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. The three regimens had similar efficacy: over 80 percent of subjects had symptomatic relief of pelvic pain and objective improvement of endometriosis lesions (documented by pre- and posttreatment surgical staging). The main difference between the drugs was in the type and severity of side effects: danazol administration was associated with weight gain, edema, myalgia, increased circulating levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and decreased levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The most common side effects associated with nafarelin were hot flashes, decreased libido, and vaginal dryness; HDL cholesterol, AST, and ALT were not affected. Bone density was not measured.

         is that the hypoestrogenic side effects associated with GnRH agonists can be minimized by add-back therapy, while androgenic side effects associated with danazol are more difficult to treat.

         Whether GnRH agonist therapy is useful postoperatively in women with stage III-IV endometriosis is controversial. A small retrospective study of 90 women with stage III-IV endometriosis included 16 women who received no postoperative medical therapy, 52 women who received gestrinone, and 22 women who received a GnRH agonist [

The cumulative pregnancy rates were 70 percent (7/10), 66.7 percent (10/15), and 60 percent (6/10), respectively. This study did not show improvement in pregnancy rates with endocrine therapy after conservative surgery.

         While postoperative GnRH agonist therapy does not appear to improve pregnancy rates, there is evidence that it might delay the recurrence of symptoms. It has been appreciated that GnRH agonist therapy is not useful for the treatment of infertility as the lesions are suppressed while on therapy, but "reactivate" soon after ovarian function returns [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. After surgical management, the recurrence of disease or symptoms may result from recurrence of the treated lesions or further progression of the microscopic lesions that were not treated at the time of surgery. Recurrence rates after either surgical or medical therapy are reported to be up to 45 percent after five years [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. For young women under the age of 21 years old diagnosed with endometriosis at laparoscopy during a five-year follow-up, 56 percent had recurrence of their symptoms. There was felt to be no association observed between the symptoms with the extent or site of the disease, the type of surgery or whether there was postsurgical medical treatment [

         Many women experience hypoestrogenic side effects during GnRH agonist therapy and recurrence of pain after discontinuation. Investigators have attempted to improve patient acceptance and extend duration of use by giving concomitant medications (called add-back therapy) to reduce the severity of the hypoestrogenic side effects induced by the treatment and improve quality of life  (

         Add-back with low dose estrogen (0.625 mg) was more effective than with higher dose estrogen (1.25 mg). The group taking higher dose estrogen was more likely than other groups to discontinue treatment due to pelvic pain, probably because the higher dose estrogen stimulated continued functioning and growth of the endometriosis implants.

         Some women do not tolerate a high dose progestin add-back regimen because of progestin-related symptoms such as mood changes, weight gain, and bloating. The FDA has not approved a regimen of GnRH agonist with low dose estrogen plus low dose progestin add-back for treatment of pelvic pain caused by endometriosis; however, numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that this combination is effective in the treatment of pelvic pain caused by endometriosis and with a reduction in side effects observed with GnRH agonist-only treatment (eg, vasomotor symptoms, reduction in bone mineral density) [

         This study suggests that control of symptoms and disease activity can be achieved and induction of hypoestrogenic side effects reduced by administering a GnRH agonist plus low dose estrogen-progestin add-back. Of some concern, bone mineral density loss occurred despite administration of very low doses of these hormones  (

         There are minimal data on estrogen-only add-back.

         The most common regimen for add-back is to begin GnRH agonist therapy with steroid add-back at the same time. The advantage of this approach is that it will markedly reduce the likelihood that the woman will experience vasomotor symptoms and maximally preserves bone density. However, multiple drugs are initiated at once, a situation that might not be acceptable to all patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         Alternatively, one can administer a GnRH agonist alone for one to six months; then, if the intent is to continue GnRH agonist therapy, steroid add-back is begun. The advantages of this approach are that it allows the clinician time to determine if treatment with GnRH will be successful and to gauge the severity of the individual woman's hypoestrogenic side effects. Given the reduction in vasomotor symptoms and the preservation of bone density with concurrent initiation of add-back with the GnRH agonist, we favor starting add-back with the agonist in most circumstances.

         We do not recommend extension of GnRH analog therapy with add-back beyond 12 months (or beyond 6 months if GnRH agonist therapy is used alone).

         200 mcg [1 spray into a nostril] in the morning and again at night). After one to three months, suppression of ovarian estrogen secretion and amenorrhea will have been achieved in most patients and pelvic pain should be improved. At this point, the dose of nafarelin can be decreased to two nasal sprays on even days and one nasal spray on odd days of the month. This is an approximately 25 percent reduction in the dose of GnRH agonist.

         At this lower dose, many women will note fewer vasomotor symptoms, but with continued amenorrhea and relief of pelvic pain. A small number of women can reduce the dose of

The cell proliferation index was significantly reduced in the epithelium and stroma of both eutopic and ectopic endometrium in both treatment groups. Only the IUD users had an increased histologic score for Fas (which stimulates cell death through apoptosis [

In eutopic endometrium, both treatments lowered expression of estrogen receptor-alpha and progesterone receptor-alpha, whereas in ectopic endometrium, only LNG IUD treatment lowered expression. These results support that, unexpectedly, the "local" application of a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD produced therapeutic effects on the ectopic endometrium and an even greater apoptotic effect than a GnRH agonist.

         <strong>
          Use of GnRH agonist
         </strong>
         – For women with chronic endometriosis-related pelvic pain unresponsive to oral contraceptives or progestins, we suggest a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist rather than
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9321" href="/z/d/drug information/9321.html" rel="external">

          Grade 2B

         ). GnRH agonists have a more favorable side effect profile and, unlike oophorectomy, do not impair fertility. (See

         <strong>
          Role of add-back therapy
         </strong>
         – Add-back therapy results in fewer vasomotor symptoms and less bone loss than when a GnRH agonist is used as monotherapy. Several add-back options are available  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58788" href="/z/d/graphic/58788.html" rel="external">
          table 3
