         The pulmonary artery catheter (PAC; Swan-Ganz or right heart catheter) can be used for a variety of clinical purposes. Interpreting hemodynamic data from PACs is important for the diagnosis and management of a range of conditions including shock and pulmonary artery hypertension  (

         ).
        </p>

         The interpretation of hemodynamic values and pressure tracings derived from the PAC is described in this topic. The insertion technique, indications, contraindications, and complications of PACs are discussed separately. (See

         Certain steps must be performed before a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is used to measure hemodynamic variables. These steps include zeroing, referencing, ensuring the catheter is in the correct position, and assessing the dynamic response using the "fast-flush" test.

         The PAC must be appropriately zeroed and referenced to obtain accurate readings [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Zeroing and referencing are generally performed with the patient lying in the supine position. Occasionally, in patients who cannot lie flat, zeroing and referencing are performed in the semi-recumbent position at approximately 30 degrees. Importantly, zeroing and referencing should be done prior to placement and repeated when time has elapsed between one set of measurements and another, especially if the patient’s position has been moved.

         Once the PAC has been zeroed and referenced, it is positioned using either pressure waveform or fluoroscopic guidance. Transesophageal echo has also been used to facilitate placement of the PAC [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. When the correct position has been confirmed, the arterial waveform and the right atrial pressure waveforms are simultaneously recorded with the pulmonary artery pressure (balloon deflated) or pulmonary artery wedge pressure waveforms (balloon inflated). Detailed discussion of correct PAC placement is provided separately. (See

         Following catheter placement, the dynamic response of the monitoring system to pressure should be assessed. This can be done at the bedside using the "fast-flush" test, which involves briefly opening and closing the valve in the continuous flush device [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3

         ]. The shape of the dynamic response can be interpreted as normal, under damped or over damped  (

         Under damped waveform – Underdamping exists if there is excessive ringing following the square wave displacement. Common causes of underdamping include tubing connected with stopcocks, excessive tubing lengths, and patient factors (eg, tachycardia, high output states). These factors should be systematically addressed.

         Over damped waveform – Overdamping exists if there is no ringing following the square wave displacement. The most common cause of overdamping is air bubbles in the tubing, which can be cleared by flushing the system through the stopcock. Additional causes include overly compliant tubing, kinked catheters, blood clot within the tubing, no fluid, or low flush bag pressure, which can generally be eliminated by changing the equipment.

         Two pressures are typically measured from the right ventricular (RV) pressure waveform, the peak right ventricular systolic pressure and the right ventricular end-diastolic pressure. These values cannot be measured from an indwelling pulmonary artery catheter; rather, they are measured during catheter insertion using the distal tip of the catheter. (See

         On the RV pressure waveform, ventricular systole is represented by a prominent upstroke and downstroke, while ventricular diastole is represented by a more gradual upstroke that consists of an early rapid filling phase (during which approximately 60 percent of filling occurs), a slow filling phase (during which another 25 percent of filling occurs), and an atrial systolic phase (which produces the a wave in the RV tracing). End diastole occurs immediately after the a wave. An illustrative RV pressure waveform is shown in the figure  (

         Importantly, many of these conditions may transiently elevate the PA pressure such that the clinician should be aware of any underlying pathologies that may explain an elevated reading. As an example, PA pressure may be elevated acutely by thromboembolism or hypoxemic-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction but may revert back to chronic levels or normal once the acute issue has resolved. Fluctuations in the PA pressure may be seen in irregular heart rhythms (eg, atrial fibrillation) because of variability in the diastolic filling time.
        </p>
        <p>
         PA systolic pressure, like RV systolic pressure, rarely exceeds 40 to 50 mmHg in acute conditions (eg, pulmonary embolism) whereas severe elevations &gt;50 mmHg are classically due to chronic conditions such as PH.

         </span>
         The pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [PCWP] or pulmonary artery wedge pressure [PAWP]) estimates the left atrial pressure. It is best measured with the patient in the supine position, at the end of expiration with the tip of the catheter in zone 3 of the lung. Ideally, the value is measured at least three times and the mean is calculated.
        </p>
        <p>
         The PAOP tracing is obtained by inflating the balloon at the distal tip of the catheter. The balloon obstructs blood flow through a branch of the pulmonary artery. This creates a static column of blood between the catheter tip and the left atrium. Pressure at both ends of the column equilibrates, after which the pressure at the distal end of the catheter is equal to the pressure of the left atrium [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Thus, PAOP is a reflection of left atrial pressure. Normal wedge pressures vary from 6 to 15 mmHg, with a mean of 9 mmHg  (

         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, the PAOP usually estimates the left ventricular end-diastolic
         <strong>
          pressure
         </strong>
         (ie, left ventricular preload) if there is no obstruction to flow between the left atrium and left ventricle and the compliance of the left ventricle is normal. Importantly, it does
         <strong>
          not

         directly measure the left ventricular end-diastolic volume, capillary hydrostatic pressure, or transmural pressures [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-10
         </a>
         ]. Thus, the PAOP may not reliably indicate left ventricular preload when compliance of the left ventricle is abnormal (eg, large myocardial infarction or in cardiac tamponade). (See

         The PAOP is only reflective of left atrial pressure if the inflated catheter balloon is fully occlusive. If the balloon is not fully occlusive, the reading will partially reflect the pulmonary artery pressure and will overestimate the PAOP. This can occur despite confirmation of PAOP occlusion by hemodynamic waveform and fluoroscopy. When accurate PAOP measurement is necessary to diagnose pre- versus post-capillary pulmonary hypertension, the addition of checking an occlusion oxygen saturation can improve accuracy. When the balloon is inflated, an oxygen saturation is measured and if it is &gt;90 percent or within 5 percent of systemic saturation, the PAOP is recorded. If the PAOP saturation is not near systemic saturation, the occlusion should be reattempted [

         Regardless of the mode of ventilation, PAOP should be measured at end-expiration to avoid the effects of respiration on PAOP measurements. Intrathoracic pressure (ie, alveolar and pleural pressure) changes with the respiratory cycle; it exerts pressure on the intravascular space within the lung, and consequently, affects PAOP, in a way that is dynamic throughout the respiratory cycle. Thus, during spontaneous breathing, pleural and alveolar pressures (relative to atmospheric pressure) decrease during inspiration and increase during expiration to similarly affect the PAOP. Conversely, during positive pressure ventilation, pleural and alveolar pressure increase during inspiration and decrease during expiration. However, at end-expiration, all intrathoracic pressures are equal to atmospheric pressure which allows the PAOP to be accurately measured regardless of whether the patient is spontaneously breathing or mechanically ventilated.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the past, many ICU monitors measured PAOP by manually moving a cursor to end-expiration on the peak component of the pressure waveform which introduced error. However, many intensive care and cardiac catheterization units now use electronic pressure monitors that are designed to measure pressure in time intervals of four seconds and to display three different pressures: the systolic (peak), diastolic (trough), and mean pressure. The PAOP pressure can be followed serially on such monitors and measured at end expiration by selecting the systolic (peak) pressure for those breathing spontaneously (with positive intrathoracic pressure at end-expiration) and the diastolic pressure (trough) for those who are receiving positive pressure ventilation (with the intrathoracic positive pressure nadir at end-expiration)  (

         Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) prevents alveolar pressure from returning to atmospheric pressure at end-expiration. The effects of PEEP on the PAOP are variable and depend largely upon the compliance of the lung, regardless of whether the PEEP was applied therapeutically (ie, applied or extrinsic PEEP) or the result of incomplete expiration and air trapping (ie, auto-PEEP or intrinsic PEEP).

         If the catheter is properly positioned in zone 3, the airway pressure should not be transmitted to the vasculature. Respiratory variation of the PAOP waveform that is greater than respiratory variation of the pulmonary artery pressure waveform suggests that the catheter may not be in zone 3 and, therefore, the PAOP may be unreliable and should be repositioned  (

         </strong>
         left atrial and ventricular filling pressure (ie, the intravascular pressure necessary to filling the left heart) that theoretically should not be affected by PEEP with a properly positioned catheter tip under zone 3 conditions. (See

         If excessive PEEP is a concern, PAOP can be estimated by subtracting one-half of the PEEP level from the PAOP if lung compliance is normal, or one-quarter of the PEEP level if lung compliance is reduced [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. As an example, for a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome (decreased lung compliance) who is receiving an applied PEEP of 10 cm H
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         O and has a PAOP of 12 mmHg, the recalculated PAOP would be 9.5 mmHg. This small difference indicates that the effects of PEEP on PAOP are usually small and, therefore, unlikely to affect clinical management. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1628.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Even though PEEP affects intravascular pressure measurements, it is not advisable to eliminate (ie, turn off) PEEP temporarily while pressure measurements are being made. Doing so may reduce the benefits of PEEP and induce hemodynamic instability due to changes in venous return and the arterial oxygen tension (PaO

         ). The causes of a low cardiac output include systolic and diastolic heart failure, but also include severe forms of mitral valve regurgitation, hypovolemia, pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular failure. Distinguishing these pathologies from one another depends upon presenting clinical and echocardiographic features and well as specific patterns of physiologic variables seen on the PAC  (

         The indicator thermodilution principle predicts that, when an indicator substance is added to a stream of flowing blood, the blood flow rate will be inversely proportional to the mean concentration of the indicator at a downstream site. In the case of thermodilution, the indicator is approximately 5 mL of either dextrose or

         that is cooler than blood. It is injected as a bolus through the proximal port of the PAC, where it mixes with blood in the right ventricle. The mixing lowers the temperature of intraventricular blood. As the blood flows past the distal thermistor port located in the tip of the catheter in the pulmonary artery, the thermistor records the temperature change over time and can electronically display a temperature-time curve. The area under this curve is inversely proportional to the flow rate in the pulmonary artery, which is determined by the cardiac output of the left ventricle. This flow rate is considered an estimate of cardiac output, assuming that there is no intracardiac shunt.

         The thermodilution method has been well-validated, as compared with the calculation of cardiac output using the Fick method. However, there are several important sources of error of which clinicians should be aware:

         Tricuspid regurgitation leads to an underestimation of CO. This is a consequence of the cold injectate refluxing back into the vena cava, with resultant decreased pulmonary artery cooling (attenuated peak) and delayed appearance of injectate that has moved retrograde into the vena cava and is then recirculated (prolonged washout).

         Right-to-left and left-to-right intracardiac shunts can produce falsely elevated cardiac output measurements by the thermodilution technique. Right-to-left intracardiac shunts produce shunting of cold injectate into the left heart, which reduces pulmonary artery cooling, attenuates the peak of the temperature-time curve, and overestimates cardiac output. Left-to-right intracardiac shunts produce increased right heart volumes and dilution of the injectate, which attenuates the height of the temperature-time curve and results in an overestimation of CO.

         Blood sampling from the right atrium (RA), right ventricle (RV), pulmonary artery (PA), superior vena cava (SVC), and inferior vena cava (IVC) is helpful when evaluating a suspected left-to-right intracardiac shunt (eg, from atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects). Sampling is typically performed during insertion of the catheter under fluoroscopic guidance to ensure that samples are drawn from the proper sites. Detection of an oxygen saturation "step-up" allows confirmation of the shunt and determination of its location [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21,22
         </a>
         ]. A step-up is defined as &gt;10 percent rise in oxygen saturation, when the saturation of blood in the RA, RV, or PA is compared to the calculated mixed venous oxygen saturation (taken from the SVC and IVC).
        </p>
        <p>
         The mixed venous oxygen saturation is calculated as follows:

They are also the most sensitive to minor inaccuracies in data acquisition. Nonetheless, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) can provide valuable information when distinguishing the classes of shock from each other  (

          Ensuring accurate measurements

         – Certain steps must be performed before a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC; also called a Swan-Ganz or right heart catheter) is used to measure hemodynamic variables. The steps include zeroing, referencing, ensuring the catheter is in the correct position, and assessing the dynamic response using the "fast-flush" test. (See

          Right atrium

          table 2

         ). Elevated RA pressures can be caused by several conditions including diseases of the right ventricle, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonic stenosis, left-to-right shunts, tricuspid valvular disease, cardiac tamponade, constrictive and restrictive cardiomyopathies, left ventricle systolic heart failure, and hypervolemia. Differentiating among the etiologies depends upon clinical, radiographic, and echocardiographic features as well as additional supportive readings or waveforms measured on PAC  (

          Right ventricle
         </strong>
         – Normal right ventricular (RV) systolic pressure ranges from 15 to 25 mmHg and normal RV end-diastolic pressure ranges from 3 to 12 mmHg  (

         ). As a general rule, elevations in RV pressure are associated with diseases that elevate the pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonic valve disorders, and diseases that primarily affect the right ventricle. Severe elevations in RV pressure are generally associated with chronic conditions (eg, idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension) while acute conditions rarely raise the RV systolic pressure above 40 mmHg (eg, acute pulmonary embolism).

         – Normal pulmonary artery (PA) systolic pressures range from 15 to 25 mmHg, while PA diastolic pressures range from 8 to 15 mmHg; the mean PA pressure (mPAp) is typically 16 mmHg (10 to 22 mmHg)  (

         ). The mean PA pressure can be elevated (eg, mPAp, &gt;22 mmHg) by acute conditions (eg, venous thromboembolism or hypoxemic-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction) or acute-on-chronic conditions (eg, hypoxemic-induced vasoconstriction in a patient with underlying chronic cardiopulmonary disease). Additionally, chronic conditions including idiopathic pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension [PH] due to left heart disease, chronic lung disease, chronic thromboembolism, and other miscellaneous causes can elevate the PA pressure; when the mPAp is ≥20 mmHg, this is known as pulmonary arterial hypertension.

          Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure
         </strong>
         – The PAC can measure the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [PCWP]; pulmonary artery occlusion pressure). PAOP is best measured with the patient in the supine position, at the end of expiration with the tip of the catheter in zone 3 of the lung (ie, region of lung below left atrium). Any condition that raises left ventricular end-diastolic pressure results in an elevated wedge pressure including left ventricular systolic heart failure, left ventricular diastolic heart failure, mitral and aortic valve disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; hypervolemia, right-to-left shunts, cardiac tamponade, and constrictive and restrictive cardiomyopathies.

          Cardiac output
         </strong>
         – The PAC measures the cardiac output (CO) via either the indicator thermodilution method or the Fick method. The preferred expression of CO is the cardiac index [CI], which is calculated by dividing the CO by the body surface area. Normal hemodynamic measures for CI are 2.8 to 4.2 L/min/m

         ). The causes of a low cardiac output include systolic and diastolic heart failure, but also include severe forms of mitral valve regurgitation, hypovolemia, pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular failure.

          Shunt detection
         </strong>
         – Detection of an oxygen saturation "step-up" on PAC allows confirmation of a suspected left-to-right shunt and determination of its location by measuring oxygen saturation from the RA, RV, PA, superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC). A step-up is defined as &gt;10 percent rise in oxygen saturation, when the saturation of blood in the RA, RV, or PA is compared to the calculated mixed venous oxygen saturation (taken from the SVC and IVC).
