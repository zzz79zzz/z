         Anemia is common among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Anemia underlies many of the symptoms associated with reduced kidney function and is associated with increased mortality and hospitalizations [

         Anemia is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a hemoglobin (Hb) concentration &lt;13.0 g/dL for adult males and postmenopausal women and an Hb &lt;12.0 g/dL for premenopausal women [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5

         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7133.html" rel="external">
          "Diagnostic approach to anemia in adults", section on 'Caveats for normal ranges'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the WHO definition of anemia does not define goals of treatment among patients with CKD. Thus, even when adequately treated, many patients with CKD will have anemia as defined above. This is because the treatment of anemia involves erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs); multiple studies have now shown that targeting a normal Hb with ESAs increases risks of adverse outcomes. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Target hemoglobin value'

         Anemia is common among patients with nondialysis CKD, and the prevalence increases as the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) declines [

          6-8

As an example, based upon over 15,000 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the prevalence of anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] &lt;12 g/dL in men and &lt;11 g/dL in women) increased from 1 percent among patients with an estimated GFR (eGFR) of 60 mL/min/1.73 m

         All patients with CKD should be evaluated for anemia with a complete blood count (CBC).
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who are found to be anemic should be evaluated for the cause. Patients may have anemia related to CKD but are also at risk for all the other causes of anemia that occur in the general population. The initial evaluation of anemia is generally the same for patients with CKD as in the general population. The evaluation should include CBC, red blood cell (RBC) indices, reticulocyte count, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), percent transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum ferritin, serum folate and vitamin B12 levels, and testing for occult blood in stool.

         After the initial evaluation, we continue to routinely monitor all patients with CKD for anemia and, if anemia is present, for iron deficiency. We monitor for anemia with hemoglobin (Hb) concentration. Screening tests for iron deficiency are discussed elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1943.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         The frequency of monitoring varies based upon the presence of anemia on initial evaluation, trends in Hb concentration over time, whether or not patients are treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), and upon the severity of CKD. The following approach is largely consistent with the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines [

         Iron studies should be similarly monitored if iron deficiency is present at initial evaluation. Hb and iron studies are also generally measured after blood loss or surgery. (See

         Among patients who are started on an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) or in whom the dose has been increased, we measure the Hb every two to four weeks while the ESA is being initiated and at least every three months thereafter. However, recommendations from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are for more frequent testing.

        <p>
         We generally screen such patients for iron deficiency every three months. Patients who have marginal iron status, or those with declining serum ferritin or TSAT levels on initial screen, should be screened every two to three months. (See

        <p>
         The 2012 KDIGO and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines suggest evaluating iron status at least every three months during ESA treatment and more frequently when increasing the ESA dose or monitoring the response to intravenous iron or when there is blood loss or other circumstances (eg, hospitalization) when iron stores may be depleted [

         Patients who have certain comorbidities (eg, being bedbound or with very limited functional capacity, dementia, etc) that make them unlikely to derive the same benefit from ESAs as someone who is more active and symptomatic from anemia. We avoid use of ESAs in such patients unless there is a need to improve Hb sufficiently to achieve a specific clinical goal (eg, to minimize hospitalizations for transfusions, optimize management of heart failure) that cannot be achieved with iron supplementation alone.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Among patients with TSAT ≤20 percent and ferritin ≤500 ng/mL, we usually administer iron before giving an ESA since they may respond to iron with an increase in Hb. If the response to iron supplementation is adequate, then we do not use ESA in such patients.

        <p>
         We are attentive to possible symptoms of anemia in younger patients who have CKD with few comorbidities, whose symptoms of anemia may occur at higher Hb levels. For such patients, we may initiate ESAs at Hb levels of 10 g/dL or even higher after discussing potential risks and benefits with each patient.
        </p>
        <p>
         The administration of ESAs has substantially reduced the need for red cell transfusions (with an attendant decrease in and/or risk for transfusion-related complications). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1935.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         However, the Hb concentration at which to initiate ESAs is not known with certainty, and the safety of ESAs in treating even severe anemia has not been evaluated in large, placebo-controlled trials. We agree with the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines that the potential benefits of reducing blood transfusions and anemia-related symptoms should be balanced against the harm in individual patients (such as stroke, vascular access loss, and hypertension) [

          14,15

         ]. Intravenous and subcutaneous administration of darbepoetin are of similar efficacy.

         The initial dose for epoetin is approximately 50 to 100 units/kg/week. However, the use of lower doses would also be reasonable, particularly in patients with pretreatment Hb levels near 10 g/dL.

         In practice, most patients are dosed by unit dosing (eg, a vial), rather than on a strict unit/kg basis. Thus, we initiate therapy in most patients beginning at 4000 or 10,000 units subcutaneously once weekly or 10,000 to 20,000 units subcutaneously every other week.

         For most patients with nondialysis CKD who are treated with ESAs, we maintain Hb levels between 10 and 11.5 g/dL using the lowest possible ESA dose. We individualize therapy in some patients who may have improvements in quality of life at Hb ≥11.5 g/dL and will be prepared to accept the possible risks associated with higher Hb targets. We do not target Hb concentration &gt;13 g/dL.
        </p>
        <p>
         The optimal target Hb level for patients with CKD is not well defined. Our target Hb range reflects the results of clinical studies and recognizes that anemia treatment should be individualized. The US FDA boxed warning on ESAs states that Hb targets &gt;11 g/dL are not recommended [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. While this recommendation is appropriate for most patients, our upper target Hb limit of 11.5 g/dL acknowledges that some patients may have better anemia symptom control and quality of life (eg, improved exercise capacity) with Hb &gt;11 g/dL and is based on Hb concentrations generally not exceeding 11.5 g/dL in the control group of major randomized controlled trials. Our practice is consistent with the KDIGO 2012 guidelines [

The mean achieved Hb level was 12.5 g/dL and 10.6 g/dL in the darbepoetin and placebo groups, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
         At a median follow-up of 29 months, both groups had similar risks of death or a cardiovascular event or death or ESKD. However, there was an increased risk of fatal or nonfatal stroke with

Fatigue was only modestly less common with darbepoetin. There was also an increased risk of death due to malignancy in the darbepoetin group, primarily in patients with a past history of malignancy.

        <p>
         In the TREAT and other trials comparing lower and higher Hb targets in patients with CKD, the patients were diabetic, and many had preexisting cardiovascular disease, likely contributing to a high rate of adverse outcomes. In another, smaller trial of patients without diabetes treated with

          Epidemiology
         </strong>
         – Anemia is common among patients with nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD). The prevalence increases as the glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) decline. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Epidemiology'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Anemia surveillance
         </strong>
         – All patients with CKD should be evaluated and monitored for anemia. The frequency of monitoring varies based upon the presence of anemia on initial evaluation, whether or not patients are treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), and upon the severity of CKD. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Surveillance'
         </a>
         above.)

          Treatment –
         </strong>
         The treatment of anemia among patients with nondialysis CKD should be individualized.

         <strong>
          Indications
         </strong>
         – For most patients with CKD, we suggest initiating ESAs when the hemoglobin (Hb) level is &lt;10 g/dL, providing the transferrin saturation (TSAT) is &gt;20 percent and ferritin &gt;200 ng/mL (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). An important exception is among patients with an active malignancy or recent history of malignancy, particularly those in whom cure is anticipated, or who have had a stroke since such patients may be at higher risk for adverse effects from ESAs. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Indications and contraindications'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          ESA administration and dosing
         </strong>
         – For most patients who are selected for ESA treatment, we suggest subcutaneous rather than intravenous ESA administration (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). The initial dose of epoetin is approximately 50 to 100 units/kg/week and of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8662" href="/z/d/drug information/8662.html" rel="external">
          darbepoetin
         </a>
         is 40 to 100 mcg every two to four weeks. Further titration is based on Hb response. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Route of administration'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Target hemoglobin
         </strong>
         – The optimal target Hb level for patients with CKD is not well defined. For most patients with CKD who are not on dialysis and are on ESAs, we suggest maintaining Hb levels between 10.0 and 11.5 g/dL (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Hb targets &gt;13 g/dL are associated with adverse outcomes. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Target hemoglobin value'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors
         </strong>
         – We do not use hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF PHIs) to treat anemia in patients with CKD who are not on dialysis. Compared with ESAs, HIF PHIs may be associated with higher rates of major adverse cardiovascular events in this population.
