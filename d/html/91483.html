In developed countries, the most common valve lesions are aortic stenosis (AS) due to calcific disease (affecting a trileaflet or bicuspid valve), and mitral regurgitation (MR) due to primary causes that include degenerative disease or secondary functional causes such as ischemic heart disease or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108930" href="/d/graphic/108930.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Patients often have both stenosis and regurgitation affecting a single cardiac valve, as well as more than one affected valve.

However, a total intravenous anesthetic (TIVA) technique, or a combination of inhalation and intravenous (IV) agents are reasonable alternatives. For example, a continuous infusion of a potent synthetic opioid (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9954" href="/d/drug information/9954.html" rel="external">sufentanil</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9854" href="/d/drug information/9854.html" rel="external">remifentanil</a>), short to moderate duration sedation (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9650" href="/d/drug information/9650.html" rel="external">midazolam</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9826" href="/d/drug information/9826.html" rel="external">propofol</a>) and neuromuscular blocking agent (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10041" href="/d/drug information/10041.html" rel="external">vecuronium</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9872" href="/d/drug information/9872.html" rel="external">rocuronium</a>) provide a hemodynamically stable anesthetic before during and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with rapid clearance after discontinuation of administration of each agent. Low doses of volatile anesthetic agents with a short duration can be added when necessary to smooth out the hemodynamic responses to stimulation. Depth of anesthesia monitoring (eg, bispectral index monitoring) is recommended, especially during bypass, when using this infusion regimen. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/126473.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for cardiac surgery: General principles", section on 'Maintenance of general anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3846191854"><span class="h1">TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY: GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is typically used to confirm and characterize cardiac valve pathology before cardiac valve procedures, monitor air removal after open cardiotomy, and assess the adequacy of the repaired or replaced valve(s) [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. Observational data suggest that intraoperative TEE for cardiac valve surgery may improve outcomes. A matched cohort study of 872,936 patients undergoing open cardiac valve surgery and/or proximal aortic surgery from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) database found that intraoperative TEE was associated with lower 30-day mortality (3.81 versus 5.27 percent; odds ratio [OR] 0.69, 95% CI 0.67-0.72) compared with not using TEE [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Composite outcomes were also lower in patients who received intraoperative TEE, including stroke or 30-day mortality (5.56 versus 7.01 percent; OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.74-0.79), and reoperation or 30-day mortality (7.18 versus 8.87 percent; OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.76-0.80). Results were similar for within hospital, within surgeon matched analyses. These findings suggest, but do not prove, important clinical benefits from intraoperative TEE in patients undergoing cardiac valve surgery and/or proximal aortic surgery. We employ intraoperative TEE for patients undergoing surgical cardiac valve repair or replacement or proximal aortic surgery. </p><p>Preoperative evaluation of valve structure and function, associated lesions, hemodynamics, and ventricular function with transthoracic echocardiography and TEE is discussed in the preoperative sections below, as well as in individual topic reviews. Precautions and contraindications for use of TEE are similar to those for patients undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14943.html" rel="external">"Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography for noncardiac surgery", section on 'Contraindications and precautions'</a>.) </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prebypass period</strong> – After initial probe insertion, TEE examination enables confirmation of the preoperative diagnoses and refinement of the operative plan (eg, valve repair versus replacement) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Notably, intraoperative assessment of the severity of cardiac valve stenosis and/or regurgitation may differ from preoperative assessments due to hemodynamic changes that occur with induction of general anesthesia [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. For example, reduced systemic blood pressure (BP) decreases severity of aortic regurgitation (AR) and/or mitral regurgitation (MR), while reduced cardiac output (CO) decreases the gradients across stenotic valves.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The structure and function of all other cardiac valves are also assessed. It is critically important to note significant (ie, more than mild) AR since this will limit delivery of adequate antegrade cardioplegia solution into the coronary artery ostia after cross-clamping the ascending aorta, with much of the cardioplegia solution regurgitating back through the incompetent aortic valve into the left ventricle (LV). Consequences include failure to achieve cardioplegia as well as distention of the LV. Management of significant AR during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) typically includes use of alternative methods for delivery of cardioplegia (eg, retrograde cardioplegia) as well as insertion of an LV vent to maintain LV decompression (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/130764.html" rel="external">"Management of special populations during cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass", section on 'Aortic regurgitation'</a>). In addition, significant AR is a relative contraindication to the placement of an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) because the degree of regurgitation may be increased by diastolic balloon inflation during counterpulsation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1482.html" rel="external">"Intraaortic balloon pump counterpulsation", section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A comprehensive TEE examination is also performed to identify other pathology (eg, a coexisting patent foramen ovale that will be repaired during planned open cardiotomy) and assessment of global and regional ventricular function  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104113" href="/d/graphic/104113.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104112" href="/d/graphic/104112.html" rel="external">figure 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef109762" href="/d/graphic/109762.html" rel="external">movie 1</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Patients with significant LV or right ventricular (RV) systolic dysfunction may require intraoperative inotropic support  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104531" href="/d/graphic/104531.html" rel="external">movie 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104144" href="/d/graphic/104144.html" rel="external">movie 3</a>). This initial assessment of both regional and global biventricular function, as well as intravascular volume status  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104149" href="/d/graphic/104149.html" rel="external">movie 4</a>), allows comparisons during subsequent continuous TEE monitoring.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Removal of air after open cardiotomy</strong> – Air accumulates in the left heart chambers during aortic or mitral valve repair or replacement. TEE is employed to identify air in the cardiac chambers, with ongoing monitoring to guide its removal via surgical venting. In particular, air accumulates in the pulmonary veins, the left atrial appendage, the dome of the left atrium (LA), and the LV apex. Any intracardiac air may embolize to the coronary, cerebral, and other vital organ arteries once the aortic cross-clamp is removed and the heart begins to contract  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114097" href="/d/graphic/114097.html" rel="external">movie 5</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114100" href="/d/graphic/114100.html" rel="external">movie 6</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114098" href="/d/graphic/114098.html" rel="external">movie 7</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114099" href="/d/graphic/114099.html" rel="external">movie 8</a>). Thus, it is important to remove nearly all air prior to allowing full ventricular ejection during weaning from CPB in order to avoid or minimize arterial embolization. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/115472.html" rel="external">"Intraoperative problems after cardiopulmonary bypass", section on 'Arterial air embolization'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Retained air may be eliminated via a vent/catheter in the aortic root as well as via an LV vent catheter, just prior to and following removal of the aortic cross-clamp. The right coronary artery is in a superior or nondependent position when a patient is supine; thus, air preferentially enters the right coronary artery, which may cause ischemia of the RV and inferior wall of the LV, as well as arrhythmias (particularly heart block)  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114097" href="/d/graphic/114097.html" rel="external">movie 5</a>). The de-airing process is monitored with TEE  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114098" href="/d/graphic/114098.html" rel="external">movie 7</a>). In some centers, the patient is placed in the Trendelenburg position during de-airing to decrease the risk of cerebral air embolization.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Postbypass period</strong> – During and immediately after weaning from CPB, TEE is used to assess function of the repaired or replaced valve (including identification of any paravalvular leaks) and identify complications such as myocardial ischemia, evidenced by development of new or worsening regional wall motion abnormalities. Communication with the surgeon regarding complications noted on the TEE examination facilitates decisions to reinstitute CPB for surgical correction, if necessary. These assessments are ideally performed when hemodynamic variables are similar to the patient's baseline values obtained after induction of general anesthesia and before initiation of CPB. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">After the initial postbypass TEE examination, TEE is employed to continuously monitor LV and RV function, as well as intravascular volume status, for the remainder of the intraoperative period. After aortic decannulation, the ascending aorta is evaluated to exclude aortic dissection.</p><p></p><p>Additional considerations for use of TEE before and after CPB during cardiac surgical procedures are discussed in a separate topic.

Proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) method can be helpful in quantitation of effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) or regurgitant volume. However, ventricular loading conditions and jet eccentricity can result in incorrect estimation of severity with color-Doppler assessment. Systolic reversal of flow in the pulmonary veins can be seen in severe MR. In addition, the width of the vena contracta should be measured because it is easy to acquire, reproducible, and relatively independent of ventricular loading conditions  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef105881" href="/d/graphic/105881.html" rel="external">movie 10</a>). This measurement is made at the narrowest neck of the MR jet, obtained in a midesophageal four-chamber view [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Other echocardiographic signs of severe MR include a peak E velocity &gt;1.2 m/second or a dense continuous wave Doppler MR jet signal. Of clinical note, however, all these intraoperative echocardiographic methods have pitfalls [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. For example, MR severity is typically underestimated after induction of general anesthesia due to decreases in sympathetic tone and LV afterload, and MR severity can vary considerably during surgery [<a href="#rid27">27,29</a>]. Thus, if intraoperative confirmation of severity is critically important, assessment should be performed during hemodynamic conditions approximating the patient's preoperative baseline.

For patients with primary MR, intraoperative three dimensional (3D) TEE has been used to enable detailed study of valve morphology and quantitative analysis of annular size and leaflet dimensions important to the repair of degenerative mitral valves (resulting in mitral valve prolapse, partial flail, or flail leaflet). Carpentier's classification of mitral valve regurgitation is often used to facilitate a common language between the echocardiographer and surgeon, and permit an assessment of the etiology of MR and the likelihood of successful repair. Type 1 lesions (with normal leaflet motion) and type 2 lesions (excessive leaflet motion) are typically more amenable to operative repair than type 3 lesions (restricted leaflet motion) [<a href="#rid27">27,30</a>]. Other assessments to determine whether the mitral valve can be repaired include the estimated risk of post-repair SAM of the mitral valve, precise location of the left circumflex coronary artery relative to the location of annular sutures, prediction of the correct annuloplasty device size, and prediction of the largest size mitral valve prosthesis that will fit in the patient (based on intertrigonal distance in case the repair fails). Repair is less likely to be successful if there is extensive calcification or degeneration of a leaflet or annulus, prolapse of more than one-third of the leaflet tissue, or extensive chordal fusion, calcification, or papillary muscle rupture [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].

With the aid of TEE interrogation of the repaired valve, the surgeon and cardiac anesthesiologist must jointly decide whether further attempts to repair the mitral valve are feasible, or whether replacement of the mitral valve will be necessary.

On TEE examination, SAM is identified when the mitral leaflets are drawn anteriorly into the LVOT during systole, causing LVOT obstruction and concomitant MR. The LVOT obstruction can be identified by Doppler color flow mapping and the resulting gradient can be quantified with spectral Doppler interrogation.
