         The hip is a stable, major weight-bearing joint with significant mobility. In children, common causes of hip pathology include developmental dysplasia of the hip, transient synovitis, septic arthritis, Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, and slipped capital femoral epiphysis. Less-common hip disorders include proximal femoral focal deficiency, developmental coxa vara, neuromuscular hip dysplasia, injuries about the hip, arthritides, and tumors. The radiologic evaluation of common and less-common hip disorders is discussed below.
        </p>
        <p>
         Accurate diagnosis and treatment of pediatric hip disorders are important because of the potential complications, which may lead to degenerative joint disease in adult life. The history and physical examination, which are necessary to develop a differential diagnosis prior to the selection of imaging tests, and a general review of the imaging tests that are used in the evaluation of bone and joint pain, including the physical principles underlying their usefulness, are presented separately.

         The modalities available for evaluation of the hip include ultrasonography (US), plain film radiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), radionuclide bone scan, magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography, CT arthrography, and conventional arthrography  (

          Plain film radiography
         </strong>
         – Plain film radiography is used in the initial evaluation of any cause of hip pain or limp. Because the appearance of a child's hips varies with age, strong consideration should be given to ordering anteroposterior (AP) and frog leg lateral views of the pelvis rather than views of a single hip [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. This allows easy comparison with a "control" hip in children with unilateral problems. The average radiation dose from pelvic radiographs is 0.5 millisieverts [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>

         The gonads are in the field of view for CT of the hips. In females, gonadal shielding is not feasible because of the deep location of the ovaries and loss of image quality. In males, gonadal shielding can be used, but artifact reduction software is necessary to mitigate beam hardening artifact from shielding.

         DDH is a relatively common condition that is more prevalent in females, following breech deliveries or oligohydramnios, in White children, and in the presence of a positive family history. DDH is defined as abnormal position of the femoral head relative to the acetabulum, which results in abnormal growth of both components of the hip. Most cases are detected in the first year of life, but DDH may present later, particularly in children with bilateral disease and no asymmetry on physical examination [

         Static and dynamic ultrasonography is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosis in neonates and infants up to the age of four months. Plain film radiography is recommended for older infants beginning at age four months and children. CT scanning may be used for preoperative planning, conventional contrast arthrography for intraoperative evaluation, and MRI for postoperative follow-up. (See

          Ultrasonography
         </strong>
         – Ultrasonography (US) is used in the evaluation of the femoral head, which is not ossified and not visible on plain radiographs in the first four months of life. US is the technique of choice for evaluating high-risk infants, patients with equivocal clinical findings, and for monitoring treatment. Due to normal instability of the hip in the first days of life, US should be performed in patients two weeks or older with clinical suspicion of DDH [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. In high-risk patients with negative clinical examination, a screening US should be performed at six weeks of age, as hip laxity and mild acetabular dysplasia may resolve spontaneously by four to six weeks of life. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6288.html" rel="external">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         US is able to directly visualize the cartilaginous components of the hip, determine the position and coverage of the femoral head, determine the depth and morphology of the acetabulum, and evaluate dynamic instability. The main finding is superolateral displacement of the femur from the acetabulum [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Diagnosis of DDH on US is made by measuring the alpha angle, formed by the acetabular roof and the vertical cortex of the ilium  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56328" href="/z/d/graphic/56328.html" rel="external">
          image 1
         </a>
         ). The degree of instability can range from mild laxity to subluxation and dislocation of the hip. When instability is present, US determines the reducibility of the femoral head, which is important for management. US also demonstrates the cause of obstruction to hip reduction, such as inverted labrum and soft tissue in the acetabulum.

          Magnetic resonance imagery
         </strong>
         – MRI is most useful in the preoperative assessment of complicated DDH and in the evaluation of postsurgical reduction and long-term sequelae of partially treated or untreated DDH. Contrast-enhanced MRI shows the position and shape of the cartilaginous femoral head and obstacles to reduction, as well as changes of the acetabulum not demonstrated by US or radiography. MRI also gives information about the acetabular labrum, which is important in the preoperative planning. MRI assesses the vascularity of the cartilaginous femoral head and can detect ischemia. Global decrease in perfusion of the femoral head is associated with significantly increased likelihood of avascular necrosis [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. If ossification of the femoral head does not occur by one year of age, avascular necrosis is believed to be present [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11

          Computed tomography
         </strong>
         – CT is valuable in the preoperative assessment of DDH. Pediatric protocols that involve reduced doses of radiation should be used. Three-dimensional CT images are particularly useful in the preoperative planning of complex cases and improve the ability to match the proper osteotomy with the specific acetabular deficiency [
         <a href="#rid12">

         CT is also useful in the postoperative evaluation of DDH when MRI is contraindicated or not available. Postreduction CT offers precise information regarding the position and coverage of the femoral head within the acetabulum in the cast and confirms successful reduction. Postreduction CT also has predictive value for development of avascular necrosis by measuring the abduction angle of the hip.

         PFFD is an uncommon congenital condition manifested by hypoplasia of part or all of the proximal femur. PFFD encompasses a spectrum from hypoplasia of the femoral head to congenital absence of all but the distal femoral epiphysis. PFFD is unilateral in 90 percent of cases. PFFD presents in infancy with limb shortening that can mimic the Galeazzi sign of unilateral DDH.

         Plain film radiography demonstrates a short femur with dysmorphic or absent head and neck. There is delayed appearance or nonappearance of the femoral capital ossification center. MRI enables early identification of an incompletely ossified femoral head and whether the intervening segment of femur is absent. MRI shows the cartilage structure of acetabulum and upper femur, therefore assisting in prognosis and treatment planning [

         LCP disease is a syndrome of idiopathic avascular necrosis of the femoral epiphysis, possibly due to repeated multiple vascular occlusive episodes that involve the femoral head. It typically presents as hip pain and/or limp of acute or insidious onset, most commonly in males between the ages of 3 and 12 years, with peak incidence at five to eight years of age [

Onset in children older than eight years and nonspherical femoral head at skeletal maturity are associated with higher incidence of osteoarthritis in adulthood [

         – Plain film radiography is the primary method for the diagnosis of SCFE. Because of the high incidence of bilateral disease, views of both hips are frequently obtained. The lateral radiograph is more sensitive than the anteroposterior (AP) view for detection of mild displacement; therefore, a frog-leg or a cross-table lateral view should always be performed. Some authors recommend replacing the frog-leg lateral view with a cross-table lateral view in an acute SCFE, as the frog-leg lateral view may accentuate the displacement.

         In undisplaced SCFE (also known as pre-slip), AP and lateral radiographs show widening and irregularity of the capital femoral physis, osteopenia, and increased density of the metaphysis due to healing response  (

Medial displacement is seen on the AP radiograph; however, this finding may be difficult to appreciate in subtle cases. Posterior displacement is appreciated on the frog-leg or cross-table lateral view, which is more sensitive than the AP radiograph for subtle cases  (

         Hip pain in adolescents, particularly physically active adolescents, may result from both intra-articular and extra-articular disorders. Extra-articular causes of hip pain include pelvic apophyseal injuries, iliopsoas tendinosis and bursitis, snapping hip syndrome, athletic pubalgia, and stress fractures. Intra-articular causes of hip pain include acetabular labral tears and femoroacetabular impingement [

         Pelvic apophyseal avulsions are sports injuries that occur in adolescents during forceful or repetitive traction from the attached muscles. Before ossification, the apophyseal growth cartilage is the weakest point in the musculotendinous unit, making the apophysis vulnerable to injury  (

Chronic microtrauma to the physis may result in physeal widening, which is difficult to see on radiographs and is diagnosed by MRI. In difficult cases, MRI is valuable in differentiating avulsion from neoplasm. MRI also detects other sites of pelvic injuries, including ilium adjacent to the sacroiliac joint and the pubic ramus, which may not be seen on radiographs.

         Iliopsoas tendinosis may be associated with trauma, overuse injury, or arthritis. It is often seen in kicking-related sports. Due to their proximity, inflammatory processes frequently involve the iliopsoas tendon together with the bursa. MRI shows thickening and increased signal within the tendon, with increased synovial fluid or hypertrophy of the bursa, which is located anterior to the hip joint  (

         The snapping iliopsoas tendon is seen in young athletes who use a wide range of hip motion for activities such as ballet or karate. The "snap" results from catching of the posterior iliotibial band or anterior portion of the gluteus maximus muscle over the greater trochanter ("external snapping hip"); from intra-articular lesions such as labral tear or loose body; or from the iliopsoas tendon moving over the lesser trochanter ("internal snapping hip"). Dynamic sonography can be used to confirm the diagnosis [

         Athletic pubalgia refers to a group of musculoskeletal processes that occur in and about the pubic symphysis. MRI is the study of choice to evaluate this condition. Numerous muscles attach to the parasymphyseal pubic bone, including anterior abdominal wall muscles and adductor muscles of the thigh. The most frequent pattern identified on MRI is injury to the insertion of the rectus abdominis muscle with or without adductor tendon injury. Another cause of pubalgia is osteitis pubis, which is thought to result from chronic repetitive trauma, as occurs in long distance runners. On radiography, there is sclerosis of the pubic symphysis with symmetric distribution. MRI shows intense edema across the pubic body. Stress fractures of the pubis can also occur [

         The acetabular labrum is a dense fibrocartilaginous ring which is attached to the margin of the acetabulum, increasing the depth and stability of the joint. The labrum is poorly vascularized, especially the anterosuperior portion, where most labral tears occur. Acetabular labral tears account for up to 20 percent of hip pain presentations in athletic adolescents. Sport activities that involve pivoting or twisting of the hip can result in injury to the labrum. Other causes of labral tears include DDH and femoroacetabular impingement. Labral tears predispose to early osteoarthritis. Direct MR arthrography with intra-articular injection of contrast is the procedure of choice for diagnosing labral tears, as well as any associated articular cartilage thinning [

         Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) results from abnormal contour of the proximal femur and acetabulum, resulting in abnormal contact, which increases with motion. FAI leads to labral cartilage injury, pain, and osteoarthritis [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. Athletes who perform motions of extreme hip flexion and rotation, such as dancers, are at increased risk for FAI. Other predisposing disorders include DDH, SCFE, and LCP disease. Plain film radiographs are the first imaging modality in the diagnosis of FAI. Two distinct forms of FAI have been described, cam-type and pincer type. Plain film radiographs of the cam-type FAI demonstrate a nonspherical femoral head or lack of femoral head-neck offset. The pincer type of FAI shows signs resulting from acetabular overcoverage. MRI helps diagnose the type of FAI and respective abnormalities of the femoral head, neck, and acetabulum, and shows associated chondral and labral injuries [

         Idiopathic chondrolysis of the hip is a disorder characterized by extensive loss of articular cartilage of the proximal femoral epiphysis and acetabulum, with resultant joint space narrowing and restriction of motion. It can be seen in association with SCFE, trauma, infection, arthritis, and immobilization. Females are affected more than males, and the symptoms are often unilateral. Patients present with a painful, stiff hip.

         Plain film radiographic abnormalities appear several weeks to months after onset of symptoms. Findings on radiography are joint space narrowing and osteopenia, leading to protrusion acetabuli and premature physeal fusion  (
