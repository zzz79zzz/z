These include cardiac arrhythmias, intradialytic hypotension or hypertension, dialysis disequilibrium syndrome, reactions to the HD membrane, air embolism, bleeding, and seizures. However, some of these acute complications, such as air embolism, hemolysis, vascular access hemorrhage, and major allergic reactions, are now rare due to advances in the safety features on HD machines, meticulous treatment of dialysis water, adherence to strict safety protocols, and extensive training of the dialysis staff.</p><p>Compared with these rarer complications, symptoms such as cramps, nausea and vomiting, and headache occur more frequently. These symptoms can be debilitating and can lead to nonadherence or partial adherence to dialysis (shortened treatment sessions or missed sessions), which can be associated with hospitalizations and death. In addition, physical complications of HD can negatively affect health-related quality of life and can exacerbate mood disorders. Understanding and alleviating HD-related symptoms may, therefore, have an immediate impact on patient well-being.</p><p>This topic will discuss the epidemiology, causes, brief evaluation, and management of the most common acute complications that occur during HD. Some of these complications are discussed in more detail elsewhere:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intradialytic hypotension (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1945.html" rel="external">"Intradialytic hypotension in an otherwise stable patient"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intradialytic hypertension (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1848.html" rel="external">"Hypertension in patients on dialysis", section on 'Hypertension during hemodialysis'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dialyzer reactions (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1859.html" rel="external">"Reactions to the hemodialysis membrane"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Seizures during HD (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1894.html" rel="external">"Seizures in patients undergoing hemodialysis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1851.html" rel="external">"Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2721768399"><span class="h1">IMPACT OF THE CLINICAL SETTING ON EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients on HD who are experiencing an acute complication, the extent of the initial assessment and management depends in part on the location of the patient. This is because of differences in the availability of on-site clinical staff and resources across different levels of care. Typically, freestanding outpatient HD units are usually staffed by nurses and technicians, unlike dialysis units located within hospitals, which have clinicians, in addition to nurses and technicians, on site.</p><p>In the outpatient setting, the initial assessment and management are usually communicated by telephone between the clinician (who is remote) and an HD nurse (who is on site). In addition, resources such as electrocardiogram and stat laboratory testing are usually not available. Thus, outpatients with severe symptoms (eg, dyspnea, chest pain, hypotension) that do not promptly respond to corrective interventions should be transported to an emergency department or inpatient setting for evaluation without delay. Patients with less severe symptoms that respond to initial corrective measures (eg, fluid resuscitation) can generally be managed as outpatients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1137300918"><span class="h1">COMMON COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H553971371"><span class="h2">Intradialytic hypotension</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hypotension during HD is discussed at length elsewhere.

We typically avoid the use of nitrates, especially among hypotensive or hypovolemic patients, in patients undergoing HD because they precipitously reduce venous tone and can induce or exacerbate hypotension. In addition, nitrates should be avoided after dialysis has been discontinued (ie, when the dialysis needles have been removed or the dialysis tubing detached from an HD catheter); in this setting, an episode of hypotension could not be managed quickly. Some experts do use nitrates for suspected cardiac pain in patients without hypotension who still have venous access (since an episode of hypotension could be managed with intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a>). Further analgesia can be managed by emergency personnel once they arrive to transfer the patient to the emergency department.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Although angina is usually a manifestation of obstructive coronary artery disease, patients receiving HD may also experience angina in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. This may be due to mismatched perfusion from inadequate capillary density in hypertrophied cardiomyocytes that are often present among patients on dialysis. In addition to the physiologic stress of the HD procedure, angina may be provoked by other states with high cardiac output such as anemia, sepsis, and high outflow from an arteriovenous fistula. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If intravascular hemolysis is suspected (eg, port-wine appearance in the venous blood line, similar symptoms occurring in other patients concurrently receiving dialysis in the same unit, pink color of plasma in centrifuged blood specimen, falling hematocrit) [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>], then, when discontinuing dialysis, clamp both blood lines and do not return the blood to the patient. Patients with hemolysis require hospitalization for observation since severe anemia and life-threatening hyperkalemia may develop after HD has been terminated.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Hemolysis in patients on HD may result from problems with the dialysis solution, such as overheating, hypotonicity due to a low solute-to-water ratio, or contaminants in the dialysis water (eg, formaldehyde, bleach, chloramine, copper)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef129377" href="/z/d/graphic/129377.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Red blood cell trauma and hemolysis can also occur due to improperly functioning roller clamps on dialysis machines, kinking of the blood lines, and poorly constructed blood tubing [<a href="#rid1">1,3,4</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If air embolism is suspected (eg, neurologic symptoms such as altered mentation, seizures, focal neurologic deficits, or if air or foam is visible in the venous blood line), then, when discontinuing dialysis, clamp the venous blood line, provide 100 percent oxygen by face mask, assure that the patient is lying on their left side with their feet up (eg, Trendelenburg), provide cardiorespiratory support, and consult emergency personnel for potential airway management. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8263.html" rel="external">"Air embolism"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Among patients who are recumbent, the air generally travels to the right side of the heart and then into the pulmonary circulation. Symptoms can include chest tightness or pain, dyspnea, cough, tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope. Among patients who are seated, air may enter directly into the cerebral circulation and cause seizures, blurry vision, altered mental status, or ischemic stroke. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Air can inadvertently enter the HD circuit from an uncapped or damaged central venous catheter, from various connection points in the circuit, or from incomplete priming of the circuit  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132484" href="/z/d/graphic/132484.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The introduction of air traps and detector alarms in modern HD machines has greatly reduced the risk of significant air accumulation and embolism, and now this is a rare complication [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]. The risk of air embolism can be minimized by keeping the arterial luer lock tightened, adequately priming the HD circuit and tubing system before initiation of HD, and maintaining a high blood level in the venous air catcher  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132484" href="/z/d/graphic/132484.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial management of patients with dyspnea</strong> – Patients with dyspnea during dialysis may also have chest pain. In such patients, the immediate management is the same as in patients with chest pain mentioned above  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef139057" href="/z/d/graphic/139057.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The management of those patients presenting <strong>only</strong> with dyspnea depends upon whether or not they had dyspnea prior to the start of the HD treatment or if dyspnea onset occurred after the initiation of HD:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Dyspnea prior to initiation of HD – Patients who report dyspnea prior to initiation of HD most likely have hypervolemia. In such cases, ultrafiltration during the HD procedure will often lead to resolution of symptoms. If the patient also has hypoxemia, supplemental oxygen should be provided. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">If the dyspneic patient did not have an unusually large interdialytic weight gain or reports dyspnea when presenting for HD, then their dry weight should be challenged (eg, by approximately 0.5 kg).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">If a patient receiving outpatient HD has persistent dyspnea despite adequate ultrafiltration, they should be transferred to a higher level of care (eg, emergency department) for further evaluation. However, if the patient is hemodynamically stable and not hypoxemic, then transfer to the emergency department or hospital can often be delayed until after completion of the HD treatment. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Acute dyspnea beginning after the initiation of HD – Patients who have acute onset of dyspnea occurring after initiation of HD may have angina, acute coronary syndrome, or bacteremia (often associated with catheter infection). Isotonic <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> is frequently administered at the onset of HD and, even with small volumes, may precipitate dyspnea. Uncommon causes include acute severe hypertension, pericardial effusion with or without tamponade, pulmonary embolism (particularly in a patient who recently underwent treatment of a thrombosed vascular access) and, rarely, intravascular hemolysis, an air embolism, or an allergic reaction to intravenous iron or heparin [<a href="#rid9">9-12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Patients with hypoxia should be administered supplemental oxygen. If acute severe hypertension is suspected to be the cause of acute dyspnea, then the patient should be treated with additional ultrafiltration. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1848.html" rel="external">"Hypertension in patients on dialysis", section on 'Assessment of volume status'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1848.html" rel="external">"Hypertension in patients on dialysis", section on 'How to reduce target dry weight'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">If the dyspnea occurs at the onset of HD, just after administration of isotonic <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a>, then hypervolemia is the likely cause, and the dyspnea should improve with ultrafiltration. As with patients who present repeatedly with hypervolemia and dyspnea, the dry weight should be challenged.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">In outpatients with acute onset of dyspnea who have unstable vital signs or hypoxemia, or if there is concern for a life-threatening cause, dialysis should be stopped, and arrangements should be made for transportation to a hospital setting (eg, by ambulance). In hemodynamically stable patients without hypoxemia, the dialysis treatment can often be continued.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The management of patients with suspected intravascular hemolysis or air embolism is described above  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef139057" href="/z/d/graphic/139057.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). The management of suspected allergic reactions to intravenous iron or heparin is presented elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7148.html" rel="external">"Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults", section on 'Treatment or allergic and infusion reactions'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1348.html" rel="external">"Heparin and LMW heparin: Dosing and adverse effects", section on 'Systemic allergic reactions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H298196006"><span class="h2">Dialyzer reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are two types of reactions to the dialysis membrane: type A and type B; the clinical presentations of these reactions are variable. Both are rare. As an example, type A reactions (the more severe type) occur in approximately 0.004 percent of HD treatments [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Dialyzer reactions are presented in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1859.html" rel="external">"Reactions to the hemodialysis membrane"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H331957513"><span class="h2">Cramps</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A muscle cramp is a prolonged involuntary muscle contraction [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The origin of a cramp is neural, not muscular [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Muscle cramps are a common complication of HD treatments [<a href="#rid15">15-19</a>] and are among the top three physical symptoms prioritized by patients as needing attention [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Muscle cramps often result in the early termination of an HD session and are, therefore, a significant cause of inadequate dialysis and hypervolemia. The exact etiology of cramps in patients on dialysis is unknown. Since cramps tend to occur most frequently near the end of HD treatments, changes in plasma osmolality and/or extracellular fluid volume have been implicated.</p><p>Some etiologies of HD-associated cramps, alone or in combination, may include [<a href="#rid14">14,15,20</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Change in plasma osmolality</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Plasma volume contraction</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tissue hypoxia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and electrolyte shifts</p><p></p><p>Of these, volume contraction and electrolyte shifts, either alone or in combination, are most commonly implicated; however, supporting data are sparse, and these explanations may be oversimplified.</p><p>Cramps occurring with dialysis treatment most commonly involve the muscles of the lower extremity, but the muscles of the hands, arms, and abdomen may also be affected. The modality of HD (eg, high-flux HD, hemodiafiltration) may also have an impact on the frequency of cramps [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. </p><p>Treatment is directed at two goals: reducing the frequency of cramps and relieving symptoms when they occur.

However, many sodium modeling approaches can result in a net positive sodium balance placing patients at risk for volume expansion and hypertension over time. Thus, although sodium modeling is a useful technique in some cases (eg, to prevent dialysis disequilibrium), some experts avoid sodium modeling specifically to manage cramps.

This may be due to dialysis-associated changes in vasoactive substances such as nitric oxide [<a href="#rid34">34,38,39</a>]. In patients with recurrent and severe dialysis-associated headache, some experts perform a trial of reduced HD duration in an attempt to alleviate symptom burden combined with an increase in dialysis frequency to maintain adequate dialysis [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p>In one study, for example, the rate of symptom occurrence was lower when patients received HD for two hours at a blood flow rate of 400 mL/min compared with four hours at 200 mL/min (19 versus 32 percent) [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].
