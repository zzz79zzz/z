Strategies include optimizing evidence-based drug and device therapies, addressing causes and precipitants of HF, treating comorbidities, and improving management of care. The clinician, working with others in a care team, must provide appropriate coordination of care, manage the patient between office visits, ensure adequate patient education to support the acquisition of self-care skills, address social determinants of health, and create safe transitions of care between settings. This includes reducing disruption to care during and following hospitalizations [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>HF care involves more than focused medical management of an isolated syndrome, since patients with HF typically have multiple medical conditions, often treated by many clinicians. Patients with HF are typically older adults with complex drug regimens for HF and multiple concurrent diagnoses with resulting polypharmacy [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Moreover, self-management is particularly important in HF, but HF patients may have trouble with balance, eyesight, hearing, and/or cognitive function that makes self-management difficult and may increase the risk of readmission [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13607.html" rel="external">"Heart failure self-management"</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review outpatient- and inpatient-based management strategies aimed at reducing the risk of hospitalization and rehospitalization for patients with HF. The following issues are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient self-management of HF.

Management of other causes of HF (including valve disease) is discussed in individual topic reviews.

An estimated 26 million people worldwide have HF [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Approximately 6.2 million Americans and 15 million Europeans are living with HF [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. In 2016, the HF hospitalization rate in the United States was 2.8 per 1000 for all ages and 13.4 per 1000 for those over age 64 [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], making HF among the top 10 causes of hospitalization for the full population and among the top three for those over 65 [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Furthermore, almost one-fifth of those who are hospitalized with HF are readmitted within 30 days [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>In the United States, both hospitalizations and rehospitalizations for patients with HF have been declining, with greater decreases in admissions than in readmissions. For instance, admission rates fell 30.5 percent (95% CI 29.3-31.6) between 1999 and 2011, while readmission rates declined 9.7 percent (95% CI 8.5-10.8) over the same period [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. Similar patterns have been seen for hospitalizations for all causes in the United States. From 2010 to 2013, hospital referral region-level admission rates declined from 30.8 to 27.1 per 100 person-years at risk, while readmissions declined from 17.2 to 16.1 per 100 hospital discharges [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. However, since passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 in the United States, which included penalties for higher-than-average readmission rates for HF, United States readmissions for HF have fallen faster than for other conditions [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Importantly, many readmissions after HF hospitalization are not for HF [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>Mortality for patients with HF has been increasing [<a href="#rid15">15</a>] since at least 2006 [<a href="#rid16">16</a>], which has raised concern about unintended effects of readmission reduction, but hospital risk-standardized rehospitalization rates and mortality rates are only weakly and negatively correlated [<a href="#rid17">17-19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14824261"><span class="h1">OUTPATIENT STRATEGIES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Outpatient care requires coordinated management of medical and social issues.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H467941798"><span class="h2">Key components of outpatient care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Outpatient care for HF should generally include the following components:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A process for identifying patients with HF.

Accordingly, major society guidelines and position statements for management of HF have endorsed disease management [<a href="#rid20">20</a>] or have noted the importance of multidisciplinary care [<a href="#rid20">20-22</a>] to achieve comprehensive outpatient care of the patient with HF. Disease-management programs are structured programs typically providing a multidisciplinary, integrated approach to care for patients with chronic conditions. Disease-management programs facilitate the development of an individualized care plan, provide patient education and support, and coordinate care among health care providers, patients, and patients’ support systems.</p><p>Disease management programs include a wide variety of care models, including nurse-led case management, multidisciplinary HF clinics, programs promoting self-care, telephone-based case management, and telemonitoring. The efficacies of these approaches differ, as described below. The generalizability and validity of the available evidence are difficult to ascertain given the wide variety of interventions tried and personnel involved and the fact that the evaluators and developers are often the same and blinding is not possible. Furthermore, as with all complex interventions of practice improvements, local context is critical for disease management, and the quality of implementation may be as important to success as the strategy itself [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1000940954"><span class="h2">Address social determinants</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Systems of care for patients with HF should include strategies to screen for and address social determinants of health (SDOH). SDOH are defined by the World Health Organization as “the circumstances in which people are born, grow up, live, work and age” [<a href="#rid24">24</a>] and are a substantial contributor to long-term morbidity and mortality among patients with HF apart from any medical treatment. Adverse social determinants (including limited access to food, housing, and transportation; reduced education and health literacy; lack of social support; and financial challenges) add stress to patients’ lives, take time and resources away from self-care of medical conditions, compete with medical needs, and reduce access to high-quality health care.<strong> </strong>It is well established that disability, race, ethnicity, insurance status, household income, adverse neighborhood characteristics, and other markers of social challenges are associated with higher readmission rates and mortality for patients with HF [<a href="#rid25">25-28</a>].</p><p>Conversely, a report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that addressing SDOH was a key component of Accountable Care Organizations that succeeded in achieving cost and quality targets [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. The 2020 American Heart Association (AHA)<strong> </strong>Scientific Statement on Social Determinants of Health recommended that interprofessional collaborative practice teams implement interventions to address SDOH [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. The statement includes specific recommendations in the areas of employment, access to care, health care coverage, food insecurity, environment, race, social support, and health literacy.</p><p>At a minimum we recommend the following strategies:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ensure the full clinical team is trained in principles of SDOH, including what they are, how they influence health, how they can be identified and measured, and how they can be addressed within the health system. Include social workers in the care team.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Incorporate routine screening for SDOH into clinical care (ideally integrated into the electronic health record) using a standardized tool such as the Accountable Health Communities Social Needs Screening Tool [<a href="#rid31">31</a>], the OCHIN Social Determinant of Health Screening Tool (available in multiple languages [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]), or the THRIVE screener [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Maintain an updated list of community resources for referrals for patients screening positive; a number of commercial entities now exist to provide such connections, including <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcompany.findhelp.com%2F&amp;token=xvoSSxerdCWfLv20vMnFoq3ftApzP14GoDgGFcVVwfKX3BFPpuPBzpIuig1VLVrP&amp;TOPIC_ID=15690" target="_blank">Aunt Bertha</a>, <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwellsky.com%2Fsocial-care-coordination%2F&amp;token=z%2Fd0o0lJ3lvy%2FZX1LYF6QydMy0imjklR5lGAQBj4rojq5nyg3zLXIlNTAQmCO4Q%2FmHmDQG6OkXkfCvB4rZJiuQ%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=15690" target="_blank">WellSky</a>, <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nowpow.com%2F&amp;token=lblfowwGB6QwC91WNuiIf23LjalIN0RqSE6sA1nZmo4%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=15690" target="_blank">NowPow</a>, <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Funiteus.com%2F&amp;token=YoGGxFX3KO%2BE0Rl1MlPiZowQ0Xh3oGaSdwwm6t2%2F0Ps%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=15690" target="_blank">Unite Us</a>, and others [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].

In summary, effective outpatient HF care models include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nurse-led case management, including drug titration.

Telemonitoring may be a standalone intervention, but it can also be combined with other disease-management strategies.

In addition, there was no significant change in a composite HF quality-of-care score between the two groups. Of note, many centers in the trial were already participating in a program to improve the care of patients with HFrEF.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An RCT comparing a program of discharge support with usual care in 2494 adults hospitalized with HF found reduction in emergency department visits at 30 days but no improvement in composites of clinical outcomes (all-cause readmission, emergency department visit, or death at three months; or all-cause readmission or emergency department visit at 30 days) [<a href="#rid86">86</a>]. The program of discharge support included nurse-led self-care education, a structured hospital discharge summary, and a family physician follow-up appointment less than one week after discharge; high-risk patients also received structured nurse home visits and HF clinic care. One limitation of this trial is that less than 40 percent of patients in the intervention group received nurse home visits and HF clinic care.</p><p></p><p>Discharge support interventions have variable effect on cost. For example:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An RCT of 223 patients with HF compared a standard discharge procedure with a one-hour, one-on-one teaching session with a nurse educator before discharge [<a href="#rid87">87</a>].

In a prospective study of a nurse-led transitional-care program for patients with HF being discharged from a hospital in the United States, thirty-day readmissions, lengths of stay, and 60-day direct costs were compared with those for HF patients concurrently discharged from other hospitals within the same health care system [<a href="#rid88">88</a>]. The program was associated with a 48 percent decrease in 30-day readmissions but had little impact on direct costs to the health care system over 60 days and, under the existing Medicare reimbursement system, had a negative impact on hospital revenue.</p><p></p><p>Studies of individual components of discharge support have not shown a clear reduction in HF readmissions. Examples include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An observational study of 16,791 patients hospitalized with HF at 150 hospitals found that meeting the discharge instruction requirement set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) had no relationship to one-year cardiovascular readmission [<a href="#rid73">73</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Similarly, an observational study of 2222 hospitals found no association between hospital-level performance on the CMS discharge instruction measure and 30-day readmission rates for patients admitted with HF [<a href="#rid89">89</a>].</p><p></p><p>Studies of discharge support in the general medical population (not limited to HF) are discussed separately.

The value of an early appointment may depend on the quality of care at the visit, which may be affected by the information available to the provider. An appointment may be necessary but not sufficient to reduce risk. Ideally, assessment should take place within one to two weeks after discharge to reassess fluid status, review and adjust medications, plan additional testing if needed, and provide further patient education [<a href="#rid90">90</a>]. Since this strategy might not be feasible for all of the many patients hospitalized for HF, particular focus for early follow-up should be targeted to patients who are at increased risk for early decompensation (eg, low systolic blood pressure, prolonged QRS duration, renal dysfunction, elevated natriuretic peptide level, elevated troponin levels, hyponatremia, or other comorbidities).</p><p>An observational study of 30,136 patients with HF found that hospitals in the lowest quartile of early postdischarge physician follow-up (that is, hospitals whose patients were least likely to have follow-up within seven days) had a 3 percent higher 30-day readmission rate than the other 75 percent of hospitals [<a href="#rid91">91</a>].</p><p>An observational study of 98,730 Medicare patients discharged to home care after a hospitalization for HF found that patients who received both four home-care visits in the first week (including one within 48 hours of discharge) and a physician office visit in the first week had lower readmission rates than those with neither [<a href="#rid92">92</a>].
