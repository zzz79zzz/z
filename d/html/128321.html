Early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, convalescent plasma was collected by major blood centers in the United States and was reimbursed through a government funded mechanism. Amid unprecedented blood shortages (whereby collection of convalescent plasma competed for critical frontline staff), along with the advent of effective vaccines and vaccine coverage and a growing body of evidence that COVID-19 convalescent plasma was not effective in late-stage disease, demand for the product waned and blood centers reduced or stopped collection. As successive viral variants emerged, some blood centers intermittently continued collections, albeit not in sufficient quantities to match the scale of the early phase of the pandemic (during 2020 and the early part of 2021).</p><p>This topic discusses practical aspects of obtaining and administering convalescent plasma for COVID-19.</p><p>Separate topic reviews discuss the role of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 management and general information about plasma administration:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>COVID-19</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127759.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Evaluation of adults with acute illness in the outpatient setting"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127429.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management in hospitalized adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127419.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management of the intubated adult"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/139068.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management of adults with acute illness in the outpatient setting"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Plasma</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7920.html" rel="external">"Clinical use of plasma components"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7929.html" rel="external">"Pathogen inactivation of blood products"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3138514663"><span class="h1">GENERAL CONCEPTS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3427142059"><span class="h2">Overview of products</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Convalescent plasma and hyperimmune globulin are obtained from individuals who have recovered from an infection and have generated an immune response against the infecting pathogen. Neutralizing antibodies are thought to be the main active component; other immune mediators may also contribute.</p><p>Until herd immunity has been attained (through mass vaccination and/or natural infection), these products have the potential to provide passive antibody-based immunity to previously unexposed individuals to reduce the risk of disease or to lessen its clinical impact if already infected. (See <a class="local">'Mechanism of action'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Convalescent plasma</strong> – Convalescent plasma (also called immune plasma or hyperimmune plasma) is similar to standard Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) or Plasma Frozen within 24 hours after phlebotomy (PF24). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7920.html" rel="external">"Clinical use of plasma components", section on 'Plasma products'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The major difference from other plasma products is that convalescent plasma is obtained from donors who have recovered from a specific infection (or in principle, those who have been vaccinated, although in the United States convalescent plasma based on vaccination alone [vax-plasma] has not been approved). (See <a class="local">'Donation after COVID-19 vaccination (vax-plasma)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Ideally, it contains polyclonal antibodies to the pathogen at sufficient titer and biologic activity to provide passive immunity to the recipient. (See <a class="local">'Plasma donation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Convalescent plasma is typically obtained by apheresis in a blood center, although it can also be obtained from whole blood units. The plasmapheresis collection takes approximately one to two hours. Plasma proteins are replenished rapidly in the donor, and according to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), individuals can donate plasma by apheresis as frequently as twice in a seven-day period (at least two days apart), as long as the health of the donor is preserved [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Apheresis versus whole blood collection'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Convalescent plasma is administered as a standard plasma transfusion; typically, one or two units are given. Typically it will come from a blood center frozen and is thawed prior to use. (See <a class="local">'Optimal dose'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, COVID-19 convalescent plasma became routinely available in the United States, under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the FDA; over 500,000 units of convalescent plasma were administered either as part of an expanded access program, EUA or through a clinical trial [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Access to therapy'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Historically, although convalescent plasma has been made available for other pathogens at times of disease epidemics or pandemics, its usage has not been as widespread as during the COVID-19 pandemic, nor has its efficacy been studied in as much detail. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Once an epidemic has subsided, convalescent plasma is likely to become unavailable unless a process has been put in place to bank plasma for future use (plasma has an expiration date of one year from collection). (See <a class="local">'Maintaining the supply'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Optimal characteristics of convalescent plasma include [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Sufficient titer of the relevant antibodies (see <a class="local">'Optimal timing and titer (or antibody level)'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lack of infectious particles (see <a class="local">'Infectious disease screening and pathogen inactivation'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Demonstrated safety and efficacy when used for the specific condition (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127429.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management in hospitalized adults", section on 'Limited role for antibody-based therapies (monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma)'</a> and <a class="local">'Safety'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hyperimmune globulin</strong> – During the COVID-19 pandemic, manufacture of hyperimmune globulin was pursued in parallel with investigation of convalescent plasma [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Hyperimmune globulin is a licensed product manufactured from convalescent plasma from a large number of donors (thousands) and is subject to pathogen reduction technologies and other standardization [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. It consists of a concentrated polyclonal <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> fraction with well-defined properties. (See <a class="local">'Hyperimmune globulin'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monoclonal antibodies</strong> – Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with neutralizing potential are another approach to providing passive immunity [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Each mAb recognizes a single antigen. Use in COVID-19 is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3970.html" rel="external">"Overview of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies", section on 'Target is an infectious organism'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/139068.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management of adults with acute illness in the outpatient setting", section on 'Therapies of limited or uncertain benefit'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2642987509"><span class="h2">Mechanism of action</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Convalescent plasma can provide passive immunity in the form of neutralizing antibodies (and/or possibly other immune mediators) against the infectious pathogen. Various immunoglobulin subclasses including IgG, IgM, and IgA may be useful.</p><p>Antibodies that bind to a virus can potentially decrease viral entry into cells and enhance viral clearance via antibody-dependent phagocytosis or antibody-dependent cellular toxicity; the mechanism for viral clearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; the virus that causes COVID-19) has been investigated and may include proteolysis of the spike protein [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>].</p><p>For individuals who have not previously been exposed to or vaccinated against the pathogen, it can take as long as two to three weeks to mount an antibody response [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Providing antibodies has the potential to prevent illness or shorten the duration or severity of illness sufficiently to prevent serious or life-threatening complications [<a href="#rid4">4,11</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3975.html" rel="external">"The adaptive humoral immune response", section on 'Passive humoral immunity'</a>.)</p><p>Once infection has progressed to the point that organ damage or other consequences of massive inflammation have occurred, convalescent plasma has not been shown to provide benefit. This is the rationale for providing plasma early in the disease course [<a href="#rid11">11-15</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Optimal timing and titer (or antibody level)'</a> below.)</p><p>SARS-CoV-2 has four major structural proteins, two of which appear to be the main antigenic targets [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Spike protein</strong> – The spike protein (S) is a transmembrane surface glycoprotein that binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on respiratory epithelial cells and gastrointestinal cells and mediates viral entry [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. In principle, anti-S, especially antibodies targeting its receptor-binding domain (RBD), might block viral entry into respiratory epithelium, which could reduce the severity or duration of infection [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Many variants of concern cause amino acid substitutions that affect the spike protein. Studies of the mechanism of action are ongoing. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126981.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Epidemiology, virology, and prevention", section on 'Variants of concern'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nucleocapsid protein</strong> – The nucleocapsid protein (N) interacts with the viral nucleic acid (RNA) and contributes to the assembly of functional virions [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Antibodies to N generally develop along with anti-S, but their role in recovery from infection is less well understood.</p><p></p><p>Assays that rely on antibody binding, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-type assays, have been developed for antibodies against both S and N. Testing of individuals recovering from COVID-19 suggest that in the majority, IgM anti-S and anti-N begin to appear within approximately one week and continue to increase over two weeks, while IgG appears a few days later (typically, by the third week), with faster class switching in non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients than in ICU patients [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. ELISA-type immunoassays and biologic (functional) assays for antiviral activity of convalescent plasma are in use, as discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Antibody measurements and definition of "high titer"'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4186755948"><span class="h2">Comparison with other antibody-based therapies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other antibody therapies include monoclonal antibodies and hyperimmune globulin. (See <a class="local">'Hyperimmune globulin'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/139068.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management of adults with acute illness in the outpatient setting", section on 'Therapies of limited or uncertain benefit'</a>.)</p><p>There are several differences among these therapies, and none have been compared with each other in randomized trials, making it challenging to assess relative efficacy.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Advantages of purified antibody products include greater standardization and avoidance of exposure to plasma, which can cause transfusion reactions. Disadvantages include reduced efficacy when viral antigenic drift occurs, cost, and lack of availability [<a href="#rid21">21-23</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Advantages of convalescent plasma include ease and rapidity of collection, potential for greater likelihood of matching antibody specificity to currently circulating viral variants, polyclonality, lower cost, and potentially greater availability [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The first monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2 took nearly a year to become available, whereas production of COVID-19 convalescent plasma began much earlier in the pandemic (by January 2020, within weeks of the first cases).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3653393541"><span class="h2">Experience with other viruses</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, convalescent plasma had been applied to diverse pathogens with mixed success.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The best evidence for the efficacy of convalescent plasma in other viral infections comes from a randomized trial in patients with Argentine hemorrhagic fever (caused by Junin virus, an arenavirus), in which 217 patients were assigned to receive 500 mL of convalescent plasma or control plasma within eight days of symptom onset [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Mortality was lower in the convalescent plasma group (1 versus 16.5 percent). In comparison, patients treated after nine or more days from symptom onset did not have a survival benefit.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 2015 meta-analysis identified a number of observational studies that suggested reduced mortality and other clinical benefits when convalescent plasma was used for other coronaviruses (such as severe acute respiratory syndrome virus [SARS]) and influenza viruses [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. The reviewed studies were generally considered of low quality due to high risk of bias and lack of control groups.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3027972497"><span class="h1">PLASMA DONATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3616549699"><span class="h2">Who can donate</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Blood centers may suspend or restart collection of COVID-19 convalescent plasma depending on society recommendations and demand. (See <a class="local">'Maintaining the supply'</a> below.)</p><p>The need for convalescent plasma donation has declined, with massive collection and use during the first year, reduction in use by late 2021, intermittent collection in 2022, and collection by only three or four centers in 2023. (See <a class="local">'Comparison with other antibody-based therapies'</a> above.)</p><p>Approaches to donor recruitment during the early phases of the pandemic varied depending on the region of the world, type of health care system, local disease prevalence, and evolution of the pandemic. Initial strategies relied on donor self-identification, social media campaigns, and clinician referrals. Plasma donors must meet standard criteria for blood donation and must have fully recovered from COVID-19 for at least two weeks. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7950.html" rel="external">"Blood donor screening: Medical history"</a>.)</p><p>The length of time that donors continue to produce high titers of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (and hence the period they can continue to donate convalescent plasma) is variable. One study suggested that many individuals had persistent antibodies for at least four months [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Another serial testing study suggested that the optimal time for high antibody levels is between four to eight weeks [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. In one cohort of nearly 300 recovered individuals, anti-RBD antibody levels were relatively stable over 10 weeks but declined over the course of several donations [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Some donors may continue to produce high levels of antibodies outside this range. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations state that the donation should be within six months of diagnosis. Only plasma from donors who qualify at the time of donation will be used.</p><p>Information from clinical trials suggests that many individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 did not have sufficient antibody titers to provide benefit, emphasizing the importance of testing the antibody level or titer prior to transfusing the plasma. (See <a class="local">'Antibody measurements and definition of "high titer"'</a> below.)</p><p>Advanced age, male sex, and severity of illness are associated with high-titer antibody responses [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. However, titer cannot be inferred from clinical criteria alone.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study that evaluated 126 potential COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors at a median of 43 days after an initial positive test for infection found that males had higher antibody levels than females, older individuals had higher levels than younger individuals, and those who were hospitalized had higher levels than outpatients [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Of these parameters, having been hospitalized was the strongest predictor.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study that evaluated immune responses in a series of 175 individuals recovering from mild SARS-CoV-2 infection reported development of neutralizing antibodies, assayed by pseudo-virus neutralization, in the majority of individuals within the first 10 to 15 days [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. As many as 30 percent had very low titer neutralizing antibodies; in approximately 6 percent, the antibodies were below the limits of detection. Titers of neutralizing and spike-binding antibodies were higher in older (60 to 85 years) and middle-age (40 to 59 years) individuals compared with younger individuals (15 to 39 years). There was a trend toward higher neutralizing antibody titers in males versus females and a positive correlation with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7483.html" rel="external">"Acute phase reactants"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study that compared immune responses in a cohort of 37 asymptomatic individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and a cohort of 37 symptomatic individuals found that the symptomatic individuals had slightly higher levels of virus-specific IgG and slightly longer persistence in the circulation during the early convalescent phase (first eight weeks after hospital discharge) [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p></p><p>Historically, receipt of an investigational (ie, non-licensed) vaccine has required a deferral period (eg, 12 months) from blood donation. This policy was modified for COVID-19 to allow for convalescent plasma donation, with the proviso that the individual must meet all other convalescent plasma donation criteria including prior COVID-19 diagnosis or evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from natural infection. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2367552337"><span class="h2">Maintaining the supply</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Supply and demand of convalescent plasma have varied over the course of the pandemic.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, over 500,000 units were administered to patients via an expanded access program, emergency use authorizations, and clinical trials. (See <a class="local">'General concepts'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Criteria for donation</strong> – Most blood donation centers are no longer collecting convalescent plasma. Donation criteria are the same as other blood product donations; the individual must have fully recovered from COVID-19 for at least two weeks. Having been vaccinated for COVID-19 by itself is not sufficient for convalescent plasma donation, but vaccinated individuals can donate if they meet other criteria. (See <a class="local">'Plasma donation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Plasma collection</strong> – Plasma is generally collected by apheresis. The level of the relevant antibody can be determined on the donor or the plasma unit using a functional virus neutralization assay or a serologic binding assay. Standard infectious disease screening and ABO and RhD typing are performed. Testing for anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies (and exclusion if positive) is used in parous female donors to reduce the risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). The Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA specifies that all units should be "high titer"; criteria for making this determination are discussed above. (See <a class="local">'Preparation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications for use</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/139068.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management of adults with acute illness in the outpatient setting", section on 'High-titer convalescent plasma'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127429.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management in hospitalized adults", section on 'Limited role for antibody-based therapies (monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma)'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128993.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Considerations in patients with cancer", section on 'Management of COVID-19'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Administration</strong> – If used, convalescent plasma is most likely to be effective if given early (eg, within nine days of symptom onset in outpatients; within three days of hospitalization) and if the plasma is of high titer. Plasma is typically given as a single dose of one to two units, without premedication. Recipients are monitored clinically. (See <a class="local">'Overview of therapeutic considerations'</a> above and <a class="local">'Optimal timing and titer (or antibody level)'</a> above and <a class="local">'Optimal dose'</a> above and <a class="local">'Premedications (typically not indicated)'</a> above and <a class="local">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Safety</strong> – Convalescent plasma carries risks of transfusion reactions, similar to standard plasma. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has not been noted. Antibody-containing products such as convalescent plasma might interfere with vaccine efficacy, but this question has not been addressed clinically. (See <a class="local">'Safety'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hyperimmune globulin</strong> – Hyperimmune globulin is a concentrated product manufactured from thousands of units of convalescent plasma. Efficacy was not demonstrated in a randomized trial.
