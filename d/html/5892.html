The range of symptoms and complications of GERD in children varies with age.</p><p>This topic review focuses on the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of GERD in children and adolescents. Other topic reviews relevant to GER and GERD in the pediatric age group are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5900.html" rel="external">"Management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5876.html" rel="external">"Gastroesophageal reflux in infants"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4961.html" rel="external">"Gastroesophageal reflux in premature infants"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gastroesophageal reflux</strong> – Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) refers to the retrograde passage of gastric contents into the esophagus, with or without regurgitation and/or vomiting [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. This is a normal physiologic process that occurs in healthy infants, children, and adults. Most episodes are brief and do not cause symptoms, esophageal injury, or other complications.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</strong> – Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is present when reflux episodes are associated with complications or troublesome symptoms [<a href="#rid1">1,3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Regurgitation versus vomiting</strong> – The term "regurgitate" describes reflux to the oropharynx, and "vomit" describes expulsion of the refluxate out of the mouth but not necessarily repetitively or with force. The terms are often used interchangeably in clinical practice. In this review, we will use the term "regurgitate" to describe obvious GER into the mouth, whether or not the refluxate is expelled from the mouth. Recurrent regurgitation and vomiting are often caused by GER but occasionally are caused by more serious problems, including underlying anatomic, metabolic, or neurologic abnormalities, which should be considered when indicated by the patient's clinical presentation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79114" href="/z/d/graphic/79114.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Recurrent vomiting or regurgitation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rumination</strong> – The term "rumination" describes a distinct phenomenon in which food is voluntarily regurgitated into the mouth, masticated, and then re-swallowed. This disorder should be considered as a possible cause of GER, but it has a behavioral etiology and specific treatment. (See <a class="local">'Recurrent vomiting or regurgitation'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113568.html" rel="external">"Rumination syndrome"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Few large population-based studies have described the epidemiology of GERD in children. Most studies focus on the prevalence of GERD in specific groups. Comparison among studies is also limited by the use of different definitions of GERD and the variable extent to which other possible causes of symptoms that were attributed to GERD were investigated.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevalence</strong> – According to a large community-based study of children in the United States, the prevalence of various symptoms suggestive of GER was 1.8 to 8.2 percent [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Among adolescents, 3 to 5 percent complained of heartburn or epigastric pain and 1 to 2 percent used antacids or acid-suppressing medication. The prevalence of GERD in adults in the Western world is approximately 10 to 20 percent [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Contrary to previously held beliefs, GERD does not appear to be limited to Western countries. The prevalence of GERD in children appears to be rising worldwide, although it is unclear whether the rise reflects increasing case identification or increases in obesity or other conditions that promote GERD [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Higher rates of GERD are seen among children with a history of prematurity, pulmonary diseases, and developmental and neuromuscular disorders such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>]. Children with Down syndrome are also at increased risk for GERD and other esophageal motor abnormalities for reasons that are poorly understood [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. These groups of children also appear to be at increased risk for developing respiratory complications related to GERD and represent a significant proportion of children referred for antireflux surgery. GERD also appears to be relatively common in children with obesity or cystic fibrosis [<a href="#rid6">6,12</a>]. GERD is more common in individuals with cystic fibrosis because the chronic cough induces reflux and the buffering capacity of the saliva is impaired, resulting in prolonged acid exposure in the distal esophagus. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5858.html" rel="external">"Cystic fibrosis: Overview of gastrointestinal disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complications </strong>– Respiratory complications (recurrent pneumonia and bronchiectasis) are most common in individuals with a history of prematurity, pulmonary diseases, developmental and neuromuscular disorders, and Down syndrome. Other complications of prolonged GERD include distal esophageal stricture, Barrett esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma, which are more common in individuals with esophageal dysmotility secondary to repair of esophageal atresia in the perinatal period compared with individuals without this congenital defect [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. Anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance are increased in patients with heartburn [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Natural history</strong> – Regurgitation in infants is common and typically decreases or resolves during the first year of life (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5876.html" rel="external">"Gastroesophageal reflux in infants"</a>). Although the problem usually resolves by the end of infancy, there is a weak association with GERD later in life. As an example, frequent regurgitation during infancy or a history of GERD in the mother (but not the father) predicts the risk of reflux-related symptoms during childhood. This was demonstrated in a prospective cohort study in which children who had more than 90 days of frequent regurgitation during the first two years of life were more likely to have heartburn around nine years of age [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Symptoms of GERD during childhood may persist into adolescence and adulthood ("tracking"). In a survey of 207 patients who were diagnosed with GERD based on an endoscopic examination showing esophagitis in childhood (mean age five years), approximately one-third had symptoms of significant GERD during early adulthood (approximately 15 years later) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. At least 9 (up to 23) percent had weekly symptoms of GER. Among those responding to the survey, 30 percent were currently taking acid-suppressing medications and 24 percent had undergone fundoplication. Other studies have shown similar results, but the lack of prospective trials limits the reliability of these observations [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Unanswered questions</strong> – Several questions related to the epidemiology and natural history of GERD in children remain unanswered or only partly understood:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Relationship between GER and respiratory diseases (chronic cough, asthma, and pneumonia).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Relationship between childhood GERD and GERD-related complications in adulthood.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Health care burden related to the diagnosis and treatment of childhood GERD.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Impact of GERD on quality of life for affected children and their families.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Mechanisms underlying the observed association between GERD and overweight/obesity – A common explanation is that obesity causes GERD via increased intraabdominal pressure, based primarily on adult data (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2257.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology of reflux esophagitis", section on 'Obesity'</a>). Another possibility is that the association may be mediated by dietary factors, as suggested by a report that children and adolescents with GERD consume more energy and fat compared with controls matched by body mass index, and that GERD severity (erosive esophagitis versus nonerosive GERD) is associated with consumption of increased protein and fat (but lower polyunsaturated fats) [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common symptoms of GER and GERD vary according to age, although overlap may exist.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Infants</strong> – GER is common in infants and usually is not pathologic. Regurgitation is present in 50 to 70 percent of all infants, peaks at age four to six months, and typically resolves by one year. A small minority of infants with GER develop other symptoms suggestive of GERD, including irritability, feeding refusal, hematemesis, anemia, respiratory symptoms, and failure to thrive. The clinical manifestations and management of GER in this age group are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5876.html" rel="external">"Gastroesophageal reflux in infants"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preschool-aged children</strong> – Preschool-age children with GERD may present with intermittent regurgitation. Less commonly, they may have respiratory complications including persistent wheezing. Decreased food intake, poor weight gain, or food aversion without any other complaints may be a symptom in young children. All of these symptoms are nonspecific and insufficient to make a definitive diagnosis of GERD.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A more specific symptom of GERD is Sandifer syndrome, an unusual intermittent posturing consisting of arching of the back, torsion of the neck (towards either side), and lifting up of the chin [<a href="#rid1">1,21</a>]. Sandifer syndrome sometimes occurs in typically developing preschool-aged children, as well as those who are developmentally delayed, as in the original descriptions [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. The symptom usually resolves with effective treatment of the GERD [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The differential diagnosis includes other causes of acquired torticollis in children. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6462.html" rel="external">"Acquired torticollis in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>School-aged children and adolescents</strong> – The cardinal symptoms of GERD in older children and adolescents are chronic heartburn and/or frequent regurgitation (either overt regurgitation or tasting stomach acid in the mouth) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Some patients report epigastric pain, nausea, and/or dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). Nonspecific symptoms that may be present include halitosis, excessive belching, wheezing, or erosion of dental enamel (especially on the inner surfaces of the teeth) [<a href="#rid1">1,24,25</a>]. Many younger children will not localize pain and report diffuse abdominal discomfort.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In older children, GERD-related chest pain often has the following characteristics:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Occurs after meals</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Awakens patients from sleep</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Is described as burning or squeezing and is located substernally and sometimes radiates to the back</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lasts minutes to hours and resolves either spontaneously or with antacids</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>May be exacerbated by emotional stress</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Complications of GERD, including esophagitis, strictures, Barrett esophagus, and hoarseness due to reflux-induced laryngitis, also may be seen. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2269.html" rel="external">"Barrett's esophagus: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6343.html" rel="external">"Approach to chronic cough in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Extraesophageal disorders that are associated with GERD also may be seen in older children and adolescents. In a large case-control study of children without neurologic defects, GERD was an independent risk factor for developing sinusitis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.3), laryngitis (OR 2.6), asthma (OR 1.9), pneumonia (OR 2.3), and bronchiectasis (OR 2.3) (see <a class="local">'Asthma'</a> below and <a class="local">'Recurrent pneumonia'</a> below) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. GER is also associated with otitis media with effusion, but causality has not been established. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5966.html" rel="external">"Otitis media with effusion (serous otitis media) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nonverbal children</strong> – Young or nonverbal children may communicate their GERD-related chest pain by tapping their chest or showing general irritability or distress. GERD is common in children with autism and may be manifested only by unexplained or self-injurious behaviors.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H320709681"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnostic process outlined below is generally consistent with an official consensus statement and systematic review issued by the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition/European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition [<a href="#rid1">1</a>] and the American Academy of Pediatrics [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H320709715"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The differential diagnosis of GERD in children is broad, particularly when the principal complaint is regurgitation, vomiting, or abdominal pain  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79114" href="/z/d/graphic/79114.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The diagnostic possibilities can be narrowed based upon the age of the child and the pattern of symptoms, using a thorough medical history  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61174" href="/z/d/graphic/61174.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5902.html" rel="external">"Approach to the infant or child with nausea and vomiting"</a>). The history should include the following elements:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Presence of heartburn/chest pain or abdominal pain, regurgitation or vomiting, water brash, and whether there is associated nausea</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Onset of symptoms and relation to meals</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) or odynophagia (pain while swallowing)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Underlying disorders including neurologic dysfunction or congenital anomalies</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Asthma, pneumonia, or chronic cough</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Food aversion</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Food allergies</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Functional constipation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Growth assessment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Medication history</p><p></p><p>Functional constipation may be associated with dyspeptic symptoms including GER, heartburn, and nausea [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. In many individuals, constipation may be unrecognized as the dyspeptic symptoms are the presenting complaint [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. The suspected mechanism is most likely that constipation delays gastric emptying via an intraintestinal reflex, termed the "cologastric brake" [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. The possibility of underlying constipation is suggested by palpation of stool distending the sigmoid colon and/or a digital rectal examination that detects hard stool in the rectal vault. Effective treatment of the underlying constipation may relieve the dyspeptic symptoms and avoid invasive procedures or unnecessary long-term pharmacotherapy for presumed GERD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5906.html" rel="external">"Constipation in infants and children: Evaluation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h2">Suggested approach for common clinical scenarios</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The previous discussion underscores the variable presentation of GERD in infants and children and the need to modify the diagnostic approach based upon the patient's age, type of symptoms, and symptom severity. The following sections will provide general recommendations for diagnosis in infants and children with commonly seen clinical presentations. These recommendations are consistent with the guideline issued by the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18"><span class="h3">Recurrent vomiting or regurgitation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Otherwise healthy children with recurrent vomiting or regurgitation after reaching the age of 18 months usually require evaluation. The differential diagnosis of regurgitation and vomiting is broad and depends on the age group and associated symptoms  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79114" href="/z/d/graphic/79114.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). For otherwise healthy children and adolescents with recurrent regurgitation or vomiting and no other symptoms, a thorough history and physical examination is often sufficient to exclude diagnoses other than GER.</p><p>Warning signs that suggest a diagnosis other than GERD include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fever</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Weight loss or faltering growth</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abdominal tenderness or distension</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bilious vomiting </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Marked hematemesis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hepatosplenomegaly</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Headache or new neurologic symptoms</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other systemic symptoms</p><p></p><p>Patients with any of these features warrant additional steps in the evaluation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5902.html" rel="external">"Approach to the infant or child with nausea and vomiting"</a>.)</p><p>The differential diagnosis of GERD includes several disorders that should be explored by the history  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79114" href="/z/d/graphic/79114.html" rel="external">table 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gastroparesis</strong> – Gastroparesis is the condition of impaired gastric emptying. This may cause postprandial vomiting, which usually occurs several hours after eating. Viral-induced gastroparesis may begin acutely after an episode of gastroenteritis and persist for several weeks or months thereafter and, occasionally, as long as 18 months. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5902.html" rel="external">"Approach to the infant or child with nausea and vomiting", section on 'Gastroparesis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rumination or psychogenic vomiting</strong> – Rumination syndrome is a psychogenic disorder in which the individual voluntarily regurgitates and re-swallows food, apparently as a self-comforting or habitual measure. The repeated episodes usually occur immediately after a meal. Rumination is more common among individuals with developmental disabilities but also occurs among typically developing children, adolescents, and adults. The disorder may be initially triggered by an episode of gastroenteritis, GERD, or by body weight concerns as a form of bulimia [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].

In this case, the evaluation usually should include an upper gastrointestinal series to look for anatomic abnormalities. An upper endoscopy with biopsy may be helpful in determining if the child has esophagitis (either peptic or eosinophilic esophagitis [EoE]). In older children or adolescents with heartburn or other symptoms suggestive of GERD, a four- to eight-week trial of acid suppression may be used as a diagnostic test for peptic disease as an alternative to an initial endoscopy [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

Many studies have shown clinical improvement in asthma when patients are treated for GER [<a href="#rid31">31,33</a>]; however, pinpointing patients who are likely to respond to treatment remains problematic [<a href="#rid1">1,34</a>].</p><p>For patients with asthma and symptoms that strongly suggest GERD (including heartburn in older children and adolescents or chronic regurgitation or vomiting in infants and younger children), we suggest a three-month trial of acid suppression.

Such patients should be evaluated for swallowing dysfunction using videofluoroscopy and/or fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing. Esophageal pH monitoring has low sensitivity and specificity in detecting whether aspiration pneumonia is related to reflux in an individual patient but may help establish the diagnosis in selected patients with suspected aspiration when combined with other investigations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14537.html" rel="external">"Aspiration due to swallowing dysfunction in children"</a>.)</p><p>Other than direct evaluation of swallowing for patients with suspected swallowing dysfunction, no techniques are available to determine definitively whether GERD is causing chronic aspiration in an individual patient. Measurement of lipid-laden macrophages (obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage) and nuclear scintigraphy have been used for this purpose, but neither technique can reliably determine whether a patient has chronic aspiration [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Other tests'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with recurrent pneumonia should also be evaluated to exclude underlying causes other than GERD, including foreign body aspiration, cystic fibrosis, or immunodeficiency. A history of choking is highly suggestive of foreign body aspiration, even if the choking occurred days or weeks prior to the onset of respiratory symptoms. An H-type tracheoesophageal fistula should also be considered in a child with recurrent pneumonia, especially if the same segment of the lung is always involved.

An empiric trial of a PPI may not be a valuable diagnostic test in infants and young children, in whom symptoms of GERD are less specific; however, response after a two-week trial of a PPI has been used as inclusion criteria for clinical trials in infants with GER [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].

These include children or adolescents with heartburn, hematemesis, or epigastric abdominal pain that fails to respond to or relapses quickly after empiric treatment [<a href="#rid1">1,37</a>]. In addition, endoscopy may be valuable in the evaluation of patients with recurrent regurgitation, dysphagia, or odynophagia; a history of food impaction; or in children with frequent GER that persisted from infancy until after two years of age.</p><p>At endoscopy, the examiner inspects the visual appearance of the esophageal mucosa, assesses the anatomy, and takes a series of biopsies for histologic examination. The findings help to determine the presence of strictures, webs, or rings as well as the severity of esophagitis and its complications, such as peptic strictures or Barrett esophagus, and to exclude other disorders such as eosinophilic, peptic, or infectious esophagitis. The diagnostic yield of endoscopy in children with symptoms suggesting GERD is not well established. In one large series of children undergoing endoscopy due to GERD symptoms, 35 percent were found to have erosive esophagitis [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. In another large series of children undergoing endoscopy for GER, only 13 percent had histologic evidence of esophagitis, whereas more than 50 percent of those undergoing endoscopy for dysphagia had gross and histologic abnormalities [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].</p><p>Endoscopy can be performed safely in infants, toddlers, and older children. Procedure-related complications of diagnostic endoscopy and biopsy are rare [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. Complications requiring medical attention, including under- or oversedation, occur in approximately 5 percent of cases [<a href="#rid44">44,45</a>]. The most common complication is transient sore throat or hoarseness, which occurs in approximately 35 percent of patients [<a href="#rid45">45</a>].</p><p>The endoscopy should include biopsies of the esophageal mucosa to evaluate for esophagitis, even if the esophagus appears normal on visual inspection [<a href="#rid1">1,3,46</a>]. Histologic abnormalities consistent with GERD include increased numbers of intraepithelial eosinophils, thickening of the basal cell layer, and elongation of the epithelial papillae [<a href="#rid35">35,47,48</a>]. In young children with esophagitis, the findings of basal zone hyperplasia are uncommon and other histologic features, such as the presence of neutrophils and eosinophils, and dilated vascular channels in papillae of the lamina propria are more typically seen [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Patients with reflux-associated esophagitis should be treated with acid suppression, as discussed in a separate topic review. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5900.html" rel="external">"Management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents", section on 'Esophagitis'</a>.)</p><p>The histologic features described above are only moderately specific for GERD. In patients with markedly increased numbers of eosinophils in esophageal biopsies, the possibility of EoE should be considered. EoE is a chronic immune-mediated disorder characterized by markedly increased intraepithelial eosinophils in greater numbers than noted in GERD. Symptoms of EoE and the number of intraepithelial eosinophils may not respond to acid suppression. EoE is increasingly recognized in children and adults, and the symptoms and histologic findings overlap with those of GERD, such that in some cases, it can be difficult to clearly distinguish between the disorders [<a href="#rid49">49,50</a>]. The number and distribution of eosinophils can help distinguish GERD from EoE. In children with GERD, the eosinophilic inflammation tends to be mild (&lt;15 eosinophils per high-power field) and limited to the distal esophagus, whereas in children with EoE, the inflammation tends to be more severe (&gt;15 eosinophils per high-power field) and located in the mid- or proximal esophagus. In addition, many patients with EoE have a history of atopy or peripheral eosinophilia and are more likely to fail to respond to antireflux treatment. Diagnostic and treatment approaches to patients with suspected EoE are discussed in a separate topic review.

However, the results may not correlate consistently with symptom severity, although there is a correlation with the presence of esophagitis on endoscopy [<a href="#rid1">1,48,51</a>]. Therefore, pH-MII can correlate symptoms of GERD with acid or nonacid reflux, which helps to raise or lower suspicion of GERD. However, pH-MII is not a routine or definitive diagnostic test for GERD and is not useful in many clinical situations, especially in infants.</p><p>A guideline based on expert opinion suggests that pH-MII may be useful in the following types of patients [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Atypical symptoms with unclear association with reflux</strong> – The pH-MII test helps by determining the correlation between a patient's symptoms with acid and nonacid reflux events.

Both EoE and GERD are associated with increased eosinophils in the esophagus, and in some children, distinguishing between the disorders may be difficult. The diagnosis of EoE is based on clinical and pathologic features including dysphagia, food impaction (in adolescents), feeding refusal (in toddlers), and symptoms of GERD in association with eosinophilic inflammation of 15 or greater eosinophils per high-power field. Both GERD and EoE may respond to PPI therapy, and response to PPIs is no longer considered useful to distinguish between these conditions [<a href="#rid54">54-57</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Definitions'</a> above and <a class="local">'Epidemiology and natural history'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical manifestations</strong> – Symptoms that suggest the possibility of GERD include (see <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Recurrent regurgitation that continues after two years of age</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Refusal of food, especially solids</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Frequent complaints of heartburn</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Severe or progressive asthma that is not responsive to standard therapy for asthma</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Recurrent pneumonia, particularly in children with neurologic dysfunction</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Chronic hoarseness or stridor</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> – The differential diagnosis of GERD in children is broad, particularly when the principal complaint is regurgitation, vomiting, or abdominal pain  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79114" href="/z/d/graphic/79114.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The diagnostic possibilities can be narrowed based upon the age of the child, the pattern of symptoms, and a thorough medical history  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61174" href="/z/d/graphic/61174.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'History'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Symptoms that are <strong>not</strong> typical for GERD include fever, asymptomatic vomiting, weight loss or faltering growth, abdominal tenderness or distension, bilious vomiting, marked hematemesis, hepatosplenomegaly, headache or new neurologic symptoms, or other systemic symptoms. GERD is occasionally associated with stridor, hoarseness, sinusitis, otitis media, or recurrent apnea, but, in most cases, these symptoms have other causes. Patients with these symptoms should be carefully evaluated for other disorders. (See <a class="local">'Recurrent vomiting or regurgitation'</a> above and <a class="local">'Other conditions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – When children present with symptoms suggesting GERD, further work-up is appropriate. Selection of tests depends upon the clinical scenario (see <a class="local">'Suggested approach for common clinical scenarios'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Exclude constipation</strong> – For all patients, the evaluation should include assessment for the possibility of occult or associated constipation since constipation causes secondary reflux or dyspeptic symptoms in many children.

It may also be appropriate for selected patients with severe or refractory asthma, or those with frequent nocturnal asthma. (See <a class="local">'Empiric treatment'</a> above and <a class="local">'Asthma'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/571.html" rel="external">"Gastroesophageal reflux and asthma"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Endoscopy</strong> – Endoscopic evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal tract is indicated for patients with:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Heartburn or epigastric abdominal pain that fails to respond to empiric acid suppression</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Dysphagia or odynophagia</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Selected patients who continue to have recurrent regurgitation after two years of age</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The main goal is to identify esophagitis, which is usually caused by GERD and less often by eosinophilic esophagitis. (See <a class="local">'Endoscopy and histology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Esophageal pH and impedance monitoring</strong> – These studies may be useful for patients with atypical symptoms, atypical asthma, or suspected eosinophilic esophagitis, but generally not for a child with typical heartburn.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Esophageal contrast radiography</strong> – This may be useful to exclude anatomic abnormalities in selected patients, such as those with dysphagia or odynophagia, young infants with intractable reflux, or those with suspected obstruction.
