Details of the evaluation and management of specific, defined primary TMA syndromes including TTP are presented in separate topic reviews on these syndromes. (See <a class="local">'Overview of primary TMA syndromes'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16672494"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following terminology is used in this topic review:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16672500"><span class="h2">Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>MAHA is a descriptive term for non-immune hemolysis (ie, Coombs-negative hemolysis) resulting from intravascular red blood cell fragmentation that produces schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70851" href="/d/graphic/70851.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Abnormalities in the microvasculature, including small arterioles and capillaries, are frequently involved. Intravascular devices such as a prosthetic heart valve or assist devices may also cause MAHA. Characteristic laboratory data are a negative direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test (DAT), an increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), increased indirect bilirubin, and low haptoglobin.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16672549"><span class="h2">Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Not all episodes of MAHA are caused by a TMA, and not all TMA will present with MAHA and thrombocytopenia. For example, some syndromes present with TMA limited to the kidney.</p><p>TMA describes a specific pathologic lesion in which abnormalities in the vessel wall of arterioles and capillaries lead to microvascular thrombosis [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. TMA is a pathologic diagnosis made by tissue biopsy, typically a kidney biopsy. It is commonly inferred from the observation of MAHA and thrombocytopenia in the appropriate clinical setting.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The primary TMA syndromes include TTP (hereditary or immune), Shiga toxin-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome (ST-HUS), drug-induced TMA (DITMA) syndromes, complement-mediated TMA (CM-TMA; hereditary or acquired), and rare hereditary disorders of vitamin B12 metabolism or factors involved in hemostasis. These syndromes require urgent, targeted treatment directed at the TMA pathophysiology. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1331.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology of TTP and other primary thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">With the exception of TTP (TMA resulting from severe ADAMTS13 deficiency) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS; Shiga toxin-mediated TMA), we use names that indicate the underlying cause. The nomenclature will evolve further as pathophysiologic mechanisms are better understood.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We do not use the term "atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS)," because this term has no specificity. aHUS was used historically to describe children with MAHA, thrombocytopenia, and kidney failure not associated with diarrhea. Unfortunately, the term is often used to describe any patient with a TMA who does not have severe ADAMTS13 deficiency or a documented Shiga toxin, therefore it has little clinical usefulness.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We also do not use the term "idiopathic" to describe any of the primary TMA syndromes. This term was used historically to imply ADAMTS13 deficiency in patients who did not have other recognized conditions that may cause TMA. The term "idiopathic" also has no specificity and should be avoided.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other systemic disorders that can present with MAHA and thrombocytopenia include pregnancy-associated syndromes (eg, preeclampsia with severe features and HELLP syndrome), severe hypertension, systemic infections and malignancies, autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, and complications of hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplantation. Unlike the primary TMA syndromes, these systemic disorders require therapy directed at the underlying disorder rather than specific therapy for the TMA. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6778.html" rel="external">"HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3837.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and treatment of hypertensive emergencies in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/106168.html" rel="external">"Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15803.html" rel="external">"Early complications of hematopoietic cell transplantation", section on 'Thrombotic microangiopathy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16673009"><span class="h1">INITIAL EVALUATION (ALL PATIENTS)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Individuals with a TMA may come to medical attention with any of a variety of presentations including unexplained anemia or thrombocytopenia, unexplained neurologic findings (suspected stroke or transient ischemic attack), or other acute illness.</p><p>The initial evaluation is focused on confirming that the patient has microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and thrombocytopenia, and excluding systemic disorders that manifest these findings, based on a consideration of presenting findings and likely causes  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100723" href="/d/graphic/100723.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Once systemic disorders have been excluded, the focus changes to identifying which primary TMA syndrome(s) are most likely and require immediate treatment.</p><p>We favor starting with a thorough history and physical examination that guides selected use of laboratory tests rather than a battery of tests to confirm or exclude a large number of diagnoses, especially as many available tests are not highly sensitive or specific for a single diagnosis. Institutions may develop their own approaches depending on their case mix and associated likely diagnoses (eg, higher likelihood of HUS in children; higher likelihood of drug-induced TMA (DITMA) in populations with kidney transplant or hematopoietic stem cell transplant), but these should not substitute for the judgement of the clinician evaluating the patient [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16673015"><span class="h2">Verify MAHA and thrombocytopenia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The first step is to confirm the presence of MAHA and thrombocytopenia by examination of the patient's peripheral blood smear. This requires review of the blood smear by a hematologist or other clinician with expertise in TMA syndromes, or experienced laboratory personnel. Details of this evaluation are provided in separate topic reviews. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4435.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the peripheral blood smear"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1338.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of immune TTP", section on 'MAHA and thrombocytopenia'</a>.)</p><p>If MAHA is not present, other acute systemic illnesses associated with pancytopenia must be considered. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/87499.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7152.html" rel="external">"Aplastic anemia: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7482.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Felty syndrome"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4670.html" rel="external">"Hematologic manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus"</a>.)</p><p>If MAHA is present, considerations include systemic illness or MAHA due to a mechanical cause (eg, without a disease). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7168.html" rel="external">"Non-immune (Coombs-negative) hemolytic anemias in adults", section on 'Fragmentation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2767417606"><span class="h2">Decision to use plasma exchange before diagnosis is known</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Initiating therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) treatment for TTP is urgent. Therefore, the initial evaluation and management must balance the level of confidence in a TTP diagnosis versus the suspicion of another etiology for the MAHA and thrombocytopenia  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef100722" href="/d/graphic/100722.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>The PLASMIC score is a simple algorithm that has been developed and validated to estimate the probability of ADAMTS13 activity ≤10 percent (and therefore the probability of the diagnosis of TTP) in a patient with MAHA and thrombocytopenia [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Use of such an algorithm provides confidence for a diagnosis of TTP before the results of ADAMTS13 activity testing is available. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1338.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of immune TTP", section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>If the concern for the diagnosis of TTP is strong, then TPE may need to be initiated while the diagnostic evaluation continues. (See <a class="local">'Suspected TTP: Start therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE)'</a> below.)</p><p>However, if the patient is not critically ill and the suspicion for the disorders discussed below is greater than the suspicion for TTP, then it may be appropriate to defer TPE while the evaluation continues. The degree of symptoms and timing of recovery with initial therapy contribute to the degree of confidence in a particular diagnosis:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Occurrence before gestational age of 25 weeks or a platelet count &lt;30,000/microL are rare in pregnancy syndromes (preeclampsia/HELLP [<strong>h</strong>emolysis, <strong>e</strong>levated <strong>l</strong>iver enzymes, and <strong>l</strong>ow <strong>p</strong>latelets]) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lack of improvement within several hours to three days after delivery of a pregnant patient decreases confidence that the symptoms were due to a pregnancy syndrome (preeclampsia/HELLP).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A longer duration of severe back pain (eg, weeks) or pulmonary symptoms increases suspicion for a malignancy and decreases confidence in a primary TMA.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A history of cancer should cause consideration of systemic metastatic cancer-associated TMA.

Involvement of a clinician with expertise in these disorders (and their distinction from TTP and HUS) is important.</p><p>Some systemic disorders, such as severe hypertension and preeclampsia/HELLP syndrome, are obvious. However, systemic malignancies may not be initially apparent and may require other testing (eg, chest radiography, bone marrow examination) for diagnosis. Systemic infections may not be obvious, and they may mimic all clinical features of TTP, and thus microbial testing may be required to identify an infectious organism.</p><p>Some of the more common and well-described conditions include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pregnancy complications</strong> – Preeclampsia with severe features and HELLP syndrome (<strong>h</strong>emolysis, <strong>e</strong>levated <strong>l</strong>iver enzymes, and <strong>l</strong>ow <strong>p</strong>latelets) are a continuum of pregnancy-related disorders. They characteristically cause MAHA and thrombocytopenia [<a href="#rid5">5,7</a>]. Less than 5 percent of Preeclampsia/HELLP syndromes are rare before gestational age 25 weeks (&lt;5 percent) and generally do not produce platelet counts &lt;30,000/microL (≤5 percent) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Also, individuals with SLE may experience a clinical "flare" during pregnancy. Distinguishing these disorders from TTP may be difficult because pregnancy may also trigger acute episodes of TTP (hereditary or immune). CM-TMA may cause severe postpartum acute kidney injury. Diagnostic evaluation of pregnant patients and decisions regarding delivery are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6681.html" rel="external">"Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Severe hypertension</strong> – Severe hypertension (eg, systolic blood pressure &gt;220 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mmHg) can cause MAHA and thrombocytopenia. Kidney injury may be present, but sometimes kidney dysfunction is modest or absent. In patients with severe hypertension, control of the blood pressure is the most critical initial management and may be the only intervention required. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3837.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and treatment of hypertensive emergencies in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Chronic, severe hypertension can also cause the characteristic pathologic features of TMA and varying degrees of kidney failure.

Common examples include bacterial endocarditis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, red blood cell parasites (eg, malaria, babesia) and systemic aspergillosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef101413" href="/d/graphic/101413.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).

In some patients, these findings are caused by microvascular metastases without overt evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). If there is any past history of cancer or any symptom suggestive of malignancy, such as persistent back pain or prominent pulmonary symptoms, a thorough physical examination and other testing to evaluate for a systemic malignancy is imperative, including bone marrow evaluation, chest radiography and other testing as indicated by symptoms. Identification of cancer cells in a marrow biopsy confirms the diagnosis of systemic malignancy. Identification of cancer cells may require special stains [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1306.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1353.html" rel="external">"Cancer-associated hypercoagulable state: Causes and mechanisms"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Systemic rheumatic disorders</strong> – Systemic rheumatic disorders, such as SLE, systemic sclerosis (SSc, scleroderma), and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), especially catastrophic APS (CAPS) can cause MAHA and thrombocytopenia by both immune and nonimmune mechanisms [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. They may also manifest TMA on kidney biopsies.

The rationale for focusing on this distinction is that TTP requires urgent intervention with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE; eg, within hours rather than days) to prevent serious or potentially life-threatening complications. Patients with complement-mediated TMA, such as patients with postpartum acute kidney injury, may also require urgent anti-complement treatment to prevent irreversible kidney damage.

ADAMTS13 is the protease that cleaves large von Willebrand factor multimers in the vasculature, and its deficiency promotes formation of platelet microthrombi. The diagnosis of TTP ultimately relies on clinical judgment since ADAMTS13 measures are often not available for several days, and testing may be unreliable [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Deficiency of ADAMTS13 can be hereditary (Upshaw-Shulman syndrome) or immune, as a result of inhibition of ADAMTS13 activity by an autoantibody.

The report used established criteria for determining a drug's causal association with TMA [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]; however, this may not be appropriate for determining a causal association with autoimmune disorders such as TTP.

Approximately one-third of patients have no neurologic symptoms; one-third may have nonspecific symptoms, such as confusion and headache; and one-third will have more severe neurologic symptoms, such as transient focal neurologic abnormalities, aphasia, diplopia, or weakness, clumsiness, and numbness of an arm or hand. In many cases, the focal symptoms occur transiently. Patients with TTP often have minor purpura despite severe thrombocytopenia; they rarely have overt bleeding.
