In a nationally representative survey in the United States that identified pregnant and nonpregnant women with major depression, pregnant women were less likely to receive mental health treatment than nonpregnant women (49 versus 57 percent) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Untreated disease causes maternal suffering and is associated with poor nutrition, comorbid substance use disorders, poor adherence with prenatal care, postpartum depression, impaired relationships between the mother and her infant and other family members, and an increased risk of suicide [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>].</p><p>Barriers to treatment of antenatal depression include cost, opposition to treatment (eg, fear of exposing the fetus to antidepressant medication or lack of interest in psychotherapy), unavailability of psychotherapy, and stigma [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. In addition, many clinicians are reluctant to use pharmacotherapy because they lack sufficient expertise [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], and the large literature is often inconsistent [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews choosing a specific treatment for severe antenatal unipolar major depression.

An episode of unipolar major depression is a period lasting at least two weeks, with five or more of the following nine symptoms: depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in most or all activities, insomnia or hypersomnia, change in appetite or weight, psychomotor retardation or agitation, low energy, poor concentration, guilt or thoughts of worthlessness, and recurrent thoughts about death or suicide  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994" href="/d/graphic/89994.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Additional information about the clinical presentation and diagnosis of unipolar major depression is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91774.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Clinical features"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1721.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3732864867"><span class="h2">Severity of illness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Selecting a treatment for antenatal major depression often depends upon the severity of illness:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mild to moderate</strong> – Mild to moderate episodes of unipolar major depression are generally characterized by five or six depressive symptoms  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994" href="/d/graphic/89994.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), as indicated by a score &lt;20 points on the self-report Patient Health Questionnaire – Nine Item (PHQ-9)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307" href="/d/graphic/59307.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). However, the instrument includes items about changes in appetite, energy, and sleep, which may reflect the physical effects of pregnancy rather than depression. Additional information about the PHQ-9 is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14860.html" rel="external">"Using scales to monitor symptoms and treat depression (measurement based care)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with mild to moderate illness do not manifest suicidal behavior or obvious impairment of functioning, and are less likely to develop complications such as psychotic features and catatonia, compared with patients who are severely ill. Mild to moderate depression can typically be managed in outpatient or partial hospital settings. Additional information about treating mild to moderate antenatal depression is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/108261.html" rel="external">"Mild to moderate episodes of antenatal unipolar major depression: Choosing treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Severe</strong> – Severe unipolar major depression is characterized by seven to nine depressive symptoms  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994" href="/d/graphic/89994.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), as indicated by a score ≥20 points on the PHQ-9  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307" href="/d/graphic/59307.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Severely ill patients often report suicidal ideation and behavior, typically demonstrate obvious impairment of functioning, and often manifest poor judgement that places the patient and others (including children) at risk for imminent harm. In addition, patients with severe depression can develop complications such as psychotic features and catatonia, and often have a history of severe or recurrent depressive episodes [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Patients with severe major depression should be referred to a psychiatrist for management and often require hospitalization [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. Treating major depression with psychotic features or catatonia is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16546.html" rel="external">"Unipolar major depression with psychotic features: Acute treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15869.html" rel="external">"Catatonia: Treatment and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Difficulties may arise in determining the number of depressive symptoms that are present during pregnancy because changes in appetite, energy, and sleep may due to depression, or may represent normal pregnancy-related changes. The presence of these somatic symptoms should be evaluated in the context of normal expectations for pregnancy. As an example, although food aversions can occur during pregnancy, patients with anorexia who fail to gain weight may have mild to moderate depression, and pregnant patients with anorexia who lose weight may have severe depression. In the same vein, pregnancy can cause fatigue. However, lack of energy to the point that patients need to make a significant effort to initiate or maintain usual daily activities can be a mild to moderate depressive symptom, and anergia to the point that patients cannot get out of bed for hours is probably a symptom of severe depression. Persistent uncertainty as to whether an episode of major depression is mild to moderate or severe can be resolved by referral to a psychiatrist (preferably one specializing in perinatal disorders).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2792388325"><span class="h1">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The general principles and issues that are involved in treating unipolar major depression during pregnancy include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Setting</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of prior treatment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Educating patients and families</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adherence</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Monitoring symptoms</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prescribing antidepressants</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Managing nonresponse</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Making referrals</p><p></p><p>These general principles are discussed in detail separately.

Patients start with initial therapy and progress through each step until they respond. The primary treatments are antidepressant medications. In addition, psychotherapy is nearly always indicated as an adjuvant to pharmacotherapy, unless symptoms render the patient incapable of participating.</p><p>The duration of an adequate trial with antidepressant medications is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1725.html" rel="external">"Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment"</a>.)</p><p>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is frequently indicated for patients with psychotic features, catatonia, high risk of suicide, and fluid and food refusal leading to dehydration and malnutrition. In addition, severe, antenatal unipolar major depression that does not respond to multiple antidepressant trials is often treated with ECT. (See <a class="local">'Electroconvulsive therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Continuation treatment is generally indicated for patients who respond to acute treatment of unipolar major depression, and additional maintenance treatment is indicated for patients with an increased risk of recurrence. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14674.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Continuation and maintenance treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H87155478"><span class="h3">Initial treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For pregnant women with severe unipolar major depression, we suggest antidepressant medications as initial treatment [<a href="#rid1">1,4,10-13</a>]. Using antidepressants is consistent with several practice guidelines, including those from the American Psychiatric Association, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; the general consensus is that the benefits of antidepressants outweigh the potential risks [<a href="#rid8">8-10,14-19</a>]. Antidepressants are frequently used to treat prenatal unipolar major depression; in a nationally representative survey of pregnant women with major depression in the United States (n = 375), treatment with pharmacotherapy was reported by 40 percent, more than any other treatment modality [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. The choice of antidepressant depends primarily upon the prior treatment history. (See <a class="local">'Choosing an antidepressant'</a> below.)</p><p>Nevertheless, psychotherapy is a reasonable alternative to antidepressants for severe antenatal depression in patients with a prior history of poor response to multiple antidepressants, or if patients decline pharmacotherapy after weighing the risks (see <a class="local">'Weighing the risks'</a> below). Psychotherapy is appropriate provided that the depressive syndrome does not include suicidal ideation or obvious impairment of function. If patients do not respond to psychotherapy after several sessions (eg, eight), we switch patients to antidepressants. In addition, psychotherapy can be administered as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>Although no randomized trials have evaluated the efficacy or safety of antidepressants during pregnancy, numerous trials that excluded pregnant patients have demonstrated the efficacy of antidepressants for treating the general population of patients with major depression [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1725.html" rel="external">"Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment", section on 'Efficacy of antidepressants'</a>.)</p><p>Patients receiving pharmacotherapy for prenatal unipolar major depression typically receive psychotherapy as an adjuvant, provided that patients are not too ill to participate in therapy [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. If depressive symptoms do not respond adequately to treatment, the frequency and/or intensity of psychotherapy is increased by scheduling more frequent outpatient visits or referring patients to a partial hospitalization program. Choosing adjunctive psychotherapy for patients with prenatal depression is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/108261.html" rel="external">"Mild to moderate episodes of antenatal unipolar major depression: Choosing treatment", section on 'Initial treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Evidence supporting the use of pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy includes randomized trials that indicate combined therapy is more efficacious than pharmacotherapy alone for treating the general population of patients with unipolar major depression [<a href="#rid4">4,10,21</a>].

There is no compelling evidence that the safety of fetal exposure differs among antidepressants. The one exception is monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which are not used during pregnancy. Animal studies have implicated them in congenital anomalies and there is the potential for hypertensive crisis when MAOIs are combined with tocolytic agents to delay labor [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>Clinicians choosing a medication for pregnant patients with no prior treatment history should consider the safety of the drug during breastfeeding even if patients are not planning to breastfeed, because the decision may change. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1720.html" rel="external">"Safety of infant exposure to antidepressants and benzodiazepines through breastfeeding"</a>.)</p><p>We typically avoid recently marketed medications until more information is available regarding their effects in human pregnancy [<a href="#rid15">15,17,23</a>].

Psychotic depression is generally treated with an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic; however, ECT is a reasonable alternative [<a href="#rid19">19,58</a>]. The specific choice depends upon several factors that are discussed separately, as is the administration of treatment and evidence of efficacy (in randomized trials that excluded pregnant patients). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16546.html" rel="external">"Unipolar major depression with psychotic features: Acute treatment", section on 'First line'</a>.)</p><p>Observational studies suggest that first trimester exposure to SSRIs, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10042" href="/d/drug information/10042.html" rel="external">venlafaxine</a>, and tricyclics is associated with little to no risk of teratogenicity [<a href="#rid10">10,25</a>]. In addition, most observational studies have found that prenatal exposure to first- and second-generation antipsychotics does not appear to increase the risk of major physical malformations above rates observed in the general population. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89067.html" rel="external">"Antenatal use of antidepressants and the potential risk of teratogenicity and adverse pregnancy outcomes: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors", section on 'Teratogenicity'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/100334.html" rel="external">"Antenatal use of antidepressants and risks of teratogenicity and adverse pregnancy outcomes: Drugs other than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/17159.html" rel="external">"Teratogenicity, pregnancy complications, and postnatal risks of antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, lithium, and electroconvulsive therapy", section on 'Antipsychotics'</a>.)</p><p>ECT is generally regarded as safe during pregnancy, especially if the technique for performing ECT is modified for pregnant patients.

However, an antidepressant plus a benzodiazepine at initiation of treatment may be necessary for severe anxiety. Benzodiazepines are often added at the beginning of pharmacotherapy, using standard doses, and then gradually discontinued once the antidepressant begins to take effect. Given the risk of dependence and possibly increased risks of neonatal complications, we suggest not using benzodiazepines for more than two weeks, especially near term. However, longer use may be necessary to achieve remission of symptoms. The general efficacy and use of adjunctive benzodiazepines for the general treatment of anxious depression are discussed separately.

However, the intermediate length half-lives of clonazepam and lorazepam may predispose to accumulation in the infant, and benzodiazepines can cause a withdrawal syndrome. We typically use lorazepam because it has a shorter half-life than clonazepam.</p><p>We generally avoid <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9345" href="/d/drug information/9345.html" rel="external">diazepam</a> in pregnant patients unless they are uniquely responsive to it. Diazepam can be sedating and its long half-life makes it more likely to persist in breastfed infants than drugs with shorter half-lives [<a href="#rid59">59</a>].</p><p>The risks of congenital malformations and postnatal risks (including neonatal withdrawal or toxicity) due to antenatal exposure to benzodiazepines are discussed separately.

For these patients, we suggest that they continue their antidepressant, especially if the depressive episode has been severe (eg, marked by suicide attempts, psychotic features, or functional incapacitation) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>However, if the depressive syndrome has been mild to moderate and the patient feels strongly about avoiding further exposure, pharmacotherapy can be discontinued for the first trimester (during organogenesis), and subsequently restarted. In addition, it is reasonable to switch the patient from pharmacotherapy to psychotherapy (eg, cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy), while monitoring for deterioration [<a href="#rid4">4,14</a>]. A gradual (eg, at least over one to two weeks) taper of antidepressants is preferred to avoid worsening of the depressive syndrome [<a href="#rid4">4,10,21</a>]; patients may nevertheless insist upon abruptly stopping the drug due to concerns about teratogenicity.</p><p>Unplanned pregnancy may also arise in women who are currently euthymic and treated with antidepressants; these patients need to decide whether to continue treatment [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The factors involved include the risks of recurrence and maternal depression, as well as the risks of using antidepressants during pregnancy.</p><p>Discontinuing antidepressant drugs in pregnant women who are euthymic can lead to recurrence of depression, based upon randomized trials that were conducted in the general population of patients with major depression (who were not pregnant). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14674.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Continuation and maintenance treatment", section on 'Antidepressant medications'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, multiple observational studies suggest that stopping antidepressants may cause depressive relapses [<a href="#rid60">60-62</a>]. As an example, one prospective observational study in a perinatal psychiatry program enrolled euthymic, pregnant women with a prepregnancy history of major depression, who were either currently taking antidepressants (primarily selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) or had recently (&lt;12 weeks prior to last menstrual period) discontinued them for at least one week [<a href="#rid63">63</a>]. Among patients who maintained antidepressants throughout the pregnancy (n = 82) or who discontinued antidepressants (n = 65), relapse occurred in fewer patients who continued treatment (26 versus 68 percent). The investigators also found that among patients who stopped treatment, reintroducing antidepressants attenuated the risk of relapse, but not entirely.</p><p>The increased risk of recurrence associated with discontinuation of antidepressants may be especially high in pregnant women with a lifetime history of several (eg, four) depressive episodes before pregnancy [<a href="#rid64">64</a>]. This finding is consistent with observations in the general population of patients with major depression that with each recurrence of major depression, the risk of a subsequent episode increases. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14693.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Course of illness", section on 'Recurrence'</a>.)</p><p>Many women who learn that they are pregnant while taking antidepressants decide to stop treatment during the first trimester [<a href="#rid62">62,65</a>]. Retrospective studies of health insurance databases have found that among women (total n &gt;25,000) who used antidepressants during the three to six months immediately preceding their pregnancy, 50 to 80 percent discontinued treatment during pregnancy [<a href="#rid28">28,66-68</a>].</p><p>For women who conceive while taking antidepressants but wish to discontinue them, a slow taper is preferred rather than abrupt discontinuation [<a href="#rid10">10,21</a>]. As an example, the drug can be tapered over one to two months by decreasing the dose approximately 25 percent every one to two weeks. This can diminish the risk of drug withdrawal symptoms and increase the probability of detecting incipient depressive symptoms before a full-blown depressive episode recurs.</p><p>If a woman becomes pregnant while on <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9743" href="/d/drug information/9743.html" rel="external">paroxetine</a> and is stable, we suggest that she continue the medication, especially if response to paroxetine occurred after several other failed antidepressant trials. Although findings from multiple observational studies suggest that paroxetine may be associated with a small absolute risk of congenital cardiac anomalies, several other studies have found that paroxetine is not associated with cardiac anomalies [<a href="#rid15">15,17</a>]. In addition, switching increases the risk of relapse and number of drug exposures. Nevertheless, patients may prefer to switch to another drug (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9886" href="/d/drug information/9886.html" rel="external">sertraline</a>), especially if paroxetine is the only drug they have used [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].

In addition, there has never been an episode of mania or hypomania. (See <a class="local">'Unipolar major depression'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Mild to moderate episodes</strong> – Mild to moderate episodes of unipolar major depression are generally characterized by five or six depressive symptoms. Patients with mild to moderate illness do not manifest suicidal behavior or obvious impairment of functioning, are less likely to develop complications such as psychotic features, and can typically be managed in outpatient or partial hospital settings. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Severe episodes</strong> – Severe unipolar major depression is characterized by seven to nine depressive symptoms. Severely ill patients often report suicidal ideation and behavior, typically demonstrate obvious impairment of functioning, and often manifest poor judgement that places the patient and others at risk for imminent harm. In addition, patients with severe depression can develop complications such as psychotic features, and often have a history of severe or recurrent depressive episodes. Patients with severe major depression should be referred to a psychiatrist for management and often require hospitalization.

However, psychotherapy is a reasonable alternative in patients with a prior history of poor response to multiple antidepressants, or if patients decline pharmacotherapy after weighing the risks. Using psychotherapy is appropriate provided that the depressive syndrome does not include suicidal ideation or obvious impairment of function. Patients receiving pharmacotherapy typically receive psychotherapy as an adjuvant. (See <a class="local">'Initial treatment'</a> above and <a class="local">'Weighing the risks'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Pregnant patients with severe unipolar major depression who were successfully treated with antidepressants prior to pregnancy should generally receive the same drug during pregnancy. For patients who have not been treated with antidepressants in the past, we suggest selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as initial treatment, rather than other antidepressants (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). We typically select <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9886" href="/d/drug information/9886.html" rel="external">sertraline</a> if the patient has not previously used antidepressants; however, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8874" href="/d/drug information/8874.html" rel="external">citalopram</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9046" href="/d/drug information/9046.html" rel="external">escitalopram</a> are reasonable alternatives.
