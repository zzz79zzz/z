         Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a medication and a drug misused for its euphoric, anxiolytic, stimulant, sedative, and sexual effects. Gamma butyrolactone (GBL) and 1,4 butanediol (BD) are analogs or precursors of GHB, which, when ingested, are rapidly metabolized to GHB with the same clinical effects. GHB, GBL, and BD have also been used as dietary "supplements" for purported health benefits, including bodybuilding and treatment of insomnia, anxiety, and alcohol dependence.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tolerance, psychologic and physical dependence, and withdrawal have been reported not only among individuals using GHB, GBL, and BD for recreational purposes and purported health benefits [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-13

         The clinical features and management of GHB withdrawal and dependence are reviewed here. Throughout this review, we use the term "GHB" to refer to GHB and its analogs, GBL and BD, unless specifically noted. The following are discussed separately:

         Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) products were first sold in the United States (US) and Europe in the late 1980s as a sleep aid and for purported anabolic effects. GHB analogs, gamma butyrolactone (GBL) and 1,4 butanediol (BD), were marketed in the late 1990s as "dietary supplements" and sold in health food stores, at gyms, and on the internet purportedly to help with sleep, weight loss, anxiety, depression, and other alleged health benefits [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-5
         </a>
         ]. As recreational use grew and reports of adverse effects increased, regulation of GHB and its analogs resulted in the removal of products and a shift to illicit supplies. Pharmaceutical GHB (

         </span>
         The prevalence of chronic GHB misuse and dependence is not well known and drawn largely from case reports, case series, and limited inclusion in some national surveillance systems. GHB use disorder is not recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Illnesses (DSM-5), and there are no International Classification of Diseases – 10 edition (ICD-10) codes for GHB, thus limiting data collection.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cases of GHB dependence and withdrawal internationally increased substantially in the mid to late 2000's and continue at rates higher than the US, particularly in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Netherlands.

         In the US, the earliest cases of GHB dependence and withdrawal were reported in California and Minnesota in the early 2000's among bodybuilders, health supplement users, and recreational drug users [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,4,5
         </a>
         ]. National data collected by the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services on treatment services included GHB in 2016 and indicates that cases continue at a low level. Annually, the number of patients in treatment for GHB dependence increased from 225 in 2016 to 404 in 2021. The percentage of patients for whom GHB was identified as the primary drug of dependence also increased from 14 to 20 percent during this period [

         In the Netherlands, GHB misuse and dependence have had a significant health impact, requiring community level adaptations. Patients with GHB dependence accounted for 2 percent (956 total) of all patients receiving treatment in 2021 [

          36

         Studies suggest there is greater risk for dependence among people using GHB than those using alcohol [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. Many factors contribute to this risk. The steep dose response, rapid onset of euphoric and anxiolytic effects, lack of hangover effects, cheap and easy access, trivialization of harms such as GHB coma (see below), and common perceptions of GHB as safe and life enhancing all may contribute to chronic use, tolerance, and subsequent dependence [

          11,13,21,37,42-44

         The pharmacology, cellular toxicology, and kinetics of GHB are discussed separately; aspects of these that are directly related to dependence and withdrawal are briefly discussed immediately below. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/307.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         GHB acts primarily on GHB-specific receptors and on gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-B receptors. It may also exert effects on some subtypes of GABA-A receptors, although this has not been well established. Chronic use of GHB exerts multifaceted neurotransmitter and neuromodulatory effects on the GABA, dopamine, glutamate, serotonin, norepinephrine, and cholinergic systems; as well as on neurosteroidogenesis and oxytocin release.
        </p>
        <p>
         Chronic GHB use is believed to lead to tolerance associated with downregulation of inhibitory GABA and GHB receptors. Abrupt cessation of GHB use results in a complex interaction of neurobiologic mechanisms, including decreased GABA- and GHB-mediated neuroinhibition, resulting in unopposed excitatory neurotransmission and the onset of a withdrawal syndrome. The complexity of the systems involved and diversity of the symptoms and signs manifested suggest that different medication combinations may be required for effective treatment [
         <a href="#rid50">

        <p>
         Gamma butyrolactone (GBL) and 1,4 butanediol (BD) are GHB analogs that are rapidly metabolized to GHB after ingestion. GHB-dependent individuals may use the three compounds interchangeably. GHB tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal develop subsequent to chronic BD and GBL use and manifest with the same symptomatology as GHB dependence and withdrawal, although the shorter onset of action, greater potency, and longer duration of effect of GBL may increase the risk for dependence compared with GHB [

         GHB withdrawal is generally similar to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal, commonly presenting with tremor, diaphoresis, anxiety, agitation, and confusion; but with a more rapid and abrupt onset and more prominent neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as delirium and psychosis [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. However, the presentation of GHB withdrawal can be highly variable. Severe refractory withdrawal, often involving prolonged delirium and other complications, has been reported and may result in part from delayed, inadequate, or inappropriate treatment. Co-use and co-dependence on alcohol and other drugs, especially stimulants, is common and may be associated with a more severe clinical course [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ]. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Reported dose size among patients with GHB dependence is highly variable but typically ranges from 1 to 6 grams. Dutch data on 274 inpatient detoxifications among 229 patients reported a mean dose of 4 grams and a mean daily dose of 56 grams (range 10 to 312 grams) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Other Dutch studies report that concentrations of GHB were approximately 650 mg/mL (since patients often report doses in milliliters without knowing concentration), although concentrations vary [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53,54
         </a>
         ]. Daily doses of greater than 30 grams of GHB or 15 grams of GBL have been used to predict increased risk of severe withdrawal [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         GHB dosing patterns among patients prone to withdrawal vary significantly, from daily use among bodybuilders or nightly use among patients self-treating insomnia to binge use (as frequently as every 30 to 60 minutes over consecutive days) among recreational users for partying or extended chemsex [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3,4,26,37
         </a>
         ]. Most patients with GHB dependence who develop withdrawal engage in frequent daily dosing (ie, every one to six hours) for a period of weeks to months or years. As physical dependence worsens, dosing may occur every 30 to 60 minutes, often with nocturnal/around-the-clock dosing to control withdrawal symptoms [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,6,7,39,55
         </a>
         ]. Patients with severe dependence often keep a bottle of GHB at hand to sip throughout the day as needed [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. However, severe withdrawal has occurred with use every two to three hours, around the clock, for a duration as short as 7 to 10 days [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45,56,57
         </a>
         ]. Dosing more than three times per day, particularly with nocturnal dosing, has been used to predict increased risk of severe withdrawal [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32,39,55
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with GHB withdrawal may present specifically for planned treatment or for acute, unplanned treatment of withdrawal symptoms, or may develop symptoms of withdrawal while hospitalized for GHB intoxication, trauma, or other medical conditions [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>

         Symptoms of GHB withdrawal develop rapidly. Among frequent users, symptoms may begin as rapidly as 30 minutes after the last dose. Typically, symptom onset is within one to six hours of cessation or significantly decreased dosing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Initial symptoms of GHB withdrawal most often include anxiety, agitation, tremor, diaphoresis, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, and insomnia. Within 24 hours, symptoms may progress to severe withdrawal with refractory agitation, hallucinations, delusions, and delirium.
        </p>
        <p>
         The symptom course is often unpredictable; apparent initial improvement may be followed by dramatic deterioration or the recurrence of symptoms including hallucinations, delirium, and non-neurologic complications such as rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury (ie, acute kidney failure), and possibly death [

         Profound insomnia is common and has been reported to play a key role in ongoing use, decision to seek treatment, withdrawal severity, and relapse [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,21,55

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Variability in the presentation and treatment response may be due to GHB dose, total daily intake, frequency of use, and use of co-intoxicants. Delayed presentation for treatment is associated with more severe symptoms. Gamma butyrolactone (GBL) withdrawal may be associated with a more rapid onset of symptoms [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55,61,62
         </a>

         GHB withdrawal is uncommon. The diagnosis is made clinically based upon the presence of typical symptoms in an individual with a known history of prolonged or habitual GHB use. Without obtaining a clear history of GHB use and discontinuation, the clinician must evaluate the patient for other, more common causes of delirium with hyperactive behavior for which the differential diagnosis is broad and reviewed in detail separately.

         Of note, the autonomic disturbances associated with GHB withdrawal are typically mild when compared with withdrawal or acute intoxication syndromes associated with other sedative-hypnotic agents, alcohol, or sympathomimetic agents. Conversely, agitation and delirium are often prolonged with GHB withdrawal.

         Gas chromatography or mass spectrometry is necessary to detect GHB. The results of such testing often require 7 to 10 days, precluding their use in acute management. Furthermore, the rapid disappearance of GHB in the blood (four to six hours) means that blood concentrations are likely to be negative unless the patient presents with acute intoxication and progresses directly to withdrawal. While confirmation of GHB in urine may confirm ingestion and support the diagnosis, it is unlikely to be positive if the urine specimen is collected longer than 6 to 12 hours after ingestion.

         GHB withdrawal is a clinical diagnosis; no laboratory tests are necessary. Tests are obtained on the basis of the history and physical examination to investigate alternative diagnoses or complications. (See

         Patients withdrawing from GHB may suffer from poor nutrition and may experience symptoms, such as vomiting, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, and agitation, which increase their risk for rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, and other complications. In patients experiencing GHB withdrawal, we generally obtain the following studies:

         The treatment of GHB withdrawal is primarily supportive, including the prompt administration of sedatives to control symptoms and prevent progression to severe agitation, delirium, rhabdomyolysis, and seizures. Careful monitoring for respiratory depression and potential complications is critical. In general, we recommend inpatient treatment but recognize that this may not be possible or optimal in all clinical contexts. We assess the risk of severe withdrawal, whenever possible, to guide treatment. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Assessing the risk of severe withdrawal'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Early symptoms of anxiety, tremor, diaphoresis, insomnia, and tachycardia may develop very quickly following dose cessation and progress rapidly to severe withdrawal delirium, requiring intensive care. Aggressive efforts to control agitation and delirium may require tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Severe withdrawal with delirium'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Once severe withdrawal symptoms are under control, early involvement of psychiatric specialists is critical for ongoing evaluation and management of comorbid psychiatric illnesses that may contribute to relapse. Management of depression, anxiety, agitation, and insomnia is imperative prior to discharge, as well as facilitation of appropriate psychiatric follow-up and chemical dependence treatment. (See

         Patients who have anxiety, insomnia, and tremor but remain oriented and appropriately interactive (without delirium or hallucinations) are at less immediate risk for severe complications but may acutely progress to hyperactive delirium.

         To prevent acute decompensation, it is important to treat patients' symptoms (eg, anxiety, tremor, diaphoresis, insomnia) rapidly and aggressively with sedative-hypnotic agents. In cases of planned detoxification, sedatives may be started before symptom onset, depending on the time since the last dose and risk of severe withdrawal [

         monitoring is preferred, as patients may deteriorate rapidly and unpredictably. Frequent monitoring of mental status and vital signs (approximately every two hours) should be performed. (See

         Severe withdrawal increases the risk of harm to the patient and caregivers, risk of complications (eg, delirium, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, seizures), and requires treatment with large doses of sedatives. Therefore, close monitoring in an intensive care setting is needed. Benzodiazepines are the mainstay of treatment for severe GHB withdrawal. Barbiturates (eg,

         Respiratory depression, due to the high doses of sedatives necessary to control refractory withdrawal, often necessitates tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Rapid sequence intubation may be performed using standard induction and neuromuscular blocking medications. Continuous cardiac and pulse oximetry monitoring are needed. (See

         Hyperthermia associated with severe GHB withdrawal has been reported, which is managed with control of neuromuscular hyperactivity and external cooling measures. Rhabdomyolysis is a potential complication, and serum creatine kinase concentrations should be measured in patients with severe withdrawal. The diagnosis and management of rhabdomyolysis are reviewed separately. (See

         (20 mg orally given every one to two hours, up to 60 mg or light sedation achieved) started as soon as possible after the last GHB dose and, ideally, prior to symptom onset. Maintenance dosing was diazepam 10 to 20 mg orally per hour, up to a maximum of 120 mg in 24 hours [

         has a rapid onset of action (maximum effect in five minutes with IV administration) but a high volume of distribution, rapidly redistributing into adipose tissue, so its sedative effects may diminish rapidly, necessitating repeat doses until total body loading is achieved. Although loading doses (oral or IV) may not decrease the likelihood of withdrawal delirium, they reduce the severity of delirium and control agitation [

          65

          lorazepam
         </a>
         is effective but lacks the long half-life and lipid solubility of diazepam. Nevertheless, if IV lorazepam is the only option, we recommend giving it in 2 mg increments every 10 to 15 minutes, titrating to effect. It is important to remember that lorazepam levels will drop substantially over 24 hours, as will its therapeutic effect. Therefore, we recommend replacing IV lorazepam with oral diazepam as soon as possible. (See

         Although symptom-triggered therapy protocols (similar to those used in the treatment of alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal) have not been validated specifically for GHB withdrawal, both objective and subjective scales (CIWA-Ar, OWS, SWS/OWS) [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22,27,52,53,69,74,82
         </a>
         ] have been used. We believe they provide a sound management approach and concur with the concept of using rapidly escalating doses of a benzodiazepine until control of clinical symptoms, such as agitation or delirium, is achieved. However, unlike alcohol withdrawal, hypertension and tachycardia may or may not occur with GHB withdrawal. The use of a validated alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal scale can aid in establishing a baseline and enabling ongoing assessment of the clinical course and the response to sedation. However, benzodiazepine dosing should be based on control of clinical symptoms rather than objective scoring [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22,24
         </a>
         ], and clinicians must note that dosages may differ substantially when treating for GHB withdrawal; one must assess individual responses and dose accordingly  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64835" href="/z/d/graphic/64835.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Use of this approach for alcohol withdrawal is reviewed separately. (See

         Resistance to benzodiazepine therapy occurs with some frequency among patients being treated for GHB withdrawal, particularly those taking high doses of GHB. Whereas GHB acts at gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-B receptors (and GHB-specific receptors), benzodiazepines act at GABA-A receptors, which may account for the limited efficacy of benzodiazepines in some cases of severe acute GHB withdrawal [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. In such cases, an adjunctive or alternative sedative should be used. We believe that if 100 mg of IV

          diazepam

         given over 60 minutes fails to achieve control of agitation, it is reasonable to add a barbiturate or

         will require tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.

         Once acute withdrawal symptoms are controlled, benzodiazepine treatment may be continued over several weeks in severe cases, with the dose gradually tapered.

         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9345" href="/z/d/drug information/9345.html" rel="external">
          diazepam

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Only pre-existing primary hypertension should be managed using antihypertensive medications. We believe that beta blocking medications are
         <strong>
          contraindicated
         </strong>
         in GHB withdrawal. They are ineffective in treating or preventing withdrawal delirium and may worsen hypertension and coronary ischemia.

         Due to a relatively large number of cases of GHB withdrawal that were refractory to treatment with benzodiazepines, Dutch specialists developed an inpatient detoxification treatment protocol using titration and tapering (DeTiTap) of pharmaceutical GHB (which is often sodium-GHB) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,9,54,68
         </a>
         ]. Although long-acting medications are generally preferred for withdrawal treatment, and GHB has a short duration of action, the DeTiTap protocol has been successful. Large studies (total n = 450) report that GHB withdrawal symptoms were significantly reduced, and successful detoxification was achieved in 85 percent of cases [
         <a href="#rid74">
          74
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Using this protocol, patients are admitted and administered a dose of pharmaceutical GHB within 2.5 hours of the last self-administered dose to prevent withdrawal symptoms. The initial dose is calculated per protocol and titrated up or down over the course of one to two days to identify the dose at which the patient is stable and experiences neither withdrawal nor sedation. Once this dose is found, subsequent doses are tapered over 7 to 14 days (mean 11 days). The protocol has been incorporated into national Dutch treatment guidelines as standard GHB detoxification [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,9,74
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Adverse events using this protocol are uncommon; delirium was reported in only 2 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid74">
          74
         </a>
         ]. Two cases of hypernatremia in patients treated with pharmaceutical sodium-GHB have been reported. In both cases, excessive doses of GHB were administered in addition to infusions of sodium chloride solution (NaCl). When high doses of sodium-GHB are being given, serum sodium concentrations should be monitored daily [
         <a href="#rid90">
          90
         </a>
         ]. No association between severity of symptoms and pulse and blood pressure were found using this detoxification method, suggesting that relative stability of vital signs may not be suitable for monitoring of withdrawal [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A matched-subject, multicenter observational study compared a subset of Dutch patients detoxified using the pharmaceutical GHB taper (n = 42) with a historical sample of GHB-dependent Belgian patients detoxified using a benzodiazepine taper (n = 42) [
         <a href="#rid74">
          74
         </a>
         ]. The Belgian patients experienced more severe withdrawal, a higher rate of delirium (21 versus 5 percent), more adverse events (21 versus 5 percent), and more transfers to critical care for treatment (2 versus 0 patients). A similar pharmaceutical GHB detoxification protocol has been developed in Denmark [

         Treatment of GHB withdrawal and detoxification from GHB dependence should be performed in an inpatient setting whenever possible, as the risks entailed by outpatient treatment are high, particularly in cases of acute unplanned detoxification. The clinical course of GHB withdrawal is variable and unpredictable, can entail prolonged delirium, and is potentially lethal. However, in some cases, outpatient treatment may be necessary. Some patients may be unable to pay for inpatient treatment, while others are unwilling to be inpatients. Supervised outpatient treatment is safer than unsupervised self-treatment, which has proven fatal in some instances.
        </p>
        <p>
         Several studies suggest that closely monitored detoxification for planned GHB withdrawal in ambulatory settings can be safe and successful when delivered by a specialist team with ready access to acute medical treatment if needed, particularly for patients who ingest lower cumulative daily doses and are not at risk for severe withdrawal.

         The Maudsley Guidelines and the Camden and Islington National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust in England describe a carefully monitored outpatient detoxification protocol for patients at very low risk for severe withdrawal and in settings where rapid transfer for acute hospital treatment is available [

The patient is continuously monitored at home by a non-drug using adult, who supervises administration of diazepam and baclofen.

When symptoms have resolved and diazepam has been tapered completely, the patient may continue with baclofen for up to four to six weeks.

         Psychoactive substances are known to change brain function and structure, causing cognitive and behavioral deficits that may persist after detoxification and affect treatment outcomes, including relapse. Cognitive problems experienced by chronic GHB users following detoxification and impairment of learning and memory in animals following GHB administration have been reported [
         <a href="#rid95">
          95
         </a>
         ]. A Dutch study of 103 patients with GHB dependence found cognitive impairment in 56 percent of patients pre-detoxification and in 31 percent post-detoxification. Memory effects were most prominent and were predictive of relapse [
         <a href="#rid96">
          96
         </a>
         ]. These associations suggest potential neurotoxicity, either through direct effects or from hypoxia-induced brain injury due to multiple overdoses resulting in coma.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many patients with GHB dependence report frequent, even daily, episodes of coma related to use [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,37
         </a>
         ], and Dutch studies document high rates of admission to emergency departments for such comas [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Dutch research involving functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), verbal and spatial memory testing, and questionnaires assessing negative affect (depression, anxiety, stress) has been conducted comparing GHB users reporting four or more GHB-related comas with GHB users without comas and polydrug users with no GHB use. Findings of some studies suggest that multiple GHB comas are associated with impaired memory and affect, and with alterations of brain structures involved in memory and affect [
         <a href="#rid97">
          97,98
         </a>
         ], with microstructural alterations in white matter, and higher self-reported impulsivity [
         <a href="#rid99">
          99
         </a>
         ]. However, another study reported that, while cognitive impairment, particularly of memory functions, was found pre- and post-detoxification, it was not associated with the severity of GHB use disorder, or the number of GHB-induced comas [
         <a href="#rid96">
          96
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Potential pre-existing cognitive impairment in GHB-dependent users and the effects of polydrug use complicate research on the long-term cognitive effects of chronic GHB use. Nevertheless, the high prevalence and severity of cognitive impairment in this relatively young cohort (average age 28 years) suggest that GHB use generally and the high number of GHB-induced comas among some users may have adverse long-term effects on cognition [

         As early as possible during inpatient treatment, clinicians should discuss ongoing, intensive outpatient management of chemical dependency with the patient and family members. Coordinated care following discharge may entail counselling (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy), lifestyle training, and interventions to assist with housing, debt management, and other needs that are important for preventing relapse [

         Multiple drug dependencies have been reported among GHB users, and clinicians treating patients with GHB withdrawal should be aware of this possibility. Co-dependencies may result from concurrent recreational use of GHB and other drugs, or from use of benzodiazepines, alcohol, or opiates for self-treatment of GHB withdrawal. Conversely, GHB may be used as an alcohol or drug substitute, or for self-treatment of alcohol or drug dependence/withdrawal.

         Regional poison control centers in the United States are available at all times for consultation on patients with known or suspected poisoning, and who may be critically ill, require admission, or have clinical pictures that are unclear (1-800-222-1222). In addition, some hospitals have medical toxicologists available for bedside consultation. Whenever available, these are invaluable resources to help in the diagnosis and management of ingestions or overdoses. Contact information for poison centers around the world is provided separately.

          Epidemiology
         </strong>
         – Illicit use of gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) occurs for recreation and for a number of alleged health benefits, including bodybuilding and treatment of insomnia, generalized and social anxiety, and alcohol dependence. GHB use can lead to severe dependence. Cessation can lead to withdrawal, which may be lethal. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Epidemiology'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Clinical features
         </strong>
         – Onset of GHB withdrawal symptoms occurs rapidly, typically within one to six hours of cessation or decrease. Initial symptoms include anxiety, tremor, agitation, diaphoresis, tachycardia, vomiting, and insomnia. Insomnia can be profound. Within 24 hours, symptoms may progress to severe withdrawal, with refractory agitation, hallucinations, delusions, and delirium. Delirium may develop rapidly and persist as long as 14 days. Symptom course often progresses unpredictably. Autonomic instability, if present, is usually mild to moderate. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical features of withdrawal'

         Severe and refractory agitation increases the risk of hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. (See

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of GHB withdrawal is made clinically based on the presence of typical symptoms in an individual with a known history of prolonged or habitual GHB use. Without such a history, the clinician must evaluate the patient for other, more common causes of delirium with hyperactive behavior, for which the differential diagnosis is broad. (See

          Laboratory studies
         </strong>
         – No laboratory tests are necessary to diagnosis GHB withdrawal. Tests are obtained on the basis of the history and examination to investigate alternative diagnoses or complications. In patients experiencing GHB withdrawal, we generally obtain the following studies: basic electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, creatine kinase, and a complete blood count. Co-ingestants are common among individuals who use GHB, so it is reasonable to perform the basic studies for poisoned patients, including fingerstick glucose,

          Management
         </strong>
         – Management of GHB withdrawal is primarily supportive, with administration of sedatives to control agitation, delirium, hyperthermia, and seizures, and careful monitoring for respiratory depression and potential complications. We suggest clinicians use long-acting benzodiazepines for the control of symptoms due to GHB withdrawal (

         Patients with extreme agitation may require more frequent and larger doses. Very large doses may be administered, provided respiratory status is closely monitored and tracheal intubation can be performed immediately if necessary. Alternative and adjunctive treatments include barbiturates,

         – The clinical course of withdrawal is unpredictable, even with optimal treatment. For this reason, we recommend that patients with mild withdrawal be treated in an inpatient setting or in a closely monitored outpatient setting using a GHB detoxification protocol and with ready access to acute medical care. Patients with severe withdrawal require admission to an intensive care unit. Closely monitored detoxification for planned GHB withdrawal in ambulatory settings may be safe for patients who ingest lower cumulative daily doses and are not at risk for severe withdrawal. (See
