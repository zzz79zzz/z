         Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) refer to the sudden cessation of cardiac mechanical activity with hemodynamic collapse, often due to sustained ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. These events mostly occur in patients with evidence for ischemia due to coronary artery disease, disease of the myocardium (due to hypertrophy, fibrosis, scar replacement, or other myocardial abnormality that may or may not have been previously diagnosed), valvular abnormalities, or congenital heart disease or congenital or genetic electrical abnormalities or channelopathies. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/974.html" rel="external">
          "Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The event is referred to as SCA (or aborted SCD) if an intervention (eg, defibrillation) or spontaneous reversion of the heart rhythm restores circulation. The event is called SCD if the patient dies. However, the use of SCD to describe both fatal and nonfatal cardiac arrest persists by convention. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/963.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death", section on 'Definitions'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The prognosis of patients who have SCA will be reviewed here. The issues related to acute therapy for SCA, including guidelines for advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS), and issues related to prevention of recurrent sudden cardiac death, are discussed separately. (See

         Despite advances in the treatment of heart disease, the outcome of patients experiencing SCA remains poor [

         A report analyzed outcomes for over 12,000 patients treated by emergency medical services (EMS) personnel in Seattle over 24 years [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Survival to hospital discharge for those treated between 1998 and 2001 was not significantly better than for those treated between 1977 and 1981 (15.7 versus 17.5 percent). In contrast, the long-term outcome among patients who survive until hospital discharge following SCA appears to be improving [
         <a href="#rid2">

         Among a nationwide cohort of 547,153 patients in Japan with out-of-hospital SCA between 2005 and 2009, survival to hospital discharge with favorable neurologic status improved approximately twofold in several groups over the five-year period (from 1.6 to 2.8 percent among all patients with out-of-hospital SCA, from 2.1 to 4.3 percent among bystander-witnessed SCA, and from 9.8 to 20.6 percent among bystander-witnessed SCA with ventricular fibrillation as the initial rhythm) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. However, in spite of this doubling of neurologically favorable survival, overall survival following SCA remains poor.

         Among 70,027 United States patients prospectively enrolled in the CARES registry following out-of-hospital SCA between 2005 and 2012, survival to hospital discharge improved significantly from 5.7 percent in 2005 to 8.3 percent in 2012 [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         In a Canadian study of 34,291 patients who arrived at the hospital alive following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest between 2002 and 2011, survival at both 30-day and one-year increased significantly between 2002 and 2011 (from 7.7 to 11.8 percent for one-year survival) [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, among a cohort of 6999 Australian patients with out-of-hospital SCA resuscitated by EMS between 2010 and 2012, 851 patients (12.2 percent) survived for at least one year, with more than half of patients reporting good neurologic recovery and functional status at one year [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The reasons for the continued poor survival of patients with SCA are not certain [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Although some aspects of acute resuscitation have improved over time (increased bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR] and shortened time to defibrillation), these positive trends have been off-set by adverse trends in clinical features of patients presenting with SCA (such as increasing age and decreasing proportion presenting with ventricular fibrillation) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,7
         </a>
         ]. In addition, the response times of both basic life support (BLS) and advanced life support (ALS) services have increased, possibly as a result of population growth and urbanization [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Marked regional differences in the incidence and outcome of SCA have been observed. In a prospective observational study of 10 North American regions, the adjusted incidence of EMS-treated out-of-hospital SCA ranged from 40.3 to 86.7 (median 52.1) per 100,000 census population; known survival to discharge ranged from 3.0 to 16.3 percent (median 8.4 percent) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. The adjusted incidence of ventricular fibrillation ranged from 9.3 to 19.0 (median 12.6) per 100,000 census population; known survival to discharge ranged from 7.7 to 39.9 (median 22) percent. These regional differences highlight the importance of local health care and EMS systems to SCA outcomes. A pilot study comparing the feasibility of EMS transport to a regional cardiac arrest center (with increased transit time) versus transport to the closest hospital suggested no difference in 30-day mortality or major adverse cardiac events, results which should be considered hypothesis-generating for larger scale studies [
         <a href="#rid10">

         Survivors of SCA have variable susceptibility to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, depending on the duration of circulatory arrest, extent of resuscitation efforts, and underlying comorbidities. The prognosis following hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is discussed in detail separately. (See

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         When the initial observed rhythm is asystole (even if preceded by ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation), the likelihood of successful resuscitation is low. The longer ventricular fibrillation is present, the finer are the fibrillatory waves, and ultimately asystole occurs. The duration of ventricular fibrillation impacts the success of defibrillation (see below). Only 10 percent of patients with out-of-hospital arrests and initial asystole survive until hospital admission [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ] and less than 5 percent survive until hospital discharge with good neurologic function [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12-14
         </a>
         ]. The poor outcome in patients with asystole or bradycardia due to a very slow idioventricular rhythm probably reflects the prolonged duration of the cardiac arrest (usually more than four minutes) and the presence of severe, irreversible myocardial, brain and other end-organ damage. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4833.html" rel="external">
          "Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in adults: Evaluation and prognosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Factors associated with successful resuscitation of patients presenting with asystole include spontaneous conversion to a shockable rhythm, witnessed arrest, younger patient age, shorter time to arrival of emergency medical services (EMS) personnel, and no further need for treatment with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8983" href="/z/d/drug information/8983.html" rel="external">

         for a bradyarrhythmia after initial resuscitation [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,15,16
         </a>
         ]. In a systematic review of 1,108,281 patients (from 12 studies) with SCA and initial nonshockable rhythms, approximately 4.6 percent of patients had spontaneous conversion to a shockable rhythm, which was associated with a greater chance of return of spontaneous circulation (odds ratio 1.47, 95% CI 1.40-1.55) as well as greater odds of survival and favorable neurologic status at 30 days [

         Patients who have SCA due to pulseless electrical activity (also called electrical-mechanical dissociation) also have a poor outcome due to absence of cardiac output and organ perfusion. In one study of 150 such patients, 23 percent were resuscitated and survived to hospital admission; only 11 percent survived until hospital discharge [

          —
         </span>
         The outcome is much better when the initial rhythm is a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia, especially ventricular tachycardia as there is some cardiac output and organ perfusion. The most frequent etiology is ventricular fibrillation (VF). Approximately 25 to 40 percent of patients with SCA caused by VF survive until hospital discharge [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,18,19
         </a>
         ]. Survival is dependent upon the duration of VF and time to defibrillation. In the Seattle series cited above of over 12,000 EMS-treated patients with SCA, 38 percent had witnessed VF [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Patients with witnessed VF (in whom time to defibrillation is shorter) had a significantly greater likelihood of surviving to hospital discharge than those with other rhythms (34 versus 6 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         Acute myocardial infarction (MI) or myocardial ischemia is the underlying cause of VF for many of the patients who survive to hospital discharge. In a series of 79 such patients from the Mayo Clinic, 47 percent had an acute MI, while in a series of 47 such patients from the Netherlands, 51 percent had an acute MI [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Survival is approximately 65 to 70 percent in patients who present with hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT) [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. The prognosis may be better in patients found in monomorphic VT because of the potential for some systemic perfusion during this more organized arrhythmia. In addition, patients with VT tend to have a lower incidence of a previous infarction and may have a higher ejection fraction when compared with those with VF [

         The investigators suggested that public health interventions that go beyond CPR training in Black and Hispanic communities, including use of linguistically and culturally appropriate CPR training, funding for dispatcher-assisted CPR in majority Black and Hispanic neighborhoods, and engagement of community leaders, may be indicated to reduce racial and ethnic differences in bystander CPR.

         </span>
         Ventricular fibrillation (VF) in the human heart rarely, if ever terminates spontaneously or reverts with an antiarrhythmic drug, and survival is therefore dependent upon the prompt delivery of effective CPR. Electrical defibrillation is the
         <strong>
          only
         </strong>
         way to reestablish organized electrical activity and myocardial contraction. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/983.html" rel="external">
          "Cardioversion for specific arrhythmias"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Increasing duration of VF has two major adverse effects: it reduces the ability to terminate the arrhythmia and, as with prolonged VF, the fibrillatory waves become finer and ultimately become absent, reflecting less electrical activity and thus less responsiveness to defibrillation, and, if VF continues for more than four minutes, there is the beginning of irreversible damage to the central nervous system and other organs [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41-43
         </a>
         ]. As a result, the longer the duration of the cardiac arrest, the lower the likelihood of resuscitation or survival with or without neurologic impairment even if CPR is successful. It has been suggested that without CPR, survival from a cardiac arrest caused by VF declines by approximately 10 percent for each minute without defibrillation, and after more than 12 minutes without CPR, the survival rate is only 2 to 5 percent [
         <a href="#rid44">

         These observations constitute the rationale for attempts to provide more rapid resuscitation in patients with out-of-hospital SCA, especially more prompt defibrillation. One approach is optimizing the EMS system within a community to reduce the response interval to less than eight minutes [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, in some areas, the response times of both BLS and ALS services have actually increased, possibly as a result of population growth and urbanization. In the Seattle series of over 12,000 EMS-treated patients, the BLS response interval increased from 3.8 to 5.1 minutes between 1977 and 2001, and the ALS response interval increased from 8.4 to 9.0 minutes [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, bystander CPR and even defibrillation (using an automatic external defibrillator or AED) have been recommended and have been implemented in some settings. Such interventions permit more rapid responses than those provided by ALS or BLS personnel, with better survival as a result. In the Seattle series, the OR for survival to discharge for patients who received bystander CPR to those who did not was 1.85 [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>

         The administration of CPR by a layperson bystander (bystander CPR or bystander-initiated CPR) and prompt defibrillation with an AED are important factors in determining patient outcome after out-of-hospital SCA. Survival after SCA is greater among those who have bystander CPR when compared with those who initially receive more delayed CPR from EMS personnel [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. In addition to improved survival, early restoration or improvement in circulation is associated with better neurologic function among survivors [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49-51
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         For adults with sudden out-of-hospital SCA, compression-only bystander CPR (without rescue breathing) appears to have equal or possibly greater efficacy compared with standard bystander CPR (compressions plus rescue breathing). With prompt chest compression, there is some cardiac output and systemic blood flow to organs. The 2010 American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines for CPR, along with subsequent professional society guidelines, recommended that
         <em>
          bystanders
         </em>
         perform compression-only CPR to provide high-quality chest compressions prior to the arrival of emergency personnel [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52-56
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Chest compression-only CPR'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The importance of bystander CPR and support for compression-only bystander CPR comes from a combination of retrospective and prospective studies. An initial report from the Seattle Heart Watch program in the late 1970s evaluated 109 consecutive patients resuscitated at the scene by a bystander trained in CPR and compared their outcomes with those of 207 patients who initially received CPR from EMS personnel [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ]. There was no difference between the two groups in the percentage of patients resuscitated at the scene and admitted alive to the hospital (67 versus 61 percent), but the percentage discharged alive was significantly higher among those with bystander CPR (43 versus 22 percent). The most important reason for the improvement in survival in this study was that earlier CPR and prompt defibrillation were associated with less damage to the central nervous system and other organs, including the heart. More patients with bystander CPR were conscious at the time of hospital admission (50 versus 9 percent), and more regained consciousness by the end of hospitalization (81 versus 52 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         These observations were subsequently confirmed in larger studies [

         <a href="#rid50">

         <a href="#rid48">
          48

         ]. While the number of patients receiving standard CPR improved by 3 percent over the same time period (from 35.4 to 38.1 percent), administration of compression-only CPR increased from 5.4 to 30.1 percent. Both standard CPR and compression only CPR administered by bystanders were associated with more than twofold increased likelihood of survival compared with no CPR prior to EMS arrival.

         Despite the benefits of bystander CPR, it is not always performed. Reasons for this include the bystander's lack of CPR training and concerns about possible transmission of disease while performing rescue breathing [

          65

In an analysis of 14,225 patients with cardiac arrest in 29 United States sites participating in Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES), bystander CPR was significantly more likely to be performed in higher-income (above 40,000 USD per year) than in lower-income (less than 40,000 USD per year) neighborhoods [

         Several automated devices that deliver chest compressions have been developed in an attempt to improve upon chest compressions delivered by humans as well as to allow rescuers to perform other interventions simultaneously. While a 2013 meta-analysis of 12 studies (only 3 of which were randomized clinical trials) suggested higher rates of the ROSC when an automated device was used, subsequent randomized trials showed no significant differences in survival between the mechanical CPR and manual CPR groups.

         The standard of care for resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation has been defibrillation as soon as possible. In the Seattle series of over 12,000 EMS-treated patients, 4546 had witnessed VF. For these patients, the defibrillation response interval was significantly correlated with survival to hospital discharge (OR 0.88 for every one-minute increase in response time) [

          1

          80,81

         <a href="#rid80">
          80

        <p>
         However, in the largest study to date comparing shorter versus longer periods of initial CPR prior to defibrillation in 9933 patients with SCA, patients were randomly assigned to receive 30 to 60 seconds versus 180 seconds of CPR prior to cardiac rhythm analysis and defibrillation (if indicated) [

         The use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) by early responders is another approach to more rapid resuscitation. In most but not all studies, AEDs have been found to improve survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The development, use, allocation, and efficacy of AEDs are discussed elsewhere. (See

Among the observed public arrests, 60 percent had an initially shockable rhythm, and 19 percent were shocked with an AED. Patients shocked by bystanders using the AED were significantly more likely to survive to hospital discharge (67 versus 43 percent) and to have favorable neurologic function (defined as modified Rankin score ≤2) at discharge (57 versus 33 percent) [

         The OPALS study group has proposed two termination of resuscitation rules for use by EMS personnel. The rule for BLS providers equipped with AEDs includes the following three criteria: event not witnessed by emergency medical services personnel; no AED used or manual shock applied in out-of-hospital setting; and no ROSC in out-of-hospital setting [
         <a href="#rid84">
          84
         </a>
         ]. The advanced life support (ALS) rule includes the BLS criteria as well as two additional criteria: arrest not witnessed by bystander and no bystander-administered CPR [
         <a href="#rid85">
          85
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Validation of the predictive value of the BLS and ALS termination rules was performed with data from a retrospective cohort study that included 5505 adults with out-of-hospital SCA [
         <a href="#rid86">
          86
         </a>
         ]. The overall rate of survival to hospital discharge was 7 percent. Of 2592 patients (47 percent) who met BLS criteria for termination of resuscitation efforts, only 5 survived to hospital discharge. Of 1192 patients (22 percent) who met ALS criteria, none survived to hospital discharge.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the validity of these termination rules may be reduced with improvements in EMS and postresuscitation care. One potential target for understanding and ameliorating current limitations to postarrest care is the observed marked regional variation in prognosis following SCA. (See

         The adequacy of CPR delivered to a victim of cardiac arrest and outcomes related to resuscitation efforts may depend on a variety of factors (eg, rate and depth of chest compressions, amount of time without performing chest compressions while performing other tasks such as defibrillation, etc). The American Heart Association (AHA) 2010 Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Emergency Cardiovascular Care emphasized early defibrillation (when available) and high-quality chest compressions (rate at least 100 per minute, depth of two inches or more) with minimal interruptions [

         End-tidal carbon dioxide levels have an excellent correlation with very low cardiac outputs when measured after at least 10 minutes of CPR and may provide prognostic information, suggesting that the cardiac output maintained during CPR is a determinant of outcome.

         An increase in body temperature is associated with unfavorable functional neurologic recovery after successful CPR. The increase in temperature may be neurally-mediated and can exacerbate the degree of neural injury associated with brain ischemia. For the highest temperature within 48 hours, each degree Celsius higher than 37°C increases the risk of an unfavorable neurologic recovery (OR of 2.26 in one report) [

         <a href="#rid101">
          101
         </a>
         ]. There was a statistically significant reduction in the probability of survival to hospital discharge with increasing numbers of chronic conditions, such as congestive heart failure, prior MI, hypertension, and diabetes (OR 0.84 for each additional chronic condition). The impact of comorbidities was more prominent with longer EMS response intervals.

         Delays in providing initial defibrillation have been associated with worse outcomes. This was illustrated in a report of 6789 patients with in-hospital SCA due to VT or VF from 369 hospitals participating in the National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation [
         <a href="#rid112">
          112
         </a>
         ]. Delayed defibrillation (more than two minutes after SCA) occurred in 30 percent of patients and was associated with a significantly lower probability of surviving to hospital discharge (22.2 versus 39.3 percent). Delayed defibrillation was more common with noncardiac admitting diagnosis, cardiac arrest at a hospital with fewer than 250 beds, an unmonitored hospital unit, and arrest during after-hours periods.
        </p>
        <p>
         A national early warning score (NEWS) was developed in the United Kingdom in 2012 and updated in 2017 in an effort to standardize early detection of patients at risk for in-hospital SCA [
         <a href="#rid113">
          113
         </a>
         ]. The score incorporates seven vital signs (respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, supplemental oxygen, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, temperature, and level of consciousness), with a maximal score of 20 points (0 to 4, 5 to 6, and 7 or more considered low, medium, and high scores, respectively). In a single-center study of all in-hospital SCA in 2014 and 2015, patients had markedly high risk of dying from SCA if they had a medium (odds ratio [OR] 4.4, 95% CI 1.8-10.8) or high (OR 9.9, 95% CI 2.8-35.3) NEWS score compared with patients with a low NEWS score [
         <a href="#rid114">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Multiple resuscitations involving CPR have also been associated with worse outcomes. Among 166,519 hospitalized patients (from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, an all-payer United States hospital database) who underwent CPR while hospitalized between 2000 and 2009, 3.4 percent survived the initial CPR and ultimately had multiple rounds of CPR during their hospitalization [
         <a href="#rid110">
          110
         </a>
         ]. Patients who had multiple rounds of CPR had a significantly lower likelihood of survival to discharge (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.37-0.44), and those who survived multiple rounds of CPR had high hospitalization costs and were more likely to be discharged to hospice care.
        </p>
        <p>
         Survival following in-hospital SCA treated with an automated external defibrillator (AED) has also been evaluated using data derived from the National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation [
         <a href="#rid115">
          115
         </a>
         ]. When compared with usual resuscitative care, the use of an AED did not improve survival among patients with a shockable rhythm and was associated with a lower survival to hospital discharge among patients with a nonshockable rhythm. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1042.html" rel="external">
          "Automated external defibrillators", section on 'In-hospital AED allocation'

         In 2013 the American Heart Association issued consensus recommendations regarding strategies for improving outcomes following in-hospital SCA [
         <a href="#rid116">
          116
         </a>
         ]. While the consensus recommendations focused on many of the same factors as out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (ie, early identification of SCA, provision of high-quality CPR, early defibrillation [when indicated]), the authors commented on a lack of evidence specifically focused on in-hospital SCA, with many of the current guideline recommendations based on extrapolations of data from out-of-hospital SCA. Further data specifically focusing on in-hospital SCA are required prior to making any additional recommendations.

         The ability to predict neurologically favorable survival following in-hospital SCA has not been well-defined, with most estimates based on clinical judgment of the treating clinician(s). However, it seems most likely that no single factor can effectively predict outcomes but rather a combination of factors.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In general, younger patients with normal baseline neurologic function and fewer medical comorbidities had a greater likelihood of survival following in-hospital SCA [
         <a href="#rid118">
          118
         </a>
         ]. A subsequent prospective registry study of 62,131 patients with in-hospital SCA between 2010 and 2016 validated the ability of the GO-FAR score to predict the chance of survival; survival rates were slightly higher, likely related to ongoing improvements in postresuscitation care [
         <a href="#rid119">
          119

         Oxygenation goals should be individualized and hyperoxia should be avoided. Arterial hyperoxia early after SCA may have deleterious effects, perhaps due to oxidative injury. The 2008 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation cited preclinical evidence of harm from hyperoxia and suggested a goal arterial oxygenation of 94 to 96 percent post SCA [
         <a href="#rid120">
          120
         </a>
         ]. A more detailed discussion of oxygenation with mechanical ventilation is presented separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1640.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of initiating invasive mechanical ventilation in adults in the intensive care unit", section on 'Fraction of inspired oxygen'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         A study to examine this issue was performed using a multicenter database including 6326 patients with arterial blood gas analysis within 24 hours after ICU arrival following cardiac arrest [
         <a href="#rid121">
          121
         </a>
         ]. The study included patients with in-hospital and out-of-hospital SCA (57 percent were hospital inpatients and 43 percent were from the emergency department). Oxygenation status was categorized according to the first ICU arterial blood gas value, with hyperoxia defined as PaO2 ≥300 mmHg, hypoxia as PaO2 &lt;60 mmHg, and the remaining as normoxia. The majority of patients had hypoxia (63 percent) with similar numbers having hyperoxia (18 percent) and normoxia (19 percent). The hyperoxia group had higher in-hospital mortality compared with the normoxia and the hypoxia groups (63 percent versus 45 percent and 57 percent). In a multivariable model, hyperoxia was an independent risk factor for death (odds ratio [OR] 1.8, 95% CI 1.5-2.2). Hypoxia was also an independent risk factor (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5). Further data are needed to determine the impact of oxygen titration during and after resuscitation. In a subsequent, smaller, prospective cohort study of 280 patients with cardiac arrest, among whom 105 patients (38 percent) were exposed to hyperoxia (defined as PaO2 &gt;300 mmHg) during the first six hours of care after return of spontaneous circulation, death or poor neurologic function at discharge (defined as modified Rankin score &gt;3) was significantly more likely in patients exposed to hyperoxia (77 versus 65 percent) [

Among these 79 patients, 43 underwent coronary revascularization and 35 received an ICD, 13 of whom had subsequent shocks for VT or VF. The expected five-year survival of the study population (79 percent) was the same as that of age-, sex-, and disease-matched controls who did not have out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, but significantly lower than age- and sex-matched controls in the general population.

          Prognosis following cardiac arrest
         </strong>
         – Despite advances in the treatment of heart disease, the outcome of patients experiencing sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) remains poor. The reasons for the continued poor outcomes are likely multifactorial (eg, delayed bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR], delayed defibrillation, advanced age, decreased proportion presenting with ventricular fibrillation [VF]). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prognosis following sudden cardiac arrest'

         <strong>
          Outcome
         </strong>
         – When SCA is due to a ventricular tachyarrhythmia, the outcome of resuscitation is better compared with those with asystole or pulseless electrical activity. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Outcome according to etiology'

          Factors affecting outcome
         </strong>
         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Among the many factors that appear to have an influence on the outcome of SCA, the elapsed time prior to effective resuscitation (ie, establishment of an effective pulse) appears to be the most critical element. There are several ways to decrease the time to the onset of resuscitative efforts:

         Rapid emergency medical services (EMS) response – Optimizing the EMS system within a community to reduce the response interval to eight minutes or less has been proposed as a way to improve the outcomes of SCA. However, due to a variety of factors, EMS response time of eight minutes or less cannot always be achieved. (See
         <a class="local">

         </span>
         Bystander CPR – The administration of CPR by a layperson bystander (bystander CPR) is an important factor in determining patient outcome after out-of-hospital SCA, as early restoration or improvement in circulation has been shown to result in greater survival and better neurologic function among survivors. Bystander CPR, however, is not always performed, primarily due to the bystander’s lack of CPR training and/or concerns about possible transmission of disease while performing rescue breathing. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Bystander CPR'

         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         Early defibrillation – The standard of care for resuscitation of SCA has been defibrillation as soon as possible when indicated. Shorter defibrillation response intervals correlate with greater survival to hospital discharge. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Timing of defibrillation'

         </span>
         Automated external defibrillators – The use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) by early responders is another approach to more rapid resuscitation. In most, but not all studies, AEDs have been found to improve survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1042.html" rel="external">

          Cardiopulmonary resuscitation
         </strong>
         – Several observational studies evaluating compression-only CPR versus standard CPR including rescue breathing reported no significant differences in survival or long-term neurologic function between the two groups, suggesting that compression-only CPR could be safely delivered (as long as the arrest is not a respiratory arrest). Three randomized trials of compression-only CPR versus standard CPR have all shown a trend toward improved outcomes in the compression-only CPR group, and a 2010 meta-analysis of the three randomized trials reported an increased survival to hospital discharge among patients who received compression-only CPR. As such, if a sole bystander is present or multiple bystanders are reluctant to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation, we encourage the performance of CPR using chest compressions only. (See

          Temperature management
         </strong>
         – The induction of mild to moderate hypothermia (target temperature 32 to 34°C for 24 hours) may be beneficial in patients successfully resuscitated after a cardiac arrest. Improved neurologic outcome and reduced mortality has been demonstrated in series of patients with VF arrest in whom spontaneous circulation was restored, even when the patient remains comatose after resuscitation.
