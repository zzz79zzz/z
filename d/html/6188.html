This topic will review the clinical aspects of Krabbe disease. Other lysosomal diseases are discussed separately.

Galactocerebrosidase is responsible for the liposomal hydrolysis of galactolipids formed during white matter myelination. The pathologic changes in the peripheral and central nervous system (globoid cell formation and decreased myelin) are hypothesized to result from the toxic nature of accumulated psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), which cannot be degraded because of the galactocerebrosidase deficiency [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Psychosine accumulation is thought to be toxic to oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Many aspects of the pathophysiology of Krabbe disease are unknown.</p><p>The main neuropathologic findings in the central nervous system include demyelination with preservation of myelin within the subcortical U-fibers and the presence of gliosis and multinucleated globoid cells within the white matter. The positive staining of globoid cells for CD68, ferritin, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) suggests a monocytic origin for globoid cells in Krabbe disease. Ultrastructural studies reveal the accumulation of tubular crystalloid inclusions in globoid cells [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Globoid cells are no longer present in end-stage Krabbe disease due to lack of active demyelination in long-term survivors [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">GENETICS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The galactosylceramidase (<em>GALC</em>) gene, also known as the galactocerebrosidase gene, is located on chromosome 14q31 [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. More than 200 <em>GALC</em> pathogenic variants, including numerous small deletions and insertions, have been identified in patients with all clinical types of Krabbe disease [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Some pathogenic variants result in the infantile type if found to be homozygous or with another severe pathogenic variant, and a few pathogenic variants can predict a less severe phenotype. However, genotype-phenotype correlations are not well established for Krabbe disease, with the exception of patients who are homozygotes for the most common deletion (large 30 kilobase deletion), or those who have other truncation, frameshift, or nonsense variants [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 30 kb deletion [<a href="#rid1">1,9</a>] accounts for approximately 40 to 45 percent of the pathogenic alleles in infantile patients in northern Europe and is present in approximately 35 percent of the pathogenic alleles in infantile Mexican patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Approximately one-half of patients with the juvenile or adult phenotype are heterozygous for the large 30 kilobase gene deletion [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Other pathogenic variants in these patients may occur in a low-activity <em>GALC</em> allele [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. As an example, a few reported patients with at least one copy of the <em>809G</em>&gt;A pathogenic variant have had a juvenile or adult phenotype, regardless of the pathogenic variant in the second allele [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. A subsequent analysis of Krabbe genotypes found many variants of unknown significance and confirmed that predicting the timing of symptom onset, if any, is extremely difficult in most potentially at risk people [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 2019 report from a nationwide cohort of patients with Krabbe disease in Denmark, consisting of genotype and phenotype information for 29 patients, included 10 new pathogenic variants [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The four new missense variants (c.1142C&gt;T, p.T381I; c.596G&gt;T, p.R199M; c.443G&gt;A, p.G148E; c.1858G&gt;A, p.G620R) and the splice-site variant (c.442+1G&gt;A) were predicted pathogenic in silico and found in patients with the early infantile phenotype, with the exception of the p.G620R in homozygous form, which presented with the late infantile phenotype. The nonsense variants (p.S405*, p.W288*), the insertion (c.293insT), and the two deletions (c.1003_1004del and c.887delA) were predicted as loss-of-function variants and were found in patients manifesting the early infantile phenotype. Two missense variants (p.T529M and p.Y567S) typically found in patients with severe phenotypes were seen in patients with both severe and milder phenotypes.</p><p></p><p>Obstacles to correlating genotypes with specific phenotypes include the rarity of many pathogenic variants and the need for very long follow-up of patients. As an example, in the experience of the New York State Krabbe Consortium, none of the infants who were homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for p.T96A or p.Y303C, two variants previously associated with later-onset symptoms, have developed any Krabbe symptoms [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. There are no available data that can predict the risk that these individuals have for developing symptoms beyond their first decade of life.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3141055162"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Infantile Krabbe disease is rare. The incidence of Krabbe disease was originally estimated to be 1:100,000 [<a href="#rid1">1,7</a>]. Later, evidence from the New York State Krabbe Consortium, based upon screening of around two million infants, indicated an incidence of 1:400,000 [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. An analysis of mortality records suggested the incidence in the United States was 1:250,000 [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. However, as many as 1:6000 individuals may have decreased enzyme activity and genotypes of unclear significance [<a href="#rid2">2,8</a>]. The incidence for Krabbe disease is presumably that of the invariably fatal early infantile variant, which is most likely to be listed as a cause of death. The incidence of late-onset cases, which may have prolonged survival with more indolent symptoms, is unknown since milder phenotypes are likely underdiagnosed.</p><p>A high incidence (approximately 1:100 to 1:150) of Krabbe disease has been reported in separate inbred regions of Israel, including a Druze community in northern Israel and two Muslim Arab villages near Jerusalem [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND COURSE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients with Krabbe disease present with symptoms within the first twelve months of life; approximately 10 percent present later in life, including adulthood. A peripheral motor-sensory neuropathy occurs in most patients and may be the initial presenting symptom in later-onset patients. The early-onset forms are dominated by symptoms related to central nervous system dysfunction.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Infantile onset</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Symptoms usually develop from ages 2 to 12 months with infantile-onset Krabbe disease [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. Manifestations include irritability, feeding difficulty, reflux, developmental delay, limb spasticity, axial hypotonia, optic atrophy, and decreased growth [<a href="#rid16">16,18-20</a>]. Deep tendon reflexes may be increased early when spasticity predominates but diminish and are lost as neuropathy worsens. Irritability is the most common initial symptom. The median age of onset is four months, though testing such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nerve conduction velocities, auditory brainstem responses (ABR), and visual evoked potentials (VEP) may show abnormalities prior to symptom onset [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. As patients grow, dysautonomia and orthopedic complications worsen, tonic extensor spasms occur upon stimulation with light, sound, or touch, and seizures may occur. The irritability, unprovoked crying, and tonic extensor spasms that may be triggered by simple interactions such as touch make this a particularly distressing condition for parents and caregivers to manage.</p><p>In a study of 88 children with symptom onset prior to six months of age, 77 percent did not have head control or the ability to sit independently after seven months of age [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Eighty percent of these patients developed quadriparesis by 12 months of age. Developmental testing showed that no child achieved an age equivalence higher than six months at any point. Receptive language skills were a relative strength, while gross motor skills were the most significant disability. These children regressed rapidly to a decerebrate condition, with most dying before reaching two years of age.</p><p>Infantile Krabbe disease can be broken into four stages of disease progression characterized by the presence of various clinical indicators [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>During stage 1, the child is asymptomatic to minimally symptomatic, potentially exhibiting intermittent thumb clasp, slow feeding, or reflux. Children begin to cry frequently without apparent cause.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In stage 2, neurologic symptoms become more apparent as feeding difficulties worsen and muscle tone changes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage 3 is characterized by moderate to severe neurologic progression with spastic extremities, clinical seizures, exaggerated startle, and visual tracking difficulties.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage 4 is the final and most advanced state of the disease, indicated by severe weakness and sensory impairment.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2890139918"><span class="h2">Late infantile onset</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In late infantile-onset Krabbe disease, patients present between 13 months and 36 months. Initial symptoms include abnormal gait, irritability, slurred speech, or vision difficulties. Clinical indicators include appendicular hypertonia, axial hypotonia, abnormal protective reflexes, abnormal deep tendon reflexes, constipation, and abnormal pupillary response. Visual difficulty, apneic episodes, seizures, and temperature instability are more likely as the disease progresses. The median age of death is six years [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p>Patients typically reach motor milestones such as sitting, crawling, and walking within the normal age range. As measured by developmental testing, receptive and expressive language skills are a relative strength while gross and fine motor skills are a relative weakness.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Juvenile onset</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with juvenile-onset Krabbe disease typically present with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), tremors, abnormal gait, or vision loss. Juvenile patients regress at an unpredictable rate, but all become severely incapacitated and die within ten years of diagnosis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Adult onset</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Adult-onset Krabbe disease may be manifested initially by mood and behavioral problems, loss of manual dexterity, burning paresthesias in the extremities, weakness, or peripheral motor sensory neuropathy with loss of distal sensation and muscle atrophy with scoliosis [<a href="#rid9">9,23</a>]. Some adolescents and adults have symptoms confined to weakness without intellectual deterioration, whereas others become bedridden and continue to deteriorate mentally and physically [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h1">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H566923406"><span class="h2">Approach to the diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of Krabbe disease should be considered in newborns or older children with suggestive symptoms, and in newborns with positive screening tests.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1792007988"><span class="h3">Symptomatic patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Symptomatic patients with some or all of the suggestive clinical features of Krabbe disease should be tested for GALC enzyme activity (often available as part of a white cell enzyme panel that will also cover many of the conditions in the differential diagnosis) and, if deficient, undergo molecular genetic testing for pathogenic variants in <em>GALC</em>.

The goal of newborn screening is to identify cases as quickly as possible and thereby allow for early treatment with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which is associated with improved outcomes when performed before the onset of symptoms or in minimally symptomatic patients (see <a class="local">'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation'</a> below). Newborn screening for Krabbe disease is being implemented in a number of states, while others have not yet implemented screening procedures. The methods, diagnostic accuracy, and ethical issues related to newborn screening for Krabbe disease are reviewed in the following sections.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>First- and second-tier testing</strong> – Most of the states mandating newborn screening for Krabbe disease use tandem mass spectrometry and one state uses fluorometry to directly assay galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity in dried blood spots for the detection of Krabbe disease [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>]. However, irrespective of the assay method used, the specificity of low GALC activity is insufficient to confirm the diagnosis of Krabbe disease [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Low GALC activity can be result from several causes, including the presence of pseudodeficiency alleles (ie, benign GALC variants), heterozygosity for one GALC pathogenic variant (unaffected carrier), and GALC variants that cause later-onset Krabbe disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">As GALC activity does not have enough specificity to indicate whether a child will develop Krabbe, it is important to introduce a second tier of screening to identify true cases of Krabbe disease [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Different states screening for Krabbe disease have different approaches to this second tier of screening.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>One strategy is to subsequently measure the level of psychosine in newborns with low GALC activity, given the evidence that markedly elevated psychosine in newborns is indicative of infantile Krabbe disease. Newborns with highly elevated psychosine should be evaluated immediately for treatment, while newborns with mildly elevated psychosine require close follow-up. (See <a class="local">'Psychosine concentration'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Another strategy is subsequent sequencing of <em>GALC</em>. However, not all screening laboratories have the capability to detect all pathogenic variants of <em>GALC</em> [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. This, in combination with the frequency of variants with unknown significance, suggests that <em>GALC</em> genotyping as the only second-tier test may not be as reliable as psychosine measurements for identifying cases of infantile Krabbe disease. (See <a class="local">'Molecular genetic testing'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Ideally, results of second tier testing should be available by the end of the first week of life to allow for subsequent referral for HSCT [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic accuracy </strong>– In an analysis of nearly five million newborns who were screened across six states from 2006 through October 2019, 1050 infants were picked up as a positive screen [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Of the positive screens, 24 infants were confirmed to have Krabbe disease and another 34 infants were identified as high risk in New York. Across states, the false positive rate ranged from zero percent (Tennessee, only one positive screen) to 0.052 percent (Ohio, 214 positive screens).

Two infants had elevated psychosine levels (10 and 35 nM) and were referred immediately for evaluation and treatment for infantile Krabbe disease; six infants had intermediate psychosine levels (2 to 5 nM) and are under observation as suspected candidates for late-onset Krabbe disease; and 178 infants had pseudodeficiency alleles associated with psychosine levels &lt;2.0 nM.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ethical issues</strong> – Newborn screening for Krabbe disease has been controversial [<a href="#rid30">30,31</a>]. Since studies suggest that early treatment improves outcomes (see <a class="local">'Management'</a> below), proponents emphasize the need to identify cases as quickly as possible to allow for early treatment. Any delays in initiating HSCT will lead to diminished outcomes. With the discovery that psychosine is a reliable biomarker for the infantile population [<a href="#rid32">32</a>], the biggest challenge is expeditious referral to experienced transplant centers and assuring that the transplant is done in a timely manner (within the first month of life). As new therapies are developed, it will become imperative to diagnose patients prior to the onset of symptoms.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, the utility of screening is limited because neither GALC enzyme activity nor knowledge of the genetic variant can always predict phenotype. In addition, prediction of disease onset after the first year is not as well understood. Thus, many children identified as at risk for later-onset Krabbe disease may remain asymptomatic, and referring them for HSCT, itself a high-risk procedure, could lead to harm [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Furthermore, while HSCT improves or stabilizes the brain disease, some children may still deteriorate from peripheral nerve disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The Krabbe Newborn Screening-Family Perspective Survey found that 165 of 170 (97 percent) survey respondents from families affected by Krabbe disease would support the implementation of Krabbe disease newborn screening in all states [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Semistructured interviews were conducted with parents from 11 families who received a false-positive Krabbe disease newborn screening result [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. They expressed that a lack of understanding of the newborn process and limited information provided by the primary care provider at initial contact contributed to the emotional distress and negative emotions related to the false-positive results. More detailed information provided by a genetic counselor provided some reassurance to the family while awaiting the results of diagnostic studies, suggesting an early role for genetic counseling for newborn screening positive results. The 2020 statement by the Commonwealth of Virginia Newborn Screening Advisory Committee, outlining the reasons for their decision to not include Krabbe disease in the Virginia newborn screening program, raised interesting equity and equality issues [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].

Therefore, older asymptomatic siblings of late-onset patients who are galactocerebrosidase deficient should be observed closely, but these patients may not become symptomatic until much later.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2926137227"><span class="h2">Information and support</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A number of organizations provide information and support for patients and families affected by Krabbe disease:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkrabbeconnect.org%2F&amp;token=uRIAksEva0SfkP1m4SZCMzc%2BnX1FKDfUPexFieLDQBLIYCN0kfcqe8Uum6Ks9grV&amp;TOPIC_ID=6188" target="_blank">KrabbeConnect</a></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.krabbes.org%2F&amp;token=OleF5PK2yDKlJi1MCxyCZAtoQonNibKYaUgG%2B9jQ1HevALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=6188" target="_blank">Partners for Krabbe Research</a></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Ftloaf.org%2Fkrabbe-disease&amp;token=0%2B95283LwnzVqA0zBdcm%2F4wmz%2BnTQMLOcQW8SW42JABtvKL3UnZd1PTBiLvHE9x4&amp;TOPIC_ID=6188" target="_blank">The Legacy of Angels Foundation / Krabbe disease</a></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fulf.org%2F&amp;token=nZABLyx2qPY7RPCONfdCZi25wRjhdfc8RpxYLEG51Hs%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=6188" target="_blank">United Leukodystrophy Foundation</a></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huntershope.org%2F&amp;token=u%2FUXY8mj4f2cUyB56IXs7mF5HtVhvcODKSTZjU80GXLzzZ5TBWGPqfsQ2n57prdw&amp;TOPIC_ID=6188" target="_blank">Hunter's Hope</a></p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20034632"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pathophysiology and genetics</strong> – Krabbe disease (globoid cell leukodystrophy) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by the deficiency of galactocerebrosidase (GALC; also known as galactosylceramidase). The pathologic changes in the peripheral and central nervous system (globoid cell formation and decreased myelin) are hypothesized to result from the toxic nature of accumulated psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), which cannot be degraded because of the GALC deficiency. (See <a class="local">'Pathophysiology'</a> above and <a class="local">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical manifestations</strong> – Most patients with Krabbe disease present with symptoms within the first twelve months of life; approximately 10 percent present later in life, including adulthood. A peripheral motor sensory neuropathy occurs in most patients, but the early-onset forms present with symptoms of brain disease that eventually progresses to peripheral nerve involvement. Infantile-onset disease is associated with irritability, developmental delay or regression, limb spasticity, axial hypotonia, and optic atrophy. Deep tendon reflexes may be increased early when spasticity predominates but diminish and are lost as neuropathy worsens. Seizures and tonic extensor spasms eventually appear. Typically, there is rapid regression to a hypotonic condition and death in most cases before two years of age. (See <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations and course'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation and diagnosis</strong> – The diagnosis of Krabbe disease in symptomatic patients is made by measurement of GALC activity in leukocytes isolated from whole blood or cultured skin fibroblasts. Typical values in patients with Krabbe disease are &lt;5 percent of normal. The diagnosis should be confirmed by molecular genetic testing. Although controversial, newborn screening for Krabbe disease has been implemented in a number of states. Psychosine levels are the only biomarker that can predict an infantile phenotype. (See <a class="local">'Approach to the diagnosis'</a> above and <a class="local">'Diagnostic tests'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – The only available therapy for patients with Krabbe disease is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which is beneficial for the infantile form if performed when infants are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. In lieu of HSCT, management involves monitoring, supportive care, and palliative care for those with progressive and more severe disease. (See <a class="local">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H277064638"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Maria Escolar, MD, MS, Robert P Cruse, DO, and Thomas J Langan, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li class="breakAll">Orsini JJ, Escolar ML, Wasserstein MP, Caggana M.
