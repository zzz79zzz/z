         Almost all pregnant persons desire a nurturing, supportive companion throughout labor to help them cope with the challenges of giving birth, including pain, fear, anxiety, fatigue, and uncertainty [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>
         ]. A doula (from the Greek word for a female caregiver) can fulfill these needs, and the continuous labor support that the doula provides can improve labor and birth outcomes [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Indeed, meta-analyses have concluded that continuous support during childbirth is an essential aspect of childbirth [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ] and has clinically meaningful benefits for pregnant people and infants with no known harm [

         This topic will focus on the role and impact of doulas during childbirth. Other aspects of labor and childbirth preparation are reviewed separately. (See

         A doula is an individual who has undergone childbirth training and provides physical, emotional, and informational support to pregnant persons and their families before, during, and after they give birth [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8-11
         </a>
         ]. Almost all doulas are female. Doulas are sometimes described by the activity for which they are providing support, such as birth doula, prenatal doula, breastfeeding doula, postpartum doula, and abortion doula.

         Doulas provide support for the nonmedical aspects of labor and childbirth. They complement the roles of the clinicians (physicians, midwives, and nurses) caring for the patient. They do not replace medical staff, perform clinical or medical tasks, provide medical advice, or intervene in clinical care. Doulas can totally focus on the specific supportive needs of their patient because they are not responsible for monitoring the maternal/fetal medical condition or for supporting multiple patients with competing needs [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16
         </a>
         ]. Unfortunately, doulas sometimes report poor acceptance and support from other maternity care providers [

         Although partners and other individuals (eg, family members, friends) may also be supportive during labor, doulas are professionally trained to provide support and often stay physically closer to the laboring patient, touch them more frequently, talk to them more often, and do not leave them [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25

         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. It has also been observed that, when a doula is attending the birth, partners offer more physical comfort measures, such as massage and hand holding [

         Continuous labor support can be effective when provided by individuals such as trained family members, trained friends [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ], or trained members of the hospital staff; however, benefits accrue most consistently when care is provided by an independent doula who has no other responsibilities while supporting the patient. In a randomized trial in 13 North American hospitals including nearly 7000 participants, continuous labor support provided by specially trained labor nurses did not result in clinically important medical benefits compared with usual care [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Duration of labor after randomization, neonatal outcomes, and rates of cesarean birth and use of regional anesthesia were similar for both groups.
        </p>
        <p>
         The absence of significant medical benefits from enhanced nurse support in this trial contributed to the borderline findings of the meta-analysis discussed above, which was dominated by this trial [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. It is possible that the specially trained nurses were not able to provide as effective emotional and physical support during labor as a doula because they also had to devote time to monitoring the status of other patients and were not present throughout labor and birth. The nurses changed with each shift and attended to their patient only 80 percent of the time, while a doula would remain with the patient continuously throughout labor until birth. In addition, it has been hypothesized that the nurses may have been more likely than doulas to support standard institutional patterns of pharmacologic pain relief adjuvants, confounding possible effects of these agents on the cesarean birth rate. Lastly, this trial included a high proportion of highly educated, White participants who gave birth in hospitals with high rates of routine medical interventions (eg, use of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9734" href="/z/d/drug information/9734.html" rel="external">
          oxytocin
         </a>
         , electronic fetal monitoring, and regional anesthesia), supporting the hypothesis that continuous labor support in this population is less likely to influence use of epidural analgesia. In an economically disadvantaged population, pregnant persons accompanied by doulas reduced epidural use by at least 70 percent compared with those without doulas (approximately 7 versus 23 to 55 percent without a doula) [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30,34
         </a>
         ], whereas in more economically advantaged populations, the use of epidural was the same with or without a doula or only slightly decreased (eg, 54 versus 66 percent) [

          Private doulas
         </strong>
         – Most doulas are self-employed. Pregnant persons who choose to hire a private doula meet with them before labor and discuss their general philosophy toward birth and any past experiences. Sample interview questions are listed in the table  (

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         A private doula can provide antepartum education and support, answer questions, and help develop a birth plan. When the client is in early labor, the doula may go to the client's home and then accompany the client to the hospital, or the doula may meet the laboring patient on the labor unit. Some private doulas offer postpartum services, such as visiting the new mother and newborn to provide information and answer questions, help with household chores, and give breastfeeding advice.

         Fees vary in different parts of the United States, depending on the services provided, and may range from USD $600 to $2500. A growing number of states have passed legislation for Medicaid to cover doula services [

          37,38

          Hospital doulas
         </strong>
         – Some hospitals have programs that offer a doula to pregnant patients when they are admitted to the labor unit. The doula will stay with them until they give birth. This type of doula is a volunteer or a hospital employee who is on call, familiar with the institution's routines, and has a preexisting rapport with the medical staff. The doula may provide services at no cost, for a nominal fee, or on a fee-for-service basis.

          Definition
         </strong>
         – A doula is an individual who has undergone childbirth training and provides physical, emotional, and informational support to pregnant persons and their family before, during, and after they give birth. Continuous one-on-one labor support is an essential component of doula care. (See
         <a class="local">
          'What is a doula?'

         <strong>
          Role of the doula
         </strong>
         – A doula provides comfort, emotional and physical support, information, and advocacy for laboring patients. The doula does not replace medical staff, perform clinical or medical tasks, or intervene in clinical care but can facilitate communication and help the patient gain a better understanding of the labor process, medical procedures, options for coping with pain and uncertainty, and possible complications of labor or birth. (See
         <a class="local">
          'What does a doula do?'

          Finding a doula and cost
         </strong>
         – Hospitals, prenatal care providers, and national organizations are resources for finding doulas in a community. Many doulas are self-employed. Fees vary in different parts of the United States, depending on the services provided, and may range from USD $600 to $2500. A growing number of states have passed legislation for Medicaid to cover doulas, and some private payers offer reimbursement. In addition, a growing number of community-based nonprofit organizations offer doula support at low or no cost. (See
