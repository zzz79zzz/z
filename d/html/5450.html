         A wide spectrum of benign, premalignant, and malignant lesions may occur on the vulva. The challenge to the clinician is to differentiate between normal variants, benign findings, and potentially serious diseases.

         This topic will discuss the diagnostic evaluation of women with vulvar lesions. The differential diagnosis of vulvar lesions is reviewed separately. (See

         Ideally, the history is obtained before the patient undresses for her initial physical examination. In addition to a standard medical history, answers to the following questions can help identify possible causes of the vulvar lesion and exclude others. The answers to these questions may suggest a systemic disease rather than a primary localized vulvar disorder. The answers may also increase the clinician's suspicion of dermatitis or infection as the etiology of the lesion.

         Several steps can be taken to improve patient comfort during physical examination of the genitalia, including having a female assistant in the examination room (to help with visualization of the vulva) and talking to the patient during the examination. It is useful to have a mirror available so the patient can aid in identifying the concerning lesion. This also allows you the opportunity to help the patient become more familiar and comfortable with her vulva. After the examination, patients should be allowed to dress before discussing the findings and management plan.

         The anus should be examined at the completion of the examination. The vagina, cervix, intertriginous regions, eye, mouth, and nares should be examined when the diagnosis is uncertain because vulvar lesions can be an atypical or typical manifestation of a more widespread disease, and recognition of other sites of involvement may help in diagnosis. For example, lichen planus can affect the vulva, vagina, and mouth. Aphthae can be seen on the mouth and genitalia (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15285.html" rel="external">
          "Oral lichen planus: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical manifestations'
         </a>
         ). In women with candida vulvovaginitis, fissures, erosions, and erythema may involve the interlabial sulcus and thigh (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95804" href="/z/d/graphic/95804.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Several types of speculums are available for vaginal examination. The two main types are the Pederson-type (narrow blade) and the Graves-type (wide blade) (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95809" href="/z/d/graphic/95809.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>
         ). A pediatric Pederson speculum may be required in patients with pain or scarred, foreshortened vaginas. Each type of speculum has options for view size: standard 30 mm width opening, 40 mm wide view opening, or 70 mm full view opening. Although larger sizes provide better visualization, they can also be more uncomfortable for patients. Alternatives for better visualization include use of an open-sided speculum; a Guttman style speculum, which functions without an upper blade; or a transparent plastic speculum for 360-degree visibility. Warming the speculum to body temperature and lubricating it with water or small amounts of lubricant enhance patient comfort.

         Regional lymph nodes should be palpated for lymphadenopathy, which could be indicative of infection or malignancy.

         <em>
          Candida

         wet mount preparation for viewing under the microscope, vaginal pH, and amine odor (whiff) test are rapid and inexpensive methods to evaluate vaginal discharge, which may be the source of vulvar irritation. Point of care tests for vaginal discharge are also available. A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation is used to detect fungal elements in vulvar skin scrapings (

         Vulvar ulcers may be present with certain sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). While genital herpes has traditionally been considered an ulcerative STD, it more often presents as an erosion. However, herpes infections are frequently associated with ulcers in immunocompromised women. Other ulcerative STDs include syphilis and chancroid (very rare in the United States). The clinical characteristics and diagnosis of these and other ulcerative infections of the vulva are reviewed separately. (See

         The diagnosis of atopic or contact vulvar dermatitis or psoriasis can usually be made clinically. It is based upon characteristic symptoms; a personal or family history of atopy; psoriasis; or a personal history of vulvar exposure to medications, perfumes, or other chemicals. It is important to review vulvar hygiene/cleansing routines with patients, as they can often cause irritation.

         In uncertain cases and in those not responding to treatment, patch testing and/or biopsy may be necessary to identify the allergen/irritant or an underlying dermatosis. (See

In addition, lichen sclerosus, lichen planus, condylomata acuminata, and condylomata lata can mimic HSIL of the vulva. Therefore, biopsy is generally required for diagnosis.

Because of the high prevalence of multicentric synchronous or metachronous intraepithelial lesions, comprehensive colposcopic evaluation of the perianal area is indicated in any patient with HSIL of the vulva.

         For example, we advise a biopsy for a woman who has been treated for candidiasis in an appropriate manner but continues to have itching, erythema, and skin changes. She may have contact dermatitis, lichen sclerosus, HSIL of the vulva, extramammary Paget disease, carcinoma, or one of numerous other conditions; thus, a biopsy is indicated for definitive diagnosis to direct further therapy. Once a vulvar biopsy is performed, it should be sent to a gynecologic pathologist with a special interest in vulvar pathology or a dermatopathologist.

         </span>
         Vulvar biopsies can usually be performed in the office. The indications and procedure should be discussed with the patient. Risks include bleeding, infection, scarring, and allergic reaction. It is important to know that biopsies do not always provide a diagnosis due to sampling and interpretation errors. Additionally, lesions may be nonspecific at times as is seen often with lichen planus.
        </p>
        <p>
         After proper positioning on the examination table, the selected site is prepped with a cleansing solution. One should avoid taking the biopsy from the clitoris, urethra, or anal opening, if another representative site can be biopsied, because of patient discomfort and risk of complications. However, these areas can be sampled if needed.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patient comfort, at times, a topical anesthetic (eg, 2.5%
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/z/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">

          prilocaine
         </a>
         in a cream base) to desensitize the skin may be used before the anesthesia is injected. Before prepping the vulva, the topical anesthetic should be applied sparingly for 15 to 20 minutes on modified mucous membranes and longer on keratinized skin (up to 60 minutes depending on the agent and depth of the skin) before biopsy to be maximally effective [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Effectiveness is enhanced when applied under occlusion [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. After application of a topical antiseptic, the site is infiltrated with 1 to 2% lidocaine with or without

          epinephrine

          Punch biopsy
         </strong>
         – A punch biopsy removes a small (2 to 6 mm) circular piece of skin and is used when all skin layers need to be examined (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95812" href="/z/d/graphic/95812.html" rel="external">
          picture 8
         </a>
         ). A punch biopsy is indicated when the pathologic process is dermal or in the subcutaneous fat. Use rotary and gentle downward pressure to cut through the skin surface and into the dermis. For lesions not suspicious for cancer, the depth to the halfway mark of the punch biopsy apparatus is generally adequate. At times, a depth up to the hub of the punch biopsy is required to get a full-depth biopsy for lesions suspicious for cancer. Do not crush the specimen with forceps. Lift the lesion outward and cut the base with curved iris scissors.

          Suture lift technique
         </strong>
         – In areas where tissue is fragile and likely to tear, a "suture, lift, and cut technique" is useful. A fine suture is placed to gently lift the skin and then iris or Metzenbaum scissors are used to cut the base of the tissue under the suture (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96611" href="/z/d/graphic/96611.html" rel="external">

          Pigmented lesions
         </strong>
         – Ideally, atypical-appearing pigmented lesions are completely excised to ensure accurate depth assessment. More than one punch biopsy may be necessary to adequately sample a large, heterogeneous lesion and repeat biopsies may be necessary if the clinical and pathologic impressions do not correlate. The biopsies are obtained from the thickest region of the lesion and from any ulcerated areas, at the edge of the ulceration [

          Blistering lesions
         </strong>
         – The suture, lift, and cut technique described above is ideal for obtaining biopsy samples from blistering lesions. It is important to obtain a bit of the normal skin at the margin of the blister rather than just the base of the blister. A separate biopsy of perilesional skin is needed for direct immunofluorescence for the diagnosis of the immunobullous diseases.

         <strong>
          Ulcerated lesions
         </strong>
         – An incisional biopsy is performed when the ulceration is large and only a portion of the lesion is sampled; the sample should include the edge of the ulcer. An excisional biopsy to remove the entire lesion is appropriate when the lesion is less than 1 cm in size.

        </p>
        <p>
         After the procedure, the patient is instructed to keep the site clean and dry, and other wound care instructions (eg, sitz bath), if needed, should be reviewed. Plain petrolatum can be applied daily until the site is healed; dressings are typically avoided.

          History

         – In addition to a standard medical history and review of systems, patients with vulvar lesions should be asked about the presence of non-vulvar lesions and their normal skin care and hygienic routines. This information may suggest a systemic disease rather than a primary vulvar disease or an exogenous rather than endogenous source. (See

          Physical examination

         – The vagina, anus, cervix, eye, mouth, nares, and intertriginous regions should be examined when the diagnosis is uncertain because vulvar lesions can be an atypical or typical manifestation of a more widespread disease, and recognition of other sites of involvement may help in diagnosis. Language used to describe vulvar lesions is presented in the table (

          Exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions
