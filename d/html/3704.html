         The incidence of
         <em>
          Pneumocystis jirovecii
         </em>
         (previously named
         <em>
          Pneumocystis carinii
         </em>
         ) pneumonia has dramatically declined due to effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) and, to a lesser extent, the use of prophylaxis. Despite this decrease, it remains one of the leading causes of opportunistic infections among persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and low CD4 cell counts, such as those who are unaware of their HIV diagnoses or are not receiving medical care.

         The general features of
         <em>
          Pneumocystis

         pulmonary infection in the patient with HIV, including clinical presentation and diagnosis, will be reviewed here. An overview of extrapulmonary disease due to
         <em>
          Pneumocystis

         infection will also be discussed. Treatment and prophylaxis of
         <em>

         <em>
          Pneumocystis
         </em>
         is currently recognized as a fungus based upon ribosomal ribonucleic acid (RNA) and other gene sequence homologies, the composition of the cell wall, and the structure of key enzymes [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Prior to being identified as a fungus, the taxonomic classification of
         <em>
          Pneumocystis
         </em>
         as a genus of protozoan organisms had been questioned for several years. However,
         <em>
          Pneumocystis
         </em>
         organisms are atypical fungi as they do not grow in fungal culture, they respond to some antiparasitic agents, and they have a cell wall that contains cholesterol rather than ergosterol [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The life cycle consists of the trophic form, a precystic form, and the cystic form [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The trophic form predominates over the cystic form during infection.
        </p>
        <p>
         The nomenclature for
         <em>
          Pneumocystis
         </em>
         has also changed; the species that infects rats is called
         <em>
          P. carinii
         </em>
         ; and the one that infects humans,
         <em>
          P. jirovecii
         </em>
         [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
         <em>
          P. jirovecii
         </em>
         is now designated as the species name to use in publications and references to human infections [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, we will use the abbreviation "PJP" to refer to
         <em>
          P. jirovecii
         </em>
         pneumonia throughout this topic, although some sources still use the abbreviation "PCP" to refer to the clinical entity of "
         <em>

         </em>
         pneumonia."

         <strong>
          Transmission
         </strong>
         – The primary mode of transmission of
         <em>
          P. jirovecii
         </em>
         is via the airborne route. Serologic studies show that primary infection occurs early in life, with 75 percent of humans infected by the age of four years [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. It was initially believed that PJP remained in a latent state unless the patient became immunosuppressed; however, this may not account for all cases of PJP. Animal and human studies have shown clearance of the organism, and there is increasing evidence of transmission from person to person and possibly through environmental reservoirs [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-11
         </a>
         ]. The role of colonization in humans may also be of importance to
         <em>
          Pneumocystis
         </em>
         transmission.

          Pathogen-host interaction

         –
         <em>
          Pneumocystis
         </em>
         exists almost exclusively within the alveoli of the lung [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The trophic forms first attach to the epithelium. Interaction of
         <em>
          Pneumocystis
         </em>
         with alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages initiates a cascade of cellular responses in both the organism and lung cells. Attachment of
         <em>
          Pneumocystis
         </em>
         to lung epithelial cells enhances
         <em>
          Pneumocystis
         </em>
         proliferation.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Alveolar macrophages are the primary resident phagocytes that mediate the clearance of the organisms from the lung. Phagocytosis, respiratory burst, and inflammatory activation of alveolar macrophages in response
         <em>
          to Pneumocystis
         </em>
         are impaired in persons with HIV and may contribute to the pathogenesis of infection. Accumulating evidence indicates that beta-glucan molecules, which are abundant in the cell wall
         <em>
          of Pneumocystis,
         </em>
         are important components that drive the initiation of the inflammatory response during PJP. The most abundant surface protein
         <em>
          of Pneumocystis
         </em>
         is the major surface glycoprotein (MSG) [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Variation of the expressed MSG may facilitate evasion of host immune responses.

          Host immunity
         </strong>
         – Immune control of
         <em>
          Pneumocystis
         </em>
         involves production of chemokines and inflammatory cytokines by alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells. In healthy individuals, CD4+ T cells coordinate the host inflammatory response by recruiting and activating additional immune effector cells including monocytes and macrophages, which are responsible for elimination of the organism. In contrast to CD4+ T cells, the role of CD8+ T cells in host defense against
         <em>
          Pneumocystis
         </em>
         is more controversial. However, CD8+ T cells may have some beneficial effect, particularly in a situation of chronic CD4+ depletion. In mice, the T-cell mediated inflammatory response can cause impaired lung compliance and gas exchange; as such, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells may result in deleterious lung inflammation. In addition to T cells, neutrophils, recruited by CXCL2 and IL-8, also participate in lung inflammation during PJP.

         <strong>
          Incidence
         </strong>
         – The incidence of PJP has dramatically decreased after the administration of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the widespread use of PJP prophylaxis [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,15-19
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in a United States cohort of patients with HIV, there was a decrease in PJP incidence from 3.0 per 100 person years between 1994 to 1997 to 0.39 per 100 person years between 2008 to 2010 [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,20
         </a>
         ]. In Uganda, the frequency of PJP among patients with HIV hospitalized with suspected pneumonia who had negative sputum acid-fast bacilli smears and underwent bronchoscopy decreased from nearly 40 percent of bronchoscopies in 1999 to 2000 to less than ten percent in 2007 to 2008 [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21,22
         </a>
         ]. In Spain, there was a decrease in PJP incidence from 1.3 per 100 person years in 2000 to 0.33 per 100 person years in 2013 [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The decrease in incidence with ART is due to both immunologic improvement as measured by CD4 cell count increases and the suppression of HIV RNA. For example, in a European cohort of individuals with HIV, the incidence of primary PJP was zero among those with a CD4 count between 100 to 200 cells/microL who were receiving ART and were virologically suppressed, independent of PJP prophylaxis [
         <a href="#rid19">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Despite this decrease, PJP is still one of the leading causes of opportunistic infection in individuals with HIV [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,20

          Risk factors

         <a href="#rid27">
          27

         ]. The average patient has pulmonary symptoms for about three weeks before presentation. Patients may describe fatigue with usual activities (climbing stairs, speaking on the telephone, shaving) that previously were done without difficulty. The cough is generally nonproductive. Other symptoms include fatigue, chills, chest pain, and weight loss. Approximately 5 to 10 percent of patients are asymptomatic.

         The most common findings on physical examination are fever (over 80 percent of patients have a temperature exceeding 38.1ºC) and tachypnea (60 percent). The most common adventitial sounds are crackles and rhonchi, but a normal chest examination occurs in 50 percent of cases. Oral thrush is a common co-infection.

          Bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchoscopic sampling
         </strong>
         – In many cases, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens are needed to make a definitive diagnosis of PJP. Bronchoalveolar lavage is the best option for patients who cannot produce an induced sputum or for whom induced sputum or endotracheal aspirate was non-diagnostic. Therefore, if sputum induction is negative or cannot be performed (eg, the patient cannot cooperate, is too dyspneic, or is unable to produce a specimen), fiberoptic bronchoscopy with BAL is the next recommended step.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         BAL alone has a diagnostic yield of 90 to 100 percent in patients with HIV. To increase its sensitivity, site-directed lavage can be used in patients with focal infiltrates; this involves sampling the most heavily involved lobes on chest radiograph. One study has shown that the combination of site-directed lavage and DFA staining increased the sensitivity of BAL from 80 to 98 percent [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58

         <a href="#rid59">
          59

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Transbronchial biopsy, which has a diagnostic yield of up to 100 percent, can be added if the presentation for PJP is atypical and other diagnoses with good yield on transbronchial biopsy (eg, cytomegalovirus infection, sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis) are also being considered.

          Endotracheal aspirates in intubated patients

         – Endotracheal aspirates from intubated and mechanically ventilated patients have a high sensitivity for the detection of PJP. As an example, one study of 31 intubated patients found that endotracheal aspirates examined with immunostaining techniques had a sensitivity of 92 percent for PJP, with immunostained BAL specimens serving as the reference standard [

          Other alternatives
         </strong>
         – If induced sputum, BAL, or endotracheal aspirate cannot be collected safely, we reassess the patient's risk for PJP (eg, CD4 count, whether the patient was taking ART or PJP prophylaxis), clinical presentation, and the availability of non-specific tests such as beta-D-glucan to see if a presumptive diagnosis can be made without resorting to more invasive specimen collection techniques. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Many patients with risk factors for PJP and characteristic clinical presentations can be treated empirically even with negative induced sputum and/or BAL testing without resorting to more invasive methods. This strategy is often supported by positive non-specific tests (eg, beta-D-glucan, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]). (See

         The approach to diagnosis includes definitive microbiologic identification of the organism via staining and/or PCR testing of a respiratory specimen or making a presumptive diagnosis based on the patient's risk, clinical presentation, and beta-D-glucan level. Obtaining a definitive diagnosis is preferred since treatment requires a prolonged course of possibly toxic therapy, and coinfections are common in patients with advanced immunodeficiency. (See

         There are multiple testing strategies that can be used to make a definitive or presumptive diagnosis of PJP. The approach varies across institutions and practices based on the availability of each of these tests.
        </p>
        <p>
         If all tests are available, we prefer to use PCR with the addition of beta-D-glucan in select cases when the clinical presentation is not straight forward or if there is concern for colonization. If PCR is not available, DFA is a reasonable alternative.

          If PCR is readily available
         </strong>
         – If PCR is available, the diagnosis of PJP can be made quickly and reliably with PCR alone based on a positive test result. Although a positive PCR result does not distinguish between colonization and true infection, the likelihood of colonization without infection in a patient with HIV, low CD4 count, and a clinical presentation consistent with PJP is unlikely.

         – If PCR is not available, then visualization of the cystic or trophic forms in respiratory specimens by DFA or general fungal stains can also be used to make a definitive diagnosis of PJP. However, sensitivity of general fungal stains is low on all respiratory specimens and a negative fungal stain should not be used to rule out PJP. Similarly, if DFA is negative on an induced sputum or endotracheal aspirate specimen, the sensitivity of the test is not high enough to rule out PJP, and further respiratory specimens (eg, BAL) or diagnostic methods should be sought.

         – Patients with HIV who are from regions known to have endemic fungal infections can present with disseminated diseases that may mimic PJP. The most important of these is disseminated histoplasmosis. Both diagnoses should be considered in a patient with fever, cough, and diffuse interstitial infiltrates who is from a histoplasmosis-endemic area. Elevated beta-glucan levels are observed in both PJP and histoplasmosis. Findings suggestive of histoplasmosis include adenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and/or the presence of oral or other mucosal ulcerations. The diagnosis is confirmed with histoplasmosis antigen testing. Other fungi, including cryptococcus and coccidioides, can also mimic PJP. (See

          Influenza
         </strong>
         – Individuals with HIV are considered at high risk for complications of influenza, one of which is primary influenza pneumonia. This presents with the acute onset of a severe viral syndrome (fever, myalgias, headache) followed by progressive respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea and possibly cyanosis. Typical radiographic manifestations include bilateral reticular or reticulonodular opacities with or without superimposed consolidation. High-resolution computed tomography (CT) may show multifocal peribronchovascular or subpleural consolidation and/or ground glass opacities. Unlike the acute onset of influenza pneumonia, symptoms associated with PJP occur in a subacute fashion. (See

         pneumonia, whereas chest CT abnormalities often have a peripheral distribution and involve the lower lobes in patients with COVID-19, there are no pathognomonic radiographic findings that would lead to the exclusion of either diagnosis without further testing. In some patients, concurrent COVID-19 and

          Choosing the optimal respiratory specimen
         </strong>
         – In most cases, sputum induction is the initial step in the attempt to obtain an adequate specimen. In many cases, however, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens are required to make a definitive diagnosis of PJP. For intubated patients, endotracheal aspirate is another less invasive alternative to BAL. (See

          Choosing the diagnosis test

         – A collected respiratory specimen can be sent for general fungal staining, specific immunofluorescent
         <em>
          Pneumocystis

         staining, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We prefer to send the PCR when available, because of its high sensitivity and specificity. Beta-D-glucan is a serum test that can be used adjunctively in uncertain cases to help make the diagnosis. (See

          Establishing the diagnosis

         – A definitive diagnosis of PJP requires microbiologic identification of the organism via staining and/or PCR testing of a respiratory specimen. If a definitive diagnosis is unable to be made due to a low burden of organisms and/or the inability to obtain the necessary specimen, we consider a presumptive diagnosis of PJP based on the patient's risk, clinical presentation, and beta-D-glucan level.
