Available vaccines have proven highly safe and effective. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129849.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Vaccines"</a>.)</p><p>In February 2021, a prothrombotic syndrome was observed in a few individuals who received the ChAdOx1 CoV-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca, University of Oxford, and Serum Institute of India), an adenoviral vector vaccine. Subsequently, similar findings were observed in individuals who received the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Janssen; Johnson &amp; Johnson), also based on an adenoviral vector. This syndrome has been designated vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). Clinicians need to be aware of presenting features and appropriate evaluation and management, which continue to evolve. Terminology is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Terminology'</a> below.)</p><p>In 2023, we reported a similar syndrome with VITT-like antibodies in two individuals with adenovirus infections; additional case reports followed (see <a class="local">'Triggered by an infection'</a> below). This indicates that the diagnostic and therapeutic lessons learned in 2021 regarding VITT will continue to apply when patients present with acute and chronic prothrombotic disorders mimicking VITT. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3401081306"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia is the original name used for VITT in the publication describing the syndrome [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. This name describes the sequence of events that occur in the syndrome, with thrombosis often presenting before thrombocytopenia is appreciated. This is our preferred term for the syndrome.</p><p>Other names include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia with thrombosis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT)</p><p></p><p>TTS is generally used as a more general descriptive name for a syndrome of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia of any cause following COVID-19 vaccination. Some individuals with TTS may have not been evaluated for anti-PF4 antibodies; some may have causes of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia other than VITT, such as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), cancer-associated thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In these other disorders, the temporal association of the syndrome with vaccination may be coincidental. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Some authors have used the term "pre-VITT" for thrombocytopenia, anti-PF4 antibodies, and symptoms of thrombosis such as severe headache with negative imaging following vaccination; in some cases, imaging subsequently became positive. We simply refer to this as VITT and treat accordingly. Possible explanations for initial negative imaging are presented below. (See <a class="local">'Thrombosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Terms for other anti-PF4 syndromes such as spontaneous HIT are presented separately. (See <a class="local">'Similarity to spontaneous HIT'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90261.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia", section on 'Terminology and HIT variants'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1079947648"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>VITT is caused by antibodies that recognize platelet factor 4 (PF4, also called CXCL4) bound to platelets. These antibodies are IgGs that activate platelets via low affinity platelet FcγIIa receptors (receptors on the platelet surface that bind the Fc portion of IgG). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3975.html" rel="external">"The adaptive humoral immune response", section on 'Opsonic Fc receptors'</a>.)</p><p>Ultimately, platelet activation (and possibly activation of other cells such as neutrophils) markedly stimulates the coagulation system and causes clinically significant thromboembolic complications. (See <a class="local">'Mechanisms of thrombosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H502247392"><span class="h2">Characteristics of VITT antibodies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>VITT antibody characteristics include [<a href="#rid1">1,3-5</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>IgG class.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recognize PF4 bound to platelets; the epitope on PF4 differs from the epitope recognized by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibodies.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Detectable in PF4/polyanion and PF4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and in functional assays.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cause platelet activation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Not heparin-dependent (not induced by heparin exposure; do not require heparin for detection in in vitro platelet activation assays). This is a major difference from HIT antibodies, which are typically heparin dependent. In vitro studies have documented that heparin <strong>suppressed</strong> binding of platelets and platelet aggregation with patient sera [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. One study reported that generation of procoagulant markers in an in vitro assay was heparin-dependent, the clinical significance of which is unclear [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Use of heparin to treat VITT is evolving. (See <a class="local">'Anticoagulation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>VITT antibodies bind to platelets via an eight amino acid region of PF4 located within the heparin binding site on the platelet surface [<a href="#rid5">5,9</a>]. VITT antibody binding is blocked by heparin. (See <a class="local">'PF4 assays'</a> below.)</p><p>The amino acids bound by VITT antibodies overlap with but differ from the amino acids bound by HIT antibodies. VITT antibody binding to platelets is stronger than HIT antibody binding. </p><p>Case series suggest that VITT antibodies are often transient:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A series of 65 individuals with serologically confirmed VITT that repeated functional assays over time found the functional assays became negative in 48 (74 percent), at a median of 15.5 weeks (range, 5 to 28 weeks) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. ELISA assay titers declined but were less likely to become negative (only 14 [22 percent] were negative by a median of 25 weeks). Of 29 individuals who subsequently received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (most were still receiving anticoagulation for the initial VITT episode), none developed new thromboses or increases in ELISA titer; two had mild thrombocytopenia with declining ELISA titers and no recurrence of platelet-activating antibodies. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A series of 35 individuals with serologically confirmed VITT that repeated functional assays over time found the assays became negative by 11 weeks in 23 of the 35 (66 percent) and after 12 weeks in 14 of 15 evaluable individuals (93 percent) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. ELISA assay titers also declined but did not become negative in most cases. Five individuals subsequently received an mRNA vaccine while continuing to receive anticoagulation for VITT, and none had recurrent symptoms of VITT. </p><p></p><p>These data support the safety of giving an mRNA vaccine if/when needed as a second dose or booster dose. The safety of receiving another dose of an adenoviral vaccine is unknown. However, the persistence of VITT antibodies for long periods of time in some individuals ("long VITT") provide a rationale for avoiding future use of adenoviral vectored COVID-19 vaccines in individuals who have had an episode of VITT [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Prevention (common questions)'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2449348164"><span class="h2">Mechanisms/triggers of antibody formation</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H260414151"><span class="h3">Triggered by a vaccine</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The mechanism(s) by which the implicated vaccines trigger development of new antibodies (and/or immune stimulation of preexisting antibodies) is under investigation. An evolving model suggests a two-hit process in which the vaccine stimulates neoantigen formation (first hit) along with a systemic inflammatory response (second hit), which together lead to production of anti-PF4 antibodies [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. </p><p>Vaccine components that could bind to PF4 and alter its conformation, generating a neoantigen, may include virus proteins, proteins from the HEK3 cell line in which the vaccine is produced, and free DNA [<a href="#rid1">1,3</a>]. Preliminary studies suggest that a complex of adenoviral hexon proteins bound to PF4 may be responsible [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>PF4 is a positively-charged tetrameric protein; the positive charge usually causes PF4 molecules to repel each other, but in the presence of negatively charged (polyanionic) molecules such as heparin, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9755" href="/d/drug information/9755.html" rel="external">pentosan polysulfate</a> (a rarely used medication), or endogenous polyphosphates, PF4 may form higher order structures that act as neoantigens [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. DNA and RNA also have polyanionic properties and may create a neoantigen when bound to PF4 [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hexon is the major adenoviral surface protein. The complex between PF4 and hexon appears to be mediated by electrostatic interactions [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>].

EDTA (used as a preservative) can increase capillary permeability and may contribute [<a href="#rid3">3,14</a>].</p><p></p><p>The viral spike protein antigens in the vaccine do not appear to be a source of molecular mimicry. There is no antibody cross-reactivity with the spike protein, and development of COVID-19 following recovery from VITT does not appear to re-trigger VITT antibodies or clinical recurrence of VITT [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129849.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Vaccines", section on 'General principles'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1921142799"><span class="h3">Triggered by an infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Observation of a VITT-like syndrome in two individuals who did not receive an adenoviral-vectored COVID-19 vaccine but who did have a proximate adenovirus infection suggests that a component of the adenoviral sequence may provide the source of the neoantigen [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Additional case reports followed [<a href="#rid23">23-25</a>]. Further, there are patients who were recognized prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (and the ensuing reports of VITT following vaccination) who developed cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) and thrombocytopenia following unspecified viral infection (which may have been undiagnosed adenovirus infection) who have been shown to have had VITT-like antibodies [<a href="#rid24">24,26</a>]. Hence, it is clear that a disorder clinically and serologically indistinguishable from VITT has existed prior to COVID-19 vaccination. </p><p>For these individuals, the inflammatory response related to the infection may have provided the second hit. </p><p>Antibodies in affected individuals have a VITT antibody-like profile with positive reactivity to PF4 alone (including positive serotonin release) and PF4/polyanion ELISA and negative reactivity to PF4/heparin complexes by fluid-phase ELISA and PF4/polyanion chemiluminescence assay (rapid HIT test) [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Characteristics of VITT antibodies'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2085883990"><span class="h2">Mechanisms of thrombosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Anti-PF4 antibodies cause "pancellular" activation, meaning that, besides activating platelets and coagulation, the antibodies activate monocytes (leading to tissue factor expression), neutrophils (leading to NETosis), and endothelial cells (leading to tissue factor expression) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Activation of these other cell types further contributes to high thrombosis risk.</p><p>Thrombosis in VITT can occur in typical sites of venous thromboembolism such as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the leg [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]; however, a distinctive feature of the syndrome is thrombosis in unusual sites including the splanchnic (splenic, portal, mesenteric) veins, adrenal veins (risk for adrenal failure), and the cerebral and ophthalmic veins. Arterial thrombosis including ischemic stroke (often, middle cerebral artery) and peripheral arterial occlusion has also occurred, often in individuals with concomitant venous thrombosis. (See <a class="local">'Thrombosis'</a> below.) </p><p>The pathophysiologic explanation for these unusual sites of thrombosis is unknown. The distribution is similar to that seen with other less-common thrombophilias such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Autopsy studies in individuals who have died of VITT have demonstrated catastrophic venous thrombosis involving multiple large and small vessels [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4036596393"><span class="h2">Similarity to spontaneous HIT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>VITT belongs to a spectrum of platelet-activating anti-PF4/heparin disorders, which also include [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Classic HIT</strong> – In classic heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), individuals develop thrombocytopenia, often with thrombosis, beginning 5 to 10 days after an immunizing heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin) exposure (the first day of immunizing heparin exposure is considered day 0). The antibodies are heparin dependent, meaning that the platelet count falls while the individual is receiving heparin and typically recovers within four to five days after stopping heparin exposure. Classic HIT occurs in &lt;0.1 to 5 percent of individuals exposed to heparin, with the highest incidences associated with tissue trauma (surgery) and exposure to unfractionated rather than low molecular weight heparin. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90261.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia", section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Autoimmune HIT (aHIT)</strong> – Autoimmune HIT (aHIT) represents a small portion of patients with HIT who have atypical presentations, some of which are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116418" href="/d/graphic/116418.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A 2023 review defines aHIT as an anti-PF4 disorder triggered by heparin (or low molecular weight (LMW) heparin or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8691" href="/d/drug information/8691.html" rel="external">fondaparinux</a>) with atypical clinical features such as onset, worsening, or persistence of thrombocytopenia despite stopping heparin, or that is caused by heparin flushes or by fondaparinux, along with atypical serological features including strong platelet activation in the absence of heparin [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. The sole heparin exposure may have been heparin flushes (heparin-flush HIT) or fondaparinux (fondaparinux-associated HIT). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">As stated in a 2021 review, in aHIT, the pathologic antibodies represent an amalgam of heparin-dependent and heparin-independent antibodies, explained most simply by antibodies that recognize distinct antigenic sites on PF4 corresponding to the heparin-dependent and heparin-independent (VITT-mimicking) site located at the heparin-binding site on PF4 [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. For heparin-independent antibodies, heparin is not required to produce a strongly positive result in a functional assay such as the serotonin-release assay (SRA) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

The three affected individuals had a positive serologic test for anti-PF4 antibodies; one had an indeterminant functional assay and one did not have functional assay testing. The authors concluded that these events likely represented background rates of clinical findings or a non-VITT etiology and that the data did not support an association of VITT with mRNA vaccines. VITT has not been reported after the other mRNA-based vaccine, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech). Population-based studies involving millions of individuals vaccinated with BNT162b2 have not observed increased risks of thrombosis [<a href="#rid37">37-39</a>]. </p><p>Cases of possible VITT with other (non-COVID-19) vaccines may be reported [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. However, identification of thrombocytopenia and thrombosis with anti-PF4 antibodies after a commonly administered vaccine should <strong>not</strong> be interpreted to show causality; these rare occurrences could easily be consistent with the background rate of spontaneous heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (spontaneous HIT) or possibly thrombotic thrombocytopenia due to adenoviral infection in the general population.

These antibodies activate platelets and cause thrombosis in the absence of heparin, similar to spontaneous or autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Similar presentations with VITT-like antibodies in individuals with an adenovirus infection are emerging.
