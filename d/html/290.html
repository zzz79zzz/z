         Abdominal and/or flank pain is the chief complaint in 5 to 10 percent of emergency department (ED) visits, and patients often require extensive evaluations, including testing, administration of analgesia, stabilization, and specialty consultation [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>
         ]. In many cases, the differential diagnosis is wide, ranging from benign to life-threatening conditions. Causes include medical, surgical, intra-abdominal, and extra-abdominal ailments. Associated symptoms often lack specificity, and atypical presentations of common diseases are frequent.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite sophisticated diagnostic modalities, undifferentiated abdominal pain remains the diagnosis for approximately 25 percent of patients discharged from the ED and between 35 and 41 percent for those admitted to the hospital [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,5-7
         </a>
         ]. Approximately 80 percent of patients discharged with undifferentiated abdominal pain improve or become pain free within two weeks of presentation [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Older adults, patients with immunocompromise or diabetes, and female patients of childbearing age pose special diagnostic challenges. Older adults and patients with diabetes often present with nonspecific complaints and atypical symptoms of potentially life-threatening conditions [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ].

         This topic will discuss the evaluation of the adult patient presenting to the ED with nontraumatic abdominal or flank pain. The outpatient evaluation of adults with abdominal pain, a synopsis of causes of abdominal pain, an approach to pelvic pain, and evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma are found separately.

         The evaluation of an adult emergency department (ED) patient with abdominal or flank pain starts with obtaining a history and performing a physical examination. We simultaneously and rapidly assess if the patient may be having a life-threatening abdominal catastrophe. Potential indicators include shock (eg, hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea), presence of peritonitis, significant distress from pain, or altered mental status; these warrant starting resuscitation simultaneously with obtaining further history and examination. (See
         <a class="local">

         A thorough history focuses the differential diagnosis and helps determine the need for further testing. It is important to characterize the pain as precisely as possible, including timing of onset, prior episodes of similar pain, quality, location, radiation, aggravating and alleviating factors, and associated symptoms. Features of high-risk abdominal pain are presented in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68577" href="/z/d/graphic/68577.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Symptoms in older patients are less likely to be characteristic for the underlying cause of their pain (ie, "atypical" symptoms). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Older adults'

         <strong>
          Quality and timing of pain
         </strong>
         — The quality and timing of the pain (eg, intensity at onset, acute versus chronic) help determine the acuity and focus the evaluation on specific organ systems. Severe, sudden-onset pain or constant, worsening pain lasting over six hours (but less than 48 hours) suggests a surgical cause, while nonsurgical causes tend to have milder, intermittent pain. Abdominal pain can be classified as visceral, parietal (ie, somatic), or referred depending on its neurologic basis, which is discussed in detail separately  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef142356" href="/z/d/graphic/142356.html" rel="external">
          table 2

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Pain intensity at onset provides clues to disease severity and involved structures [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,10,11
         </a>
         ]. Pain with maximum intensity at onset is concerning for a vascular process (eg, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm [AAA]), obstruction of a small tubular structure (eg, nephrolithiasis), or reproductive organ pathology (eg, ovarian cyst rupture or torsion) [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Pain with gradual onset suggests an inflammatory or infectious process (eg, appendicitis, diverticulitis) or obstruction of a large tubular structure (eg, intestine).

          First episode of pain lasting less than one week

         – We consider this to be acute pain that generally requires an extensive ED evaluation unless the history and examination determine a clear cause. (See

          Recurrent presentations of acute pain
         </strong>
         – This may be classified as acute, subacute, or chronic pain, and the ED evaluation often depends on the testing and imaging obtained during prior episodes and whether the pain has resolved. Causes may be benign (eg, irritable bowel syndrome, hernia, nephrolithiasis, abdominal migraines, cyclical vomiting syndrome, cannabis hyperemesis syndrome) or more serious (eg, intermittent ovarian torsion, mesenteric ischemia, biliary disease). High-quality evidence does not exist to define a low-risk patient subset with recurrent abdominal pain that clearly does not need computed tomography (CT) imaging [

          Pain that has remained unchanged for months or years
         </strong>
         – We consider this to be chronic pain that may not require extensive ED evaluation if the patient has had prior testing and imaging. However, a patient with chronic abdominal or flank pain can still present with an acute exacerbation of a chronic problem or a new and unrelated problem, which the history must differentiate. The diagnostic approach to chronic abdominal pain is discussed separately. (See

          Location of pain
         </strong>
         — The location and radiation of pain helps narrow the differential diagnosis. The provided tables summarize the causes of pain by characteristic location in the abdomen  (

          table 3

          table 4

         ), and the figure demonstrates patterns of referred pain  (

          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Causes of abdominal pain by location are discussed in detail separately. (See

          "Causes of abdominal pain in adults"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Localization by itself, however, is not sufficiently sensitive to definitively exclude intra-abdominal pathology [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,14,15
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in one study, 24 percent of patients diagnosed with appendicitis had no right lower quadrant pain or tenderness [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Right upper quadrant pain is often associated with the liver or gallbladder, although pain from biliary colic can be poorly localized, and patients may complain of lower chest, epigastric, or back discomfort [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Pain location can change over time, reflecting progression of disease. As a classic example, appendicitis begins as periumbilical visceral pain (reflecting its embryologic origin) then progresses to right lower quadrant parietal pain as the inflamed appendix (if anterior or pelvic) irritates the peritoneum. Retrocecal appendicitis may not cause any focal peritoneal irritation.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Thoracic diseases, such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), or myocardial infarction, can cause upper abdominal pain, particularly in older patients [

         – It is helpful to ask whether the patient sustained any injuries, procedures, or instrumentation in the prior month. Intra-abdominal injuries may not manifest for days to weeks after the event. Splenic rupture is an example, but delayed presentations of perforated bowel, pancreatitis, and injuries to the liver, gallbladder, and genitourinary tract have all been reported. Clinical manifestations of diaphragmatic injury, which is often not diagnosed immediately following the injury, can be delayed for months to even years. (See

          Blood pressure and heart rate

         – The patient's general appearance not only provides clues to the diagnosis but also guides the urgency of resuscitation, analgesia, and imaging. The patient who is restless, curled up, and agitated may have renal colic. A patient lying perfectly still in bed with knees bent or experiencing worsening pain when the examiner lightly bumps the stretcher raises concern for peritonitis. Signs of shock (eg, pallor, diaphoresis, altered mental status) warrant resuscitation simultaneously with the evaluation. Signs of systemic disease (eg, spider angiomata in cirrhosis, cachexia in malignancy) are often readily apparent.

Periumbilical ecchymosis (Cullen sign) can occur with pancreatitis, rectus sheath hematoma, perforated ulcer, and intra-peritoneal hemorrhage. Abdominal wall pathology such as a hernia can be obvious if incarcerated but may require asking the patient to increase abdominal pressure (ie, Valsalva maneuver, cough) to elicit the bulge. (See

          Palpation
         </strong>
         – Abdominal palpation identifies the location and degree of tenderness and detects signs of peritoneal irritation, such as involuntary guarding and muscular rigidity. Serial examinations can improve diagnostic accuracy [

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Our approach is to lightly palpate an area away from the site of pain, then extend towards the area of maximal pain. Once the area of maximal tenderness is localized, we perform maneuvers to elicit peritoneal signs, such as percussion or releasing after deep palpation. If light palpation does not identify a specific area of tenderness, palpate deeper to identify findings such as hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, aortic dilatation, or deep tenderness (such as may occur with retrocecal appendicitis).

As compared with amylase, serum lipase is more sensitive and specific for pancreatitis, but elevations may be caused by other diseases. Marked liver enzyme elevation suggests acute hepatitis (eg, viral) but can occur with underlying chronic liver disease (eg, Wilson disease), ischemic or drug-induced liver injury (eg,

         The decision to image an ED patient with abdominal or flank pain is a clinical judgement based on whether there are entities on the differential diagnosis that must be excluded during the current visit or can wait for outpatient follow-up. This is often a complex decision-making process and may require shared decision-making with the patient in equivocal cases. Decisions regarding the need and timing of imaging are based on suspected etiologies and are discussed in more detail below. (See

          43

         ]. Approximately two-thirds of patients presenting to the ED with acute abdominal pain have a disease that can be diagnosed by CT [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. One small study found that CT correctly diagnosed the cause of pain among patients with an "acute abdomen" in 90 percent of cases compared with 76 percent of cases diagnosed correctly by history and physical examination alone [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45

          Role of oral contrast
         </strong>
         — Improvements in the image quality provided by multislice helical CT scanners have raised questions about the need for oral contrast.

         <a href="#rid47">
          47,48

          Hollow viscous perforation and/or peritonitis
         </strong>
         – The most common cause of stomach and duodenal perforation is peptic ulcer disease, but perforation can also complicate appendicitis, diverticulitis, bowel obstruction, ischemic bowel, toxic megacolon, severe retching (ie, esophageal perforation, Boerhaave syndrome), and other processes. Mortality increases in older adults (who are often unaware they have peptic ulcer disease until a complication develops) and with delays in diagnosis. (See

         We consult procedural specialists early in the patient's ED course since surgical intervention and/or percutaneous drainage are often necessary to obtain source control of intra-abdominal infections (other than spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [SBP]) or to obtain hemostasis of intra-peritoneal hemorrhage. Do not delay consultation while awaiting definitive imaging when there is high clinical suspicion for an abdominal catastrophe. Depending on the preliminary diagnosis, we consult either a general or vascular surgeon, gynecologist, urologist, gastroenterologist, or interventional radiologist, such as in the following circumstances:

         In a patient with concern for an abdominal catastrophe, the choice of imaging (beyond point-of-care ultrasound) depends upon the acuity of the presentation, the patient's capacity to tolerate a study, stability for transport to radiology, risk of not diagnosing the etiology versus risk of transport to radiology, and consultant requirements for operative planning. The timing of imaging may need to be coordinated with the procedural consultant and/or intensivist, since resuscitation may need to be continued until the patient is stable for advanced imaging or a definitive procedure.

         ). Immediate surgical consultation is required if pneumoperitoneum is identified. An upright CXR detects as little as 1 to 2 mL of free air after the patient has been upright for 5 to 10 minutes compared with approximately 5 mL detected by a plain abdominal radiograph [

         In a patient without a diagnosis and management plan after point-of-care ultrasound and/or upright CXR (if performed), we obtain an abdominopelvic CT scan, which is the imaging modality most likely to provide the diagnosis in a patient with an abdominal catastrophe. In a hemodynamically stable patient, the risk of not diagnosing the etiology will often outweigh the risk of transporting the patient to radiology. IV contrast is preferred if concerned for an AAA, aortic dissection, or mesenteric ischemia, but hemorrhage from leaking or ruptured AAA can also be visualized on nonenhanced CT  (

         In a patient suspected of having a ruptured AAA, CT confirms the rupture and evaluates feasibility of endovascular repair. However, in a hemodynamically unstable patient with a known AAA or point-of-care ultrasound-visualized AAA, CT imaging is desirable for the surgeon but is not absolutely required prior to intervention. Imaging decisions in the unstable patient should be made in consultation with the surgeon or proceduralist. (See

         In a patient with biliary, kidney, pregnancy-related, or ovarian pathology, the surgeon or proceduralist may request a radiology-performed ultrasound for further evaluation. If the patient is hemodynamically unstable and point-of-care ultrasound images confirm a diagnosis, we discuss with the surgeon or proceduralist whether the risks of definitive treatment delay and patient transport to radiology for an additional study are outweighed by any additional information that study may provide.

However, we do not definitively diagnose an ED patient with gastritis, reflux, or peptic ulcer disease since upper gastrointestinal endoscopy confirms the diagnosis and is not routinely performed in the ED. Also, intermittent upper abdominal pain can be a symptom of other diseases, such as biliary colic and acute coronary syndrome.

         Plain radiographs in patients with mesenteric ischemia are often unremarkable and therefore should not be obtained in patients with a suspected acute vascular process.

         Imaging decisions are guided by the acuity of the presentation and history of prior episodes of obstruction, especially if abdominopelvic CT scans were obtained during prior episodes. We obtain plain abdominal radiographs (including upright chest radiograph [CXR]) in a patient suspected of having a bowel obstruction to quickly confirm the diagnosis, expedite consultation, and exclude findings that indicate the need for immediate intervention (eg, pneumoperitoneum, volvulus, pneumatosis intestinalis). This is typically followed by abdominopelvic CT to further characterize the nature, severity, and potential etiologies of the obstruction. (See

         ). CT without contrast enhancement can possibly diagnose SBO. In a patient with suspected partial or intermittent SBO, the surgeon may request an oral and IV contrast-enhanced CT since the presence or absence of contrast distal to the site of suspected obstruction helps guide management. (See

         However, in a patient with plain radiographs confirming obstruction, a CT may not be necessary and should be obtained in discussion with the consulting surgeon.

However, renal colic can be a clinical diagnosis; thus, we may forego imaging in young patients without suspicion for a serious alternative diagnosis (eg, cholecystitis, appendicitis, AAA) or patients with recurrent stones who have been previously managed conservatively (eg, analgesia, hydration). We prefer kidney ultrasound in patients with kidney stones visualized on imaging during prior episodes, pregnant patients, and those felt to be at low risk for serious alternative diagnoses. In other patients, those with high-risk features (eg, obesity [males &gt;129 kg, females &gt;113 kg], kidney transplant, dialysis dependency, a solitary kidney, and age &gt;76 years [

CT can also exclude ruptured AAA, a catastrophic renal colic mimic, and thus is especially valuable in patients without prior abdominal imaging and with AAA risk factors (eg, advancing age, male sex, tobacco use, other large vessel aneurysms, family history of AAA, atherosclerosis, hypertension). If we have a high suspicion that the pain is from nephrolithiasis, we perform a noncontrast CT because contrast-enhanced parenchyma with early excretion into the pelvicalyceal system can occasionally obscure calculi within the collecting system. In other patients, performing an IV contrast-enhanced CT is reasonable since it allows for evaluating other etiologies of flank pain while preserving high sensitivity for identifying calculi large enough to be at risk of not passing spontaneously [

         We have a low threshold to obtain imaging if the abdominal or flank pain is not typical of previous pain episodes. A patient with sickle cell disease can have intermittent abdominal pain as part of a vaso-occlusive episode but is also at increased risk of having gallstones, cholecystitis, acute hepatic sequestration, acute splenic sequestration, renal papillary necrosis, UTI, pyelonephritis, or opioid-induced constipation.

         An organ transplant recipient with abdominal or flank pain often requires imaging (eg, CT, MRI) because transplanted organs are denervated and lose normal lymphatic drainage and thus do not have characteristic manifestations of pathology. Additionally, immunosuppressive agents can mask signs and symptoms of peritonitis or systemic infection. Common and opportunistic abdominal infections can develop, such as cytomegalovirus colitis, hepatitis B and C viral infections, gastrointestinal parasites (eg,
         <em>
          Cryptosporidium
         </em>
         and
         <em>
          Microsporidium
         </em>
         ), and UTIs, particularly in kidney transplant recipients. Post-surgical undrained fluid collections or blockage or leaks of anastomoses can cause pain or become infected. Acute kidney rejection can present with allograft pain and tenderness. Kidney transplant recipients with pain and tenderness over their kidney allograft, and selected patients diagnosed with a UTI should have an ultrasound of the allograft. (See

         Immunosuppressive agents increase risk of various malignancies that can present with abdominal or flank pain.

         Many complications of bariatric surgery cause abdominal pain and can present weeks, months, or years after the surgery. A contrast-enhanced (often both IV and oral) abdominopelvic CT is typically necessary, but imaging decisions should be made in consultation with the patient's bariatric surgeon. Imaging with CT is essentially required if the surgeon cannot be reached or the specifics of the procedure are unavailable (eg, surgery performed internationally). Some patients will need endoscopy or laparoscopic exploration even if the CT is normal. In addition to bowel obstruction, other potential complications include (see

         Mesenteric lymphadenitis (ie, inflammation of the mesenteric lymph nodes) is a common benign cause of nonspecific abdominal pain but can mimic appendicitis [

         ]. It is a diagnosis of exclusion in the ED and can often be identified by the presence of enlarged lymph nodes on abdominopelvic CT or abdominal ultrasound (the latter may not be sufficient to exclude appendicitis). Causes include viral infections (the most common), bacterial infections (eg, gastroenteritis), inflammatory bowel disease, and lymphoma. If caused by a viral infection, the course is self-limited, resolving within several weeks. (See

          First-line: Abdominopelvic CT

         – In a male or nonpregnant female with suspected nongynecologic etiology with lower abdominal (especially right lower quadrant), left upper quadrant, or diffuse abdominal pain, an IV contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT is the study with the best accuracy. Even in the absence of IV contrast, CT is still helpful to diagnose appendicitis and other conditions since inflammatory changes in mesenteric fat are a secondary finding in many processes (eg, pericecal and periappendiceal fat in case of appendicitis). However, such inflammatory changes can be obscured in young, slender patients with little retroperitoneal and mesenteric fat. We do not routinely administer oral contrast, which is discussed further above. (See

         In a patient with left lower quadrant pain, an IV contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT is the most accurate modality to diagnose diverticulitis [

While CT is not necessary for all patients with suspected diverticulitis, it is helpful to confirm the diagnosis in a patient without a previous history of diverticular disease and to assess for complications (eg, perforation, abscess formation) in a patient with known disease but severe symptoms. When symptoms are consistent with prior diverticulitis episodes, we will use shared decision-making regarding treatment and reassessment versus immediate imaging. (See

         An abdominal ultrasound, if used for the appropriate indication, is an alternative imaging option that avoids exposing the patient to ionizing radiation or IV contrast.

         When used to diagnose appendicitis, test performance is variable and depends on patient-specific (eg, body habitus, discomfort and alertness, appendix location relative to overlying bowel) and operator-specific (eg, experience) variables. Ultrasound has a reported sensitivity of approximately 85 percent and a specificity of 90 percent. Rates of indeterminate examinations are high, with 50 to 85 percent of normal appendices not visualized. (See

         In a patient whose cause of pain is identified, the disposition is relatively straightforward and based on management of the specific etiology. However, in a patient with an unrevealing evaluation, the disposition depends upon age, comorbidities, extent of pain, need for pain management, whether imaging was performed, certainty of imaging results, likelihood of serious disease, availability of expedited follow-up care, and reliability and social supports. This generally involves shared decision-making with the patient.

         – We will reassure and discharge most patients with nonspecific abdominal or flank pain, even older adults, who have normal cross-sectional imaging and laboratory results. A normal abdominopelvic CT increases physician comfort with not identifying a specific cause for the abdominal pain and with discharging a patient who might otherwise be admitted for observation [
         <a href="#rid104">
          104
         </a>
         ]. Discharged patients must be provided with clear, written instructions of potential danger signs and where and when to return for emergency care or re-evaluation. One common approach is to instruct the patient to follow up for re-evaluation with their primary care clinician in 12 to 48 hours or to return to the ED if they cannot not be seen by their outpatient clinician in that timeframe.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         After an appropriate ED evaluation, most patients with a diagnosis of nonspecific abdominal pain have a benign condition that resolves without further intervention [

          Initial evaluation

         – The evaluation of an adult emergency department (ED) patient with abdominal or flank pain starts with obtaining a history, performing a physical examination, and rapidly assessing if the patient may have an abdominal catastrophe (clues include hypotension or other signs of shock, peritonitis, toxic appearance). High-risk features of abdominal pain must be appreciated  (

         ). Pain that is severe and maximum intensity at onset is concerning for a vascular emergency (eg, aortic rupture or dissection, mesenteric ischemia, pulmonary embolism), obstruction of a small tubular structure (eg, ureter), or reproductive organ pathology (eg, ovarian torsion, ruptured ovarian cyst). The presence of associated symptoms  (

          Physical examination
         </strong>
         – Abdominal palpation localizes the tenderness and detects signs of peritoneal irritation, such as involuntary guarding and muscular rigidity. A rigid abdomen is cause for concern, but traditional techniques for assessing rebound tenderness have limited sensitivity and specificity for identifying peritonitis. (See

          Role of point-of-care ultrasound
         </strong>
         – Emergency physician-performed point-of-care ultrasound has become an important tool for the evaluation of patients with abdominal pain. Ultrasound is especially helpful in the unstable patient or when there is concern for abdominal catastrophe. It can identify hemoperitoneum, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), intrauterine pregnancy, gallstones, a distended urinary bladder, pericardial effusion, and hydronephrosis and measure inferior vena cava diameter as an indicator of fluids status. (See

         Start treatment simultaneously with the initial evaluation when there is a concern for an abdominal catastrophe. Establish venous access, start intravenous (IV) fluids (ie, crystalloid), obtain laboratory studies, and perform point-of-care ultrasound. Patients may need vasopressors, stress-dose glucocorticoids, blood product transfusion, and/or empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics. (See

          High-risk conditions
         </strong>
         – Risk factors for serious causes of abdominal and flank pain include older age, immunocompromise, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, active malignancy, taking chronic glucocorticoids or immunosuppressants, alcohol misuse, recipient of an organ transplant, sickle cell disease, prior abdominal (especially bariatric) surgeries, cardiovascular disease, and recent instrumentation.

         <strong>
          Analgesia
         </strong>
         – We offer the patient targeted analgesia to facilitate the ED evaluation. Analgesics, including opioids, do not interfere with the assessment of abdominal pain and do not result in more frequent incorrect management decisions. The goal of analgesia is to reduce pain to manageable levels, improve patient comfort, and possibly improve the accuracy of the examination by minimizing voluntary guarding. The goal is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         to eliminate all pain. We minimize opioid administration in patients with low-risk, recurrent, undifferentiated abdominal pain. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Analgesia'

         <strong>
          Disposition
         </strong>
         – In a patient who does not have a specific etiology identified, the disposition depends upon age, comorbidities, extent of pain, need for pain management, whether imaging was performed, certainty of imaging results, likelihood of serious disease, availability of expedited follow-up care, and reliability and social supports. We will reassure and discharge most patients with nonspecific abdominal pain, even older adults, who have a normal CT and laboratory results. If there remains doubt about the nature or seriousness of the underlying cause, especially in older adults or those with high-risk conditions, we will admit to the hospital or observe the patient in the ED.
