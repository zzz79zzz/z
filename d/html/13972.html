In the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services has published guidelines on the evaluation and management of pregnant women with HIV [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Our recommendations below are largely consistent with these guidelines.</p><p>We recognize that not all pregnant, postpartum, and lactating individuals identify as women or mothers. However, using gender-inclusive language is not possible in all languages, all countries, and for all our readers. The topics discussed here are based on risks driven by biological sex and not gender identity. Therefore, throughout this topic, we use the term “woman” to signify a person of the female sex (regardless of gender identity) and the term “mother” to signify the female biological parent of a child (regardless of gender identity).</p><p>The use of antiretroviral medications during pregnancy, intrapartum care, and infant antiretroviral prophylaxis are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15799.html" rel="external">"Antiretroviral selection and management in pregnant individuals with HIV in resource-rich settings"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/126417.html" rel="external">"Intrapartum and postpartum management of pregnant women with HIV and infant prophylaxis in resource-rich settings"</a>.)</p><p>Recommendations on breastfeeding in resource-rich and resource-limited settings are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/126417.html" rel="external">"Intrapartum and postpartum management of pregnant women with HIV and infant prophylaxis in resource-rich settings"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13970.html" rel="external">"Prevention of HIV transmission during breastfeeding in resource-limited settings"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7447182"><span class="h1">HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A thorough history and physical examination should be performed in the pregnant individual with HIV to see if there are health concerns in the mother, which may also affect the well-being of the fetus. Patients should be interviewed about any history of opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), medication use (including over the counter drugs), immunization status, or substance abuse issues. Immunosuppressed women who report fevers and weight loss may have an underlying opportunistic infection, which may compromise maternal and fetal health (eg, tuberculosis).</p><p>The physical examination should be focused on assessing any signs of advanced HIV infection (eg, thrush or evidence of wasting) or signs of concomitant STIs (eg, genital ulcers or vaginal discharge). Since many patients with HIV are also at risk for viral hepatitis, a careful examination for stigmata of advanced liver disease (eg, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, spider angiomata) is also indicated. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10063269"><span class="h1">GENERAL COUNSELING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prenatal care providers should address potentially modifiable behaviors, which have been associated with an increased risk of vertical HIV transmission, such as cigarette smoking, illicit drug use (eg, cocaine, heroin), and unprotected intercourse with multiple partners [<a href="#rid2">2-7</a>]. Some of these risk factors are also associated with low birth weight. However, most of these studies were conducted prior to the era of potent antiretroviral therapy so the true magnitude of effect is unclear. </p><p>Pregnant individuals should be counseled regarding the harmful effects of substance use (including alcohol, cocaine, and opiates) on fetal development. Patients should also be counseled to discontinue cigarette smoking. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4799.html" rel="external">"Substance use during pregnancy: Screening and prenatal care"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4803.html" rel="external">"Cigarette and tobacco products in pregnancy: Impact on pregnancy and the neonate"</a>.)</p><p>Patients should be advised to use condoms during sexual activity, as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can lead to preterm delivery and teratogenicity (eg, congenital syphilis). Providers should evaluate for evidence of STIs as part of routine antenatal care. If a couple is monogamous, have tested negative for STIs, and the partner with HIV has achieved virologic suppression on antiretroviral therapy, we have taken a more liberal approach to condom use. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7596.html" rel="external">"Screening for sexually transmitted infections"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6761.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous preterm birth: Overview of risk factors and prognosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16612.html" rel="external">"HIV infection: Risk factors and prevention strategies", section on 'Counseling on condom use'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10063283"><span class="h1">DETERMINATION OF GESTATIONAL AGE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ultrasound imaging can estimate gestational age and thereby calculate the expected date of delivery. Accurate determination of fetal gestational age is particularly important among pregnant individuals with HIV infection since early delivery may be necessary to decrease the risk of vertical HIV transmission. Delivery by prelabor cesarean section is recommended at 38 weeks gestation in the event of incomplete viral suppression (&gt;1000 copies/mL). Because of the potential need for an early, scheduled cesarean delivery with the attendant risk of fetal pulmonary immaturity, a first trimester ultrasound should be performed, when possible, to ensure accurate pregnancy dating [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p>Several studies have demonstrated that ultrasound estimation during the first half of pregnancy is superior to estimating the delivery date based on the last menstrual period or physical examination [<a href="#rid8">8-10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5391.html" rel="external">"Prenatal assessment of gestational age, date of delivery, and fetal weight"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10063311"><span class="h1">PRENATAL LABORATORY TESTING</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10063319"><span class="h2">CD4 cell counts</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CD4 cell count should be assessed at the initial visit and at least every three months during pregnancy. For patients who have been on combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) with consistent viral suppression and have CD4 counts above the threshold for opportunistic infections (&gt;200 cells/microL and &gt;14 percent), CD4 cell count monitoring may be done every six months [<a href="#rid1">1,11</a>].</p><p>Pregnancy itself is associated with a decline in absolute CD4 count number, which may be related to increased plasma blood volume; however, there is usually no effect on the CD4 cell percentage [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. Therefore, some clinicians prefer to monitor the CD4 cell percentage during pregnancy; however, decisions regarding opportunistic infection prophylaxis and monitoring of ART response are based on absolute CD4 cell count numbers. The CD4 cell criteria for initiation of prophylaxis for pneumocystis, toxoplasmosis, or <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex are the same as in nonpregnant patients with HIV. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3747.html" rel="external">"Overview of prevention of opportunistic infections in patients with HIV"</a> and <a class="local">'Chemoprophylaxis for opportunistic infections'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10063326"><span class="h2">Viral load measurement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Plasma HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) is monitored frequently during pregnancy to confirm attainment and maintenance of viral suppression. As in nonpregnant adults, patients should exhibit at least a two log decline in plasma viremia by a month after initiation of therapy. Complete viral suppression should be achieved as soon as possible in pregnant patients. Persistent viremia detected more than eight weeks after initiation of therapy should warrant suspicion of poor adherence, HIV drug resistance, increased metabolism of drug(s) due to pregnancy resulting in low drug levels, or drug-drug interactions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3770.html" rel="external">"Patient monitoring during HIV antiretroviral therapy"</a>.)</p><p>Close monitoring is desired to confirm the effectiveness of the patient’s antiretroviral drug regimen since higher levels of HIV RNA are associated with increased risk of vertical transmission of HIV infection. HIV RNA levels are generally monitored at entry into care, at the time of ART initiation, two to four weeks after initiation (or changing) of therapy, monthly until complete viral suppression and then at least every three months for the remainder of the pregnancy. Patients who remain on ART regimens that lack data on use in pregnancy (eg, two-drug regimens, newer ART drugs with minimal or no pharmacokinetic data in pregnancy) should have their viral load checked more frequently (every one or two months) during pregnancy [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. For patients who have viral suppression on a cobicistat-based regimen and do not want to change regimens during pregnancy, we check viral levels monthly throughout pregnancy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15799.html" rel="external">"Antiretroviral selection and management in pregnant individuals with HIV in resource-rich settings", section on 'On ART with viral suppression'</a>.)</p><p>Plasma viral load should also be assessed at 34 to 36 weeks gestation in order to aid in the decision regarding mode and timing of delivery [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. If the viral load is detectable, resistance testing and assessment of adherence is advised. If the viral load is &gt;1000 copies/mL near term gestation, the patient should be counseled regarding the benefits of scheduled pre-labor cesarean section at 38 weeks gestation for the prevention of vertical transmission. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/126417.html" rel="external">"Intrapartum and postpartum management of pregnant women with HIV and infant prophylaxis in resource-rich settings", section on 'Mode of delivery'</a>.)</p><p>The relationship between HIV RNA levels and risk of vertical transmission is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15799.html" rel="external">"Antiretroviral selection and management in pregnant individuals with HIV in resource-rich settings", section on 'HIV viremia and risk of infant infection'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10063333"><span class="h2">Drug resistance testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HIV drug resistance testing should be performed prior to starting or modifying ART regimens in all pregnant individuals whose HIV RNA levels are above the threshold for resistance testing (ie, &gt;500 to 1000 copies/mL) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. For treatment-naïve pregnant individuals with HIV, ART should be initiated without delay, prior to receiving the results of the resistance testing; the regimen can be modified if necessary based on the results of the resistance assay. This is particularly important if the mother presents late for care, as the risk of vertical HIV transmission is associated with the duration of antenatal ART and level of viral suppression at delivery. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15799.html" rel="external">"Antiretroviral selection and management in pregnant individuals with HIV in resource-rich settings", section on 'Detectable viremia late in pregnancy'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H613315441"><span class="h2">Monitoring for ART toxicity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Toxicities associated with ART should be assessed based on the particular drug regimen. As with all patients with HIV, complete blood count (CBC), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, and liver function tests are checked prior to ART initiation and every three to six months thereafter. Urinalysis is also checked after ART initiation and every six months while on a tenofovir-containing regimen. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3745.html" rel="external">"Primary care of adults with HIV", section on 'Hematologic, renal, and hepatic toxicity'</a>.)</p><p>Even in the absence of potential ART toxicity, HIV infection has also been associated with abnormalities of bone marrow, kidney, and liver function, either directly or because of comorbid conditions. Maternal anemia has been associated with an increased risk of both adverse pregnancy outcomes as well as vertical HIV infection [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Correction of potential underlying causes, such as iron deficiency, is important to prevent anemia-related complications of pregnancy. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H613315226"><span class="h2">Screening for gestational diabetes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Glucose challenge testing as screening for gestational diabetes is generally performed at the usual recommended gestational age of 24 to 28 weeks. However, it is reasonable to consider protease inhibitor use an indication for earlier glucose challenge screening, given the potential association between these agents and glucose intolerance in the general population with HIV. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3778.html" rel="external">"Safety and dosing of antiretroviral medications in pregnancy", section on 'Gestational diabetes'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6797.html" rel="external">"Gestational diabetes mellitus: Screening, diagnosis, and prevention"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8632998"><span class="h2">Testing for viral hepatitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pregnant individuals with HIV should be screened for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections since coinfection is common in patients with HIV due to shared routes of transmission (eg, injection drug use). Testing for hepatitis B infection includes hepatitis B surface antigen and antibodies to core and surface antigens (ie, anti-HB core and anti-HBs). Testing for hepatitis C infection includes serologic testing; patients with advanced HIV infection (CD4 cell count &lt;100 cells/microL) and risk factors for HCV (eg, injection drug use history) should also have HCV RNA testing since antibody testing can be falsely negative. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3640.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of hepatitis B in patients living with HIV"</a>.)</p><p>Those without evidence of hepatitis B infection (ie, nonreactive anti-HB core and anti-HBs results) should begin a hepatitis B virus immunization series, since the recombinant vaccine is safe to give during pregnancy. Those with evidence of chronic hepatitis B infection will need consultation with a specialist knowledgeable in both liver and HIV disease. Certain antiretroviral medications have dual activity against HIV and hepatitis B viruses. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3652.html" rel="external">"Treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients with HIV"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15799.html" rel="external">"Antiretroviral selection and management in pregnant individuals with HIV in resource-rich settings"</a>.)</p><p>Individuals without evidence of HCV infection should be counseled regarding avoidance of HCV acquisition (eg, abstinence from injection drug use; avoidance of unprotected intercourse with an HCV-seropositive partner). Acute infection with HCV during pregnancy is problematic because direct-acting antiviral agents have not been studied in pregnancy, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9860" href="/d/drug information/9860.html" rel="external">ribavirin</a> is contraindicated in pregnancy, and interferon is not recommended. Also, theoretically, there is an increased risk of HCV transmission to the infant due to the high levels of viremia that are observed during early infection. </p><p>Vertical transmission of HCV appears to be facilitated by HIV-coinfection, compared with patients without HIV. A meta-analysis of 10 studies demonstrated that maternal coinfection increases the odds of vertical HCV transmission by approximately 90 percent (odds ratio 1.9, 95% CI 1.4-2.7) compared with maternal HCV infection alone [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. There are no differences in general management principles (eg, the timing or mode of delivery) based on HCV coinfection in the mother [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3637.html" rel="external">"Vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus"</a>.)</p><p>Patients should also be screened for antibodies to the hepatitis A virus, if this has not been done previously. Those testing negative should receive the hepatitis A virus vaccine series [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3900.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis A virus infection: Treatment and prevention"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7448597"><span class="h2">Testing for tuberculosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with HIV are at high risk of developing active disease after infection with <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </em>[<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. For this reason, all persons should be tested for latent tuberculosis infection after HIV is diagnosed [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/135001.html" rel="external">"Tuberculosis infection (latent tuberculosis) in pregnancy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8014.html" rel="external">"Tuberculosis disease (active tuberculosis) in pregnancy"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H328332"><span class="h2">Screening for STIs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with HIV should be screened for evidence of certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs), which can be associated with stillbirth, preterm delivery, and low birth weight. Screening for maternal syphilis infection is not only important in preventing congenital syphilis; one study demonstrated that maternal infection was associated with an increased risk of vertical HIV transmission as well [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Screening for gonococcal, chlamydial, and trichomonal infection is recommended as well. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4794.html" rel="external">"Syphilis in pregnancy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7596.html" rel="external">"Screening for sexually transmitted infections", section on 'Patients with HIV infection'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8632752"><span class="h2">Toxoplasma serologies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Congenital toxoplasmosis is a concern among pregnant individuals, but the seroprevalence varies based on geographic location. Toxoplasmosis titers are not routinely recommended for pregnant individuals in the United States because the prevalence is relatively low and the serology test must be performed in a reference laboratory. Thus, among those without HIV, evidence of acute infection is generally determined based on discovery of abnormal ultrasound findings [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Congenital toxoplasmosis causes intracranial calcifications and neurologic disability in the neonate. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6756.html" rel="external">"Toxoplasmosis and pregnancy"</a>.)</p><p>However, in the setting of HIV infection, documentation of maternal <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> serologic status should be obtained during pregnancy if not known previously. Suppressive therapy to prevent reactivation toxoplasmosis is indicated in patients with CD4 cell counts &lt;100 cells/microL and a positive <em>T. gondii</em> IgG. (See <a class="local">'TMP-SMX during pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with evidence of potential primary <em>Toxoplasma</em> infection during pregnancy or evidence of fetal infection should be referred to a maternal fetal medicine specialist for evaluation. Diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are administered during pregnancy for affected fetuses. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8632759"><span class="h2">Cytomegalovirus serologies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common congenital infection, with a birth prevalence of approximately 0.5 to 1 percent in the United States. It is the most common infectious cause of congenital hearing loss. While the majority of infected infants are asymptomatic, approximately 10 percent suffer major handicap or death and up to 25 percent develop sequelae later in life [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4810.html" rel="external">"Cytomegalovirus infection in pregnancy"</a>.)</p><p>It is unknown whether the fetuses of individuals with HIV infection are at higher risk for congenital infection. The majority of pregnant individuals with HIV (&gt;90 percent) have a history of CMV exposure [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>].

Although there are concerns regarding possible teratogenicity associated with systemic TMP-SMX exposures during the first trimester, the benefit of using TMP-SMX for chemoprophylaxis is generally thought to outweigh that theoretical risk [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]; these issues should be discussed with the patient. We use TMP-SMX for prevention of PCP and reactivation toxoplasmosis when indicated in pregnancy, regardless of gestational age.
