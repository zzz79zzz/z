          —
         </span>
         Breastfeeding (or, when necessary, feeding expressed breast milk) is recognized as the normative standard for virtually all infants because of its health benefits to infants and their mothers. There is broad consensus recommending exclusive breastfeeding for approximately the first six months and continued breastfeeding, along with the introduction of solid foods, for at least one year after birth, as long as it is mutually desired by mother and infant [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-5
         </a>
         ]. The World Health Organization recommends continued breastfeeding through at least the child's second birthday.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unfortunately, despite the strong recommendations, actual breastfeeding practice falls short of these goals in many countries and cultures. In the United States, more than 80 percent of mothers initiate breastfeeding, but less than 60 percent continue through six months postpartum and less than 40 percent are breastfeeding at 12 months [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Exclusive breastfeeding is practiced by less than one-half of mothers at three months postpartum and only one-quarter of mothers at six months. These observations call for collaboration among mothers, partners and families, communities, clinicians, health care facilities, and employers to actively support optimal breastfeeding [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Anticipatory guidance and ongoing counseling and education for mothers are discussed below. Detailed discussions of steps to initiate breastfeeding and address common problems of breastfeeding are presented separately. (See

          FACTORS IN PARENTAL INFANT FEEDING DECISIONS
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Mothers often make decisions about how they will feed their infant very early in pregnancy or before conceiving [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Understanding which factors affect parental decisions about infant feeding is essential to provide adequate education and support for families. In addition, an understanding of the common misconceptions and barriers that new mothers face and how to overcome them will facilitate counseling. Similarly, public resources and policy should be directed at addressing the common obstacles to breastfeeding in a population.

         <strong>
          Intention to breastfeed
         </strong>
         – Intention to breastfeed is a strong predictor of initiation and duration of breastfeeding [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-11
         </a>
         ]. Asking about intentions to breastfeed enables the clinician to provide extra counseling and support for those who are hesitant or undecided. Women are more likely to intend to breastfeed if they have prior successful experience with breastfeeding and if this decision is supported by their family and workplace. Women are less likely to intend to breastfeed if they face economic challenges (lower household income and/or need to return to work), have health problems or "hassles" during pregnancy, are pregnant with twins, are younger, and/or have limited access to health care [
         <a href="#rid12">

         <strong>
          Clinician advice
         </strong>
         – Receiving advice from a health care provider to breastfeed is associated with a higher incidence of breastfeeding initiation [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Moreover, routine ongoing support and guidance during antenatal and postnatal care are associated with longer duration of breastfeeding (exclusive and partial) [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. This support is optimally tailored to the setting and needs of the population and individual patient and may include a variety of professional or lay/peer counselors. However, breastfeeding advice is not universally provided, and when it is provided, it is not always consistent with recommendations to exclusively breastfeed [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>

         <strong>
          Common myths about breastfeeding
         </strong>
         – Several common myths about breastfeeding could hinder a mother's success [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17-19
         </a>
         ]. These include a perception that breastfeeding is inherently painful, that many mothers are unable to produce sufficient breast milk, and that infants have poor weight gain with breastfeeding. Addressing each of these concerns is an important component of counseling while the mother makes her decision about breastfeeding during the antenatal and perinatal periods. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Address common concerns'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>

         <strong>
          Attitudes and social norms
         </strong>
         – Attitudes and social norms play a large role in a mother's decision about whether to breastfeed and her overall breastfeeding success [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. This includes a mother's perception of whether or not it is acceptable to breastfeed in public. Mothers may need help feeling comfortable and empowered to feed their babies in public and may benefit from positive messages and learning strategies to maintain their desired level of modesty while doing so. Exposure to media images, advertising, and negative breastfeeding messages also influences a mother's initiation and continuation of breastfeeding [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21,22
         </a>

          Lost generations
         </strong>
         – In the late 1970's and early 80's in the United States, breastfeeding initiation rates were as low as 25 percent [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. This means that an entire generation of mothers, grandmothers, support people, and clinicians witnessed most mothers feeding formula to their infants and few mothers attempting breastfeeding. Now that the importance of breastfeeding is widely recognized [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ], mothers and families need further education about why breastfeeding is recommended and what to expect, and clinicians who trained during that time need to develop skills to support the breastfeeding mother, especially in the first days and weeks postpartum.

         <strong>
          Self-efficacy
         </strong>
         – Breastfeeding self-efficacy (a mother's confidence in her ability to breastfeed) is one of the strongest predictors of breastfeeding initiation and duration [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Strategies and counseling techniques are needed that serve to boost a mother's confidence both prenatally and early postpartum to help her successfully breastfeed from the start. Counseling can help the mother learn to trust her body, which just grew a precious infant, and learn ways to confirm that breastfeeding is going well and that her baby is getting enough nourishment.

         <strong>
          Marketing of infant formulas
         </strong>
         – Marketing of artificial breast milk substitutes (formulas) often has a negative influence on breastfeeding initiation [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. Marketing messages overtly or covertly intensify parents' anxieties and aspirations (eg, by claiming to solve common infant problems such as reflux or allergies), position formulas as close to or equivalent to breast milk, make health and nutrition claims based on marginal evidence, and encourage unnecessary use of toddler formula (after 12 months of age) [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26-28
         </a>
         ]. Marketing is accomplished through a variety of platforms that effectively promote formula feeding, including targeted digital marketing methods to consumers and various methods that influence health professionals [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. Countermeasures, such as professional education and baby-friendly hospital initiatives, are valuable but often insufficient. Marketing messages reach families in both low- and high-income countries, although the economic and structural drivers, market saturation and balance between marketing and countermeasures varies substantially [
         <a href="#rid25">

          Assess the mother's knowledge and concerns

         – To initiate counseling, it is helpful to start with an open-ended question such as "What have you heard about breastfeeding?" or "What are your thoughts about breastfeeding?" rather than asking "How do you plan to feed your baby?" The open-ended questions help to determine the mother's level of knowledge, comfort, and self-efficacy with breastfeeding, so that education may more resemble a conversation that is tailored to the mother's prior experiences and needs [

          Insufficient glandular tissue
         </strong>
         – While it is rare, some mothers have insufficient glandular tissue. The breasts tend to appear misshapen, somewhat triangular in appearance, widely-spaced, and "less full" between the areolar complex and the chest wall  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef129136" href="/z/d/graphic/129136.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). These women are at risk of being unable to establish a full milk supply, but the likelihood of successful breastfeeding cannot be fully predicted from the physical examination.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         For mothers with insufficient glandular tissue, the clinician should identify the problem to help manage her expectations and provide focused lactation counseling to optimize her chance of successful breastfeeding. This includes guidance to establish an effective latch from the very start and frequent expression of milk to maximize breast milk production. Even if a mother is unable to produce the quantity of milk needed for exclusive breastfeeding, it is likely that she can at least produce drops of colostrum, which have important health benefits for the baby. She can also have a breastfeeding relationship with her infant, offering suckling at the breast for comfort and possibly using a device that allows for supplementation at the breast while the infant is suckling.

         <strong>
          Other anatomic risk factors
         </strong>
         – Prenatal breast assessments are helpful to identify women with other anatomic conditions that may affect latching or milk supply, such as scar tissue, previous surgeries, or flat or inverted nipples  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51390" href="/z/d/graphic/51390.html" rel="external">

         ). It is difficult to predict whether these findings will interfere with breastfeeding. However, these mothers benefit from education and assistance during breastfeeding initiation to help them effectively feed their infants, remove milk frequently to help maximize their milk supply, achieve and sustain an effective latch, and avoid nipple trauma.

         ]. Contraindications may be permanent or temporary. In some cases, the infant may be fed expressed breast milk until it is safe to resume direct breastfeeding, as listed in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef129134" href="/z/d/graphic/129134.html" rel="external">

         Considerations for breastfeeding for a mother with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are discussed separately. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         If one of these contraindications exist, the clinician should educate and support the mother on how to feed her infant safely and effectively in another manner. If the suspension of breastfeeding is temporary, she will need to express milk and signal her breasts frequently with either a breast pump or hand expression in order to maintain her milk supply until she can return to breastfeeding. A mother who is not able to breastfeed often experiences a sense of disappointment and even guilt. The clinician can help by recognizing and validating those feelings as well as helping her explore other ways to nurture and bond with her infant. (See

         Most mothers produce enough milk for their infants if they have appropriate education and support. To optimize milk supply and promote direct breastfeeding, key goals are:

         Frequent feeding and emptying of the breast (including hand expression if needed) beginning immediately after birth and then at least 8 to 12 times in each 24-hour period until the breast milk supply is fully established

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         To achieve these goals, recommended practices include immediate skin-to-skin contact after birth, encouraging feeding in the first hour or two after birth and with every cue, 24-hour rooming-in with the infant to catch and respond to every feeding cue, working to achieve a comfortable position, and teaching an effective latch each time. Mothers should be encouraged to ask for help and hands-on assistance with positioning and troubleshooting problems such as nipple pain or if she has concerns that the baby is not feeding well. By observing a feeding and other clinical data, an experienced clinician can determine whether feeding and maternal milk supply are progressing as expected and provide appropriate guidance and reassurance. All new mothers should be taught techniques for hand expression of colostrum to provide signaling for her body in the case of a sleepy baby or if they are separated and to ensure optimal intake for the infant.

         Pain during breastfeeding is a common concern but usually can be addressed by making minor adjustments in the technique, particularly with regard to the angle that the infant approaches the breast. Pain is usually a signal that the baby is compressing or rubbing the nipple during suckling, which can impede milk flow. When a mother experiences pain during suckling, she should use a finger to help break the latch and reposition the baby, such that she and the baby are both comfortable. Pinching or rubbing the nipple during feeding can lead to more soreness and does not provide optimal signaling to mother's body. If the mother experiences pain while breastfeeding or latching the infant, even at the beginning of a latch, the clinician should directly observe breastfeeding and teach the mother techniques to achieve a good latch  (

         A newborn should eat at least eight times in 24 hours and more frequently if the baby is giving feeding cues. The feedings are not usually spaced out evenly throughout the day and night but rather may occur in "clusters" followed by "breaks" of up to four hours. It is common for a newborn to fall asleep at the breast because this is where they are most comfortable. To address this, the mother can try to arouse the infant by taking "burp breaks"; changing the diaper; or rubbing his or her head, back, arms, or feet. She can also encourage the infant to feed by using hand expression and breast compression.

         Most mothers make enough milk to feed their baby without need for any supplementation. Understanding the normal progression of lactation after delivery will help a mother to focus on steps to enhance lactation and shape her expectations about milk volume. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4986.html" rel="external">

         In the first few days after birth, breasts will feel the same as before while mothers are producing colostrum, which is measured in drops rather than ounces. Colostrum is very concentrated with antibodies and other nutrients and is all that the baby needs. Because the volumes are small, babies will need to eat frequently. Mothers should not expect to produce significant milk volume (ounces) until day 3 to 4 after birth.
        </p>

         In the meantime, there are established ways to tell whether the baby is receiving sufficient amounts of milk by monitoring his or her weight, input and output, behavior, and other findings on the physical examination:

         Breastfeeding mother-infant dyads should have frequent follow-up with a clinician until breastfeeding is well established. For those who appear to have effectively initiated breastfeeding in the hospital and have no risk factors for breastfeeding problems  (

          table 2
         </a>
         ), routine follow-up in the primary care office may be sufficient. The initial visit depends on the length of the birth hospitalization but usually should be within 24 to 48 hours after discharge. The timing of subsequent follow-up visits depends upon the infant's feeding and risk factors, such as prematurity or any other medical problems. Some infants may need to be seen one or more times again prior to the routine two-week visit. (See

         Patients with any problems with breastfeeding and/or poor infant weight gain should be seen more often and may benefit from professional breastfeeding assistance, such as a breastfeeding medicine clinician or a lactation consultant. (See

         Breastfeeding is well established when the infant has regained their birth weight, continues to gain weight well, and is cueing to feed appropriately; lactogenesis II has occurred; and the mother has no nipple pain or discomfort. Once these milestones are reached, follow-up can be performed in the form of check-ins about breastfeeding during routine well-child visits, with additional visits as needed should any problems arise.

         A small percentage of alcohol is transferred into breast milk. The amount of alcohol considered to be "safe" while breastfeeding is controversial. We suggest that a breastfeeding woman avoid exposing the infant to alcohol by waiting to nurse for two hours after a single serving of alcohol (12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof liquor). If a woman drinks more than this amount, she should refrain from breastfeeding for an additional two hours for each serving of alcohol [

          54
         </a>
         ]. It is not necessary to express and discard milk after consuming alcohol, unless the breasts become uncomfortably engorged before enough time has elapsed for the alcohol to leave her system. Heavy alcohol intake can impair judgement and child care abilities and should be avoided, regardless of how the infant is fed.

The infant should sleep in a separate sleep surface designed for infants, such as a crib or bassinet. Infants should never sleep in the adult bed or on a sofa, recliner, armchair, or other type of cushioned chair. Infants should always be placed supine for sleep. Due to exhaustion, it is not uncommon for mothers to fall asleep while feeding their infants. For this reason, if there is a risk of the mother falling asleep, feedings should occur in an adult bed (not a couch, sofa, or chair) without any pillows, blankets, or soft bedding and that the infant be returned to a nearby crib or bassinet when the mother awakens after the feeding, as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics [

         Mothers of late preterm infants (gestational age 34 to &lt;37 weeks) and some early term infants may need additional support to establish effective breastfeeding and an adequate milk supply. These infants, despite appearing "normal" and not needing intensive care, are immature and should not be expected to be "good breastfeeders" until they reach approximately 40 weeks gestational age. Their mothers often require assistance with strategies to empty the breasts frequently and effectively to ensure adequate intake and signaling by the mother's body to promote sufficient milk production. Details are discussed in a separate topic review. (See

         Multiples pose a challenge for new mothers as they both/all require frequent feedings and often are born early. Mothers may need extra help with positioning the infants at the breast and with general infant care. Tandem nursing (breastfeeding two infants simultaneously) may be awkward and difficult for mothers to achieve without assistance at first but can help with synching the feedings for the infants, so that the mother may rest between feedings. As long as both/all of the infants are going to the breast with every feeding cue, the mother's body will adapt and produce the amount of milk that it is signaled to do so.

         </span>
         All newborns develop jaundice to some extent, which is considered physiologic and may even be protective because bilirubin is a powerful antioxidant. The baseline levels of bilirubin in breastfed infants are higher than in those who are formula feeding; however, unless there is inadequate intake, breastfeeding alone does not cause the bilirubin to rise to pathologic levels.
        </p>
        <p>
         Early-onset pathologic jaundice has multiple potential causes, including hemolysis, infection, and underlying genetic disorders, and requires evaluation and management. Cessation of breastfeeding should only be considered in cases of extreme jaundice, in which the bilirubin levels come close to the threshold for an exchange transfusion. To reduce the risk of pathologic jaundice due to insufficient milk intake, all infants should receive optimal support of breastfeeding from birth to help ensure an adequate milk supply. Infants with jaundice should have focused feeding evaluations to ensure a comfortable, effective latch and milk transfer to ensure adequate intake. Unless there are signs of insufficient intake, infants who are breastfeeding should not require supplementation with anything other than mother's own milk [

         Similar to jaundice, most infants do not develop pathologic hypoglycemia. Measurement of infant blood glucose is recommended only for infants with risk factors for hypoglycemia, such as a diabetic mother, prematurity, or small for gestational age [

         It is possible for a mother who has lactated before to reestablish and maintain a milk supply. It is also possible, although more challenging, to induce lactation in people who have never lactated. Protocols for inducing lactation are not well studied but typically include both hormonal preparation and breast signaling (nipple stimulation) with pumping [
         <a href="#rid72">
          72-75
         </a>
         ]. The resulting milk production varies but is often sufficient to support at least partial breastfeeding.

         Induced lactation may be particularly valuable for adopting families [

         Some mothers encounter problems with establishing breastfeeding that are beyond their control. The clinician's role is to provide accurate information in a culturally sensitive manner, so that the mother is able to make a truly informed choice about breastfeeding and to identify and remove barriers to breastfeeding if possible [
         <a href="#rid82">
          82

        </p>
        <p>
         If the mother cannot or chooses not to breastfeed, the clinician should guide her toward a plan for feeding, bonding, and interacting with her infant that will be as close as possible to meeting her personal breastfeeding goals. This process will help to minimize her experience of guilt or shame and ensure that she and her infant are safe, healthy, and have every opportunity to bond and thrive.

         All lactating mothers need a technique to express milk, either by hand or with a manual or electric breast pump, in case they are ever separated from their infant. In general, maintenance of supply requires frequent signaling of the breasts, either with frequent feedings or with milk expression. Mothers should be instructed to pump at least once every time the infant does not drink directly from the breast or feeds anything other than her breast milk. If her supply is diminishing, increasing the frequency and amount of breastfeeding and/or milk expression for a day or two will usually increase the milk production within 24 to 48 hours, similar to when an infant feeds more frequently during a growth spurt. Further information on equipment and technique is discussed separately. (See

         Infant feeding recommendations are for exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months, followed by continued breastfeeding with the introduction of complementary foods for at least one year (or two years according to the World Health Organization). However, many mothers are unable to meet these targets [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. In the Infant Feeding Practices Study II, only 32.4 percent of mothers were able to meet their own personal feeding goals and most of those personal goals were shorter than the recommendations [

         This guidance should ideally be part of each routine visit while the mother is breastfeeding.

          Breastfeeding education
         </strong>
         – Routine ongoing support and guidance during antenatal and postnatal care is associated with longer duration of breastfeeding (exclusive and partial). This support is optimally tailored to the setting and needs of the population and individual patient and may include a variety of professional or lay/peer counselors. (See

         <strong>
          Initial assessment
         </strong>
         – During prenatal care or early postnatal visits, all mothers should have an initial assessment by a clinician with expertise in breastfeeding. This involves:

         Breast examination to identify anatomic differences in the breasts that may complicate breastfeeding, including flat or inverted nipples  (

          figure 1

          Contraindications to breastfeeding
         </strong>
         – There are very few contraindications to breastfeeding  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef129134" href="/z/d/graphic/129134.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). In some cases, the contraindication is temporary and the infant may be fed expressed breast milk until it is safe to resume direct breastfeeding. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Contraindications to breastfeeding'

         A common concern is that breastfeeding is inherently painful, which is not the case. "Tugging," "pressure," and an unfamiliar sensation are common. Nipple pain or compression are not normal and require immediate attention because they usually indicate that the latch is ineffective and that milk flow is impaired. The clinician should address this concern by observing a feeding and providing guidance and assistance during breastfeeding initiation to ensure proper technique, including an effective latch  (

         Counseling during breastfeeding initiation can also help with other common concerns, including feeding a sleepy baby, ensuring sufficient milk supply, and addressing maternal exhaustion  (

          Maternal medications

         <strong>
          Situations requiring additional attention
         </strong>
         – Early and focused guidance to optimize breastfeeding is particularly important for certain infants, including those born late, preterm, or early term; twins; or those with jaundice or hypoglycemia, as well as for mothers with risk factors for breastfeeding problems. The clinician should also be aware of the possibility of inducing lactation for a non-gestational parent, including adoptive parents, members of same-sex couples, or transgender and nonbinary people.

         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Long-term support to maintain breastfeeding
         </strong>
         – A majority of mothers do not meet targets for sustained breastfeeding, which are exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months followed by continued breastfeeding with complementary foods for at least one year. To help mothers come as close as possible to these goals, the clinician should ensure that the mother has an effective technique for breast milk expression in order to maintain her milk supply when she is unable to breastfeed directly and provide anticipatory guidance about strategies to continue breastfeeding while returning to work or other activities. (See
