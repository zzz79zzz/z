         Flexible bronchoscopy is a procedure that visualizes the lumen and mucosa of the trachea, proximal and distal airways. It can be used to diagnose or treat abnormalities within or adjacent to these airways.
        </p>
        <p>
         The indications and contraindications of flexible bronchoscopy are discussed in this topic. The equipment, procedure and complications of flexible, fluorescence, and rigid bronchoscopy as well as endobronchial ultrasound and transbronchial needle aspiration techniques are discussed in detail elsewhere.

         There are several diagnostic indications for flexible bronchoscopy. Common indications are discussed below  (

         <strong>
          Evaluation of pneumonia or infiltrate of unclear etiology
         </strong>
         – Flexible bronchoscopy can obtain specimens as part of the evaluation for an infectious, opportunistic, or alternative etiology.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In suspected pneumonia or infection, microbiological specimen can be collected with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or with bronchial washings via flexible bronchoscopy. Bronchoscopy is particularly helpful when pneumonia is suspected on the basis of an abnormal chest radiograph or CT scan with symptoms or signs of pneumonia (eg, fever, cough), but the patient cannot produce sputum for collection (eg, mycobacterial species) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The value of bronchoscopic sampling in patients who can produce sputum for analysis is controversial and uncertain. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4303.html" rel="external">
          "Basic principles and technique of bronchoalveolar lavage"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Flexible bronchoscopy is used routinely to obtain specimens when an abnormal infiltrate is seen in immunocompromised (eg, long term steroid use, patients on chemotherapy, HIV, transplant recipients) host to rule out opportunistic infections (eg, PCP or fungal infections). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4339.html" rel="external">
          "Pulmonary complications after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation: Causes", section on 'Pulmonary infections'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In the intensive care unit (ICU), bronchoscopy with a BAL is often done on patients who are found to have a persistent lung infiltrate that is not responsive to antibiotics to rule out the infectious process or the cause of any post obstructive pneumonia.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Bronchoscopy is also useful for patients with slow or incomplete resolution of presumed pneumonia, despite treatment (eg, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia). The evidence suggests that among the persistent infiltrates that are eventually definitively diagnosed, most can be diagnosed by bronchoscopy [
         <a href="#rid2">

          Diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection
         </strong>
         – Nasopharyngeal swab or saliva are considered the source specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although bronchoscopy is not recommended as the primary mode of diagnosis of COVID-19 [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ], limited evidence [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ] and our experience suggest a possible role of BAL to confirm COVID-19 infection when the nasopharyngeal swab or saliva specimen is negative for SARS-CoV-2 and the suspicion of COVID-19 is high based on the clinical and radiologic presentation. In addition, BAL can identify an alternate etiologic agent such as bacterial coinfection in 27 to 56 percent [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,6
         </a>
         ]. In a multicenter retrospective study of 79 consecutive inpatients, two patients with negative nasopharyngeal swabs were found to have significantly detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in BAL [
         <a href="#rid6">

         <strong>
          Persistent atelectasis
         </strong>
         – Flexible bronchoscopy is warranted in patients who have persistent atelectasis that is either of unknown cause or suspected of being due to airway obstruction. The atelectasis often develops in the lower lobes as a result of poor cough or mucus plugging. The purpose of bronchoscopy is to identify (eg, malignant endobronchial obstruction) or remove any obstructing lesion (eg, mucus plug, foreign body). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4387.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Centrally located lung masses or nodules
         </strong>
         – Flexible bronchoscopy is a reasonable approach for the evaluation of large centrally located parenchymal masses discovered with chest imaging [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Diagnostic specimens can be collected for cytopathological analysis by washing, brushing, BAL, or biopsy. The extent of extrinsic compression of the airway from the mass if present can also be assessed as well as direct sampling of peribronchial masses with transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) can be performed. Transbronchial biopsy, biopsy of peripheral nodules and use of cryobiopsy are discussed separately. (See

         <strong>
          Peripheral lung mass or nodules
         </strong>
         – Flexible bronchoscopy with fluoroscopic guidance, electromagnetic navigation guidance, or radial probe ultrasound guidance can be used to access and obtain diagnostic tissue from the peripheral lung nodules. With an ultrathin bronchoscope (a variation of the flexible bronchoscope with an outer diameter of 2.8 to 3.5 mm)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94870" href="/z/d/graphic/94870.html" rel="external">
          picture 1

         ) smaller peripheral airways can be accessed [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Because these bronchoscopes have a larger working channel (1.7 mm) unlike a pediatric bronchoscope, peripheral lung nodules or masses can be sampled with standard biopsy forceps or brushing. (See

          Mediastinal lymphadenopathy or masses
         </strong>
         – Transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) performed through a flexible bronchoscope is used to sample enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes or masses, potentially eliminating the need for mediastinoscopy. Endobronchial ultrasound guided TBNA is a less invasive alternative in staging of lung cancer in addition to diagnosis [

         <strong>
          Hemoptysis
         </strong>
         – Flexible bronchoscopy is indicated in hemoptysis to identify and localize the cause of bleeding to direct appropriate therapy [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. In mild or moderate hemoptysis, the bleeding may be controlled with local treatment using laser, APC, balloon tamponade, or selective occlusion of the suspected bronchus with a blockade catheter. Even if the source of bleeding cannot be identified, flexible bronchoscopy may localize the area of bleeding for angiographic embolization, or surgical resection [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Rigid bronchoscopy may be indicated in the management of massive hemoptysis that cannot be controlled with flexible bronchoscopy alone. (See

         <strong>
          Suspected airway obstruction
         </strong>
         – Airway obstruction may be expected on the basis of history (eg, aspiration), an abnormal physical examination finding (eg, focal wheezing or stridor), an abnormal pulmonary function test (eg, flattening of the inspiratory or expiratory limbs of the flow-volume loop) secondary to benign tracheal stenosis or malignant airway obstruction, or an abnormal radiographic finding (eg, focal hyperlucency on a chest radiograph suggesting postobstructive pneumonia). Flexible bronchoscopy is helpful in assessing the patency of the airways, confirming airway obstruction and identifying the cause. Ultrathin bronchoscopes  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94870" href="/z/d/graphic/94870.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ) can be used to examine the distal airways beyond a high grade obstruction without compromising the ventilation critically. (See

         <strong>
          Evaluation of stridor
         </strong>
         – Flexible bronchoscopy is performed in the evaluation of stridor to determine if any vocal cord lesion or tracheal stenosis is present. After reviewing the chest computed tomography (CT) scan findings, the location and extent of tracheal stenosis is identified with bronchoscopy to plan appropriate therapy. It is also performed when airway narrowing (trachea or proximal bronchi) is suspected on chest CT and the patient has a history of previous intubation or tracheostomy. (See

         – Flexible bronchoscopy is used to examine the mechanical properties of the airways. Bronchoscopic documentation of dynamic airway collapse under moderate sedation in suspected patients is the gold standard for diagnosing tracheomalacia, tracheobronchomalacia, or excessive dynamic airway collapse (EDAC). Flexible bronchoscopy is indicated to examine the extent of the process and to evaluate candidacy for surgical intervention [

          Bronchopleural fistula

         – When a post-lobectomy or postpneumonectomy patient develops a bronchopleural fistula, flexible bronchoscopy may be used to evaluate the integrity of the surgical stump and often to offer interventions such as endobronchial valve placement or closure [

         </a>
         ]. In contrast, bronchoscopy may not be helpful in identifying the exact location of a fistula following transbronchial lung biopsy, thoracentesis, or attempted central venous catheter insertion because the injury in these cases is most likely along the pleural surface and the bronchoscope cannot visualize the peripheral airways or lung. However, in persistent air leak, bronchoscopy is still indicated to localize the involved lobe or subsegment with the help of selective balloon inflation to direct further intervention such as endobronchial valve placement or surgical intervention.

          Tracheobronchial stents
         </strong>
         – Expandable metallic stents and certain hybrid (silicone/metallic) stents can be placed with the help of a flexible bronchoscope in the airways occluded by tumor or stricture. Often rigid bronchoscopy is better to debulk the tumor first before placement of the stents. The stents are most commonly placed in conjunction with ablative therapies or balloon bronchoplasty. Rigid bronchoscopy is required for silicone stent placement and removal. During follow up after stent placement, surveillance flexible bronchoscopy is used periodically to clean both metallic and silicone stents and rule out stent migration. (See

         Bronchoscopy is contraindicated in conditions where the potential for a complication is high, either from the procedure itself or from the associated sedation. Absolute contraindications for bronchoscopy are absent informed consent, severe refractory hypoxia with inability to maintain adequate oxygenation during the procedure, or malfunctioning equipment. The common complications of flexible bronchoscopy are tachycardia, bronchospasm, hypoxemia, or bleeding. Sedation and partial airway occlusion with the bronchoscope can lead to hypoxia even in normal subjects. The contraindications discussed here are applicable to flexible bronchoscopy, BAL, brushing, transbronchial needle aspiration, and endobronchial or transbronchial biopsy. (See

         A careful risk-benefit analysis prior to bronchoscopy is important to determine whether the information obtained from bronchoscopy will significantly influence the management decision. In certain circumstances, the risk factors may be optimized prior to the procedure to avoid any impending complications. For example, severe hypoxemia is a contraindication to bronchoscopy. However, a patient may be intubated specifically for bronchoscopy to minimize the risk of periprocedural hypoxemia at the known expense of exposing the patient to all the attendant complications of intubation and mechanical ventilation. The informed consent process should include a clear discussion of the available alternatives with possible outcomes and the risks. (See

         In most cases, bronchoscopic inspection of the airways, with or without BAL, may be safe but performing transbronchial biopsy, brushing or an advanced bronchoscopic intervention may be contraindicated to avoid a catastrophic outcome from asphyxia or bleeding. Specific contraindications of individual interventional procedures (eg, laser or stent placement) performed with flexible bronchoscopy are discussed separately. (See

         Patients considered at risk of decompensation during bronchoscopy include those with severe hypoxemia, current or recent myocardial ischemia, poorly controlled heart failure, significant hypotension or hypertension, exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pregnancy, bradycardia or tachycardia, and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Severe refractory hypoxia with inability to maintain adequate oxygenation during the procedure is a contraindication to bronchoscopy unless the bronchoscopic intervention is intended to relieve an obstruction or remove a foreign body that potentially could be therapeutic and can be done safely. An airway management plan should be in place before proceeding with bronchoscopy in such cases. Thus, nonemergent elective bronchoscopy should be avoided in patients who are currently having or have had any of the following events within the past six weeks: myocardial ischemia (ie, unstable angina, myocardial infarction), decompensated heart failure, an exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.

However, if an intervention is planned to treat the condition, bronchoscopy can and should be performed provided adequate pre-procedure planning is done to address any procedural complications. Limiting the duration of bronchoscopic examination or intervention will also permit adequate ventilation and oxygenation.

          Severe pulmonary hypertension
         </strong>
         – Bronchoscopy, and in particular, transbronchial biopsy, in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) is traditionally considered high risk. Risks include bleeding from transbronchial biopsy as well as hemodynamic compromise secondary to both sedation and increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure during bronchoscopy and possible requirement for mechanical ventilation post procedure. PH is defined as mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) ≥20 mmHg. This assessment is largely based upon clinical experience and the logic that capillary pressure is constantly elevated in this group. There is no absolute cut-off point in pulmonary pressure over which bronchoscopy becomes unsafe. However, in general, we prefer to avoid bronchoscopy in patients with untreated PH. (See

          Unstable or severe obstructive airways disease

         – Bronchoscopy to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage or transbronchial lung biopsy is usually safe in patients with stable obstructive airways disease (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], bronchiectasis). However, there is a potential for bronchospasm and/or drop in FEV
         <sub>

          47
         </a>
         ]. Premedication with nebulized bronchodilator and optimization of asthma control can minimize the risks of bronchospasm or hypoxia. Patients may benefit from CPAP or positive pressure ventilation during recovery from sedation. Transbronchial biopsy should be avoided in COPD patients with bullous disease due to the higher than usual risk of pneumothorax. Nonemergent elective bronchoscopy should be avoided in patients who are currently having or have had an exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the prior six weeks. Oxygen supplementation during bronchoscopy should be avoided or used with caution in those where the pre-bronchoscopy partial arterial pressure of carbon dioxide is raised. Some clinicians advocate spirometry followed by arterial blood gas analysis (in those found to have a forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV

          Hemodynamic instability and myocardial ischemia
         </strong>
         – Systemic cardiovascular effects of bronchoscopy include increased mean systemic pressure, increased cardiac index, and decreased oxygenation. Consequently, bronchoscopy should be avoided in patients with acute ongoing myocardial ischemia and elective bronchoscopy should be deferred for six weeks after an acute myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina. In addition, bronchoscopy should not be performed in patients with severe hypertension/hypotension or uncontrolled rhythm disturbances (tachycardia/bradycardia) in the outpatient setting.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         However, major complications are uncommon such that when clinically indicated and the benefits outweigh the risk, a recent myocardial infarction should not always preclude bronchoscopy particularly when results/therapies might significantly impact the management (eg, massive hemoptysis, pre-cardiac transplant evaluation for infection). In a retrospective study of bronchoscopy to evaluate suspected pneumonia in 21 patients with acute MI in a coronary care unit, it was found to be safe [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49

We prefer a minimum platelet count of 30,000/microL to perform a bronchoscopy for inspection or BAL and at least 50,000/microL to perform any other elective diagnostic procedures. In patients with thrombocytopenia or those at risk for bleeding, we avoid nasal insertion and prefer to insert the bronchoscope orally to minimize the risk of epistaxis from scope trauma. However, in cases of emergency, the decision to perform bronchoscopy should be individualized and will depend on the skills and experience of the operator.

         Bronchoscopy is an aerosol-generating procedure and may expose the bronchoscopist or other health care workers to potential infection. Initial guidelines from North America and Europe recommended delaying or avoiding elective bronchoscopy in COVID-19-positive patients or in patients with unknown COVID-19 status [

          3,59-61

          59,60

         Testing prior to bronchoscopy – Although specific guidelines for bronchoscopy or aerosol-generating procedures are yet to be updated, we believe an elective bronchoscopy should not be delayed for more than two weeks after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in asymptomatic patients, provided that the indication for bronchoscopy is still present. A repeat SARS-CoV-2 or negative test is not mandatory [

         A SARS-CoV-2 test (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] or antigen based) prior to bronchoscopy or within 72 hours of scheduled elective bronchoscopy, in addition to screening for symptoms or exposure history, should be performed. Targeted SARS-CoV-2 testing in patients to identify asymptomatic or presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection can further reduce the risk for exposure during the bronchoscopy, in addition to the use of universal personal protective equipment (PPE) and infection control in health care settings.

         Timing – Flexible bronchoscopy can be performed emergently (on the same day) in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, if deemed therapeutic (such as in mucus plug impaction or central airway obstruction from tumor or foreign body causing acute respiratory distress), and for evaluation of moderate or massive hemoptysis. Bronchoscopy should be performed urgently (within one to three days) in immunocompromised cases with persistent infiltrate or in lung transplant patients with clinical decline, where bronchoscopy with BAL or biopsy can guide appropriate therapy.

         Bronchoscopic evaluation of lung mass or mediastinal adenopathy for diagnosis and staging in suspected malignancy is crucial and may be delayed for two to three weeks in SARS-CoV-2-positive patient.

         A comprehensive stratified approach to delay bronchoscopy is described [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>

         Procedure – For patients considered infectious, all bronchoscopies should be done in a negative-pressure room to minimize droplet spread. The risk of aerosolization can be further reduced if the patient is intubated for the procedure or is already on mechanical ventilation (eg, intensive care unit [ICU]). If a negative-pressure room is not readily available, a portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration system can be placed in the room to filter pathogens [

          63,64

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In SARS-CoV-2-positive cases, the bronchoscopy is preferable under deep sedation or general anesthesia with a short-acting paralytic to minimize cough reflex.

         PPE – The rate of healthcare worker exposure in this population is unknown. Nonetheless, in the absence of full powered air purifying respirator (PAPR), we recommend wearing an N-95 mask with a face shield, cap, impermeable gown with gloves, knee-high shoe covers, and follow strict donning and doffing of PPE to avoid cross contamination. Restricting the number of personnel in the room is also important as most procedures can be done with two health care personnel (bronchoscope operator and an assistant). A nurse can administer and monitor sedation remotely in the ICU where the sedation can be administered from outside using a long intravenous tubing. Additionally, if the procedure is performed in the bronchoscopy suite, an anesthesiologist or a nurse (or both) may need to be present. Similar precautions should be observed during the preprocedure evaluation and recovery.

         Equipment – Use of disposable bronchoscopes, if available, can minimize the risk of cross contamination and avoid exposure to health care personnel, especially during the cleaning. Although routine procedures such as a BAL can be performed easily with disposable scopes, they are not as robust and procedures other than BAL may require a regular non-disposable flexible bronchoscope. The bronchoscopy tower with monitor can be covered in plastic wrap and cleaned thoroughly with standard high-level disinfectants. Precautions are needed for specimen handling according to local infection control protocols. All specimens acquired are placed in a double biohazard bag and handled using double gloves.

Although the older adult population had a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class compared with the younger group there was no significant difference in complication rates, diagnostic yield or indications between the two groups suggesting that the flexible bronchoscopy is safe among those older than 85 years old compared with the younger cohort [

         The value of prophylactic antibiotics in patients who typically require them for other procedures is unknown. Some clinicians advocate for their use in patients who are asplenic, have a mechanical heart valve prosthesis, or who have a history of endocarditis [
         <a href="#rid73">
          73
         </a>
         ]. In some patients with artificial prosthesis (eg, hip or knee replacement), some clinicians use prophylactic antibiotic to prevent a transient bacteremia and potential seeding of the prosthetic with bacteria. However, the value of the practice is of unclear benefit.

         Inability to obtain an informed consent is an absolute contraindication to an elective procedure. Intolerance of sedation, due to compromised respiratory status requires specialized planning, such as general anesthesia with supported ventilation. Other relative contraindications include an inability to cooperate with the procedure or malfunctioning equipment. We generally avoid flexible bronchoscopy in those with an unstable cervical spine, unless the spine is stabilized. For those with temporomandibular joint dysfunction who cannot open their oral orifice wide enough for insertion of the scope, a small bronchoscope can be easily inserted through the nasal orifices.

         Common diagnostic indications for bronchoscopy include the evaluation of pneumonia or infiltrates of unclear etiology as well as the evaluation of hemoptysis, sampling of lung masses, nodules, or mediastinal lymph nodes to diagnose malignancy, the evaluation and diagnosis of endobronchial foreign bodies, tracheoesophageal fistula, tracheobronchomalacia, and endobronchial lacerations, and the evaluation of cough and airway complications of artificial airways.

         Common therapeutic uses include the removal of excess mucus or foreign body from the airways; endotracheal tube placement in difficult airways; endoluminal tumor debulking with laser, APC, cryotherapy, or electrocautery; balloon bronchoplasty; surveillance of tracheobronchial stents; bronchial thermoplasty; or endobronchial valve placement.

         Absolute contraindications for bronchoscopy are absent informed consent (for an elective procedure), severe refractory hypoxia with inability to maintain adequate oxygenation during the procedure, or malfunctioning equipment. Other contraindications to flexible bronchoscopy include those at risk of respiratory and cardiovascular decompensation as well as those at risk of bleeding during bronchoscopy. (See

         Urgent bronchoscopy can be done safely in COVID-19 patients with full powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) or appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and infection control in a negative-pressure room. Elective bronchoscopy can be performed two to three weeks after a SARS-CoV-2-positive test in asymptomatic patients. (See

         Specific contraindications to flexible bronchoscopy include those with severe hypoxemia (but responsive to increasing fraction of inspired oxygen), exacerbation of asthma, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe pulmonary hypertension, current or recent myocardial ischemia, poorly controlled heart failure, life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. (See

         Flexible bronchoscopy is also contraindicated in those patients who are at risk of bleeding including those on anticoagulants or who have a coagulopathy that cannot be reversed, patients with renal insufficiency, and occasionally those with superior vena cava syndrome. (See

         Flexible bronchoscopy is a high risk procedure in select populations, but can be performed safely with certain provisions. As examples, flexible bronchoscopy can be performed in patients with raised intracranial pressure preferably under deep sedation or general anesthesia. Non-emergent bronchoscopy should be delayed in pregnancy until after delivery or at least after 28 weeks of gestation but can be performed for emergent indications preferably under general anesthesia. Additional precautions should be considered in those on mechanical ventilation, in those with large anterior mediastinal masses, and in older adults. (See
