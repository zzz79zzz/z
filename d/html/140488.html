         TM refers to diffuse or segmental weakness of the tracheal wall resulting in abnormal airway narrowing. It can be further subcategorized as cartilaginous TM (limited to the anterior or lateral wall) or circumferential TM (involves anterior, posterior, and lateral walls).

         Our approach to the management of TM is shown in the algorithm  (

         For patients with TM who are asymptomatic, even if TM is severe, we suggest observation rather than an intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
         We typically follow patients clinically (eg, every 6 to 12 months). At every visit, we inquire about newly developed symptoms, such as cough, dyspnea, or recurrent infections. We may also periodically perform pulmonary function tests (PFTs) with flow volume loop (FVL) assessment (eg, every year) and dynamic airway computed tomography (DACT; eg, every one to two years in those older than 60 years), particularly in those with severe TM. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4406.html" rel="external">
          "Tracheomalacia in adults: Clinical features and diagnostic evaluation", section on 'Clinical manifestations'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         If patients develop symptoms attributable to TM, we repeat PFT with FVL assessment and DACT (if not recently performed) and then proceed to dynamic flexible bronchoscopy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4406.html" rel="external">
          "Tracheomalacia in adults: Clinical features and diagnostic evaluation", section on 'Diagnostic approach'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The rationale for observation is that in most adult patients, TM is progressive, although some patients may progress slowly or not at all [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-5
         </a>
         ]. In a series of 17 patients with TM who underwent repeat bronchoscopy, worse airway narrowing was detected in 76 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. A larger series followed 94 patients with TM, tracheobronchomalacia (TBM), or bronchomalacia (BM) for an average of 5.2 years [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Among the 36 patients who underwent repeat bronchoscopy, most patients had worse disease, some had stable disease, and none improved. Six of the nine patients with TM progressed to TBM while all five patients with BM progressed to TBM [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5

          algorithm 1

         ). For all patients with TM who are symptomatic, we optimize therapy for any underlying contributing disorder (eg, lung disease, gastroesophageal reflux  (

          'Initial medical therapy in all patients'

         For patients with TM who have a coexisting contributing disorder, we optimize therapy for the underlying disorder if feasible  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73937" href="/z/d/graphic/73937.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The rationale for this approach is that patients with coexisting lung disorders, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, can improve if their medical regimen is optimized, by decreasing the degree of bronchospasm and large pressure swings in the thorax that worsen the collapse of the central airways. Similarly, treatment of inflammation due to gastroesophageal reflux and relapsing polychondritis may improve symptoms and slow the progression of TM. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1447.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         The ideal duration for medical optimization is unknown, but we generally trial medical therapy for approximately four to eight weeks and then re-evaluate symptoms [

         Several adjunctive therapies may be used in conjunction with treatment of the underlying disorder. Although clinicians use these therapies, there is little evidence for their benefit [

         Breathing techniques – All patients with moderate or severe TM should be educated in the pursed lip breathing (PLB) technique. PLB is a breathing technique that consists of exhaling through tightly pressed lips and inhaling through the nose with the mouth closed. The purpose of this technique is to create pressure inside the airways, thereby extending expiration time, producing a pneumatic split during exhalation, and decreasing the work of breathing.

         Airway clearance techniques – Retained secretions are an important cause of recurrent infections, airway obstruction, and airway/lung injury. Thus, in those with sputum retention, we typically use airway oscillatory devices (eg, flutter valve  (

While some experts skip a stent trial, in our experience, approximately 75 percent of patients with severe TM who undergo a stent trial experience subjective and/or objective improvement and 65 percent will ultimately undergo definitive surgery. In addition, a stent trial also provides objective evidence to help distinguish symptoms due to TM from symptoms due to the underlying disorder, thereby supporting the value of a stent trial before proceeding with central airway stabilization surgery.

         For most patients with severe TM whose primary symptom is dyspnea and in whom initial medical therapy has failed, we suggest performing a stent trial rather than proceeding directly to central airway stabilization surgery. The purpose of a tracheal stent trial is to assess whether symptoms are likely to improve with surgery, since surgery is extensive, has a high morbidity, and requires significant expertise, which is not universally available.

          Rationale
         </strong>
         – The purpose of a stent trial is to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from surgical central airway stabilization (eg, tracheobronchoplasty [TBP]), which is extensive surgery that has a high morbidity and requires significant expertise. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Central airway stabilization surgery'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         There are no predictors that determine who benefits from a stent trial.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Long-term stents are not an ideal long-term solution given the rate of complications in this patient population. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Long-term stent'

         <strong>
          Stent selection
         </strong>
         – Several stents are available (eg, Y-silicone stent or uncovered self-expanding metallic stents [USEMAS]  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58596" href="/z/d/graphic/58596.html" rel="external">

         )).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         USEMAS are our preferred stent for short stent trials since they have several advantages, including easy placement by flexible bronchoscopy, dynamic expansion, and preservation of mucociliary function. However, long-term use of USEMAS is not recommended for benign airway obstruction as they have a black box warning against their use in the treatment of benign airway disease.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For patients with a large tracheal airway diameter of &gt;20 mm (eg, tracheomegaly), we use a silicone stent since other stents cannot fit properly to adequately assess response. (See

         For symptomatic patients with severe TM who subjectively and objectively improve following stent insertion and who are surgical candidates, we suggest central airway stabilization surgery rather than alternative treatments (eg, positive pressure ventilation, long term stenting, tracheostomy). This generally requires referral to a center with significant experience in airway surgery since expertise is not universal. We consider surgery the only option for definitive therapy leading to long term relief of symptoms and prevention of complications. In rare cases, we use noninvasive positive pressure ventilation to facilitate pulmonary rehabilitation and improve candidacy for surgery. (See

          Open tracheobronchoplasty (TBP)

         – TBP encompasses surgical splinting of the posterior wall of the trachea, mainstem bronchi, and bronchus intermedius with polypropylene mesh [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. When an open approach is used, a right posterolateral thoracotomy is used to access both the thoracic trachea and bilateral bronchi. Polypropylene mesh is sutured to the posterior membranous wall and anchored to the cartilaginous edges of the trachea and bronchi. The sutures are placed in a partial-thickness fashion, resulting in a posterior splint that is entirely external to the airway lumen. This splint reconstitutes a C-shape to the tracheal cartilage and prevents the posterior membrane from intruding into the lumen  (

         TBP is extensive, involving trachea and mainstem bronchi to the level of the bronchus intermedius, even if disease is anatomically limited. The rationale for this approach is that if treatment is limited to the affected airway only, the disease may progress in the future to untreated segments, resulting in recurrent symptoms.

          Tracheal resection and reconstruction
         </strong>
         – Conventional tracheal resection and reconstruction are utilized in cases of short-segment focal malacia, most commonly in the cervical trachea (eg, 4 cm). Tracheal resection and reconstruction have low morbidity and mortality in experienced hands and provide curative relief without the need for multiple endoscopic interventions. However, like any resection of the trachea, it can have the unintended consequence of renarrowing the trachea (ie, tracheal stenosis). Tracheal resection techniques and their complications are described separately. (See

         For patients who objectively improve following stent insertion but who decline surgery or are poor surgical candidates, options are limited. We generally apply intermittent noninvasive positive airway pressure (PAP) before considering long-term stenting (ie, silicone stents). In patients with TM who are not surgical candidates, have an existing stoma, and do not require PAP for ventilatory failure, a Montgomery T-tube may be an option. Tracheostomy is reserved for patients with TM who have respiratory failure requiring positive pressure ventilation.

         Noninvasive PAP, typically continuous PAP (CPAP), can maintain an open airway and facilitate secretion drainage [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23-25
         </a>
         ]. In patients who also have hypercapnic respiratory failure due to TM, we use bilevel PAP (BPAP). We do not typically use automatically adjusting PAP (APAP) unless it is clear that the set minimum pressure provides adequate support for TM. Notably, the indication for PAP is maintenance of airway patency rather than ventilation.
        </p>
        <p>
         In practice CPAP or BPAP is often initiated in the hospital during an acute illness but may be initiated as an outpatient. We prefer bronchoscopic titration to find the optimal pressure that adequately treats TM. Bronchoscopic titration is performed during dynamic flexible bronchoscopy while a PAP facial mask is applied; a flexible bronchoscope is introduced into the airway and PAP pressures are increased until airway collapse is &lt;70 percent or a pressure of 16 cm H
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         O is reached. If bronchoscopic titration is not feasible, we start CPAP at 8 cm H
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         O and titrate up according to symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         We prefer that the patient initially receive CPAP 24 hours per day. We then gradually transition to intermittent CPAP as tolerated (often at night during sleep, with pursed lip breathing during the day). Newer light-weight devices are commercially available that can deliver noninvasive ventilation during ambulation, although they are poorly studied in this population.

         There are several types of long-term airway stents available for treating patients with TM  (

          table 3
         </a>
         ). We prefer a custom-designed silicone Y-shaped stent for the chronic management of TM. The custom-design helps to reduce pressure points and decrease the risk of granulation tissue. Although their insertion requires rigid bronchoscopy and general anesthesia, they are easily repositioned and removed and migration occurs less frequently when compared with tubular silicone stents. Due to a high incidence of stent-related complications in this population, we follow these patients closely both clinically and bronchoscopically.
        </p>
        <p>
         USEMAS are a poor choice for the long-term treatment of TM. This is because they cannot be easily removed and, compared with silicone stents, long-term USEMAS are more frequently associated with major complications, including stenosis and stent fracture  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75119" href="/z/d/graphic/75119.html" rel="external">

         ), which can obstruct and perforate the airway, respectively. As a consequence, the US Food and Drug Administration has issued a black box warning regarding their long-term use for benign airway disease [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,27

         Data that support the value of silicone stenting as long-term therapy for patients with TM are limited. Several case series report improvements in symptoms and functional class, but complications are frequent and seen in more than 80 percent [

          12,14

         A Montgomery T-tube is a type of stent. It has a narrow tube that connects at a right angle to a larger tube, forming the shape of the letter T  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef135123" href="/z/d/graphic/135123.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). The narrow tube passes from the tracheal lumen through a cervical stoma, similar to a standard tracheostomy tube. The larger tube functions like a straight tubular tracheal stent, extending both superiorly and inferiorly to the stoma. The inferior aspect of the larger tube can extend into the thoracic trachea  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef106750" href="/z/d/graphic/106750.html" rel="external">
          picture 4
         </a>
         ). The airflow during breathing is through the lumen of the larger tube and the larynx if the narrow tube is capped externally. In contrast, the airflow is through both the narrow tube and the larynx if the narrow tube is uncapped.
        </p>
        <p>
         Occasionally, a silicone tracheal Y-shaped tube (TY-tube) is used for long-term stenting in patients with diffuse TBM who are not surgical candidates, have an existing stoma, and do not require PAP. A TY-tube is particularly suited to patients with malacia in the cervical or upper thoracic trachea.

         Tracheostomy is reserved for patients with TM who have coexisting respiratory failure requiring positive pressure ventilation. Even if the TM is diffuse, tracheostomy may be beneficial as a route to deliver PAP. Tracheostomy is a treatment of last resort since it can worsen TM by destroying the tracheal cartilage and weakening the tracheal wall. It can also induce stenosis which may co-exist with TM  (

        <p>
         Tracheostomy tubes can be used as a therapy in patients with short-segment TM since they can bypass the abnormal tracheal segment and splint the abnormal airway open. Longer segments of TM may require longer tracheostomy tubes.

At every visit, we inquire about newly developed symptoms, such as cough, dyspnea, or recurrent infections. We also perform periodic pulmonary function testing with flow volume loop assessment (eg, every year) and dynamic airway CT (eg, every one to two years in patients &gt;60 years). The rationale for observation is that in most adult patients, TM is progressive. (See

          Central airway stabilization
         </strong>
         – For most patients who improve following stent insertion, we suggest central airway stabilization surgery rather than other alternative therapy (eg, positive airway ventilation, long-term stenting) (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Tracheobronchoplasty is the definitive operative technique used for most patients  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53691" href="/z/d/graphic/53691.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>
         and
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62393" href="/z/d/graphic/62393.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         ), although tracheal resection with reconstruction may be an option in patients with focal, short-segment TM. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Central airway stabilization surgery'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent3">
         Surgery is the only option for definitive cure, and it may provide long term relief of symptoms and prevent complications, although data are limited and the morbidity is high. Referral to a center with significant surgical experience is necessary since expertise is not universal.

         <strong>
          Alternatives
         </strong>
         – For patients who improve following stent insertion, but are not surgical candidates or decline surgery, we generally apply intermittent noninvasive positive airway pressure (PAP) before considering long-term stenting (ie, silicone stents). In patients with TM who are not surgical candidates, have an existing stoma, and do not require PAP for ventilatory failure, Montgomery T-tube  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef135123" href="/z/d/graphic/135123.html" rel="external">

         ) may be an option. Tracheostomy is reserved for patients with TM who have respiratory failure requiring positive pressure ventilation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Alternatives'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Patients who do not improve with stenting
         </strong>
         – For patients who do not improve after a stent trial, we perform additional diagnostic workup to help identify an alternative cause for the patient's symptoms. (See
         <a class="local">
          'No improvement with stent'

         <strong>
          Patients not suitable for stent trial
         </strong>
         – In patients who are not suited to a stent trial, our approach is the following (see
         <a class="local">
          'Patient not suited to a stent trial'

         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         For patients with mild to moderate TM or patients with isolated bronchial disease distal to the central airways  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104076" href="/z/d/graphic/104076.html" rel="external">
          figure 3
         </a>
         ), we do not perform a stent trial since airway surgery will not be helpful or feasible. We continue medical therapy.
        </p>
        <p>

         For patients with severe TM, whose primary symptom is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         dyspnea, we do not perform a stent trial since it is unlikely to be helpful in determining the potential response to surgery. Treatment is individualized depending upon the reason, but options include persisting with medical therapy or proceeding with surgery without stent trial data.

         In patients with severe tracheomegaly (eg, Mounier-Kuhn syndrome), a large enough stent may not be available such that some experts do not perform a stent trial and proceed directly to central airway stabilization surgery.

         <strong>
          Prognosis
         </strong>
         – For patients with mild symptoms, the prognosis is generally favorable and the disease may progress at a rate that minimally impacts life expectancy. Similarly, for those who undergo successful surgical repair, the outcome is generally good. For those with severe TM who are not surgical candidates, the prognosis is more guarded since therapy is more limited in this population.
