The patient’s distress comes primarily from an unfounded fear of having a disease rather than physical symptoms, and persists despite appropriate physical examination and laboratory testing that are negative. Physical symptoms are not present, or they are minimal and often represent a misperception of normal bodily sensations. Illness anxiety disorder is usually chronic. The American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder conceptually overlaps with the prior Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), diagnosis of hypochondriasis [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, assessment, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder. Treatment and prognosis of illness anxiety disorder, and the clinical features, medical evaluation, and treatment of somatization are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16260.html" rel="external">"Illness anxiety disorder: Treatment and prognosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/109552.html" rel="external">"Somatic symptom disorder: Epidemiology and clinical presentation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/112997.html" rel="external">"Somatic symptom disorder: Assessment and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/110022.html" rel="external">"Somatic symptom disorder: Treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H44384494"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY AND DSM-5-TR</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Illness anxiety disorder is a diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef104206" href="/z/d/graphic/104206.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) that was introduced with publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) in 2013 [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The diagnostic criteria remained the same with publication of the DSM-5-TR in 2022 [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The clinical features and diagnostic criteria are discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation'</a> below and <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Illness anxiety disorder was derived in part from the diagnosis of hypochondriasis, which was eliminated from DSM-5/DSM-5-TR [<a href="#rid1">1,3</a>]. In DSM-5/DSM-5-TR, patients previously diagnosed with hypochondriasis are nearly always diagnosed with either somatic symptom disorder (if physical complaints are prominent) or illness anxiety disorder (if physical complaints are minimal or nonexistent). Although relatively few studies of illness anxiety disorder have been published, there is a larger literature on the symptom of health anxiety, defined as persistent unrealistic worry or conviction about having an illness. The spectrum of health anxiety ranges from none to severe, with the severe end representing a clinical endpoint (such as illness anxiety disorder or hypochondriasis) [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>].</p><p>In the DSM-IV-TR, the term hypochondriasis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68413" href="/z/d/graphic/68413.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) described patients who misinterpreted one or more bodily symptoms and believed that they had a serious disease or were preoccupied with fear of a disease, despite appropriate medical evaluation and reassurance [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Both the DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of hypochondriasis and the DSM-5/DSM-5-TR diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder include patients who believe that they have a serious disease or are preoccupied with fear of a disease, despite a normal physical examination, negative tests, and reassurance [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>].</p><p>Among patients previously diagnosed with hypochondriasis, it is estimated that approximately 75 percent are subsumed under the DSM-5/DSM-5-TR diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder and 25 percent under the DSM-5/DSM-5-TR diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder [<a href="#rid1">1,3</a>]. Support for these estimates include a retrospective study of patients who initially received a DSM-IV diagnosis of hypochondriasis (n = 58); post-hoc application of DSM-5/DSM-5-TR criteria found that 76 percent met criteria for somatic symptom disorder and 24 percent met criteria for illness anxiety disorder [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Additional information about somatic symptom disorder, including its diagnostic criteria, is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/109552.html" rel="external">"Somatic symptom disorder: Epidemiology and clinical presentation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/112997.html" rel="external">"Somatic symptom disorder: Assessment and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>DSM-5/DSM-5-TR includes illness anxiety disorder in the category called somatic symptom and related disorders, which are diagnoses characterized by prominent somatic concerns, distress, and impaired functioning [<a href="#rid1">1,3</a>]. Patients with somatic symptom and related disorders typically present to primary care clinicians and general medical specialists rather than psychiatrists. Additional information about somatic symptom and related disorders is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/109552.html" rel="external">"Somatic symptom disorder: Epidemiology and clinical presentation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/112997.html" rel="external">"Somatic symptom disorder: Assessment and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>Hypochondriasis remains a diagnosis in the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases, 11<sup>th</sup> Revision (ICD-11) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The essential feature of the ICD-11 diagnosis is a persistent preoccupation with having at least one serious general medical illness. In addition, patients manifest either excessive health-related behaviors (eg, frequently checking oneself for signs of the illness), or avoidance behavior related to one’s health, such as avoiding medical appointments. Clinically significant distress is present or functioning (eg, social or occupational) is impaired.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7947228"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prevalence of illness anxiety disorder is largely unknown because it was introduced as a diagnosis in the DSM-5, which was published in 2013 [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The diagnostic criteria remained the same with publication of the DSM-5-TR in 2022 [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Illness anxiety disorder was derived in part from the diagnosis of hypochondriasis, which was eliminated from DSM-5/DSM-5-TR. It is estimated that among individuals who were diagnosed with hypochondriasis, approximately 33 percent would qualify for a diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In addition, the prevalence of illness anxiety disorder can be estimated from studies of individuals with symptoms of health anxiety (persistent unrealistic worry or conviction about having an illness), which is a broad construct that exists along a continuum and presumably has a greater prevalence than illness anxiety disorder. (See <a class="local">'Terminology and DSM-5-TR'</a> above.)</p><p>The estimated prevalence of illness anxiety disorder depends upon the study sample and setting, and it is thought that illness anxiety disorder/health anxiety presents far more often in general medical clinics than other settings [<a href="#rid1">1,3,10</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>General medical outpatients</strong> – The prevalence of illness anxiety disorder in medical outpatients (eg, family practice and primary care) is approximately 0.75 percent, based upon a pooled analysis of 12 studies that found the prevalence of hypochondriasis was 3 percent [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Symptoms of health anxiety (unrealistic fears about illness) occur in approximately 5 to 30 percent of ambulatory medical patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Community dwelling adults</strong> – A pooled analysis of seven community surveys found that the prevalence of hypochondriasis in the general population was 0.4 percent, suggesting that the prevalence of illness anxiety disorder is approximately 0.1 percent [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. In a different set of seven community surveys, symptoms of health anxiety occurred in 2 to 13 percent of community adults.</p><p></p><p>Age of onset for illness anxiety disorder is not known. Hypochondriasis is most common in early adulthood and rarely begins after the age of 50 years [<a href="#rid2">2,12</a>]. Health anxiety occurs across the lifespan but appears to be more common between ages 35 to 64 years [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Illness anxiety disorder is uncommon in children and it can be difficult to separate the child’s anxiety from the parent’s [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>Hypochondriasis and health anxiety occur in males and females in approximately a one-to-one ratio and are not associated with marital status [<a href="#rid8">8,13,15</a>]. Health anxiety is more common in the unemployed than the working population [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Hypochondriasis and health anxiety are more common in less educated patients and often accompanied by disability [<a href="#rid13">13,15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7947235"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pathogenesis of illness anxiety disorder is not known. However, some inferences can be drawn from studies of hypochondriasis and the symptom of health anxiety (persistent unrealistic worry or conviction about having an illness). Psychosocial etiologies of hypochondriasis and health anxiety have been examined more than biological causes.</p><p>Illness anxiety disorder is a diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef104206" href="/z/d/graphic/104206.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) that was introduced with publication of the DSM-5 in 2013 [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The diagnostic criteria remained the same with publication of the DSM-5-TR in 2022 [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The disorder was derived in part from the diagnosis of hypochondriasis, which was eliminated from DSM-5/DSM-5-TR. It is estimated that among individuals who were diagnosed with hypochondriasis, approximately 25 percent would qualify for a diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder. In addition, the pathogenesis of illness anxiety disorder can be inferred from studies of individuals with symptoms of health anxiety (persistent unrealistic worry or conviction about having an illness). (See <a class="local">'Terminology and DSM-5-TR'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3712854"><span class="h2">Psychosocial</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among the different psychosocial theories that describe how patients develop hypochondriasis, the cognitive-behavioral model has empirical support and leads to effective treatment [<a href="#rid4">4,16</a>]. In this model, the disorder is characterized by excessive and persistent anxiety about threats to one’s health [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. The anxiety is due to normal body sensations that are perceived as abnormally intense and misattributed to serious medical disease, leading the patient to seek assurance of good health. In addition, the way people interpret and react to naturally occurring, intrusive thoughts about illness appears to create vulnerability for developing illness anxiety disorder [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>In the cognitive-behavioral model, risk factors for hypochondriasis, and likely for illness anxiety disorder, include dysfunctional assumptions about the prevalence and communicability of severe illnesses, the meaning of bodily symptoms, and the course and treatment of illnesses [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. As an example, patients may believe that good health is a symptom-free state, or overestimate their vulnerability to developing disease [<a href="#rid16">16,20,21</a>]. The dysfunctional assumptions may stem from early family experiences and childhood illness. Abnormal illness behavior in parents (eg, their own high health anxiety or excessive worry about illness in their children), as well as a child's exposure to serious parental illness, appears to increase the risk of somatic symptom disorders in adulthood [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>].</p><p>An event, such as reading about an illness or hearing about the illness of an acquaintance or celebrity, can activate dysfunctional assumptions and lead to excessive illness anxiety. Patients may increasingly monitor their bodily sensations for any sign of the illness, and amplify or exaggerate any evidence of illness. Normal somatic feelings are then prone to be misinterpreted as ominous. The misinterpretation triggers anxiety, which patients attempt to reduce by seeking assurance of good health from physicians and/or alternative care providers or remedies.</p><p>Despite medical reassurance, patients with illness anxiety disorder remain anxious about their health. One reason is that patients vigilantly monitor their bodies for symptoms and become sensitive to slight homeostatic fluctuations that occur normally [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>In addition, it is thought that illness anxiety leads patients to confirm their fears through selective attention toward information that is consistent with having a disease and away from information that is consistent with good health. Support for this hypothesis includes a randomized trial that enrolled undergraduate students (n = 60, not selected for any psychopathology) and assigned them to spend one week frequently engaged in safety behaviors (such as checking one’s body or using the internet to research health information), or to spend one week monitoring their normal use of safety behaviors (controls) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Health anxiety increased more in the group frequently engaging in safety behaviors compared with controls. Among individuals with illness anxiety, checking behaviors appear to reduce negative emotional states [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p>Avoidance behavior may also maintain illness anxiety symptoms. As an example, patients who erroneously believe that they have cardiac disease may avoid physical exertion because they think this will exacerbate their condition; patients thus lose the opportunity to verify their good health and correct the mistaken belief.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3712862"><span class="h2">Genetics and biological correlates</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The genetics of illness anxiety disorder and hypochondriasis are unknown, and there is little information about their neurobiology. A family study found that the prevalence of hypochondriasis was comparable in 72 first-degree relatives of patients with hypochondriasis and in 97 relatives of controls, but interpreting the results is difficult due to the small number of individuals involved and the relatively low incidence of the illness [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Studies of biologic correlates have found that compared with healthy controls, patients with hypochondriasis have decreased levels of plasma neurotrophin-3 and platelet serotonin [<a href="#rid27">27</a>], and smaller pituitary volumes [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Another observational study (n = 24) found that individuals with high levels of health anxiety focused more upon body symptom words (eg, dizziness, headache, and nausea) compared with individuals with low levels of health anxiety, and that this attentional bias toward body symptom words was associated with hypoactivity of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. However, due to the cross-sectional design of these neurobiologic studies, it is unclear whether the abnormalities represent etiologic causes, sequelae, neither, or both. In addition, the studies were small.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7947242"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical features of illness anxiety disorder discussed in this section are based in large part upon studies of hypochondriasis, as well as studies of individuals with symptoms of health anxiety (persistent unrealistic worry or conviction about having an illness). Illness anxiety disorder is a diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef104206" href="/z/d/graphic/104206.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) that was introduced with publication of the DSM-5 in 2013 [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].

It is estimated that among individuals who were diagnosed with hypochondriasis, approximately 33 percent would qualify for a diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Terminology and DSM-5-TR'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H235454074"><span class="h2">Symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Symptoms of illness anxiety occur on a spectrum from normal to pathologic [<a href="#rid5">5,6,30</a>], and are considered a disorder when the preoccupation with health causes clinically significant distress or impairment [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Transient health anxiety preoccupations (eg, disease fears commonly experienced by second-year medical students) do not constitute illness anxiety disorder.</p><p>The core features of illness anxiety disorder are [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An excessive concern about acquiring or a preoccupation with having a serious medical illness, despite a normal physical examination, negative tests, and reassurance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Somatic symptoms are minimal or nonexistent.</p><p></p><p>Illness anxiety preoccupations are heterogeneous. Patients may be preoccupied with a particular diagnosis (eg, cancer or HIV infection), a bodily function (eg, bowel movements), normal variation in function (eg, in heart rate or blood pressure), or vague somatic sensation (eg, “tired heart”). The patient’s concern may involve one or more organ systems, and the focus of concern may shift over time from one organ or disease to another [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p>The degree of insight varies; some patients recognize that their disease fears are excessive, while others firmly maintain their convictions. However, the belief is not of delusional intensity, and patients can acknowledge the possibility that their disease fears are exaggerated or that there may be no disease at all.</p><p>The concern about the feared illness often becomes a central feature of the patient’s life, and psychosocial functioning may suffer (see <a class="local">'Functioning'</a> below) [<a href="#rid1">1,30</a>]. Many patients check their bodies to reassure themselves; examples of illness anxiety behavior include excessive breast self-examination or blood pressure and pulse monitoring. This behavior may increase during times of stress. In addition, health anxiety does not abate despite the benign course of the feared disease [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p>The preoccupation with illness typically leads to high health care utilization [<a href="#rid1">1,9,13,31</a>], with multiple normal examinations and laboratory tests that do not allay the patient’s concern [<a href="#rid15">15,30</a>]. Patients may press their physicians to order progressively more invasive diagnostic tests and higher-risk treatments, which can reinforce the disorder and increase the probability of iatrogenic complications. Seeking care from multiple clinicians ("doctor-shopping") is also common [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Despite extensive medical attention, patients with illness anxiety disorder often are disappointed and frustrated with their clinicians [<a href="#rid30">30,32</a>]. Clinicians in turn may become frustrated because their efforts at managing and reassuring the patient seem futile.</p><p>Some patients fear iatrogenic illness (eg, adverse medication effects or radiation exposure), avoid mainstream medical clinicians, and pursue a diagnosis and remedy through complementary and alternative practitioners. In addition, many patients use the internet to obtain information about prevention of feared diseases, and consume vitamins, over-the-counter remedies, and fad diets.</p><p>General medical illnesses may be present or may arise in patients with illness anxiety disorder [<a href="#rid1">1,33</a>]. Having feared serious illness, the patient with illness anxiety disorder may feel vindicated when diagnosed with a serious medical disease.</p><p>Little is known about cultural variation in illness anxiety disorder.

It is not the symptom per se that causes distress, but rather the meaning and significance of the physical complaint.</p><p>Patients with illness anxiety disorder remain preoccupied with having or acquiring a serious medical disease despite appropriate, negative physical examination and laboratory testing. The illness preoccupation becomes a central focus of the patient’s life that affects daily activities and functioning [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

Patients may worry about having an occult disease during its early stage, when signs on physical examination or laboratory test abnormalities are not readily apparent. This may be more frequent when there is a strong family history of a serious medical illness (eg, breast cancer, Alzheimer dementia, or coronary heart disease) or the serious disease has an insidious onset (eg, AIDS or ovarian or pancreatic cancer).

In addition, some of the disorders that resemble illness anxiety disorder can also occur in conjunction with it [<a href="#rid54">54</a>]; if the patient meets full diagnostic criteria for both illness anxiety disorder and another psychiatric disorder (eg, unipolar major depression or generalized anxiety disorder), both conditions are diagnosed [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Comorbid psychopathology'</a> above.)</p><p>The differential diagnosis for illness anxiety disorder includes [<a href="#rid1">1,4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Normal reactions</strong> – Among patients with or at significant risk for general medical conditions, health related anxiety may be either a normal response or a symptom of illness anxiety disorder. Health related anxiety in response to the threat or experience of serious medical illness is normal and is not a psychiatric disorder; this nonpathological health anxiety is clearly related to the medical disease, is proportionate to its seriousness, and typically abates over time (eg, within two to three months). By contrast, patients with illness anxiety disorder are preoccupied with or anxious about their medical condition to a degree that is clearly excessive and disproportionate, and the health related anxiety persists for at least six months.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adjustment disorder</strong> – Patients with or at significant risk for general medical conditions may develop illness anxiety disorder or an adjustment disorder with anxiety. Both illness anxiety disorder and adjustment disorder are characterized by disproportionate behavioral responses to the general medical illness, as well as impaired functioning. However, adjustment disorder is a residual diagnosis and is not diagnosed if the patient meets criteria for another specific disorder, such as illness anxiety disorder.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Somatic symptom disorder</strong> – Both somatic symptom disorder and illness anxiety disorder are characterized by prominent somatic concerns that are accompanied by distress and impaired functioning. However, patients with somatic symptom disorder have significant somatic symptoms; typically there are multiple concurrent symptoms, but there may be only one severe symptom, such as pain. By contrast, somatic symptoms in illness anxiety disorder are at most minimal, and patients are more preoccupied with the idea that they are sick. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/109552.html" rel="external">"Somatic symptom disorder: Epidemiology and clinical presentation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/112997.html" rel="external">"Somatic symptom disorder: Assessment and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Generalized anxiety disorder</strong> – Patients with generalized anxiety disorder may worry excessively about illness but are also preoccupied with other issues, such as relationships, work, or finances. By contrast, the concern in illness anxiety disorder is restricted to having or developing an illness, and illness anxiety disorder is diagnosed only if the patient is solely preoccupied with or anxious about having an illness. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/496.html" rel="external">"Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder</strong> – Although illness anxiety disorder may include intrusive thoughts about having a disease (obsession) and associated compulsive behaviors (eg, seeking reassurance), the disorder does not include the stereotyped, repetitive, ritualized behaviors that characterize obsessive-compulsive disorder. Most patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder have obsessions or compulsions involving other concerns (eg, checking locks, counting, and/or keeping strict order) in addition to fears about contracting disease. Illness anxiety disorder is diagnosed when the predominant concerns are restricted to health and disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/498.html" rel="external">"Obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Specific phobia</strong> – Specific phobia and illness anxiety disorder both involve fear that is disproportionate to the perceived threat, can lead to maladaptive avoidance, and are present for at least six months. However, specific phobia involves a specific object or situation, such as animals, seeing blood, heights, receiving an injection, or flying. Patients with illness anxiety disorder are preoccupied with fears of having or acquiring a serious disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14637.html" rel="external">"Specific phobia in adults: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Panic disorder</strong> – Panic attacks can occur in both illness anxiety disorder and panic disorder, and both disorders are characterized by hypervigilance to benign somatic sensations. One distinction between the two disorders is that panic attacks in illness anxiety disorder are triggered by health fears, whereas the triggers in panic disorder are typically not limited to health concerns. In addition, health fears in illness anxiety disorder occur frequently, are persistent and enduring, and are not amenable to reassurance. Although patients with panic disorder may fear an imminent medical catastrophe (eg, myocardial infarction), these fears occur only during panic attacks, and patients usually are amenable to reassurance that their symptoms are panic attacks and not a myocardial infarction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14628.html" rel="external">"Panic disorder in adults: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Body dysmorphic disorder</strong> – Patients with illness anxiety disorder and body dysmorphic disorder are both preoccupied with perceived body abnormalities, excessively perform behaviors, such as checking their body, and may exhibit maladaptive avoidance. However, the preoccupation in illness anxiety disorder is with having or acquiring a serious illness, whereas the preoccupation in body dysmorphic disorder is with being ugly or deformed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Psychotic disorders</strong> – Psychotic patients may be convinced that they are ill as a result of somatic delusions (false, fixed beliefs about the body). By contrast, patients with illness anxiety disorder are not delusional and can consider the possibility that they are not seriously ill. Thus, the beliefs about health that occur in illness anxiety disorder do not rise to the rigid and intense level seen in somatic delusions. In addition, bizarre somatic beliefs that occur in conjunction with other signs of psychosis (eg, hallucinations or disorganized speech and behavior) indicate a psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, unipolar major depression with psychotic features, or bipolar disorder with psychotic features. However, it is more difficult to differentiate delusional disorder, somatic type (eg, delusional parasitosis), which is characterized by behavior and functioning that are not markedly strange or impaired, from illness anxiety disorder with poor insight. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17193.html" rel="external">"Psychosis in adults: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic evaluation", section on 'Determining the etiology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Unipolar major depression or persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)</strong> – Depressed patients may ruminate over physical health and have difficulty accepting reassurance, but they also suffer other symptoms (eg, insomnia, anorexia, anergia, impaired memory and concentration, and suicidality) that are generally not seen in illness anxiety disorder. A separate diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder is not made if health concerns arise only during depressive episodes. However, if excessive health anxiety persists after remission of a depressive episode and other criteria for illness anxiety disorder are met, the diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder should be made. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1721.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7947298"><span class="h1">SUMMARY</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Illness anxiety disorder is a diagnosis that was introduced with publication of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-5).
