         Pediatric to adult life transition is a critical time requiring continued support to ensure continuity of care. There is a clear need for a structured process of transition from pediatric to adult care for youth with sickle cell disease (SCD) that is not based on age but rather on social and emotional development and achievement of milestones in disease-management knowledge and skills.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic describes standards, our approach to planning and carrying out health care transition in SCD, and how national guidelines and frameworks can guide this process.

         Survival for children with SCD has substantially improved in middle- and high-income countries (HICs) in recent decades [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4

         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. This improvement in survival translates into a change in the disease paradigm, which today can be considered a chronic disease in which most children in middle- and high-income countries are expected to survive to adulthood.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, as adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with SCD transition from pediatric to adult care, the stakes for their health and even survival are high. The timing of this transition often coincides with other life and health changes that contribute to their vulnerability, including:

         Certain morbidities of SCD become more likely as individuals age. As a result, during the transition to adult care, increased monitoring for these conditions, along with patient education and possibly interventions to prevent or mitigate their progression, should occur. (See

         The SICKLE recommendations are aimed at settings of any income level (low, middle, or high) and focus on individual-level variables that lend to successful transition from pediatric to adult life and care. (See

         Providers can use elements from each of the frameworks; they should be clear about how transition policies and practices align with each framework.

         – Each institution should develop a policy for transition. Key components include informing patients and families/caregivers about differences related to privacy and consent and the age at which these changes apply (typically age 18 years). The policy should be developed with input from patients and family members/caregivers. Generally, discussions of the policy begin when the patient is approximately age 12 to 14 years, and the policy is regularly reviewed as part of ongoing care.

          Unique requirements
         </strong>
         – The systems of care into which the AYAs are transitioned must be sensitive and responsive to the unique needs and challenges of AYAs with SCD. Care is complex because a number of prevalent adult SCD comorbid conditions begin in childhood; these include silent cerebral infarcts, avascular necrosis of joints, asthma, chronic sickle lung disease, and chronic kidney disease leading to kidney failure [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. Without transition support and assured continuity of care, these conditions very likely may worsen and may seriously impact functional ability. (See

          'SCD complications rise during the AYA period'

         <a href="#rid2">
          2,39,41
         </a>

Pediatric SCD specialists reported that the inability to find an adult provider to whom they could transfer their patients was the most significant issue they faced in the transition process [

          SCD pain management and site of care

         – One of the most frequently cited barriers to accessing optimal care reported by AYAs in transition and adults with SCD is negative interactions with emergency department and primary care providers [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42,44-47
         </a>
         ]. A hematology/oncology infusion center or dedicated day hospital care is preferred for acute, uncomplicated vaso-occlusive pain in individuals with SCD. (See

          Cycle of mistrust

        <p>
         Assessment of transition readiness must be multidimensional, evaluating not only knowledge and skills in relation to disease management but also where the individual stands in relation to developmental goals of adolescence. These goals include achievement of autonomy, establishment of supportive relationships, development of a comfortable body image and sense of self-esteem, adjustment to sexual maturation, and preparation for future goals including occupational readiness, social development, and reproductive and family planning. Assessment of emotional adjustment to the transition process and development of self-efficacy are also important.
        </p>
        <p>
         Studies that have gathered perspectives of AYAs after the transition from pediatric to adult care have identified several facilitators of health care transition. Addressing fear of the unknown has been identified as important and can be mitigated by meeting the adult provider prior to transfer and being well-informed about what to expect [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. AYAs also recommended gradually taking over disease management and starting the process of transition early. In a 2017 survey of 19 AYAs with SCD (ages 18 to 30), those who had completed the transition to adult care reported a history of primarily negative experiences in the adult health care system, particularly in emergency departments (EDs) [
         <a href="#rid90">
          90
         </a>
         ]. They also confirmed the importance of self-efficacy, adequate knowledge, developmental maturity, acceptance, and motivation as important for transition.
        </p>
        <p>
         As noted above, lack of readiness is a major barrier to a smooth transition. (See

         Cognitive dysfunction, including attention deficit, is common in SCD, often progresses with age, and can negatively impact the transition process, as discussed above. (See

         By the same token, relative strengths in domains of cognition and attention are associated with successful transition.

          Familiarity with sites of care

         – AYAs and families/caregivers express anxiety about the transition process, even with pediatric/adult medicine colocation models, as care in the ED and inpatient services often must take place in community facilities. To alleviate this anxiety, it can be helpful to offer tours of partner community facilities [

          Patient-centered medical home

         – There is evidence that AYAs (and adults) receive higher-quality care when it is delivered within a patient-centered medical home (PCMH). As an example, in a cohort of over 20,000 AYAs in the general population, those who received care in a PCMH were more likely to receive preventive care, immunizations, cancer screenings, and screening for sexually transmitted infections [

          40
         </a>

         Transition to adult care is a multidisciplinary effort. Ideally, health care transition teams should have clinicians (eg, clinicians, advanced practice providers), nurse educators, social workers, and psychologists. Teams that include transition coordinators, academic liaisons, and community/peer navigators are better positioned to provide holistic and comprehensive transition services.

          Integration into adult care
         </strong>
         – The completion of transition typically occurs between the ages 18 and 26 years. During this period, a confirmation of transfer should take place. Additionally, feedback related to the satisfaction with the transition process should be elicited from the patients and their families/caregivers. Their feedback should be incorporated into the transition activities for continued quality improvement of the transition program. Long-term retention in adult care is an important metric of health care transition. Risk factors for poor adult care retention are not yet identified in SCD and have implications for care continuity and maintenance of health and quality of life.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In some programs, pediatric and adult teams involved in SCD care are co-located in the same building, which facilitates communication. Co-located pediatric and adult care in the first few years of adult care has been shown to prevent the expected spike in acute care utilization among AYAs with SCD [

         <strong>
          Importance
         </strong>
         – The transition period from pediatric to adult care for youth with sickle cell disease (SCD; as with other chronic conditions) is important as they develop the knowledge, skills, and motivation to actively participate in their health care. The stakes for health and even survival are high for individuals with SCD, who often experience an increase in the use of health care resources as well as a sharp increase in mortality during the AYA years. In addition, the incidence of certain disease complications rises as individuals with SCD age. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Health care transition as a vulnerable time'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Indicators of success
         </strong>
         – An optimal transition from pediatric to adult SCD care is one in which the youth adheres to therapy, continues along a stable disease trajectory, participates in preventive care and health maintenance, and achieves appropriate developmental milestones. Other indicators of success include good communication, self-efficacy, and trust with the adult provider. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Defining a successful transition'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Barriers to success
         </strong>
         – A major barrier to the smooth transition from pediatric to adult care in SCD is the limited availability of knowledgeable adult-oriented providers (and hence, limited access to quality health care). Other barriers also exist, including lack of readiness, cognitive dysfunction (eg, due to stroke or silent cerebral infarcts), and depression (eg, due to chronic pain). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Barriers to a smooth transition'
         </a>
         above and

         <strong>
          Predictors of success
         </strong>
         – The success of the transition depends on the patient's self-efficacy, emotional and intellectual readiness, adherence to the care plan, support from the parents/family/caregivers, and a patient-centered approach to care. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Predictors of a smooth health care transition'

         <strong>
          Stages of transition
         </strong>
         – Transition is a multidimensional process that must begin early and occur in stages that include providing information about the process, assessing readiness, coordinating communication between pediatric and adult providers, completing age-appropriate medical assessments and interventions, preparing a medical summary and an action plan for pain control and prevention  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115352" href="/z/d/graphic/115352.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ), and introducing the adult provider. The table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115302" href="/z/d/graphic/115302.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         <strong>
          Age and readiness
         </strong>
         – Most youth are transitioned to adult care between 18 and 21 years of age; however, transition readiness is determined by the individual's social and emotional development and achievement of milestones in disease management, not by a prespecified age. (See
         <a class="local">
