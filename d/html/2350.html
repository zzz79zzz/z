         Hyponatremia represents a relative excess of water in relation to sodium. It can be induced by a marked increase in water intake (primary polydipsia) and/or by impaired water excretion due, for example, to advanced kidney failure or persistent release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). (See

         Our approach to treating patients with hyponatremia depends upon the duration of the hyponatremia, the severity of the hyponatremia, the presence and severity of symptoms, and the presence of preexisting intracranial pathology such as recent traumatic brain injury, recent intracranial surgery or hemorrhage, or an intracranial neoplasm or other space-occupying lesion  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115886" data-inline-graphics="115886" href="/z/d/graphic/115886.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Following initial therapy, the subsequent treatment can vary with the cause of hyponatremia.

         Therapy for hyponatremia depends in part upon the acuity:

         </span>
         Acute – If the hyponatremia has developed over a period of less than 48 hours, it is called "acute." Acute hyponatremia usually results from parenteral fluid administration in postoperative patients (who have antidiuretic hormone [ADH] hypersecretion associated with surgery) and from self-induced water intoxication (as in, for example, competitive runners, psychotic patients with extreme polydipsia, and users of ecstasy).

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Chronic – If it is known that hyponatremia has been present for 48 hours or more, or if the duration is unclear (such as in patients who develop hyponatremia at home), it is called "chronic."
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The more acute the hyponatremia, the greater the risk of complications (such as cerebral edema and seizures) and the greater the need for aggressive therapy. The more chronic the hyponatremia and the lower the serum sodium concentration, the greater the risk of complications from overaggressive therapy and the greater the need for monitoring to avoid overcorrection.

         Severe hyponatremia – A serum sodium concentration of &lt;120 mEq/L is "severe hyponatremia." Complications of untreated hyponatremia and complications from overcorrection of hyponatremia are most common among patients with severe hyponatremia.

         Symptoms due to hyponatremia are typically classified as severe or mild to moderate; some patients are or appear to be asymptomatic:

         Severe symptoms – Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include seizures, obtundation, coma, and respiratory arrest. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2287.html" rel="external">
          "Manifestations of hyponatremia and hypernatremia in adults", section on 'Clinical manifestations of acute hyponatremia'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Severe symptoms such as seizures are relatively common in patients with an acute and marked reduction in the serum sodium concentration. Without time for brain adaptation to occur, affected patients can develop severe neurologic manifestations, including coma, brainstem herniation, and death.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         By contrast, seizures and other severe neurologic manifestations are relatively uncommon in patients with chronic hyponatremia (even among those with severely decreased serum sodium concentrations). As an example, a single-center study identified seizures in 3 of 120 patients (2.5 percent) with a serum sodium of 115 to 119 mEq/L, 3 of 54 patients (5.4 percent) with a serum sodium of 110 to 114 mEq/L, and 4 of 39 patients (10 percent) with a serum sodium of less than 110 mEq/L [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, another study reported that seizures occurred in only 7 percent of patients with chronic hyponatremia and a serum sodium of 110 mEq/L or less; by contrast, the incidence of seizures was 30 percent in patients with acute hyponatremia of this severity [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. However, in patients with chronic hyponatremia, the risk for convulsions may be higher in patients with an underlying seizure disorder and in patients who are withdrawing from alcohol.

         </span>
         Mild to moderate symptoms – Mild to moderate symptoms of hyponatremia are relatively nonspecific and include headache, fatigue, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, gait disturbances, forgetfulness, confusion, and muscle cramps. They occur most commonly in patients with chronic hyponatremia (present for 48 hours or more) that is severe (serum sodium concentration less than 120 mEq/L) and, in such cases, result from brain adaptations that minimize cerebral edema but alter the composition of brain cells [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-5
         </a>
         ]. In patients with severe, chronic hyponatremia, these findings are usually
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         associated with impending herniation. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2287.html" rel="external">
          "Manifestations of hyponatremia and hypernatremia in adults", section on 'Clinical manifestations of chronic hyponatremia'

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         However, if the serum sodium concentration is extremely low (less than 110 mEq/L), then such symptoms may be a prelude to seizures. In addition, mild to moderate symptoms in patients with acute hyponatremia, even those with sodium concentrations of greater than 120 mEq/L, should be considered ominous and may evolve without warning to seizures, respiratory arrest, and herniation [
         <a href="#rid6">

         Asymptomatic – Many hyponatremic patients appear to be asymptomatic. However, "asymptomatic" patients, particularly those with chronic hyponatremia of moderate severity (120 to 129 mEq/L), may have subtle impairments in mentation and gait and an increased risk of falls and fractures [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Thus, such patients are often offered chronic therapies to normalize the serum sodium concentration in an effort to treat these subtle manifestations [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ] and to avoid the possibility that the serum sodium concentration will fall further and produce more serious symptoms. Chronic therapies that are used include oral

          urea

         , or vasopressin antagonists. However, there is no evidence proving that these therapies decrease the risk of falls and fractures.

         Patients at high risk for complications from untreated hyponatremia and those at high risk for complications from overcorrection of hyponatremia should be treated in hospital settings that allow frequent assessments of the patient's neurologic condition, accurate measurements of urine output, and frequent measurements of the serum sodium concentration.

         Treatment of patients who do not require hospital admission varies according to the cause of hyponatremia. Chronic treatment of these disorders is discussed separately:

         The treatment of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients has four important goals: to prevent further declines in the serum sodium concentration, to decrease intracranial pressure in patients at risk for developing brain herniation, to relieve symptoms of hyponatremia, and to avoid excessive correction of hyponatremia in patients at risk for osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) [

        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach to attaining these goals, both during initial therapy (ie, the first six hours after recognition of the electrolyte disturbance) and during subsequent therapy (the first several days), is presented below. (See

         Patients with acute hyponatremia caused by parenteral fluid administration, as in patients with postoperative hyponatremia due to surgery-induced syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Large volumes of isotonic fluid produce volume expansion and result in increased sodium excretion in the urine. If antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels are high, the excretion of this sodium in a concentrated urine will cause the serum sodium to fall further, a phenomenon that has been called "desalination" [

         In such patients, when the serum sodium concentration falls to less than 130 mEq/L, even mild, nonspecific symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, headache, confusion) may rapidly progress to seizures, respiratory arrest, and permanent or fatal brain damage.
        </p>
        <p>
         Concurrent hypoxemia, which may result from noncardiogenic pulmonary edema or hypoventilation, can exacerbate hyponatremia-induced cerebral edema and lead to a vicious cycle ending in death [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Impending herniation can be successfully reversed with a 4 to 6 mEq/L increase in the serum sodium concentration [

         In contrast to the clinical settings listed above, other patients with hyponatremia have virtually no risk of herniation. Although such patients who are hospitalized with hyponatremia have a high mortality rate, deaths associated with hyponatremia are primarily due to the underlying disease and are rarely caused by cerebral edema. In one study, for example, only 1 of 664 patients with a serum sodium less than 120 mEq/L admitted to a community hospital over the course of 12 years died from cerebral edema, and this patient had coexistent intracranial pathology [
         <a href="#rid13">

         It is important to determine whether or not hyponatremia may be producing symptoms and to relieve those symptoms by raising the serum sodium concentration. Symptoms of hyponatremia are nonspecific, but if the serum sodium is less than 130 mEq/L, we assume that hyponatremia may be responsible. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Determine the severity of symptoms'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The urgency and, therefore, the aggressiveness of treatment to raise the serum sodium varies depending upon the severity of symptoms, the acuity of hyponatremia, the level of the serum sodium concentration, and the patient's underlying condition. Even the most extreme symptoms can be relieved by a 4 to 6 mEq/L increase in serum sodium during the first 24 hours. Thus, if symptoms persist after an increase of this magnitude, there is no benefit and, in some cases, potential harm from correcting at a faster rate.

         Overly rapid correction of severe, chronic hyponatremia (ie, chronic hyponatremia with a serum sodium concentration below 120 mEq/L and particularly below 115 mEq/L) can lead to a severe and sometimes irreversible neurologic disorder called the osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS)  (

         Low risk for ODS – Patients with acute hyponatremia that developed over a few hours due to a marked increase in water intake, as can occur in marathon runners, patients with primary polydipsia, and users of ecstasy, are probably not at risk for this complication. These patients have not had time for the brain adaptations that reduce the severity of brain swelling but also increase the risk of harm from rapid correction of the hyponatremia. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination is low when the initial serum sodium concentration is greater than 120 mEq/L; therefore, there should be little hesitation to treat acute hyponatremia with hypertonic

         Complications of overly rapid correction of hyponatremia were once called "central pontine myelinolysis (CPM)," but the term "osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS)" was introduced to describe these complications for several reasons: because demyelination may be more diffuse and does not necessarily involve the pons, because not all patients with posttreatment neurologic symptoms have demonstrable anatomic lesions, and because not all patients with central pontine myelinolysis have experienced a rapid increase in serum sodium  (

         Although some correction of hyponatremia is usually indicated in patients with severe hyponatremia, the goal of initial therapy is to raise the serum sodium concentration by 4 to 6 mEq/L in a 24-hour period. In symptomatic patients with acute hyponatremia or in patients with severe symptoms, this goal should be achieved quickly, over six hours or less. Thereafter, the serum sodium can be maintained at a constant level for the remainder of the 24-hour period to avoid overly rapid correction.

        <p>
         If the serum sodium concentration is &lt;120 mEq/L or if there are additional risk factors of ODS (as examples, alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease) the
         <strong>
          maximum rate of correction

         should be 8 mEq/L in any 24-hour period [

          20,21
         </a>

         Because of the inherent imprecision of serum sodium measurements, particularly at very low concentrations, a laboratory report indicating that the serum sodium has increased by 8 mEq/L might reflect a true increase of 10 mEq/L [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23

         The 24-hour goal may be achieved in the first few hours since it is the daily change, rather than the hourly change, in serum sodium that is associated with ODS. Thus, patients requiring emergency therapy can be corrected rapidly in the first several hours of the 24-hour period.

Autocorrection can be suspected if the cause of hyponatremia has been reversed, urine output has increased, and the urine is dilute (specific gravity &lt;1.005, osmolality &lt;200 mosmol/kg, or urine cation concentration [the sum of the urine sodium and potassium concentrations] is less than one-half the serum sodium). Alternatively, autocorrection can be detected by remeasuring the serum sodium. However, the results of this remeasurement must be available expeditiously. A point-of-care sodium analyzer (if available) provides helpful and rapid information about the trajectory of the serum sodium in such patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         We then monitor the patient for symptoms and remeasure the serum sodium concentration every one to two hours to determine the need for additional therapy.

         Patients with self-induced water intoxication may have a further decline in serum sodium, even after presentation, due to delayed absorption of ingested water. In addition, patients who have ingested large volumes of water are volume expanded, which results in increased sodium excretion in the urine. If antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels are high due to a nonosmotic stimulus such as nausea, the excretion of sodium in a concentrated urine will cause the serum sodium to fall, a phenomenon that has been called "desalination" [

These individuals, despite not having severe hyponatremia, can develop ODS, and more care should be taken to avoid overly rapid correction. Such measures are described below. (See

The lower the serum sodium concentration, the greater the risk. For reasons discussed below, we prefer 3 percent

          saline
         </a>
         in such patients to treat hyponatremia, even among those who are thought to be hypovolemic. Isotonic saline can be given concurrently (with 3 percent saline), if needed, to correct symptomatic hypovolemia or prerenal azotemia. (See

          saline
         </a>
         (ie, before any treatment is given to correct the hyponatremia). Although we prefer 3 percent saline to treat severe hyponatremia in hypovolemic patients, some clinicians use normal saline instead; in such cases, desmopressin should only be given after the serum sodium has been increased by 4 to 6 mEq/L.

          desmopressin
         </a>
         should be considered a high-risk group because they can become hypernatremic if desmopressin is discontinued. Thus, we continue to administer desmopressin to such patients even when the serum sodium is &gt;120 mEq/L. Oral or intranasal outpatient dosing should be converted to the parenteral route to ensure an effective antidiuresis while hyponatremia is being corrected.

          desmopressin
         </a>
         is prescribed to prevent overly rapid correction of hyponatremia, we usually use 1 to 2 mcg of desmopressin, intravenously or subcutaneously (our preference), every six to eight hours for a period of 24 to 48 hours (or until the serum sodium has been increased to at least 125 mEq/L), and we simultaneously administer a slow intravenous infusion of hypertonic

          saline

         , beginning with a dose of 0.25 mL/kg/hour. A bolus of hypertonic saline can be given at the start of therapy to help relieve troublesome symptoms if these are present. The rate of infusion of hypertonic saline is then adjusted to achieve the desired rate of correction. Desmopressin makes the rate of correction resulting from hypertonic saline more predictable because it prevents an unexpected water diuresis from occurring during the course of therapy.

         ]. In one of these studies, 25 patients received 3 percent saline (dose varied depending upon the severity of symptoms, with some patients receiving a 50 mL bolus of 3 percent saline) and desmopressin (1 to 2 mcg intravenously or subcutaneously every eight hours for 24 to 48 hours), aiming for a correction rate of 6 mEq/L/day [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. The mean increase in serum sodium was 6 mEq/L in the first 24 hours and 4 mEq/L in the second 24 hours; one patient corrected by 11 mEq/L in the first 24 hours, but there were no other instances of overly rapid correction. With this approach, desmopressin is given to eliminate the potential for urinary water losses, in essence creating a state of iatrogenic SIADH that can be managed more predictably with hypertonic saline. The approach can be used to treat both hypovolemic hyponatremia and SIADH. It is particularly attractive in patients who are at high risk of developing ODS from overly rapid correction of hyponatremia.

         In the past, treatment of hyponatremia was targeted at raising the serum sodium to a level perceived to be safe (usually above 120 mEq/L and sometimes above 128 mEq/L) on the first day of treatment in the mistaken belief that this improved the prognosis of severe hyponatremia. There is no evidence to support this practice. Although the eventual goal is normalization of the serum sodium concentration, the therapeutic goal on any given day should
         <strong>
          not

         In patients with acute hyponatremia, we monitor the patient for symptoms and remeasure the serum sodium concentration hourly to determine the need for additional therapy. The frequency of monitoring can be decreased when the serum sodium has been raised by 4 to 6 mEq/L.

         Patients who are treated for chronic hyponatremia in the hospital should have their serum sodium measured often enough to ensure an appropriate rate of correction and to allow the clinician to react quickly to impending overly rapid correction (eg, every four hours). In addition, the urine output should be monitored, and, if increasing, the urine osmolality, urine sodium, and urine potassium should be measured. An increase in urine output and a decrease in the urine cation concentration can signify that the rate of correction is accelerating, and, in this setting, the serum sodium should be measured more frequently (eg, every two hours). If the risk of overly rapid correction is low, the frequency of measurements can be reduced, but measurements should still be taken at least every 12 hours until the serum sodium is 130 mEq/L or higher.

         Fluid restriction to below the level of urine output is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic or severe hyponatremia in edematous states (such as heart failure and cirrhosis), syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), and advanced kidney function impairment. Restriction to 50 to 60 percent of daily fluid requirements may be required to achieve the goal of inducing negative water balance [

         The effectiveness of fluid restriction alone can be predicted by the urine-to-serum cation ratio (the concentration of the urine cations, sodium (Na) and potassium (K), to the serum sodium concentration; ie, the concentrations of the urine [Na] plus the urine [K] divided by the serum [Na]) [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47

Similarly, if fluid must be given or the serum sodium concentration must be raised quickly because of symptomatic hyponatremia, the cation concentration of the administered fluid must exceed the cation concentration of the urine.

         Potassium is as osmotically active as sodium. As a result, giving potassium (usually for concurrent hypokalemia) can raise the serum sodium concentration and osmolality in hyponatremic patients [

          54-58

         Intracellular hydrogen moves into the extracellular fluid in exchange for potassium. These hydrogen ions are buffered by extracellular bicarbonate and, to a much lesser degree, plasma proteins. This buffering converts the bicarbonate ions to carbon dioxide and water, and the bicarbonate is replaced by the chloride that was infused with potassium (which, as noted, is exchanged for hydrogen ions). The increased intracellular osmolality due to potassium leads to water movement into the cells.

         The net effect is that concurrent administration of potassium must be taken into account when estimating the sodium deficit and anticipating the rate of correction of the hyponatremia. This relationship becomes clinically important in the patient with severe diuretic or vomiting-induced hyponatremia who is also hypokalemic.

         Suppose, for example, that a patient with hyponatremia has a serum potassium concentration of 2 mEq/L and that it is decided to give 400 mEq of oral potassium during the first day. If the patient is a 70 kg man, the total body water (TBW) will be approximately 40 liters (60 percent of body weight). The administered potassium will raise the serum sodium concentration by approximately 10 mEq/L, which exceeds the upper limit for the rate of safe correction. Thus, giving

          54,55
         </a>
         ]. Giving additional sodium may lead to an overly rapid elevation in the serum sodium concentration and potentially cause osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) [

         By contrast, many commercially available intravenous potassium solutions are hypotonic (10 mmol in 100 mL of water producing a 100 mmol/L solution). This solution will generally

         Thus, when calculating the impact of a particular regimen on the serum sodium concentration, one must consider the sodium plus potassium concentration of the solution, not simply the sodium concentration.

         ]. There are multiple receptors for the ADH vasopressin: the V1a, V1b, and V2 receptors. The V2 receptors primarily mediate the antidiuretic response, while V1a and V1b receptors principally cause vasoconstriction and mediate adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release, respectively [

         The vasopressin receptor antagonists produce a selective water diuresis (also called aquaresis) without affecting sodium and potassium excretion.

         In view of the often severe and permanent adverse consequences of ODS, prevention is essential. Prevention and treatment of overly rapid correction and ODS are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2317.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The risk for overly rapid correction is higher if the cause of impaired water excretion is likely to be reversible (eg, in hypovolemic patients), thereby resulting in a water diuresis that can produce an abrupt rise in the serum sodium. An increase in urine output and a decrease in the urine cation concentration can signify a water diuresis that will accelerate the rate of correction.
        </p>
        <p>
         Avoidance of overly rapid correction (more than 8 mEq/L in any 24-hour period) is often difficult in patients with self-induced water intoxication (as with psychotic patients who have primary polydipsia, exercise-associated hyponatremia, and ecstasy use). These patients tend to autocorrect since ADH is physiologically suppressed, permitting rapid excretion of large volumes of free water. However, the acute onset of hyponatremia in these disorders is associated with a low risk of ODS due to overly rapid correction. (See
         <a class="local">

         By correcting the hypovolemia, it removes the stimulus to antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release, thereby allowing the excess water to be excreted in a dilute urine. At this time, the serum sodium concentration may return rapidly toward normal; in some patients, overly rapid correction of hyponatremia can lead to the severe neurologic disorder osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) [

         is indicated in patients who are overtly hypovolemic with hypotension, prerenal azotemia, or orthostatic symptoms. Although isotonic saline will raise the serum sodium in hyponatremic patients with true hypovolemia, we concurrently give hypertonic saline if the hyponatremia is acute or severe and symptomatic. Isotonic saline will initially raise the serum sodium more slowly than hypertonic saline (until near-euvolemia is attained and ADH secretion is suppressed). In addition, some patients with hypovolemia may have coexistent syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH) due to stress and will not respond well to isotonic saline. Thus, hypertonic saline will be predictably more effective in rapidly alleviating symptoms of severe hyponatremia. After euvolemia is established, the slow correction in patients receiving isotonic saline may accelerate due to suppression of ADH, leading to a marked water diuresis. This rapid rise in serum sodium in patients who were, until that point, correcting slowly may produce an excessive 24-hour increase in the serum sodium. Initial therapy with a combination of hypertonic saline and

         In contrast to hypovolemia, the response to administered isotonic

          saline
         </a>
         is different in a hyponatremic patient with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Assuming the patient is euvolemic, the administered sodium is excreted in the urine because the response to aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide is normal. However, the water is retained because of the persistent action of ADH. Thus, when 1 liter of isotonic saline is administered to a patient with SIADH, the sodium is excreted in the urine while some of the water is retained, worsening the hyponatremia.
        </p>
        <p>
         A few simple calculations can illustrate this point. Suppose a patient with SIADH and hyponatremia has a high, relatively fixed urine osmolality and a urine cation concentration (urine [Na] + urine [K]) of 308 mEq/L, which is twice the cation concentration of isotonic
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">
          saline
         </a>
         . If 1000 mL of isotonic saline is given (containing 154 mEq of sodium), all of the sodium chloride will be excreted (because sodium handling is intact) but in only 500 mL of water (154 mEq of urinary sodium in 500 mL equals 308 mEq/L). The retention of one-half of the administered water will lead to a further reduction in the serum sodium concentration even though the serum sodium concentration will temporarily increase because the isotonic saline is hypertonic to the patient.
        </p>
        <p>
         Using a hypothetical 60 kg woman with a serum sodium of 110 mEq/L and the equations that are presented below (see

          'Approaches that we typically avoid'

         above), the effect of 500 mL of retained water can be calculated. For these calculations, the initial total body water (TBW) is assumed to be 50 percent of body weight (30 L), and the baseline total exchangeable cations are assumed to equal the product of TBW and the serum sodium concentration (30 L x 110 mEq/L = 3300 mEq).

         The TBW, rather than extracellular fluid volume, is used in these formulas since, although the administered sodium will stay in the extracellular space, water moves from the intracellular to extracellular space in response to the administered sodium to equalize the osmolality of the two fluid compartments. Potassium added to the solution should be included in the formula (ie, "Infusate [Na + K]" rather than "Infusate [Na]") since potassium is as osmotically active as sodium and will therefore contribute to the elevation in serum sodium (see

         to accurately predict the magnitude of change in serum sodium [

         </a>
         is given, the increase in serum sodium is often greater than that predicted by the formula [
         <a href="#rid72">
          72,73
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in a series of 62 patients with a baseline serum sodium of 112 mEq/L who were treated with hypertonic saline, 74 percent had a rise in serum sodium greater than expected from the above formulas. In addition, the maximum recommended rate of correction at 24 and 48 hours was exceeded in 11 and 10 percent, respectively [
         <a href="#rid72">
          72
         </a>
         ]. Inadvertent overcorrection was due to a documented water diuresis in 40 percent of patients, which, as mentioned above, can occur when saline therapy corrects hypovolemia, thereby removing the hypovolemic stimulus to the release of ADH and permitting rapid excretion of the excess water.
        </p>
        <p>
         By contrast, in patients with persistent SIADH secretion, the administered sodium will be excreted in the urine, and some of the water will be retained; as a result, the increase in serum sodium after 3 percent
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">
          saline
         </a>
         will be less than that predicted by formulas, and the serum sodium may actually fall after isotonic saline. Suppose, for example, a 60 kg woman with SIADH and hyponatremia (serum sodium of 110 mEq/L) has a high, relatively fixed urine osmolality and a urine cation concentration (urine [Na] + urine [K]) of 308 mEq/L, which is twice the cation concentration of isotonic saline. If 1000 mL of hypertonic saline (513 mEq/L) is given, all of the sodium chloride will be excreted but now in 1665 mL of urine (513 ÷ 308 mEq/L). Thus, after the administration of hypertonic saline, there will be an initial large rise in the serum sodium concentration, followed by reduction toward baseline after the administered sodium has been excreted. At this time, the rise in the serum sodium due to the net loss of 665 mL of water can be calculated. For these calculations, the initial TBW is assumed to be 50 percent of body weight (30 L), and the baseline total exchangeable cations are assumed to equal the product of TBW and the serum sodium concentration (30 L x 110 mEq/L = 3300 mEq). With these assumptions:

        <div class="formulaContainer">
         <div class="formula">
          <p>
           New SNa  =  Total exchangeable cations  ÷  TBW

           =  3300 mEq (same as baseline)  ÷  29.3 L (665 mL loss)

         Predictive formulas can, however, be valuable adjuncts to therapy. If the increase in serum sodium is more than predicted by the formula, one should suspect that an increase in water excretion has occurred because the original cause for water retention has ended (eg, euvolemia has been restored in a patient with hypovolemic hyponatremia or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/z/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">
          desmopressin
         </a>
         has worn off in a patient with desmopressin-induced hyponatremia). Such a deviation of the actual increase in serum sodium from the predicted increase should prompt strict monitoring of urine output and, in many cases, replacement of water losses or treatment with desmopressin to stop them.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, if serial measurements of urine chemistries (urine sodium, potassium, and creatinine) and urine volume are available, a predictive formula including these data can be useful:

         Patients with mild hyponatremia and asymptomatic patients with moderate hyponatremia can be managed as outpatients. The severity of hyponatremia and the severity of symptoms are presented above. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Determine the severity (degree) of hyponatremia'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         If hyponatremia persists at the time of discharge, patients who were treated in the hospital for severe hyponatremia or symptomatic moderate hyponatremia will require continued therapy as outpatients.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the following should be considered before discharging a patient who required inpatient treatment for hyponatremia:

         <span class="glyph">

         Patients should remain in the hospital long enough to assure that there is no longer a risk of injury from hyponatremia itself or from rapid correction of the electrolyte disturbance. Generally, this is true of patients whose serum sodium has been raised above approximately 125 mEq/L.
        </p>
        <p>

         </span>
         If the patient still has a potentially reversible cause of hyponatremia (eg, recent administration of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/z/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">
          desmopressin
         </a>
         [dDAVP] to prevent overcorrection), then the clinician should review the patient's risk factors for osmotic demyelination and the rate of rise in serum sodium that occurred in the preceding 24 hours since the rate of rise during the 24 hours after discharge may result in excessive correction.
        </p>
        <p>

         Take, for example, a patient being treated with

          desmopressin

         as an inpatient to avoid overly rapid correction of hyponatremia; the patient's serum sodium increased from 117 to 125 mEq/L during the preceding 24 hours (an increase of 8 mEq/L, which is in the acceptable range). If desmopressin is withdrawn, the ensuing water diuresis could produce a rise in serum sodium during the subsequent 24 hours that is substantially greater than 8 mEq/L, and that also exceeds the safe 48-hour correction limit, putting the patient at risk for osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). Thus, this patient should be monitored as an inpatient for the next 24 hours after withdrawal of desmopressin, rather than being discharged, and water losses should be replaced, if necessary, to avoid excessive correction.

In addition, the appropriate dose of tolvaptan should be determined in the hospital while carefully monitoring the patient's urine output. If tolvaptan is ineffective, then other strategies should be used for outpatient management of the hyponatremia. If tolvaptan successfully increases the patient's serum sodium, then discharge should be delayed until it is established that the patient is able to replace their water losses induced by the drug. Thereafter, the need for continued tolvaptan therapy should be reassessed every 30 days.

         Hyponatremia represents a relative excess of water in relation to sodium. It can be induced by a marked increase in water intake (primary polydipsia) and/or by impaired water excretion resulting from advanced kidney failure or from persistent release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)  (

         Our approach to treating patients with hyponatremia depends upon the duration of the hyponatremia, the severity of the hyponatremia, the presence and severity of symptoms, and the presence of preexisting intracranial pathology such as recent traumatic brain injury, recent intracranial surgery or hemorrhage, or an intracranial neoplasm or other space-occupying lesion  (

         Acute – If the hyponatremia has developed over a period of less than 48 hours, it is called "acute." Acute hyponatremia usually results from parenteral fluid administration in postoperative patients (who have ADH hypersecretion associated with surgery) and from self-induced water intoxication (as in, for example, competitive runners, psychotic patients with extreme polydipsia, and users of ecstasy).

         Patients with acute hyponatremia, most patients with severe hyponatremia (ie, serum sodium less than 120 mEq/L), and most patients with symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated in hospital settings that allow frequent assessments of the patient's neurologic condition, accurate measurements of urine output, and frequent measurements of the serum sodium concentration. By contrast, patients with mild hyponatremia and asymptomatic patients with moderate hyponatremia usually do not require hospitalization. (See

         The treatment of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients has four important goals: to prevent further declines in the serum sodium concentration, to decrease intracranial pressure in patients at risk for developing brain herniation, to relieve symptoms of hyponatremia, and to avoid excessive correction of hyponatremia in patients at risk for osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). Although some correction of hyponatremia is usually indicated in patients with severe hyponatremia, the goal of initial therapy is to raise the serum sodium concentration by 4 to 6 mEq/L in a 24-hour period. In symptomatic patients with acute hyponatremia or in patients with severe symptoms, this goal should be achieved quickly, over six hours or less. In patients with chronic, severe hyponatremia, the
         <strong>
          maximum rate of correction
         </strong>
         should be 8 mEq/L in any 24-hour period. (See

The frequency of monitoring can be decreased when the serum sodium has been raised by 4 to 6 mEq/L.
