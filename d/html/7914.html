It is a bacterial infection caused by six species in the spirochete family <em>Borreliaceae</em>. The taxonomy of these spirochetes is undergoing revision, and the genus name may be represented as either <em>Borrelia</em> or <em>Borreliella</em>. In either case, the abbreviation for the genus is "B" and stands for both terminologies in the discussion below. </p><p>In<em> </em>North America, infection<em> </em>is caused primarily by <em>B. burgdorferi</em> sensu stricto (hereafter called <em>B. burgdorferi</em>) and, less commonly, in a region of the upper Midwest, by <em>B. mayonii. </em>In Europe and Asia<em>, </em>infection is caused primarily by either <em>B. afzelii</em> or <em>B. garinii</em>, less commonly by <em>B. burgdorferi</em>, and rarely by <em>B. spielmanii</em> or <em>B. bavariensis</em>. There is a broad spectrum of manifestations, and severity of disease is due, in part, to differences in the infecting species.</p><p>The diagnosis of Lyme disease will be reviewed here. Specific considerations regarding the diagnosis of Lyme arthritis and neurologic Lyme disease, as well as topic reviews that discuss the microbiology, epidemiology, immunopathogenesis, clinical manifestations, treatment, and prevention of Lyme disease, are presented elsewhere.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16138.html" rel="external">"Microbiology of Lyme disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7901.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology of Lyme disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14008.html" rel="external">"Immunopathogenesis of Lyme disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7895.html" rel="external">"Prevention of Lyme disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7916.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of a tick bite for possible Lyme disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7913.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6038.html" rel="external">"Lyme disease: Clinical manifestations in children"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7915.html" rel="external">"Lyme carditis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7894.html" rel="external">"Musculoskeletal manifestations of Lyme disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15247.html" rel="external">"Nervous system Lyme disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7896.html" rel="external">"Treatment of Lyme disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3138672015"><span class="h1">CLINICAL SUSPICION FOR LYME DISEASE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of Lyme disease should be suspected in patients who are at risk of exposure to ticks carrying Lyme disease <strong>and</strong> have clinical manifestations that are consistent with Lyme disease. Once Lyme disease is suspected, the approach to diagnosis depends upon the stage of disease. (See <a class="local">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1713145474"><span class="h2">Risk of exposure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lyme disease is a spirochetal infection caused by <em>Borrelia</em> species (<em>B. burgdorferi</em> and <em>B. mayonii</em> in the United States, and primarily <em>B. afzelii</em> and <em>B. garinii</em> in Europe and Asia). The organisms are transmitted by the bite of infected <em>Ixodes </em>ticks<em> (I. scapularis</em>, <em>I. pacificus, I. persulcatus, I. ricinus</em>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16138.html" rel="external">"Microbiology of Lyme disease"</a>.)<em> </em></p><p>Patients are at risk for Lyme disease if they are from or have travelled to an endemic area. In the United States, the primary endemic areas include Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. State-specific information can be found on the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Flyme%2Fdatasurveillance%2Frecent-surveillance-data.html&amp;token=R4Uiw8%2FbmPVaqNHRDqpXLE8qSTr6WD53jFB3iDjH%2F%2F1ja1fdKLyzdpxJV%2FZkvbbG%2FDbe%2FbxD0lQFhPlLeJrx7IUo2a6fPQ9matsFF5VIgLY%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=7914" target="_blank">United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website</a>. In Europe, Lyme has been seen in many countries and is particularly prevalent in Central and Eastern Europe and southern parts of Nordic countries [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7901.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology of Lyme disease"</a>.)</p><p>Transmission is most likely to occur from May through October, with a peak in June in northeastern states. In addition, certain occupations and activities (eg, hiking, gardening) increase the likelihood of exposure. However, patients can still be at risk for Lyme disease if they are from an endemic area and do not report a specific exposure.</p><p>For clinicians in nonendemic areas for Lyme disease who see patients with possible Lyme disease, it is especially important to obtain a detailed travel and activity history, with inquiries about prior residences and prior clinical findings that might be consistent with manifestations of Lyme disease. Without this history, an erythema migrans (EM)-like skin lesion could be misdiagnosed as either a spider bite or as community-acquired cellulitis due to pyogenic bacteria. Such patients are often treated with a first-generation cephalosporin (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9231" href="/d/drug information/9231.html" rel="external">cephalexin</a>), which is ineffective for treating Lyme disease [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. </p><p>Similarly, an appropriate travel history can help distinguish Lyme disease from Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), an illness principally reported in the southeast and south-central regions of the United States. In patients with STARI, a skin lesion indistinguishable from EM occurs following the bite of the <em>Amblyomma americanum</em> tick, not the <em>Ixodes</em> species tick. <em>A. Americanum</em> ticks have been identified as far north as Maine, so the range of <em>A. americanum </em>and<em> I. scapularis</em> ticks now overlap. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7896.html" rel="external">"Treatment of Lyme disease", section on 'Early localized disease (single erythema migrans)'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3950868189"><span class="h2">Consistent clinical manifestations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical manifestations of Lyme disease can generally be divided into three phases: early localized, early disseminated, and late disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72018" data-inline-graphics="72018" href="/d/graphic/72018.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). However, the clinical features of each stage can overlap, and some patients present in a later stage of Lyme disease without a history of prior signs or symptoms suggestive of earlier Lyme disease:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Early localized disease is characterized by the appearance of the characteristic skin lesion, EM, with or without constitutional symptoms  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81270" data-inline-graphics="81270" href="/d/graphic/81270.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). EM usually occurs within one month following the tick bite.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Early disseminated disease is characterized by multiple EM lesions (that typically occur days to weeks after infection) and/or neurologic and/or cardiac findings (that typically occur weeks to months after infection). Some of these patients have no history of antecedent early localized Lyme disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Late Lyme disease is typically associated with intermittent or persistent arthritis involving one or a few large joints, especially the knee (sometimes preceded by migratory arthralgias). Symptoms may develop months or longer after the initial infection and are most likely to be the presenting manifestation of the disease when early disease is asymptomatic or misdiagnosed. In untreated patients, objective manifestations of late Lyme disease, such as monoarticular or oligoarticular arthritis, may persist for several years. On rare occasion, late Lyme disease can also present with neurologic problems, such as a subtle encephalopathy or polyneuropathy. </p><p></p><p>The clinical manifestations of Lyme disease are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7913.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6038.html" rel="external">"Lyme disease: Clinical manifestations in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3285368874"><span class="h2">When Lyme testing is not warranted</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Serologic testing for Lyme disease should<strong> not</strong> be performed: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For screening of asymptomatic patients who live in endemic areas</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For evaluation of patients who present only with nonspecific symptoms (eg, subacute or long-standing myalgias/arthralgias or fatigue)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We do not test these patients, since the use of serologic testing in populations with a low pre-test probability of Lyme disease results in a greater likelihood of false-positive test results than true-positive test results. As a consequence, asymptomatic patients and those with nonspecific articular or neurologic symptoms may be incorrectly diagnosed as having "chronic Lyme disease" and receive unnecessary antibiotics. In patients with noninflammatory musculoskeletal pain, cognitive complaints, fatigue, and/or irritability, alternative diagnoses should be considered, including chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, myofascial pain syndrome, polymyalgia rheumatica, hypothyroidism, inflammatory myopathies, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5624.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2740.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5625.html" rel="external">"Differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7757.html" rel="external">"Overview of soft tissue musculoskeletal disorders", section on 'Myofascial pain syndrome'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8235.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7893.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of and screening for hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In addition, we do <strong>not</strong> perform serologic testing for Lyme disease in asymptomatic patients after an <em>Ixodes</em> spp tick bite. The rationale for this approach is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7916.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of a tick bite for possible Lyme disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7916.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of a tick bite for possible Lyme disease", section on 'Serologic testing'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1249691140"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The approach to diagnosis in patients with suspected Lyme disease depends upon the stage of disease, and it is also impacted by having a history of prior infection. (See <a class="local">'Erythema migrans (single or multiple)'</a> below and <a class="local">'Early disseminated and late Lyme disease'</a> below and <a class="local">'Considerations in patients with prior Lyme disease'</a> below.)</p><p>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed a definition of Lyme disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63453" data-inline-graphics="63453" href="/d/graphic/63453.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Although this definition was not intended to be used by clinicians to make a diagnosis of Lyme disease, as it is not comprehensive, the vast majority of cases of Lyme disease in practice do fulfill the case definition. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1241987595"><span class="h2">Erythema migrans (single or multiple)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of erythema migrans (EM) should be made on clinical grounds alone when at least one characteristic EM lesion is present in a patient who lives in or has recently traveled to an endemic area  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81270" href="/d/graphic/81270.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67424" href="/d/graphic/67424.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Risk of exposure'</a> above and <a class="local">'Consistent clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>Serologic testing is neither required nor recommended in such patients, particularly if there is a single lesion, since the EM lesions often appear prior to development of a diagnostic, adaptive immune response, and patients who present with EM are often seronegative. In addition, serologic testing after treatment is generally not indicated since patients with EM who are treated early in their course may not develop an antibody response. Thus, a negative test result does not exclude the diagnosis. (See <a class="local">'Limitations of serologic testing'</a> below.)</p><p>However, if the cause of the skin lesion is in doubt, and empiric antimicrobial therapy is not administered, serologic testing is reasonable. Testing can be obtained at the time of presentation, and if negative, a repeat test can be performed two to three weeks later. In this setting, patients should be told to inform their provider if they develop clinical findings that become more suggestive of EM (eg, slowly expanding target-like rash); in that case, empiric treatment would be warranted. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7896.html" rel="external">"Treatment of Lyme disease"</a>.)</p><p>Another way to diagnose early Lyme disease is by performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for <em>B. burgdorferi</em> on a skin punch biopsy of at least 2 mm diameter taken from the margin of the skin lesion [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. However, this approach is not typically used since skin biopsies are not routinely performed in the primary care or urgent care setting, and PCR testing is not widely available for clinical use. (See <a class="local">'Polymerase chain reaction'</a> below.)</p><p>Although patients with EM may be spirochetemic, blood cultures for <em>B. burgdorferi</em> are not commercially available. (See <a class="local">'Culture'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1650333699"><span class="h2">Early disseminated and late Lyme disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with suspected early disseminated or late Lyme disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72018" href="/d/graphic/72018.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), serologic testing is usually warranted to support the diagnosis, except in patients with multiple erythema migrans, as described above. (See <a class="local">'Erythema migrans (single or multiple)'</a> above.)</p><p>Testing for antibodies to <em>B. burgdorferi</em> should be seen as an adjunct to the clinical diagnosis since, by itself, serologic testing can neither establish nor exclude the diagnosis of Lyme disease. A positive or negative serologic test result for Lyme disease simply changes the probability that a patient has been infected with <em>B. burgdorferi</em>. (See <a class="local">'Ability to confirm active disease'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, there are special considerations in patients with a known history of prior Lyme disease, since antibodies (including immunoglobulin [Ig] M) can persist for years. (See <a class="local">'Considerations in patients with prior Lyme disease'</a> below.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4152382273"><span class="h3">Serologic testing algorithms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A two-tiered conditional strategy is typically used to support the diagnosis of Lyme disease [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. This section will review specific testing algorithms. A more detailed discussion of the types of tests is found below. (See <a class="local">'Serologic tests'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H973948155"><span class="h4">Choosing an algorithm</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are two options for two-tiered serologic testing algorithms. The traditional algorithm includes an initial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or immunofluorescence assay (IFA) followed by a Western blot. Modified algorithms that include two sequential EIAs have been developed and validated; however, these modified algorithms may not be available in all clinical settings, and experience with them is more limited. </p><p>When laboratories offer both testing strategies, the choice between them should take into consideration the relative advantages for the individual patient. Specifically:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with suspected early disseminated Lyme disease who require testing (eg, those with cardiac or neurologic findings), a modified algorithm that uses two EIAs would be preferred, as this combination offers the greatest sensitivity and specificity in this setting. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with suspected late disease, the sensitivity and specificity of the traditional algorithm are equivalent to the modified algorithm; however, some experts prefer the traditional algorithm in this setting, since Western blot testing provides additional information that can be beneficial in the evaluation of more complex cases. </p><p></p><p>Descriptions of the individual algorithms are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Traditional two-tiered testing'</a> below and <a class="local">'Modified two-tiered algorithms'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27411097"><span class="h4">Traditional two-tiered testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The traditional two-tiered testing algorithm starts with a sensitive enzyme immunoassay, such as a whole cell-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In some cases, a different type of enzyme immunoassay (an IFA) is used [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. If the immunoassay result is negative, the diagnosis of either early disseminated or late Lyme disease is unlikely and no further testing is performed. (See <a class="local">'Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays'</a> below.)</p><p>If the immunoassay is positive, a more specific serologic test, the Western blot, is performed, typically with separate IgM and IgG blots. The IgM Western blot is considered positive if two of three particular bands are detected, and the IgG Western blot is considered positive if 5 of 10 particular bands are detected  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50882" data-inline-graphics="50882" href="/d/graphic/50882.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).

Detection of RST type 1 strains was equivalent. The lower sensitivity of the two-tiered approach was mainly due to decreased sensitivity of the Western blot. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h2">Interpretation of results in vaccine recipients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>LYMErix, the original Lyme disease vaccine interfered with the serologic diagnosis of Lyme disease by causing a positive ELISA [<a href="#rid35">35,50,51</a>]. However, this vaccine was withdrawn from the market in 2003 and is unlikely to explain a positive serologic response in patients being evaluated for Lyme disease. A new, second-generation OspA vaccine is currently undergoing clinical trials and may become available in the future. Although the impact on serologic testing has yet to be determined, the Western blot or the VlsE/PepC10 tests should not be impacted. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H28"><span class="h1">TESTS OF LIMITED OR UNCERTAIN VALUE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have cautioned clinicians that some commercial laboratories are performing assays for Lyme disease, the accuracy and clinical usefulness of which have not been adequately established [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. These tests include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on inappropriate specimens such as blood and urine, urine antigen tests [<a href="#rid53">53</a>], immunofluorescent staining for cell wall-deficient forms of <em>B. burgdorferi</em>, and lymphocyte transformation tests.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H29"><span class="h2">Polymerase chain reaction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used clinically to identify the presence of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or synovial fluid specimens [<a href="#rid54">54-59</a>]. PCR test results for <em>B. burgdorferi</em> are often positive in synovial fluid prior to antibiotic therapy [<a href="#rid56">56</a>].

However, a positive PCR result with negative serum antibody results is likely to be a false-positive result, and a positive PCR result does not prove that the patient has active infection, since spirochetal DNA may persist long after spirochetal killing has occurred. PCR identifies DNA in the specimen; it does not differentiate between infection with a live organism and the presence of remnant DNA from a prior, but cured, infection.

However, in research studies, <em>B. burgdorferi</em> has been isolated from skin biopsy specimens, blood, and CSF [<a href="#rid62">62,63</a>]. Two commonly used mediums are the modified Kelly-Pettenkofer and Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly II. </p><p>In a study of 65 adults with erythema migrans (EM), the yield of blood cultures increased from 46 percent using traditional blood culture methods to 71 percent when quantitative PCR was performed on blood culture samples following incubation [<a href="#rid64">64</a>]. Of the 46 patients with a positive PCR assay, 42 (91 percent) had a positive PCR result within seven days after the cultures began incubating. An important limitation of this study is that negative control samples were not included, so it is not possible to determine whether the additional positive samples were true positives. </p><p>In a cross-sectional study in which blood cultures for <em>B. burgdorferi</em> were obtained in 213 untreated adults with EM, spirochetemia was present in 44 percent during the early phases (the first several weeks) [<a href="#rid65">65</a>]. Spirochetemic patients were significantly more likely to be symptomatic (89 versus 74 percent) and have multiple lesions (42 versus 15 percent) than those without spirochetemia, 8 of 35 asymptomatic patients (23 percent) with a single skin lesion had a positive blood culture. The risk for spirochetemia was present the day the patient noticed the lesion and continued for more than two weeks.</p><p>In another study, blood cultures were positive in 5 of 26 untreated patients (19 percent) with early disseminated Lyme disease with neurologic, cardiac, or musculoskeletal involvement [<a href="#rid66">66</a>]. Patients with a positive blood culture had a shorter duration of symptoms compared with those with a negative blood culture (mean 14 versus 125 days, respectively). These findings suggest that spirochetemia occurs early in the course of infection. Positive blood cultures were associated with the presence of a concomitant EM lesion; positive blood cultures occurred in four of nine patients (44 percent) with EM versus 1 of 17 patients (6 percent) without EM. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H31"><span class="h2">Urinary antigen testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, most urinary antigen tests are of no proven value in the diagnosis or management of Lyme disease and are not recommended [<a href="#rid53">53</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1553471810"><span class="h2">Testing ticks</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although testing of individual <em>Ixodes</em> ticks recovered from patients for <em>B. burgdorferi</em> by PCR is available commercially, most experts do not recommend testing of ticks, since the results do not affect clinical management [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. If an <em>Ixodes</em> tick has been attached for less than 36 hours, it is unlikely to have transmitted disease, and no prophylaxis should be offered, even if PCR is positive. By contrast, if the tick has been attached for ≥36 hours, then prophylaxis is recommended, and a delay in initiation of prophylaxis while awaiting results of testing could be detrimental.

Once Lyme disease is suspected, the approach to diagnosis depends upon the stage of infection. (See <a class="local">'Clinical suspicion for Lyme disease'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Patients with erythema migrans</strong> – The diagnosis of erythema migrans (EM) should be made on clinical grounds alone when one or more characteristic EM lesion is present in a patient who lives in or has recently traveled to an endemic area  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81270" href="/d/graphic/81270.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67424" href="/d/graphic/67424.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Erythema migrans (single or multiple)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Patients with early disseminated or late infection</strong> – In patients with suspected early disseminated (other than multiple EM) or late Lyme disease, serologic testing is warranted to support the diagnosis. However, testing for antibodies to <em>B. burgdorferi</em> should be seen as an adjunct to the clinical diagnosis, since, by itself, serologic testing can neither establish nor exclude the diagnosis of Lyme disease. (See <a class="local">'Early disseminated and late Lyme disease'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>No role for screening of asymptomatic patients or patients with nonspecific symptoms</strong> – Serologic testing for Lyme disease should<strong> not</strong> be performed to screen asymptomatic patients who live in endemic areas (even if they had a known <em>Ixodes </em>spp tick bite) or for evaluation of patients who present only with nonspecific symptoms (eg, sub-acute or long-standing myalgias/arthralgias or fatigue). (See <a class="local">'When Lyme testing is not warranted'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Specific diagnostic tests</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Serologic tests</strong> – When testing is indicated, a two-tiered conditional strategy should be used to support the diagnosis of Lyme disease. Two-tiered testing can be performed using an initial enzyme-linked immunosorbent immunoassay (ELISA) or immunofluorescence assay, followed by either a Western blot (traditional two-tiered testing) or by a second ELISA that uses a different target (modified two-tiered testing). (See <a class="local">'Serologic testing algorithms'</a> above and <a class="local">'Serologic tests'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Synovial and cerebrospinal tests</strong> – Testing of cerebrospinal or synovial fluid may be needed to support a diagnosis of Lyme disease in patients with evidence of aseptic meningitis, radiculoneuritis, or Lyme arthritis. This is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15247.html" rel="external">"Nervous system Lyme disease", section on 'Diagnosis and differential diagnosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7894.html" rel="external">"Musculoskeletal manifestations of Lyme disease", section on 'Diagnosis of Lyme arthritis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Use of laboratory tests other than ELISA, Western blot, and in limited cases, polymerase chain reaction, should <strong>not</strong> be used to support a diagnosis of Lyme disease. (See <a class="local">'Tests of limited or uncertain value'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Limited role of testing in patients with prior Lyme disease</strong> – Some patients with prior Lyme disease may present with new symptoms after resolution of a previous infection or may have persistent symptoms that fail to improve despite appropriate treatment. Depending upon the clinical presentation, such patients may have reinfection with a new organism, post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or post-infectious arthritis. These diagnoses are often based upon epidemiologic and clinical findings. Serologic testing is rarely helpful in patients with prior Lyme disease since antibodies (including immunoglobulin [Ig]M) can persist for years.
