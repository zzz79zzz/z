         Unipolar depression is a major public health problem associated with increased functional disability and mortality. The illness likely represents a group of heterogeneous disorders that are phenotypically similar [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Depression can thus be considered the final common pathway of different disease processes that occur across a biopsychosocial continuum. Efforts to understand the pathogenesis of depression, including its genetic basis, are intended to discern these different diseases or subtypes.

         This topic reviews the genetic basis of unipolar depression. Other aspects of the pathogenesis of unipolar depression are discussed separately, as are the neurobiology, clinical features, assessment, diagnosis, and initial treatment of unipolar depression:

         Unipolar major depression is likely due to genetic effects as well as environmental influences specific to the individual, with altered gene expression occurring during brain development and in response to stress [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-9
         </a>
         ]. Genes probably contribute vulnerability toward depression that requires additional nongenetic environmental factors to produce the disorder.

         Evidence that genetic effects are involved in the pathogenesis of unipolar depression includes the following:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         In a meta-analysis of six twin studies involving more than 21,000 individuals [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ] and a subsequent study of more than 15,000 twin pairs [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ], the concordance rate for major depression in monozygotic twins was 37 and 38 percent. Thus, environmental factors accounted for most of the risk for major depression.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         A national registry study identified monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs, full siblings who were reared together or apart, and half siblings who were reared together or apart (total n &gt;1.7 million pairs), to estimate the proportion of risk for unipolar major depression that was due to genetic factors or variation (heritability) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. The relative contribution of genetic factors to major depression in males was 36 to 41 percent and in females was 49 to 51 percent; the remaining contribution was attributable to either nonshared or shared environmental factors.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, it appears that the genetic basis of major depression stems from multiple small genetic effects. A genome-wide association meta-analysis of seven studies included patients with unipolar depressive syndromes (n &gt;130,000) and nondepressed controls (n &gt;340,000) and found 44 independent and significant loci; 30 were newly discovered and 14 were previously identified [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Gene expression patterns in the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate, areas involved in executive functions and emotion, differed between cases and controls.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although some studies have failed to identify genes associated with major depression [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12-16
         </a>
         ], these failures may be due to the heterogeneity of the disorder [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) minimized heterogeneity by examining only Chinese women (n &gt;5000) with recurrent episodes of major depression and no substance use disorders prior to onset of major depression; the controls (n &gt;5000) were individuals who had no personal or family psychiatric history [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Two loci on chromosome 10 were associated with major depression, and the findings were replicated in a separate sample of Chinese cases and controls.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another reason that some studies have failed to identify causal loci for unipolar major depression is that their small effects necessitate large samples. Relatively large studies that have identified genes associated with depression include the following:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         A meta-analysis of three GWAS data sets, which included more than 130,000 patients with a history of depressive syndromes and more than 340,000 controls, identified 15 independent loci (17 single nucleotide polymorphisms) associated with depression [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Some of these variants were replicated in a subsequent study [
         <a href="#rid20">

         A genome-wide association meta-analysis of seven studies found 44 significant loci, utilizing data from more than 130,000 patients with unipolar depressive syndromes and more than 340,000 controls [

         A meta-analysis of three GWAS data sets required more than 160,000 individuals to identify two genetic variants associated with depressive symptoms [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the validity of the results may be limited because several studies identified cases of depression based upon self-report data rather than administering structured interviews [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Some studies have focused upon both genes and environmental factors, and how their interaction causes depression; however, the findings have not been consistently replicated [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22,23
         </a>
         ]. As an example, several studies reported that an interaction between the short allele of the serotonin transporter gene and stressful life events increased the risk for depression [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24-26
         </a>
         ]. However, a meta-analysis of 14 studies (n &gt;14,000 participants) found that the serotonin transporter genotype did not add anything to the prediction of increased risk of depression associated with stressful life events and thus failed to confirm this association [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. One plausible mechanism by which gene-environment interactions may lead to depression is epigenetic changes [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. (See

         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. As an example, one twin study found that the heritability of major depression was higher in women compared with men (42 versus 29 percent) [

         The interaction between genetic effects and environmental influences may differ between females and males. A study of adolescents (n &gt;1000) found that in females, the

         SL genotype was associated with a decreased risk of depressive symptoms independent of social context [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. However, among males, the protective effect occurred only in the context of socioeconomic deprivation.

         A meta-analysis of three studies examined gene expression across three brain regions, using postmortem brains from subjects with unipolar major depression (24 females and 26 males) and from sex-matched controls [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30

         ]. Among depressed females and female controls, there were 882 differentially expressed genes (524 upregulated and 358 downregulated). Among depressed males and male controls, there were 706 genes that were differentially expressed (252 upregulated and 454 downregulated). Only 73 differentially expressed genes were shared by both females and males with depression, and 52 of these were changed in the opposite direction.

         A study examined gene expression in six brain regions, using postmortem brains from people with unipolar major depression (n = 13 males and 13 females) and control subjects (n = 13 males and 9 females) [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31

         ]. Gene expression in all six regions differed between female depressed subjects and female controls, and differed between male depressed subjects and male controls. In addition, the overlap between female and male depressed subjects was only 5 to 10 percent, depending upon the brain region. The findings were largely replicated in a second set of subjects (n = 50).

         The sexual dimorphism in the genetics of depression is consistent with differences between women and men in the prevalence of unipolar major depression, which occurs twice as often in women. (See

         Epigenetic changes refers to modifications of chromosomes that do not alter the nucleotide base sequence, but nevertheless increase or decrease gene expression. Examples include methylation of DNA or acetylation of histones. These modifications may occur in response to environmental factors such as adverse life events or chronic stress, and may thus serve as a mechanism by which adversity increases the risk of mental illness [

          35,36
