         Hypoglycemia is an uncommon clinical problem in individuals without diabetes mellitus. It can occur in the fasting or postprandial state, and some individuals experience both fasting and postprandial hypoglycemia. Fulfillment of Whipple's triad supports the presence of pathologic rather than physiologic hypoglycemia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whipple's triad comprises the following:

         For individuals with evidence of a hypoglycemic disorder (ie, confirmed fulfillment of Whipple's triad or high clinical suspicion based on home glucose monitoring), a thorough clinical history and physical examination can help identify the most likely cause(s) of the hypoglycemia and inform the next steps in evaluation. Subsequent evaluation depends on whether an insulin- or insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-dependent cause of hypoglycemia is suspected as the underlying etiology. If either etiology is suspected, additional laboratory measurements should be obtained during a spontaneous or provoked episode of hypoglycemia  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73797" href="/z/d/graphic/73797.html" rel="external">

         This topic will review the etiologic evaluation of hypoglycemia in individuals without diabetes. An overview of the causes of hypoglycemia and their clinical manifestations are discussed separately  (

         ), as is the diagnostic evaluation to establish the presence of a hypoglycemic disorder in adults without diabetes. The evaluation and management of hypoglycemia in patients with drug-treated diabetes mellitus are also reviewed separately. (See

         For individuals with evidence of a hypoglycemic disorder (ie, confirmed fulfillment of Whipple's triad or high clinical suspicion based on home glucose monitoring), the patient's overall health status and a thorough clinical history can help identify the most likely cause(s) of hypoglycemia and determine the next steps in evaluation  (

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although hypoglycemia may be classified in a variety of ways, a clinically useful strategy is based on whether the patient has underlying illness or is seemingly healthy [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. The context in which hypoglycemia occurs (eg, in an inpatient versus outpatient setting), the presence of comorbid conditions, and current medication use all inform this distinction. The major causes of hypoglycemia based on this classification are listed in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78919" href="/z/d/graphic/78919.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). Once clinical suspicion for a hypoglycemic disorder is high, a detailed clinical and biochemical evaluation is usually required for healthy individuals, whereas in ill or medicated patients, the cause of hypoglycemia may be readily recognized as a consequence of underlying illness or its treatment [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].

         </span>
         In individuals who have no underlying medical conditions, take no medications, and feel otherwise well, the most likely etiologies of hypoglycemia are endogenous hyperinsulinism or factitious hypoglycemia  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78919" href="/z/d/graphic/78919.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         These individuals should undergo additional, supervised testing to confirm the presence of hypoglycemia (if not previously confirmed with laboratory testing) and distinguish between these potential etiologies. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Supervised testing'

         In individuals with comorbid conditions who have hypoglycemia, the cause often can be determined based on clinical history alone. Clinical history may indicate a non-insulin-mediated etiology such as cortisol deficiency, critical illness, kidney or liver dysfunction, or a previously diagnosed mesenchymal tumor. In such individuals, initial evaluation should focus on the suspected underlying cause  (

          algorithm 1

         ). Hospitalized patients can present unique diagnostic challenges. In such patients, hypoglycemia is often multifactorial and iatrogenic. (See

         </span>
         Although adrenal insufficiency is not the most common cause of hypoglycemia in ill individuals, this etiology should always be considered first because acute cortisol deficiency can be life-threatening if untreated. Weight loss, weakness, hyponatremia, and fatigue, particularly in the setting of a personal or family history of autoimmunity, suggest adrenal insufficiency as the underlying cause of hypoglycemia. If due to cortisol deficiency, hypoglycemia virtually always will be accompanied by other signs and symptoms supporting this etiology; these are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See

         In patients with suspected adrenal insufficiency, diagnostic testing is the next step in evaluation and is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See

         Medications and excessive alcohol ingestion are common causes of hypoglycemia. Alcohol intake (eg, binge drinking) should be assessed, and all prescription and nonprescription medications should be reviewed in detail. Inspection of pills and bottles is important to identify prescription or dispensing errors. In hospitalized patients, careful examination of the medical and drug administration records is critical. Patients also should be queried about any home medications or supplements that they have continued while hospitalized. Medications other than those used to treat diabetes can cause hypoglycemia  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52892" href="/z/d/graphic/52892.html" rel="external">
          table 3

        <p>
         If medication- or alcohol-related hypoglycemia is possible based on clinical history, the suspected agent should be withdrawn. If the hypoglycemia resolves, this etiology is confirmed, and no additional evaluation is needed. If hypoglycemia persists, additional evaluation is warranted and reviewed immediately below.

         – Patients who have undergone gastric bypass surgery may have underlying postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. This etiology is supported by a history of predominantly postprandial hypoglycemia. If post-gastric bypass patients report hypoglycemia after high-carbohydrate meals, the first step in evaluation should be dietary modification. (See

         Sepsis, other critical illness, or acute or chronic kidney or liver dysfunction can be the primary etiology of hypoglycemia or play a contributory role. However, these causes of hypoglycemia are a diagnosis of exclusion.

        <p>
         A careful clinical history should be obtained to verify that hypoglycemia developed in parallel with the illness or kidney or liver impairment. The concurrent evolution of hypoglycemia with either illness or organ dysfunction corroborates this etiology. If hypoglycemia developed before the onset of critical illness or organ dysfunction or if uncertainty otherwise persists, supervised testing to assess for other causes of hypoglycemia is usually warranted.

         Supervised testing (supervised fast or mixed meal test) should be performed in individuals with evidence of a hypoglycemic disorder in whom an insulin- or insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-mediated cause is suspected or those in whom the underlying cause is uncertain. This evaluation should only be performed in individuals in whom clinical suspicion is high for an underlying hypoglycemic disorder (ie, those with evidence of all three criteria for Whipple's triad or clinical history and fingerstick blood glucose measurements that raise suspicion for pathologic hypoglycemia). Supervised testing, including the decision to proceed with such testing, should be performed by an endocrinologist. The diagnostic evaluation for a hypoglycemic disorder must precede supervised testing and is reviewed separately. (See

         When clinical suspicion for a hypoglycemic disorder is based on home glucose monitoring, the purpose of supervised testing is to document Whipple's triad and establish the mechanism of hypoglycemia [

         ]. If Whipple's triad has already been established through laboratory glucose measurement, then a supervised test may be necessary to establish the mechanism of hypoglycemia. Laboratory tests obtained during hypoglycemia specifically assess the etiologic role of insulin or an IGF. Thus, supervised testing should be performed only if these are the most likely etiologies of hypoglycemia or no specific etiology can be discerned from the clinical history and physical examination.

          Testing to provoke hypoglycemia
         </strong>
         – If a patient is not evaluated during a spontaneous episode of symptomatic hypoglycemia, provocative testing is required. The choice of provocative test depends on both clinical history and logistical considerations  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef141451" href="/z/d/graphic/141451.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 2

         ). If symptoms occur primarily in the fasting state, testing should be performed during a supervised fast. If the patient has a history of exclusively postprandial symptoms, a mixed meal test should be performed. The choice of appropriate test is important, as patients with hypoglycemic disorders that cause only postprandial hypoglycemia can have normal findings on a 72-hour fast. If the timing of hypoglycemia in relation to meals is uncertain, we proceed with a supervised fast. (See

         Institutions have different protocols for the collection of venipuncture samples during a mixed meal test. In some centers, venous blood samples are collected prior to ingestion of the meal and once the patient's typical hypoglycemic symptoms develop. In other institutions, samples are collected prior to ingestion of the meal and every 30 minutes thereafter until one of the test endpoints is met. With either protocol, venous blood samples are collected by venipuncture for measurement of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels at each time point.

         When either endpoint is met, a final blood collection should be performed with an additional sample drawn for an oral hypoglycemic agent (sulfonylureas and meglitinides) screen. After final blood samples are collected, the patient should be given food (eg, approximately 15 g of rapidly available carbohydrate). Carbohydrate administration will both correct hypoglycemia if present and verify whether symptoms resolve with reversal of hypoglycemia (the third criterion of Whipple's triad). Another plasma glucose level should be obtained by venipuncture once symptoms improve to verify reversal of hypoglycemia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Blood samples from each time point are sent for measurement of glucose concentrations. The final samples collected for insulin and C-peptide levels and the oral hypoglycemic agent screen should be analyzed only if collected when plasma glucose is &lt;65 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L)

         Standards for the interpretation of the mixed meal test are not well established, and the interpretation of test results obtained during a supervised fast are generally applied to the mixed meal text. However, the interpretation of insulin levels in the postprandial state is more difficult than in the fasting state as circulating concentrations represent the net sum of both insulin secretion and clearance. Insulin has a half-life of approximately 5 minutes in individuals with normal kidney function. Therefore, postprandial insulin levels may reflect the clearance rate rather than the rate of secretion in response to nutrient ingestion. Nevertheless, irrespective of clearance rates, an appropriately suppressed insulin level (&lt;3 microU/mL [20.8 pmol/L]) can exclude hyperinsulinism as the cause of hypoglycemia. (See

A suppressed insulin level (&lt;3 microU/mL [20.8 pmol/L]) suggests non-insulin-mediated causes of hypoglycemia (eg, alcohol, medications [other than antihyperglycemic agents], toxins, malnourishment, cortisol deficiency).

         Healthy individuals do not have neuroglycopenic symptoms after a prolonged fast because of hormonally mediated increases in glucose production and/or lipolysis and ketone body production. During fasting, the energy substrate for organ function partially shifts from glucose to free fatty acids. Gluconeogenesis accounts for approximately 50 percent of glucose production after an overnight fast and for almost all glucose production after ≥42 hours of fasting [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. A prolonged fast will result in hypoglycemia only if the ability to maintain normoglycemia is compromised due, for example, to an excess of insulin, which inhibits both endogenous glucose production and ketogenesis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The purpose of the supervised fast is to provoke the homeostatic responses that prevent glucose from falling to concentrations that cause hypoglycemic symptoms. Increased release of

         The choice of setting depends on patient characteristics and institutional resources. For some patients who report consistent symptoms after a short period of food withdrawal (eg, 8 to 12 hours), we initially choose the outpatient setting for the supervised fast. Prolonged observation in the office or clinic after an overnight fast may result in an episode of symptomatic hypoglycemia [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ] and avoids the logistical challenges and inconvenience of an inpatient fast. If this approach fails to elicit hypoglycemia but clinical suspicion remains high, the patient should undergo a supervised 72-hour fast in the inpatient setting. For other patients, particularly those at risk for hypoglycemia-related morbidity (eg, older adults, those with comorbidities), we initially proceed with the inpatient 72-hour fast. The fast should be performed only under the supervision of experienced personnel. A detailed approach to the supervised fast is reviewed below. (See

         The outpatient fast typically lasts up to 20 to 24 hours (depending on when the patient initiates the overnight fast and the duration of clinic hours), whereas the inpatient fast lasts up to 72 hours. In either setting, the fast is terminated prior to maximal duration if any of the test endpoints is met. (See

         Fasting for a maximum of 72 hours has been the standard test for the diagnosis of insulinoma. A 48-hour maximum has been proposed as a shorter alternative based on a report of 127 patients with insulinoma, all of whom had screening glucose values &lt;45 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L), in which adequate diagnostic information was obtained in all patients within 48 hours [
         <a href="#rid8">

         ]. The fast was terminated because of neuroglycopenic symptoms and biochemical hypoglycemia (plasma glucose ≤45 mg/dL [2.5 mmol/L]) in 43 percent of patients by 12 hours, 67 percent by 24 hours, and 95 percent by 48 hours. The rationale for extending a fast beyond 48 hours arises from a series of 205 patients with surgically confirmed insulinoma, in which 7 percent of patients who underwent an extended supervised fast did not develop hypoglycemia with neuroglycopenic symptoms within 48 hours of fasting [

         A careful record should be kept of all procedures, collected blood samples, plans for laboratory analyses, glucose values, and any symptoms experienced by the patient. Blood samples and laboratory slips must be carefully labeled, particularly with the exact time of collection, and sample labeling information should also be recorded on a flow sheet. The subsequent interpretation of laboratory results will require these details. (See

         – Careful questioning and testing for subtle symptoms or signs of neuroglycopenia should be conducted repeatedly when the glucose is near or in the hypoglycemic range. Simple tests of cognitive function may be indicated (eg, basic arithmetic questions, counting backwards from 100). Ending the fast in the absence of symptoms or signs of hypoglycemia jeopardizes the ability to discriminate between physiologic and pathologic hypoglycemia. A low plasma glucose is a necessary, but not sufficient, finding for the diagnosis of hypoglycemia.

        </p>
        <p>
         Laboratory data are reliably interpretable only if plasma glucose is &lt;55 mg/dL (3 mmol/L) at the end of the fast. The corresponding insulin concentration helps determine whether the low glucose resulted from hyperinsulinism or another cause. When plasma glucose is in the hypoglycemic range, the normal fasting reference ranges for plasma insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, and BHB concentrations cannot be applied; rather, the etiologic evaluation of hypoglycemia requires unique diagnostic thresholds for each of these analytes. The interpretation of these laboratory results is shown in the table and algorithm  (

         – In patients with hypoglycemia due to endogenous hyperinsulinism who have a negative oral hypoglycemic agent screen, the degree of elevation in plasma C-peptide and proinsulin levels may be helpful for suggesting either insulinoma or insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia as the underlying etiology.

         </strong>
         – Marked elevation in C-peptide and proinsulin levels (eg, &gt;10 times the diagnostic threshold) can support an underlying etiology of insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia, which is caused by antibodies to endogenous insulin or to the insulin receptor. In patients with suspected insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia, autoantibodies to insulin and the insulin receptor (when possible) should be measured to distinguish insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia from other causes of endogenous hyperinsulinism  (

         In insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia and associated symptoms can occur postprandially, fasting, or in both states. In patients with insulin autoantibodies, the presumptive mechanism underlying hypoglycemia is that insulin secreted in response to a meal initially binds to the circulating antibodies, which block insulin action and cause hyperglycemia. Subsequently, insulin disassociates from the antibodies in an unregulated fashion, causing hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia. In patients with antibodies to the insulin receptor, hypoglycemia occurs due to antibody activation of the receptor.

         – Patients with predominantly fasting hypoglycemia who have mild to moderate elevations in C-peptide and proinsulin levels most likely have underlying insulinoma. Higher levels of insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide (though still below those seen in insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia) may suggest the presence of a malignant rather than benign insulinoma [

         ], and the proinsulin level may be disproportionately elevated in less differentiated tumors. This disproportionate elevation in proinsulin level is therefore one of the features that may indicate the need for increased surveillance after insulinoma resection. (See

         With insulinoma, the BHB level is low (≤2.7 mmol/L) due to insulin-mediated suppression of ketogenesis. Once endogenous hyperinsulinism has been established as the cause of hypoglycemia, further evaluation is warranted to localize the insulinoma. Localizing studies should

          Postprandial hypoglycemia
         </strong>
         – Mild to moderate elevations in plasma insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin values are found with noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome (NIPHS), a form of endogenous hyperinsulinemia due to islet hypertrophy and nesidioblastosis (the neodifferentiation of islet of Langerhans cells from pancreatic duct epithelium). An unusual feature of this disorder is that hypoglycemia occurs postprandially, two to four hours after a meal. Fasting hypoglycemia, characteristic of insulinoma, is rare in this disorder. Nesidioblastosis has also been described in patients with post-gastric bypass postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Selective arterial calcium stimulation can help distinguish insulinoma from NIPHS as the etiology of hypoglycemia. (See

         If the venous glucose is low (&lt;55 mg/dL [3 mmol/L]) and the corresponding insulin level is &lt;3 microU/mL (20.8 pmol/L), the hypoglycemia is unlikely to be mediated by insulin. However, measurement of the plasma insulin level may be erroneous or misleading in some circumstances. Plasma insulin measured by ICMA may be artifactually low due to hemolysis after blood sample collection. Some insulin assays detect only human insulin, whereas others detect both human insulin and synthetic insulin analogs. Consequently, depending on the assay employed, an insulin level &lt;3 microU/mL (20.8 pmol/L) may not exclude exogenous insulin as a cause of hypoglycemia. Interpretation of the plasma insulin level therefore requires that the clinician know which insulin assay is used and whether the assay measures human insulin, insulin analogs, or both. If exogenous insulin administration is suspected, blood samples obtained during supervised testing at the time of hypoglycemia should be used to measure specific synthetic insulin analogs (eg, glargine, detemir, lispro, aspart).

         – A low BHB level indicates that ketogenesis is suppressed, either by insulin or an IGF. Patients with a low venous glucose level, appropriately suppressed insulin secretion, and suppressed ketogenesis may have IGF-mediated hypoglycemia, also referred to as nonislet cell tumor hypoglycemia. This etiology of hypoglycemia is a paraneoplastic syndrome in which a tumor produces IGF-2 or its precursor pro-IGF-2. IGF-2 and pro-IGF-2 can lower glucose levels and suppress ketogenesis through activation of the insulin receptor, and hypoglycemia further may be potentiated by the high metabolic needs of the tumor. Such tumors are rarely occult, and IGF-related hypoglycemia in patients with known malignancy and large tumor burden can be identified by measuring free IGF-2, pro-IGF-2, and IGF-1 (to determine the ratio of IGF-2 to IGF-1). Values for these measurements that are above the upper limit of the laboratory reference range confirm the diagnosis. A healthy individual with hypoglycemia is unlikely to have nonislet cell tumor hypoglycemia. (See

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10

          Initial assessment to determine the etiology
         </strong>
         – For individuals with evidence of a hypoglycemic disorder (ie, confirmed fulfillment of Whipple's triad or high clinical suspicion based on home glucose monitoring), the patient's overall health status and a thorough clinical history can help identify the most likely cause(s) of the hypoglycemia and inform the next steps in evaluation  (

          Healthy individuals
         </strong>
         – In individuals who have no underlying medical conditions, take no medications, and feel otherwise well, the most likely etiology of hypoglycemia is endogenous hyperinsulinism or factitious hypoglycemia  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78919" href="/z/d/graphic/78919.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). Supervised testing should be performed to further evaluate these potential etiologies. (See

          Ill or medicated individuals
         </strong>
         – In individuals with underlying illness or comorbid conditions, the cause of hypoglycemia often can be determined based on clinical history alone  (

          algorithm 1

         ). In such patients, medications and alcohol use are the most common causes of hypoglycemia  (

          Supervised testing
         </strong>
         – The purpose of supervised testing is to document Whipple's triad and establish the mechanism of hypoglycemia. If Whipple's triad has already been established, then a supervised test may be necessary for etiologic evaluation. This evaluation can be performed during an episode of fortuitously observed spontaneous hypoglycemia but usually requires provocative testing to elicit hypoglycemia  (

          Mixed meal test for postprandial hypoglycemia

         – For individuals who experience exclusively postprandial hypoglycemia, the mixed meal test should be performed for further diagnostic evaluation. For this test, the patient consumes a non-liquid meal and is then observed for up to five hours [

          Supervised fast for fasting hypoglycemia
         </strong>
         – For individuals who experience predominantly fasting hypoglycemia, a supervised fast should be performed. The fast may be performed in the outpatient or inpatient setting. During the fast, if the glucose level is &lt;55 mg/dL (3 mmol/L) by laboratory measurement, additional blood samples should be sent for measurement of insulin, proinsulin, C-peptide, and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels, as well as an oral hypoglycemic agent screen.

          Interpretation of the supervised fast results
         </strong>
         – Laboratory test results help discriminate between insulin- and non-insulin-mediated causes of hypoglycemia but will not identify all potential etiologies of hypoglycemia  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56314" href="/z/d/graphic/56314.html" rel="external">

          algorithm 3
         </a>
         ). Additional testing may be required to verify the cause. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Interpretation of supervised fast results'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         If the fast was terminated before test endpoints were achieved but was continued for ≥18 hours, findings may be sufficient to exclude an underlying hypoglycemic disorder  (
