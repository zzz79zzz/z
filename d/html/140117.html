The clinician typically makes a provisional clinical diagnosis based upon the character of bleeding (eg, volume, associated with pain or painless, type of pain) and physical examination; imaging tests are used to support or revise the initial diagnosis.</p><p>The evaluation and differential diagnosis of vaginal bleeding in the second half of pregnancy (ie, 20 weeks or more of gestation) are discussed here. The evaluation and differential diagnosis of vaginal bleeding in the first half of pregnancy (ie, up to 20 weeks of gestation) are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6799.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and differential diagnosis of vaginal bleeding before 20 weeks of gestation"</a>.)</p><p>The management of pregnant patients with vaginal bleeding in the second half of pregnancy depends on numerous factors, including the gestational age, the cause of bleeding, the severity of bleeding, and fetal status. Management is discussed in the individual topic reviews on the specific causes of vaginal bleeding in this gestational age range.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3853058527"><span class="h1">INCIDENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Vaginal bleeding in the second half of pregnancy is estimated to occur in 2 to 7 percent of pregnancies prior to the onset of labor [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>]. Reported incidence varies widely depending on the definition of bleeding and method of case ascertainment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H743538603"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2029059043"><span class="h2">Site</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The site of patient evaluation depends upon the gestational age, severity of bleeding, and presence of other symptoms. Patients more than 20 to 22 weeks of gestation with more than spotting, lightheadedness/syncope, and/or pelvic pain warrant prompt evaluation on the labor and delivery unit where appropriate personnel and resources are available in the event of preterm birth of potentially viable newborn. Patients with spotting and no other symptoms may be evaluated in an office setting.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4049552133"><span class="h2">Goal</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goal of the evaluation is to make a definitive diagnosis when possible and exclude the presence of serious pathology in the remaining cases. The exact etiology of vaginal bleeding often cannot be determined, especially when bleeding is light [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4028190042"><span class="h2">History</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H152026916"><span class="h3">Has an intrauterine pregnancy been documented?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once an intrauterine pregnancy has been documented by ultrasound, an extrauterine pregnancy as the cause of bleeding is highly unlikely. Extrauterine intra-abdominal ectopic pregnancy or cornual ectopic pregnancy are rare exceptions as they may be erroneously reported as a normal intrauterine pregnancy if the sonographer does not carefully evaluate the relationship between the pregnancy and myometrium. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/132045.html" rel="external">"Abdominal pregnancy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1751540611"><span class="h3">What are the characteristics of the bleeding?</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Substantial bleeding with uterine contractions and abdominal pain</strong> – Substantial vaginal bleeding (eg, soaking a peripad, passage of clots) is usually related to placenta previa or placenta abruption. The presence of uterine tenderness, contractions, and abdominal pain often distinguish an abruption from a previa, but an ultrasound is usually required because a minority of abruptions are not associated with significant uterine pain/tenderness or contractions and a minority of previas are associated with these symptoms. Ultrasound will confirm the diagnosis of placenta previa if present; abruption is the likely diagnosis if previa is absent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See <a class="local">'Placental abruption'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See <a class="local">'Placenta previa'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Light bleeding with abdominal pain, hypotension, tachycardia</strong> – Light vaginal bleeding associated with constant abdominal pain accompanied by signs of intra-abdominal hemorrhage (eg, hypotension, tachycardia, increasing abdominal girth) are presumptive signs and symptoms of uterine rupture or extensive placental abruption. However, the degree, character, and location of pain are often variable, and the signs and symptoms of intra-abdominal or intrauterine bleeding can be subtle. Uterine rupture is most common in patients with a previous transmyometrial incision (eg, previous cesarean or myomectomy), and more common intrapartum than antepartum. (See <a class="local">'Uterine rupture (in patients with previous hysterotomy)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Light bleeding with no or minimal abdominal pain or contractions</strong> – Vaginal bleeding that is light, intermittent, and painless or associated with minimal abdominal pain and uterine irritability may be related to cervical insufficiency, a small placental abruption, placenta previa, a cervical or vaginal lesion (eg, polyp, infection, cancer), or impending labor ("bloody show").</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See <a class="local">'Cervical insufficiency'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See <a class="local">'Placental abruption'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See <a class="local">'Placenta previa'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See <a class="local">'Cervical or vaginal lesions'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See <a class="local">'Bloody show'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2407714343"><span class="h3">Is there a recent history of trauma?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The possibility of abruption should always be considered in patients who are being evaluated for trauma (eg, motor vehicle crash, fall, domestic violence), especially if there was direct abdominal trauma. (See <a class="local">'Placental abruption'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H852919546"><span class="h2">Focused physical examination</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3735954732"><span class="h3">Abdominal examination</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Uterine size, tenderness, tone</strong> – An abdominal examination is performed to assess uterine size, tenderness, and tone. The normal gravid uterus at 20 to 22 weeks is palpable at approximately the level of the umbilicus. After 20 to 22 weeks, the symphysis-to-fundal height measured in centimeters should correlate with the week of gestation. The normal uterus is soft similar to a relaxed skeletal muscle and nontender; bleeding associated with uterine firmness or rigidity and tenderness suggests abruption. (See <a class="local">'Placental abruption'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A smaller than expected uterine size associated with abdominal pain and/or contractions in a bleeding patient could be a sign of uterine rupture, with extrusion of the fetus, although this is rare. (See <a class="local">'Uterine rupture (in patients with previous hysterotomy)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fetal cardiac activity</strong> – Absence of fetal cardiac activity on transabdominal ultrasound confirms fetal demise, which may be a consequence of the disorder responsible for the bleeding (eg, abruption, uterine rupture, vasa previa).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Inability to detect fetal cardiac activity by handheld Doppler ultrasound or a stethoscope is subject to clinician error and should always be confirmed by ultrasound examination. On the other hand, Doppler confirmation of fetal cardiac activity is reliable and reassuring, unless maternal tachycardia is present and misinterpreted as the fetal heart rate (simultaneously checking the maternal pulse can exclude this possibility). Doppler confirmation of fetal cardiac activity in a twin pregnancy may be misleading as a single fetal demise may be missed; ultrasound examination is required. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See <a class="local">'Placental abruption'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See <a class="local">'Uterine rupture (in patients with previous hysterotomy)'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See <a class="local">'Vasa previa'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H998077689"><span class="h3">Cervical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><strong>Digital examination of the cervix should be avoided in patients presenting with bleeding in the second half of pregnancy until placenta previa has been excluded by transvaginal ultrasound examination</strong>. Digital examination of a placenta previa can cause immediate, severe hemorrhage.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the second trimester (14 weeks and 0 days to 27 weeks and 6 days), cervical dilation and/or effacement is abnormal. If uterine contractions are absent, then cervical insufficiency should be suspected. (See <a class="local">'Cervical insufficiency'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>After 20 weeks of gestation, progressive cervical dilation and effacement over time that is associated with uterine contractions is diagnostic of labor, which can be associated with a small amount of bleeding, as well as mucus discharge and/or leaking of amniotic fluid. (See <a class="local">'Bloody show'</a> below and <a class="local">'Labor'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1901013742"><span class="h2">Ultrasonography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ultrasonography is the cornerstone of the evaluation of bleeding in pregnancy and usually performed as soon as the focused history and physical examination have been completed. Transabdominal ultrasound is performed initially, followed by transvaginal ultrasound when the cervical area is the focus of the examination.</p><p>The primary goals are to determine whether the placenta is covering the cervical os (placenta previa), whether there is evidence of decidual hemorrhage causing placental separation (ie, placental abruption), and, in the second trimester, whether the cervix shows signs suggestive of cervical insufficiency (short length, dilated internal os, prolapsed fetal membranes). Sonography performs well for determining placental location and evaluating the cervix, but has low sensitivity for diagnosis of abruption. (See <a class="local">'Placenta previa'</a> below and <a class="local">'Cervical insufficiency'</a> below and <a class="local">'Placental abruption'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1385138257"><span class="h2">Role of speculum examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A speculum examination should be performed in patients with bleeding and suspected leakage of amniotic fluid (eg, oligohydramnios on ultrasound, passage of watery blood) to determine whether membrane rupture has also occurred. It can be omitted in patients whom placenta previa or abruption is suspected based on history, physical examination, and/or ultrasonography. In patients in whom labor, placenta previa, or abruption is unlikely, speculum examination may confirm that the uterus is the source of bleeding or may reveal a vaginal or cervical source unrelated to pregnancy. (See <a class="local">'Cervical or vaginal lesions'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3834770237"><span class="h2">Laboratory tests</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A hemoglobin/hematocrit measurement should be performed as a baseline in patients with heavy vaginal bleeding and in those with suspected concealed retroplacental hemorrhage.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hemoglobin/hematocrit, coagulation studies, and type and screen or crossmatch should be obtained in all patients who are hemodynamically unstable (hypotension, tachycardia, orthostasis, syncope).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>RhD typing should be performed because <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9858" href="/z/d/drug information/9858.html" rel="external">anti-D immune globulin</a> is administered to those with uterine bleeding to prevent alloimmunization from concurrent fetomaternal bleeding.

In general:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ultrasound examination immediately makes the diagnosis of placenta previa or excludes it.

(See <a class="local">'Uterine rupture (in patients with previous hysterotomy)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bleeding from vaginal and cervical lesions is readily diagnosed by visual inspection, with ancillary tests as indicated (eg, wet mount and pH of vaginal discharge, cervical cytology, and/or biopsy of mass lesions). (See <a class="local">'Cervical or vaginal lesions'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In all of the aforementioned settings, the blood loss is maternal. Rarely, a patient will be found to have vasa previa on a routine second-trimester ultrasound examination. If these patients rupture membranes, fetal blood loss is a real possibility and life-threatening. (See <a class="local">'Vasa previa'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prelabor and early labor are often associated with light bleeding, which may contain mucous. These diagnoses should be clear based on the gestational age, cervical examination, and uterine contraction pattern. (See <a class="local">'Bloody show'</a> below and <a class="local">'Labor'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2753076911"><span class="h2">Most common antepartum etiologies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Placental abruption or placenta previa account for at least 50 percent of cases of antepartum bleeding. The etiology of the antepartum bleeding cannot be determined with certainty in most of the remaining cases. These cases are frequently attributed to marginal separation of the placenta.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3146840260"><span class="h3">Placental abruption</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Placental abruption (abruptio placentae) refers to premature separation of a normally implanted placenta prior to birth. The degree of separation ranges from mild to severe (life-threatening to mother or fetus) and it may be acute or chronic. The most common risk factors include prior abruption, trauma, tobacco use, cocaine use, methamphetamine use, hypertension, and preterm prelabor rupture of membranes. The possibility of abruption should always be considered in patients who are being evaluated for abdominal trauma (eg, motor vehicle crash, fall, domestic violence). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6738.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of major trauma in pregnancy", section on 'Placental abruption'</a>.)</p><p>Abruption is a clinical diagnosis. Patients typically present with vaginal bleeding (80 percent), uterine tenderness (70 percent), and uterine contractions (35 percent), with or without abnormalities of the fetal heart rate pattern. Uterine tenderness is caused by extravasation of blood into the myometrium (called a Couvelaire uterus, an enlarged bluish-purple-appearing uterus due to the extravasation of blood through the myometrium to the serosa). In severe cases, blood can even penetrate to the peritoneal cavity. The amount of vaginal bleeding may not be a reliable indicator of the severity of the hemorrhage since bleeding may be concealed (retained in the uterine cavity).</p><p>The major purpose of ultrasound examination is to exclude placenta previa, not to diagnose or exclude abruption. Ultrasound examination is helpful when it identifies a retroplacental hematoma, which strongly supports the clinical diagnosis (positive predictive value 88 percent) [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>], but many patients with abruption do not have this finding (sensitivity 25 to 60 percent [<a href="#rid5">5,7-9</a>]). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6826.html" rel="external">"Acute placental abruption: Pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and consequences"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3472151472"><span class="h3">Placenta previa</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Placenta previa should be suspected in any patient who presents with vaginal bleeding in the second half of pregnancy. Classically, the absence of abdominal pain and uterine contractions was considered the clinical feature that distinguished between placenta previa and abruption, which is the other major cause of vaginal bleeding at this time. However, some patients with placenta previa have uterine contractions in addition to bleeding; thus, the diagnosis of placenta previa must be determined by sonographic examination.</p><p>The diagnosis of placenta previa is based on sonographic identification of echogenic homogeneous placental tissue extending over the internal cervical os on a second- or third-trimester imaging study  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74665" href="/z/d/graphic/74665.html" rel="external">image 1</a>), preferably using transvaginal ultrasound. Diagnosis and management are reviewed in depth separately.

It usually occurs during labor or as a result of abdominal trauma but rarely occurs without an obvious precipitating cause. Abdominal pain, fetal heart rate abnormalities, and hemodynamic instability due to intra-abdominal bleeding are typical findings and indicate an obstetric emergency. The diagnosis is based on identification of a complete disruption of all uterine layers (including the serosa) at laparotomy. In cases without maternal or fetal compromise, the diagnosis may be made by ultrasound examination.

The diagnosis vasa previa is based on sonographic visualization of membranous fetal vessels passing across or in close proximity (within 2 cm) of the internal cervical os by transvaginal ultrasound examination with color Doppler  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72943" href="/z/d/graphic/72943.html" rel="external">image 2</a>). The membranous vessels may be associated with a velamentous umbilical cord or they may connect the lobes of a bilobed placenta or the placenta and a succenturiate lobe. Risk factors for vasa previa include multiple gestation and in vitro fertilization.</p><p>In vasa previa, rupture of the membranous fetal vessels is an obstetric emergency because the blood is fetal in origin and likely to result in fetal death from exsanguination. In placental abruption, the bleeding is maternal in origin. A clinical diagnosis of ruptured vasa previa should be suspected in the setting of vaginal bleeding that occurs upon rupture of the membranes and accompanied by fetal heart rate abnormalities, particularly a sinusoidal pattern or bradycardia. Historically, tests such as the Apt or Kleihauer-Betke test or other tests (Ogita, Londersloot) were recommended for confirmation of fetal blood; however, typically there is no time to wait for test results before performing an emergency cesarean birth for fetal distress, thus these tests have a limited practical role in diagnosis or management.

The clinician typically makes a provisional clinical diagnosis based upon the character of bleeding (eg, volume, associated with pain or painless, type of pain) and physical examination; imaging tests are often used to support or revise the initial diagnosis. The goal is to make a definitive diagnosis when possible and exclude the presence of serious pathology in the remaining cases. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Incidence'</a> above and <a class="local">'Goal'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Etiology</strong> – Bleeding after 20 weeks of gestation is usually related to one of the following six entities. The signs and symptoms of these disorders can have substantial overlap, as shown in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef140334" href="/z/d/graphic/140334.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) (see <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Placental abnormalities</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Placental abruption (see <a class="local">'Placental abruption'</a> above)</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Placenta previa (see <a class="local">'Placenta previa'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Uterine rupture (primarily in patients with a previous hysterotomy) (see <a class="local">'Uterine rupture (in patients with previous hysterotomy)'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Cervical or vaginal lesions (see <a class="local">'Cervical or vaginal lesions'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Cervical insufficiency (see <a class="local">'Cervical insufficiency'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Prelabor bloody show or labor (see <a class="local">'Bloody show'</a> above and <a class="local">'Labor'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Vasa previa (see <a class="local">'Vasa previa'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic evaluation</strong> – Diagnostic evaluation includes obstetric and symptom history, focused physical examination, and usually ultrasonography. The differential diagnosis of vaginal<strong> </strong>bleeding after 20 weeks can be difficult when bleeding is mild and relatively painless because several disorders share these characteristics  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef140334" href="/z/d/graphic/140334.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Digital examination of the cervix <strong>should be avoided</strong> until placenta previa has been excluded by ultrasound examination as it can cause immediate, severe hemorrhage.
