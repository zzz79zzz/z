         "Hoarseness," or "dysphonia," is the term used to describe a change in the quality of the voice. The voice quality can be breathy, strained, fatigued, rough, tremulous, or weak. It may have a change in pitch or abnormal resonance. Hoarseness can be caused by any process that affects the structure or function of the larynx (

         The evaluation of the child with hoarseness will be presented here. The etiology and management are discussed separately. (See

         The larynx is part of the anterior hypopharynx. In newborns, the larynx is situated at the level of C3-C4, where it facilitates simultaneous respiration and swallowing during infant feeding. It gradually descends to the level of C6-C7 by the age of 15 years. The mobile, crescent-shaped hyoid bone forms the anterior upper limit of the larynx, which is divided into three regions relative to the level of the vocal cords:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The supraglottic region encompasses the area above the vocal folds and includes the epiglottis, arytenoids, aryepiglottic folds, and false vocal folds.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The glottic region includes the vocal folds and the region immediately below the vocal folds. This region has the narrowest diameter in adults.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>

         The subglottic region refers to the region starting 1 cm below the vocal folds and ending in the upper cervical trachea. This region corresponds to the cricoid cartilage and has the narrowest diameter in infants and children.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The larynx is formed by the articulation of the thyroid and cricoid cartilages (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79855" href="/z/d/graphic/79855.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The ring-shaped cricoid cartilage is the only cartilage that completely encircles the airway. The epiglottis and the anterior commissure of the vocal folds are attached to the inner aspect of the thyroid cartilage at the thyroid prominence (also called the Adam's apple).
        </p>
        <p>
         The arytenoids, which help to position and move the vocal folds, articulate on the posterior edges of the cricoid cartilage (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56206" href="/z/d/graphic/56206.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). The aryepiglottic folds are formed by mucosa that runs from each edge of the epiglottis to the arytenoid. The lower portion of the aryepiglottic fold creates the false vocal folds (also called the false vocal cords or vestibular folds), which are protective in normal phonation function (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79855" href="/z/d/graphic/79855.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The true vocal folds (the vocal cords) are comprised of the thyroarytenoid muscle and the vocal ligament and extend from the vocal process of the arytenoid to the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage anteriorly. The vocal folds undergo age-related changes, lengthening as the child grows.
        </p>
        <p>
         The muscles of the larynx (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56206" href="/z/d/graphic/56206.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ) act to open and close the glottis and to regulate voice quality (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62687" href="/z/d/graphic/62687.html" rel="external">

         The superior and recurrent laryngeal branches of the vagus nerve innervate the laryngopharynx. The recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLNs) branch from the vagus in the upper chest and reenter the neck ("recur") in the thoracic inlet, extending to the larynx superiorly, traveling in or near the tracheoesophageal groove. The right and left RLNs travel underneath the right subclavian artery and around the arch of the aorta, respectively. The superior laryngeal nerve descends along the pharynx and divides into internal and external branches.
        </p>
        <p>
         The superior laryngeal nerve supplies sensory innervation to the epiglottis and false vocal folds and the motor innervation to the cricothyroid muscle. The remainder of the larynx receives motor and sensory innervation from the RLN. The interarytenoid muscle is the only muscle that is dually innervated by both RLN.

         The larynx has three main functions: phonation, airway protection, and cough production.

          Phonation

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Phonation occurs as a result of the interaction between the true vocal cords and the exhaled column of air from the lungs, which creates oscillation of the vocal fold mucosa relative to the deeper vocal fold structures (thyroarytenoid muscle and vocal ligament).
        </p>
        <p>
         The intrinsic laryngeal musculature adjusts the tension and location of the vocal folds to produce fine changes in voice production (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62687" href="/z/d/graphic/62687.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). Changes in pitch and frequency are mediated by the tension and position of the vocal folds, which are controlled by the cricothyroid and thyroarytenoid muscles. Contraction of the thyroarytenoid shortens and contraction of the cricothyroid muscle lengthens the vocal fold, resulting in lower and higher pitch, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
         Voice is articulated through fine motor control of the tongue and lips and resonated by the airway above the vocal folds. The size of the pharynx, oral cavity, nasal cavity, and larynx increase with age, resulting in changes of resonance, particularly in boys. The loudness of voice is directly related to subglottic pressure.

         </span>
         The airway is protected from ingested material during swallowing by laryngeal elevation, epiglottic deflection, and closure of the false and true vocal folds. Contraction of the paired lateral cricoarytenoid and the interarytenoid muscles results in adduction of the vocal folds and closure of the airway. Contraction of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle causes rotation of the arytenoid and opening of the airway.

         Transient glottic closure causes increased intrathoracic pressure that results in cough. Rapid glottic opening during cough facilitates the expectoration of tracheal air and mucous.

         Hoarseness can be caused by any process that affects the structure or function of the larynx. Etiologic categories include infection, inflammation, trauma, obstruction or infiltration, and congenital anomalies (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73274" href="/z/d/graphic/73274.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). In children, hoarseness is most often due to a benign or self-limited cause (eg, viral upper respiratory infection or vocal abuse and misuse). Hoarseness is a common complaint in children, with reported prevalence rates ranging from 4 to 23 percent [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3

         The initial evaluation of the child with hoarseness includes a complete history and physical examination. Additional information can be obtained from laryngoscopy and formal voice evaluation [

          Timing of onset
         </strong>
         – It is important to determine whether the onset of dysphonia was acute, gradual, or longstanding; whether it was related to a particular event (eg, surgery, illness); whether the symptoms are intermittent or constant; and whether they are static or progressive. Acute problems are more commonly related to vocal abuse and result from injury to the mucosa overlying the vocal folds. Acute problems may also be caused by an infectious or inflammatory process [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>

         <strong>
          Associated symptoms
         </strong>
         – It is important to ask if there are any associated symptoms such as stridor, wheezing, coughing, respiratory distress, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, change in olfaction, ear pain, sore throat, dysphagia, odynophagia, feeding difficulties, aspiration, or weight loss. Children with associated stridor, aspiration, pain, or respiratory distress may warrant urgent referral to an otolaryngologist (see
         <a class="local">
          'Criteria for referral'
         </a>
         below). In addition, the clinician should ask if there are factors that alleviate or aggravate the dysphonia (eg, allergies, environmental exposures, vocal overuse, upper respiratory tract infection) or if the hoarseness is worse at a particular time of day (morning versus evening). Hoarseness that worsens over the course of the day may suggest vocal abuse.

         <strong>
          Past medical history
         </strong>
         – If the voice problem had onset in infancy, details of the birth history should be reviewed, including whether forceps were used in the delivery and whether the quality of the newborn cry was normal. Other aspects of the past medical history that may be pertinent include any surgeries or hospitalizations (particularly if they required intubation); any trauma or surgery involving the heart, chest, base of the skull, or neck; and any history previous voice problems, speech or language delay, developmental delay, behavioral problems, psychiatric disorders, hearing loss, or chronic ear disease. In addition, the child's medications should be reviewed (both prescribed and over the counter). Medications that may contribute to hoarseness include inhaled glucocorticoids, antihistamines, and anticholinergics.

         Suspected mass lesion – In a child with vocal fold paralysis suspected to be caused by a mass lesion either within the larynx or along the course of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), imaging with a chest radiograph, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be useful. However, if the child's primary complaint is hoarseness, CT or MRI should generally not be performed without first directly visualizing the larynx [

         The stroboscopic examination is another useful diagnostic tool in the evaluation of hoarseness. During phonation, the vocal folds vibrate more than 100 times per second. The stroboscope sends out bright flashes of light that are timed to the frequency of vocal fold vibration, a process that visually "freezes" the image for the observer and permits evaluation of the mucosal edges of the vocal folds for irregularity or subtle changes. The endoscopes used for stroboscopy are usually a rigid telescope with a 90° prism (which allows visualization of the larynx through the oral cavity) and the flexible endoscope. Stroboscopic examination is usually well tolerated in children older than six to seven years [

         Direct laryngoscopy may be necessary if the larynx is not adequately visualized by nasopharyngolaryngoscopy or stroboscopic examination, if the child's hoarseness is not responding to therapy, or if a suspicious lesion is detected by the above examinations. Direct laryngoscopy is performed in the operating room. The laryngoscope is placed within the oral cavity to directly visualize the larynx. A microscope or telescope can be used to enhance visualization. Complications of direct laryngoscopy are rare and may include dislocation of the jaw, inadvertent removal of teeth, discomfort, small mucosal tears, injury to the larynx, and risk of anesthesia.

          figure 1

         ). Etiologic categories include infection, inflammation, trauma, obstruction or infiltration, and congenital anomalies (
