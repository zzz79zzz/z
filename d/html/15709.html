When presenting acutely, the etiology is usually due to embolism to superior mesenteric or celiac arteries, thrombosis of an existing atherosclerotic arterial stenosis, traumatic injury, or spontaneous mesenteric dissection. When presenting as a chronic issue, the etiology is usually due to stenosis at the origin(s) of the mesenteric arteries due to atherosclerosis [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The pattern of chronic disease is frequently multivessel in nature, and patients present either acutely with intestinal catastrophe (ie, acute-on-chronic ischemia) and necrosis or more insidiously with chronic symptoms of postprandial pain, food fear, and cachexia.</p><p>The surgical and endovascular techniques used to revascularize the mesenteric vessels are reviewed. The clinical features, diagnosis, and nonsurgical management strategies for managing acute or chronic ischemia due to arterial occlusion are reviewed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96754.html" rel="external">"Acute mesenteric arterial occlusion"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2563.html" rel="external">"Chronic mesenteric ischemia"</a>.)</p><p>The management of other forms of acute mesenteric ischemia including mesenteric venous thrombosis and nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia, which are primarily managed medically with supportive care with or without anticoagulation, are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91220.html" rel="external">"Mesenteric venous thrombosis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91221.html" rel="external">"Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1838575263"><span class="h1">MESENTERIC ANATOMY AND TARGETS FOR REVASCULARIZATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Adequate knowledge of visceral vessel configuration, collateral circulation, and associated anatomy is critical to understanding the clinical evaluation and treatment of mesenteric ischemia. The mesenteric vessels include the celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), which arise from the abdominal aorta  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89910" href="/d/graphic/89910.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Embolism as a cause of acute mesenteric ischemia preferentially occurs in the SMA (passing by the celiac artery) because of the gentler takeoff of the SMA from the aorta. The embolism typically lodges beyond the origin of the middle colic, thus sparing the proximal jejunum. Atherosclerotic lesions producing chronic mesenteric ischemia typically occur at the origin of the mesenteric vessels. There is rich collateralization  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89911" href="/d/graphic/89911.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) between the mesenteric vessels, and classically, stenosis or occlusion of two of the mesenteric arteries is required to produce symptoms of chronic mesenteric ischemia. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Celiac artery</strong> – The celiac artery arises at spinal level T12 and is the first branch of the aorta in the abdomen just beyond the crus of the diaphragm. The celiac artery supplies the foregut with blood supply via the common hepatic, splenic, and left gastric arteries [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The treatment of celiac artery alone in chronic mesenteric ischemia is associated with the highest rate of symptomatic recurrence [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], and typically, this vessel is only revascularized in combination with the SMA.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Superior mesenteric artery </strong>– The SMA arises at spinal level L1 as the second named vessel in the abdomen. The SMA supplies the majority of the small intestines  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89910" href="/d/graphic/89910.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) as well as portions of the ascending and transverse colons via the middle, right, and ileocolic arteries  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73756" href="/d/graphic/73756.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The proximal SMA may provide the inflow for a replaced hepatic artery  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103685" href="/d/graphic/103685.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inferior mesenteric artery</strong> – The IMA arises at the level of L3 and supplies the transverse and descending colons. The marginal artery of Drummond and arc of Riolan collateralize the IMA with the SMA. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H653253520"><span class="h2">Targets for revascularization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The SMA is the primary target for revascularization. There is reasonable evidence that treatment of the SMA alone in patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia is adequate [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>], although some authors suggest treatment of both the SMA and celiac artery, if possible [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. Similar to the celiac artery, the IMA is a secondary, rather than primary target of mesenteric revascularization, although while mesenteric ischemia primarily affects the small bowel, there have been reports of chronic ischemic colitis arising from stenosis or occlusion of the IMA [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2564.html" rel="external">"Colonic ischemia", section on 'Chronic ischemic colitis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1898166026"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS AND TECHNIQUE SELECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The primary indications and technique selection for mesenteric revascularization depend on the acuity of the presentation (acute, chronic), etiology of the disease (embolic, thrombotic), lesion characteristics, and patient factors.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3038297898"><span class="h2">Acute mesenteric ischemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with mesenteric ischemia due to mesenteric arterial occlusion, revascularization should occur urgently or as an emergency for patients who demonstrate evidence of bowel ischemia. This may include acute onset abdominal pain that is "out of proportion" to the physical examination in the setting of vascular imaging (usually computed tomographic angiography) consistent with mesenteric artery occlusion and laboratory studies suggesting metabolic acidosis with elevated lactic acid and leukocytosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2559.html" rel="external">"Overview of intestinal ischemia in adults", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>The operative and interventional techniques selected for acute mesenteric ischemia are procedures that can be performed expeditiously. The sooner blood flow is restored to the ischemic bowel, the better the outcome for the patient. In addition, the ability to assess the intestines for irreversible necrosis is crucial in determining the viability of the bowel and resecting any nonviable segments. As such, endovascular techniques are not commonly selected in the setting of acute mesenteric ischemia, with some exception. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with mesenteric embolism, open mesenteric artery embolectomy quickly restores blood flow. (See <a class="local">'Superior mesenteric artery embolectomy'</a> below.). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with thrombosis of existing atherosclerotic lesions, thrombectomy would not be successful in achieving long-term patency, and as such, techniques that correct the culprit lesion and inspect the intestines such as open mesenteric bypass or retrograde open mesenteric stenting can be used, depending upon patient and inflow vessel characteristics. (See <a class="local">'Mesenteric artery bypass'</a> below and <a class="local">'Retrograde open mesenteric stenting'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with spontaneous mesenteric artery dissection, bowel ischemia rarely develops, but if there is compromised flow, these patients can be treated using open or endovascular options. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/102500.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous mesenteric arterial dissection"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with traumatic lesions, the approach will depend upon the extent of the injury and may be amenable to open or endovascular techniques. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/109431.html" rel="external">"Abdominal vascular injury", section on 'Mesenteric arteries'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2848737923"><span class="h2">Chronic mesenteric ischemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with symptomatic chronic mesenteric ischemia with vascular imaging suggesting multivessel mesenteric occlusive disease can proceed with revascularization on an elective basis once other potential causes of abdominal pain have been excluded with an appropriate clinical evaluation including esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, and abdominal imaging. The patient should also be optimized for the procedure from a medical standpoint. The symptoms of chronic mesenteric occlusion usually include the insidious onset of postprandial abdominal pain, food fear, and weight loss, or nonspecific symptoms such as nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2563.html" rel="external">"Chronic mesenteric ischemia", section on 'Clinical presentations'</a>.)</p><p>Endovascular and open surgical options are available for revascularization of chronic mesenteric lesions, with the primary intent to restore flow to the superior mesenteric artery in most cases. Overall, given the lower rate of perioperative complication rates with similar short- and long-term mortality, endovascular revascularization is typically recommended if the culprit lesions are amenable to endovascular treatment. An open surgical technique is preferred for endovascular failures and for arterial lesions such as flush aortic occlusions or lesions that are severely calcified or long or tandem in nature. The selected approach depends on patient comorbidities, lesion characteristics accounting for the patient's life expectancy, and the durability of the revascularization. </p><p>There have been no prospective randomized trials comparing open with endovascular treatment, but most centers have shifted toward mesenteric stenting as the first-line treatment in chronic mesenteric ischemia. Endovascular treatment is associated with lower morbidity and a shorter hospital length of stay, with similar mortality and overall survival compared with mesenteric bypass [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. Perioperative complications occur more frequently with open revascularization, but recurrence rates are higher for endovascular revascularization [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Open reconstruction is very durable, with lower rates of restenosis compared with mesenteric stenting (15 versus 37 percent), better primary patency rate (86 versus 51 percent), higher freedom from recurrent symptoms (13 versus 30 percent), and lower rates of reintervention (9 versus 20 percent) [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. Primary patency of open bypass is 89 percent at five years with 93 percent freedom from reintervention, while covered stents have 92 percent primary patency at three years, reaching similar levels as open bypass [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Mesenteric artery bypass'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2688079266"><span class="h1">PATIENT PREPARATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3543846617"><span class="h2">Medical evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The underlying reason for mesenteric revascularization guides the preoperative preparation. The acuity of the clinical presentation often dictates the available time for medical evaluation and optimization and urgency of revascularization.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute mesenteric ischemia – Patients with acute mesenteric ischemia require aggressive fluid resuscitation, as they often present with abdominal sepsis. Given the broad range of differential diagnoses, there is often a delay, further increasing the importance of resuscitation and the need for emergency intervention. In addition, if there is any concern for bowel ischemia/necrosis, antibiotics should be initiated. Ideally, vasopressors should be avoided whenever possible, as use of these agents may exacerbate intestinal ischemia. If needed due to the patient's condition, the best choice is low- to mid-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9384" href="/d/drug information/9384.html" rel="external">dopamine</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a>, taking care to avoid pure alpha-adrenergic agents. Systemic anticoagulation (eg, intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8518" href="/d/drug information/8518.html" rel="external">unfractionated heparin</a>) should also be initiated as soon as the diagnosis has been made to limit clot propagation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic mesenteric ischemia – Patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia have a high incidence of concomitant coronary artery disease and should undergo medical evaluation and cardiac clearance once other causes of abdominal pain have been ruled out. Pulmonary function should also be evaluated and optimized. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6616.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6917.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of perioperative pulmonary risk"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Noninvasive imaging of the carotid arteries and lower extremities should also be undertaken given the high incidence of arterial disease in other vascular beds. For patients in whom mesenteric bypass is selected, it is important to know the extent of aortoiliac disease, as this will influence the choice of inflow vessel. Computed tomographic angiography is also necessary to evaluate the ability to clamp the infrarenal and supraceliac aorta and the suitability of the iliac arteries to serve as inflow, if needed. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia are often malnourished and require full evaluation of their nutritional status. Prolonged delays to intervention should be avoided. Those with mild symptoms should be counseled to avoid large meals, while those with severe malnutrition may need preoperative nutrition support. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/817.html" rel="external">"Clinical assessment and monitoring of nutrition support in adult surgical patients"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2880.html" rel="external">"Overview of perioperative nutrition support", section on 'Preoperative nutrition support'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2231578643"><span class="h2">Antiplatelet therapy prior to mesenteric stenting</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients in whom endovascular revascularization is planned (eg, chronic mesenteric ischemia) are often taking antiplatelet agents, and daily dosing should not be withheld. It is often difficult to know if mesenteric artery revascularization will be successful, so we do not routinely alter a prior regimen or provide any loading dose. If a decision is made intraoperatively to perform mesenteric stenting, a loading dose of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> can be provided in the recovery room. (See <a class="local">'Postoperative course'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2257787238"><span class="h2">No role for bowel preparation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Routine bowel preparation is not required and should be avoided in patients with severe abdominal symptoms or subacute ischemia. Bowel preparation delays time to revascularization and can exacerbate ischemia, potentially increasing the risk for intestinal necrosis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1873407910"><span class="h1">ENDOVASCULAR TECHNIQUES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H903112116"><span class="h2">Principles of endovascular therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The majority of endovascular procedures for mesenteric ischemia are performed via a percutaneous approach, although hybrid open procedures have been described. (See <a class="local">'Retrograde open mesenteric stenting'</a> below.)</p><p>The choice of access vessel depends on the anatomy of the artery being treated. When percutaneous access is used at any site, real-time ultrasound guidance is recommended to directly image the needle entering the artery at an access point that is free of disease, away from large branching vessels, and in an area that can be easily compressed or treated with a closure device postprocedure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15192.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous arterial access techniques for diagnostic or interventional procedures"</a>.)</p><p>Common femoral artery and brachial artery access have been used to treat mesenteric arterial occlusions. Brachial artery access is appealing given the acute downward route of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), which makes selection and crossing of lesions easier compared with a femoral approach; however, brachial artery sheath hematoma can lead to neuropathy [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. For this reason, some practitioners prefer brachial artery cutdown for arm access given the larger sheath size for the stents that will be used, which eliminates this risk and allows direct repair of the access artery. If percutaneous access is used, ultrasound guidance is preferred regardless of the approach to allow direct visualization of the needle entering the artery in an access point that is free of disease, away from large branching vessels in an area that can be compressed easily postprocedure. </p><p>Appropriate sheath placement in the aorta provides support for wires and crossing catheters used to navigate stenoses. Positioning of the C-arm is crucial in achieving an adequate view of the pathology being treated. This usually requires a relatively steep oblique or lateral view given the anterior direction of the mesenteric vessels from the aorta but will depend on the patient's individual anatomy. Distal mesenteric vessels are best viewed from an anterior-posterior positioning of the C-arm. </p><p>Mesenteric vessels tend to spasm, so wire manipulation should be minimized. The use of embolic protection devices during intervention has been suggested, with 66 percent of filters retrieving debris in mesenteric revascularization cases in one study [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12427253"><span class="h2">Mesenteric stenting</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia due to atherosclerosis, revascularization of the superior mesenteric artery is the main goal; stenting the celiac artery may be a secondary goal. </p><p>Mesenteric intervention has evolved from primary angioplasty to primary mesenteric stenting [<a href="#rid16">16,18-21</a>]. Balloon-expandable covered stents are frequently used, given their short lengths and superior radial force, as well as better patency compared with uncovered stents [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Freedom from restenosis with covered stents is higher compared with uncovered stents (92 versus 52 percent), as is freedom from symptom recurrence (92 versus 50 percent, respectively). Factors associated with lower success rates using an endovascular approach include flush aortic occlusions or lesions that are long or multisegmental in distribution. Patients with these anatomic features should be considered for open intervention. </p><p>Unlike chronic mesenteric ischemia, the use of mesenteric stenting in acute mesenteric ischemia has not been universally embraced, although it has been described and thought to be technically noninferior compared with open procedures, with significant selection bias [<a href="#rid23">23-25</a>]. Patients with acute mesenteric ischemia need rapid revascularization and don't have the luxury of time needed for many endovascular techniques. In addition, these patients need to have their bowels inspected for ischemic necrosis, which is not readily available using an endovascular approach. If endovascular revascularization is used for acute mesenteric ischemia, depending on the expediency of revascularization and the patient's clinical condition, the entire length may need to be evaluated, either with laparotomy or laparoscopy, to determine if there are any areas of frank necrosis requiring resection [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3854279205"><span class="h2">Mechanical thrombectomy and lysis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The use of a minimally invasive approach for acute mesenteric ischemia has been described, but given the prolonged treatment time for this therapy and the time-sensitive nature of the diagnosis, it is often not used as a solo technique [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. One option is initial endovascular management with a mechanical thrombectomy device to allow intestinal reperfusion followed by placement of a lysis catheter to resolve residual thrombosis [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].

If the retroperitoneal tissue does not close easily, an omental flap can be used to cover the graft.

Any replaced or accessory hepatic arteries need to be identified and preserved.

The long-term and major complication rates are similar for antegrade and retrograde mesenteric bypass [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Preoperative computed tomographic angiogram is necessary to evaluate the suitability of the aorta or iliac arteries for clamping and sewing the bypass. Selecting which approach to use is based on several factors. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The advantage of antegrade mesenteric bypass is provision of inflow from a healthy supraceliac aorta; however, it typically requires complete occlusion of the supraceliac aorta during construction of the proximal anastomosis, which may increase the hemodynamic and ischemic intestinal demands experienced by the patient. Adequate exposure of supraceliac aorta is required for antegrade reconstruction, with care taken to identify and protect the esophagus. In addition, while creating the retropancreatic tunnel, care is needed to prevent injury to the splenic vein.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Retrograde bypass to the SMA is easier to create and usually performed more quickly than antegrade bypass; however, retrograde bypasses are prone to kinking, which can be reduced by using an externally supported prosthetic graft.

The celiac trunk allows for an end-to-end anastomosis, while the hepatic artery allows for easier exposure, but makes orientation of the graft more difficult. These bypasses usually arise from the supraceliac aorta directly given the lack of calcification usually found in this area and the fact it is exposed when exposing the celiac trunk.</p><p>For superior mesenteric revascularization, the anastomosis is usually placed just distal to the origin of the middle colic artery where the artery is soft and free of disease with multiple distal branches by which to perfuse the intestines.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3987330103"><span class="h3">Conduit selection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Either autogenous vein or prosthetic (eg, polyester or polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]) graft can be used as a conduit for mesenteric bypass.

The main issue with using vein is the risk of kinking. This can be addressed using an externally supported prosthetic graft, provided there is no gross contamination of the operative field (ie, spillage of intestinal contents, pus). In addition to vein, cryopreserved vessels can also be used as a bypass conduit in contaminated fields. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H293879551"><span class="h3">Antegrade mesenteric bypass</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Antegrade mesenteric bypass provides a shorter bypass and more robust inflow to the bypass.

This approach should be avoided in patients with severe coronary heart disease or history of heart failure.</p><p>Adequate exposure of the supraceliac aorta is required for antegrade reconstruction, with care taken to identify and protect the esophagus. The supraceliac aorta can be approached through either a midline or bilateral subcostal incision. The midline incision is easier to close, while a bilateral subcostal incision can help with exposure of the upper abdomen in larger patients. </p><p>The triangular ligament of the liver is divided, with care taken to identify and avoid injury to the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins, and the left lateral segment of the liver is moved laterally. The gastrohepatic ligament is then divided, with care to avoid injury to a replaced left hepatic artery, which if present would course through the ligament. Knowledge of visceral vessel configurations is important to ensure that aberrant vessels are identified and preserved. (See <a class="local">'Mesenteric anatomy and targets for revascularization'</a> above.)</p><p>The esophagus and stomach are then mobilized laterally.
