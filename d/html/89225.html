The cause of ITP remains unknown in most cases, but it can be triggered by a preceding viral infection. ITP was previously known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or immune thrombocytopenic purpura. The current term <strong>I</strong>mmune <strong>T</strong>hrombocyto<strong>P</strong>enia preserves the widely recognized acronym "ITP" and acknowledges the immune-mediated mechanism of the disorder while allowing that patients may have little or no signs of purpura or bleeding [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>ITP in children often resolves spontaneously within three months. A minority of affected children go on to have chronic ITP, which is defined as thrombocytopenia for &gt;12 months since presentation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5917.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Initial management", section on 'Disease course'</a>.)</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of chronic ITP and chronic refractory disease in children will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, diagnosis, and initial management of ITP in children are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5930.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5917.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Initial management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H55528375"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Approximately 10 to 20 percent of children who present with ITP develop chronic ITP, defined as platelet count &lt;100,000/microL lasting beyond 12 months from the time of presentation [<a href="#rid1">1-6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3672973336"><span class="h2">Risk factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chronic ITP cannot be predicted at diagnosis, but factors that correlate with increased risk include [<a href="#rid2">2,3,5</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Older age</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Higher presenting platelet count at initial diagnosis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Insidious onset of symptoms</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lack of preceding infection or vaccination prior to development of ITP</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Underlying chronic medical conditions (eg, autoimmune disorders)</p><p></p><p>This issue is discussed in greater detail separately.

For example, studies have shown that certain polymorphisms in genes related to immune function (eg, <em>CD28</em>, <em>CTLA4</em>, <em>DNAM1</em>, <em>FCGR2B</em>, <em>ICOS</em>, <em>LAG3</em>, <em>PD1</em>, <em>TIM3</em>, <em>TLR4</em>, <em>TNFSF4</em>) may be associated with lower likelihood of responding to ITP therapies and/or increased likelihood of developing chronic ITP [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>]. Other studies have demonstrated potentially pathogenic variants in immune-related genes (<em>TNFRSF13B</em>, <em>CARD11</em>, <em>CBL</em>, <em>LRBA</em>, <em>NFKB2</em>, <em>RAG2</em>) in a subset of patients with chronic ITP, though most patients in these studies had other subtle signs of primary immunodeficiency (eg, abnormal immunoglobulin levels, recurrent infections) [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p>In addition, some patients labeled as having chronic refractory ITP may actually have an inherited platelet disorder rather than an immune-mediated process. If possible, a previously normal platelet count should be documented to exclude this possibility. Inherited platelet disorders are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5921.html" rel="external">"Causes of thrombocytopenia in children", section on 'Inherited platelet disorders'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6675.html" rel="external">"Inherited platelet function disorders (IPFDs)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H55529287"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial diagnostic evaluation</strong> – At the initial presentation of a child with symptoms suggestive of ITP, a basic evaluation should be performed to exclude other causes of thrombocytopenia. This includes a focused personal and family history, physical examination, and laboratory testing, as summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89206" href="/d/graphic/89206.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). A previously normal platelet count should be documented whenever possible. Children with atypical findings (eg, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, systemic symptoms, or any abnormalities in the complete blood count (CBC) or peripheral blood smear) should promptly undergo further investigation to exclude other causes of thrombocytopenia. The initial diagnostic evaluation is discussed in detail in a separate topic review. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5930.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Additional evaluation for children who develop chronic ITP</strong> – Additional evaluation is performed both to exclude other causes of persistent thrombocytopenia (eg, bone marrow failure, inherited thrombocytopenia) and to assess for underlying or secondary causes of ITP such as immunodeficiency, chronic infection, or systemic autoimmunity/inflammatory disorders  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61163" href="/d/graphic/61163.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).

In our practice, we typically perform the following tests at 6 to 12 months from diagnosis if ITP has not resolved:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Serology and/or polymerase chain reaction testing for associated infectious causes (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hepatitis C, cytomegalovirus, <em>Helicobacter</em> <em>pylori</em>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Immunoglobulin levels and/or antibody response to routine childhood vaccines, repeated annually for all children with chronic ITP. For children with additional clinical concern for impaired immune function (eg, recurrent infections), additional testing may be warranted, as discussed separately.

The components of supportive care are similar to those for children with newly diagnosed or persistent ITP:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If needed, restrict physical activities with significant risk of trauma, especially contact and collision sports. The type of activity that is restricted has not been standardized, and decisions should be individualized with participation of the patient and family. It is important to not overly restrict participation in sports and other social activities [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoid medications with antiplatelet activity, including <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13371" href="/d/drug information/13371.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a> and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), unless necessary and the child has previously tolerated them. If NSAIDs or other antiplatelet medications are used frequently, it is reasonable to set a slightly higher goal for maintaining the platelet count.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Monitor menstrual bleeding and treat with hormonal therapy, antifibrinolytics, and/or iron supplementation if needed. (See <a class="local">'Adjunctive therapies'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Monitor for epistaxis and treat with humidity, antiallergy measures, and antifibrinolytics as needed. (See <a class="local">'Adjunctive therapies'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Provide education to the child and caregivers about the risks and complications of ITP and when to seek care.

For example, if a previously asymptomatic patient develops new bleeding symptoms requiring treatment, weekly monitoring with a complete blood count (CBC) is often appropriate until the symptoms resolve and the platelet count stabilizes. If a patient has minimal symptoms and the CBC is stable at a moderate degree of thrombocytopenia (50,000 to 100,000/microL), monitoring can be done less frequently (eg, once a month to every four months). In our practice, we usually stop monitoring after the platelet count has returned to normal and has remained stable for 6 to 12 months, though we may monitor it longer in patients who had longstanding ITP before achieving normal counts.</p><p>Patients with chronic ITP also should be evaluated at least annually for thyroid disease because of the high association between ITP and autoimmune thyroid disease [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In addition, screening for common variable immunodeficiency with immunoglobulin levels and/or antibody response to routine childhood vaccines should be performed annually. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5838.html" rel="external">"Acquired hypothyroidism in childhood and adolescence", section on 'Autoimmune thyroiditis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16132.html" rel="external">"Common variable immunodeficiency in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H55528389"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1352374324"><span class="h2">Indications for treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Platelet counts can vary considerably in patients with chronic ITP:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Some patients maintain platelet counts between 50,000 to 100,000/microL without treatment. Such patients generally do not experience bleeding symptoms and do not require additional treatment unless a higher platelet count is needed (eg, for surgery).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Some patients remain relatively asymptomatic, but they may require occasional acute intervention for management of intermittent episodes of clinically significant thrombocytopenia, often triggered by an infection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other patients may require continuous or intermittent therapy for management of ongoing or recurrent bleeding symptoms or risks.</p><p></p><p>Thresholds for pharmacologic treatment depend on multiple factors, including the burden of bleeding symptoms, risk factors for bleeding (sports or an active lifestyle), concomitant medical conditions and medications, anxiety, fatigue, and access to medical care. Decisions should be individualized and made in collaboration with the patient and family.</p><p>Children with chronic ITP should be managed by a pediatric hematologist whenever possible. If regular visits to the hematologist are challenging for the family (eg, if it requires long-distance travel back and forth to the specialty clinic), the primary care provider can provide follow-up care in consultation with the hematologist. Virtual visits using telehealth are another option.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H55530163"><span class="h2">Acute intervention for bleeding or risk of bleeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The first-line pharmacologic options for acute intervention are similar to those used in the initial management of patients with newly diagnosed ITP and include intravenous <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> (IVIG), <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12762" href="/d/drug information/12762.html" rel="external">anti-D immune globulin</a> (anti-D), or glucocorticoids alone or in combination  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89045" href="/d/graphic/89045.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). The dosing and administration of IVIG and intravenous anti-D are the same as for initial management. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5917.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Initial management", section on 'First-line therapies'</a>.)</p><p>Infrequently, platelet transfusion(s) or combination therapy may be administered for life-threatening bleeding or in the setting of major trauma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5917.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Initial management", section on 'Life-threatening bleeding'</a>.)</p><p>Prolonged daily use of glucocorticoids should be <strong>avoided</strong> because of adverse effects, especially on growth in children. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7988.html" rel="external">"Major adverse effects of systemic glucocorticoids", section on 'Young children'</a>.)</p><p>Glucocorticoids may be appropriate if only infrequent short courses or pulses are required. However, if repeated rescue treatment is required or ongoing treatment for more than a few weeks is needed, we prefer steroid-sparing agents (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12971" href="/d/drug information/12971.html" rel="external">rituximab</a>, thrombopoietin receptor agonists [TPO-RAs]), or, less commonly, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12923" href="/d/drug information/12923.html" rel="external">azathioprine</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12582" href="/d/drug information/12582.html" rel="external">6-mercaptopurine</a> (6-MP), <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12624" href="/d/drug information/12624.html" rel="external">mycophenolate</a> mofetil (MMF), <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12761" href="/d/drug information/12761.html" rel="external">sirolimus</a>, or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13193" href="/d/drug information/13193.html" rel="external">cyclosporine</a>. (See <a class="local">'Rituximab'</a> below and <a class="local">'Thrombopoietin receptor agonists'</a> below and <a class="local">'Other agents'</a> below.)</p><p>When an increased platelet count is needed for surgery or another activity with high risk of bleeding, any first-line ITP therapy (glucocorticoids, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a>, anti-D) may be used. Considerations include the timing of surgery, the desired platelet count, and the patient's prior treatment response. If there is sufficient time before surgery, short-term use of a TPO-RA may be useful as an adjuvant or an alternative to first-line agents. However, there is a minimum of a five- to seven-day delay before a response is seen with TPO-RAs, so they are not appropriate if an increased platelet count is needed more urgently.

The most critical is the small but lifelong risk of overwhelming infection, which occurs in approximately 1 to 3 percent of splenectomized patients, usually with encapsulated organisms such as <em>Pneumococcus</em>, <em>Haemophilus</em>, and <em>Neisseria</em>. This risk is highest in young patients (&lt;5 years old) and those with underlying immune dysfunctions (eg, ALPS) [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16614.html" rel="external">"Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS): Management and prognosis", section on 'Avoidance of splenectomy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The other major long-term risk associated with splenectomy is thrombosis, particularly stroke. In a population-based study, splenectomized patients (mostly adults) had a 1.5-fold increased risk of stroke compared with nonsplenectomized ITP controls [<a href="#rid56">56</a>]. In addition, pulmonary hypertension has been observed in splenectomized patients with hereditary spherocytosis but not in splenectomized ITP patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7079.html" rel="external">"Hereditary spherocytosis", section on 'Splenectomy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation prior to splenectomy</strong> – Prior to planned splenectomy, the diagnosis of ITP should be critically reviewed to exclude causes of thrombocytopenia other than ITP, especially those related to immune deficiency, ongoing viral infection, systemic autoimmune disease (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus), bone marrow failure, or an inherited form of thrombocytopenia  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61163" href="/d/graphic/61163.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). This includes a comprehensive serologic evaluation, as previously described.

Once stabilized, the platelet count should be monitored at least yearly depending upon whether the count remains low or has returned to normal. Pneumococcal titers should be measured yearly as well to determine if additional vaccination is warranted, though consensus is lacking as to the optimal frequency of revaccination. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1412.html" rel="external">"Prevention of infection in patients with impaired splenic function", section on 'Vaccinations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with ongoing severe ITP after splenectomy and standard pharmacologic therapies are considered to have chronic refractory ITP. Occasionally, an accessory spleen causes late recurrence of ITP following splenectomy, especially if the initial splenectomy resulted in remission for at least one year [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]. In such cases, the possibility of an accessory spleen should be investigated with abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography. This possibility is further suggested if Howell-Jolly bodies  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60588" href="/d/graphic/60588.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) are absent on the peripheral smear following splenectomy. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2577238437"><span class="h2">Adjunctive therapies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Adjunctive therapies may be used in the following settings to treat or reduce the likelihood of clinically significant bleeding:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Heavy menses</strong> – In patients with heavy menses, hormonal therapy may be helpful to reduce bleeding. We generally use progesterone-based treatment (eg, 5 to 10 mg daily of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12577" href="/d/drug information/12577.html" rel="external">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate) or a low-estrogen formulation rather than a standard estrogen-based contraceptive.

Antifibrinolytic agents may also be used instead of or in addition to measures to raise the platelet count prior to dental work. Intranasal DDAVP (<a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13212" href="/d/drug information/13212.html" rel="external">desmopressin</a>) is another option for children with nose bleeding.

In a large registry study, more than one-quarter of those who still had ITP 12 months from diagnosis underwent complete remission by 24 months from diagnosis [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Similar outcomes were reported from a Nordic registry study of children with chronic ITP [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. After two years of chronic ITP, 32 percent of subjects still had platelet counts that were &lt;20,000/microL, but 35 percent had recovered completely (platelets &gt;150,000/microL). After five years of chronic ITP, 12 percent of subjects had platelet counts &lt;20,000/microL, while 52 percent had recovered completely.</p><p>Children &lt;10 years old are more likely to enter remission than older patients [<a href="#rid62">62,63</a>]. Children &gt;10 years old, especially adolescent females, have a disease course more like that seen in adults with ITP. Neither of these tendencies is enough to substantially alter management. The role that hormonal and other physiologic changes of puberty play in this process is not well understood.

A very low count is permissive, but not sufficient, for bleeding. In the Nordic registry study described above, &lt;10 percent of patients with chronic ITP experienced a serious bleeding episode in five years of follow-up and, in each case, the bleeding episode was in the context of a platelet count &lt;20,000/microL [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage is &lt;1 percent but may be slightly higher among patients with chronic ITP as compared with those with newly diagnosed ITP [<a href="#rid64">64</a>]. Patients with very low platelet counts (eg, &lt;10,000/microL) are at risk for serious bleeding even if they have not had previous bleeding. Nearly all cases of intracranial hemorrhage occur at these very low counts. However, there is individual variation in bleeding severity, which is not well understood and is independent of the platelet count. This may be explained by differences in endothelial and platelet function that are difficult to capture with available tests.
