Invasive coronary angiography is considered the "gold standard" for the diagnosis of CHD involving the epicardial coronary vessels, but it is limited by its invasive nature, attendant risks, inability to assess the microcirculation, and cost. Invasive angiography is therefore rarely indicated as the first diagnostic test for stable CHD, and is appropriate only in select, high-risk patient populations [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA), which can noninvasively image the epicardial coronary vessels, has a lower risk than invasive angiography but shares many limitations of invasive angiography (eg, radiation exposure, inability to assess the microcirculation, or to assess the functional significance of coronary stenoses), and has additional limitations of its own (eg, artifact). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5308.html" rel="external">"Cardiac imaging with computed tomography and magnetic resonance in the adult"</a>.)</p><p>The evaluation of patients presenting with chest discomfort or other symptoms suggestive of CHD usually relies upon stress testing. Several types of stress tests are available clinically that vary in accuracy, availability, and cost. The optimal testing strategy, including the possible use of more than one test, differs according to the patient population [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1502.html" rel="external">"Selecting the optimal cardiac stress test"</a>.)</p><p>The use of stress testing for the diagnosis of obstructive CHD will be reviewed here. The overall approach to the patient who presents with chest discomfort, including those with known or suspected CHD, the advantages and limitations of the different stress testing modalities, and the use of stress testing to assess prognosis or guide management are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6832.html" rel="external">"Outpatient evaluation of the adult with chest pain"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1502.html" rel="external">"Selecting the optimal cardiac stress test"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1548.html" rel="external">"Prognostic features of stress testing in patients with known or suspected coronary disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H184270461"><span class="h1">OUR APPROACH TO DIAGNOSTIC STRESS TESTING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our approach to diagnostic stress testing varies with the pretest probability of disease, which is the estimate of the likelihood of coronary heart disease (CHD) prior to stress testing based upon the patient's age, gender, symptom characteristics, and clinical history, including standard cardiac risk factors. Because pre-test probability of disease strongly influences post-test likelihood of disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50189" href="/z/d/graphic/50189.html" rel="external">figure 2B</a>), clinical assessment of pretest probability, based upon data from large studies, is essential prior to testing  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef112717" href="/z/d/graphic/112717.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). This estimate of pretest probability of CHD can then be used to determine the need for and the optimal initial diagnostic approach to testing in the patient with known or suspected CHD.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H622870625"><span class="h2">Estimating pretest probability</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several studies with varying methodologies have contributed to estimation of the pretest probability of CHD [<a href="#rid5">5-11</a>]. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the classic analysis from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS), 1465 men and 580 women with complaints of chest pain underwent treadmill exercise testing prior to invasive coronary angiography, and were categorized into three groups based on chest pain symptoms [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Definite or classic angina – Substernal chest discomfort characterized by all of the following characteristics: a typical quality and duration, provocation by exertion or emotional stress, and relief by rest or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9706" href="/z/d/drug information/9706.html" rel="external">nitroglycerin</a></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Probable or atypical angina – Chest pain with two of the three above characteristics</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Nonanginal or nonischemic chest pain – Chest pain with one or none of the above characteristics </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The pretest probability  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50121" href="/z/d/graphic/50121.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) of CHD varied between 5 and 89 percent based upon gender and chest pain characteristics. Within each of these subgroups, the frequency of CHD increased with age, while women with the same symptoms were less likely to have CHD than men of the same age  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef112717" href="/z/d/graphic/112717.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5-7,12</a>]. The higher false-positive rate on exercise ECG testing in women compared with men can be largely explained by the lower prevalence of CHD in women [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Male gender, older age, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia were identified as independent predictors of the likelihood of CHD in an analysis of nearly 400,000 patients from the American College of Cardiology National Cardiovascular Data Registry who underwent invasive coronary angiography [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Elective noninvasive testing (some form of stress testing in most cases) was performed prior to angiography in 84 percent of patients, and patients with an abnormal noninvasive test result were significantly more likely to have obstructive CHD (41 versus 35 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient age, sex, and symptom type were independent predictors of the probability of CHD in a multi-center registry of over 14,000 patients with suspected CHD who underwent CT coronary angiography [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The overall prevalence of CHD was lower in this cohort of patients who did not undergo invasive coronary angiography than in earlier studies that required referral to cardiac catheterization to document anatomic CHD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5307.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive testing and imaging for diagnosis in patients at low to intermediate risk for acute coronary syndrome"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H622871287"><span class="h2">Using the pretest probability</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The interpretation of the stress test result (as with any diagnostic test) is strongly influenced by the pre-test probability of disease (ie, prevalence). The probability of disease in a patient with a positive test result (positive predictive value), and probability of no disease in a patient with a negative test result (negative predictive value), depends directly on the pretest probability of disease. Major differences between studies in the apparent accuracy of noninvasive testing are explained, at least in part, by this factor.</p><p>Stress testing is most useful for the diagnosis of CHD in patients with an <strong>intermediate</strong> pretest probability (variably defined as between 25 and 75 percent or between 10 and 90 percent)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef112717" href="/z/d/graphic/112717.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Positive tests in these patients are more likely to be true positives due to the predictive accuracy of the test [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Stress testing is less useful for the diagnosis of CHD in patients with either a high or a low pretest probability. Asymptomatic patients without diabetes have a low pretest probability of significant CHD, and generally should not be screened by use of stress testing. In asymptomatic patients, the risk of developing symptomatic CHD over the next 10 years can be estimated using one of many validated risk scores. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1519.html" rel="external">"Screening for coronary heart disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1551.html" rel="external">"Screening for coronary heart disease in patients with diabetes mellitus"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/114029.html" rel="external">"Cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention: Risk calculators"</a>.)</p><p>In special situations, such as those who have high-risk occupations (eg, airline pilots, bus drivers), asymptomatic patients may be considered for stress testing or CCTA. (See <a class="local">'Summary and recommendations'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1519.html" rel="external">"Screening for coronary heart disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H622871464"><span class="h2">Posttest probability</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pretest probability, in conjunction with the sensitivity and specificity of the test, is used to determine the posttest probability of CHD  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81630 graphicRef50189" href="/z/d/graphic/81630.html" rel="external">figure 2A-B</a>). </p><p>Among patients with a very high pretest probability, a positive stress test is highly predictive of CHD, but a negative stress test does not exclude CHD. Conversely, among patients with a very low pretest probability, a positive stress test is likely to be a false-positive result, while a negative stress test is highly predictive of the absence of CHD.</p><p>Once the decision to perform a stress test has been made, the choice of the optimal test will depend upon clinical information. The ability to exercise adequately and a normal resting ECG are necessary for performing an exercise ECG without imaging for CHD. Stress imaging options have different advantages and disadvantages in different patient groups. Local expertise and availability may also affect the choice of imaging modality for stress testing. This is also discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1502.html" rel="external">"Selecting the optimal cardiac stress test"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H974620024"><span class="h2">Test accuracy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients in whom all of the tests can be performed, accuracy, radiation exposure, local expertise in performance and interpretation of the test, and cost are all important factors in choosing a test. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H974620051"><span class="h3">Sensitivity and specificity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The accuracy of noninvasive tests for CHD is determined by their sensitivity and specificity  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50121" href="/z/d/graphic/50121.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2759.html" rel="external">"Glossary of common biostatistical and epidemiological terms", section on 'Measures of diagnostic test performance'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sensitivity reflects the probability of a positive test among patients with disease.

There are also procedure-specific factors. With exercise ECG testing, for example, test performance can be affected by exercise end points, the number of ECG leads monitored, and most importantly by the ECG criteria used for a positive test  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80746" href="/z/d/graphic/80746.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1494.html" rel="external">"Exercise ECG testing: Performing the test and interpreting the ECG results"</a>.)</p><p>The sensitivity and specificity of a given test vary reciprocally upon the threshold used to define a positive result. As an example, if ST segment depression with exercise is used as the test endpoint, a cutoff of 1 mm of ST segment depression is more sensitive but less specific than a cutoff of 2 mm of ST segment depression to define a positive test. In general, the application of more stringent criteria for a positive result decreases sensitivity and increases specificity, while the application of less stringent criteria increases sensitivity and decreases specificity.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2174060403"><span class="h3">Epicardial disease versus microcirculatory disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For decades, CHD was diagnosed by identifying a significant stenosis in an epicardial coronary artery, and it was felt that patients with angina but no obstructive epicardial CHD must have a non-cardiac etiology for their symptoms. This approach also affected the sensitivity and specificity of various diagnostic tests, with epicardial CHD seen (or not seen) on coronary angiography used as the gold standard. However, functional changes at the site of epicardial vessels and/or at the microcirculatory level may, in some individuals, lead to true myocardial ischemia, resulting in symptoms, wall motion abnormalities on stress echocardiography, and perfusion defects on rMPI, even in the absence of severely obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). It is now more common for trials to include combined anatomic (eg, invasive coronary angiography) and functional (eg, assessment of myocardial ischemia) reference standards for the determination of test sensitivity and specificity. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1479.html" rel="external">"Microvascular angina: Angina pectoris with normal coronary arteries"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2453326348"><span class="h3">Post-test referral (verification) bias</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The majority of studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy of stress testing determine sensitivity and specificity used invasive coronary angiography as the gold standard. Because patients are generally referred for angiography due to abnormal test results, this leads to artificially increased sensitivity and decreased specificity. This poses challenges in determining the true accuracy of stress testing for the diagnosis of CHD. The few studies that have corrected for verification bias then reported lower sensitivity and higher specificity.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H974620132"><span class="h3">Challenges in women</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While women present some diagnostic challenges for identifying ischemia related to obstructive CHD, the choice of diagnostic test is rarely made based on gender but rather on the clinical scenario. However, women are less likely to present with (or report during treadmill testing) typical angina and false positive test results during exercise ECG testing are more common in women [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The diagnostic value of the exercise ECG testing alone in women is limited by a lower specificity of ST segment changes compared with men and a lower sensitivity for diagnosing ischemia compared with stress imaging [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. Some of the important causes of this lower predictive accuracy in women are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A lower prevalence of coronary disease than in men of the same age [<a href="#rid5">5,16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A higher prevalence of nonobstructive CAD and microvascular disease which, while not associated with obstructive disease on angiography, can cause symptoms and are associated with future cardiac events [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A modestly higher incidence of false-positive ST segment depression during exercise [<a href="#rid5">5,18</a>]. </p><p></p><p>The optimal diagnostic strategy, from a standpoint of both accuracy and cost effectiveness, is not yet known in women with suspected CHD. The WOMEN trial randomized 824 women with an intermediate pre-test probability of CHD to either an exercise ECG or exercise myocardial perfusion imaging. The study found that the exercise ECG strategy led to more abnormal initial tests, and thus required more follow-up testing, but had lower overall costs and equivalent clinical outcomes [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. The consensus statement of the American Heart Association recommends using a similar diagnostic approach in women and men [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H622869167"><span class="h1">AVAILABLE NON-INVASIVE TESTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A variety of noninvasive tests are available to establish the diagnosis of coronary heart disease (CHD).

Tests for myocardial ischemia can be further classified according to the method used to detect ischemia (ECG changes, perfusion defects, or wall motion abnormalities) and the method used to induce ischemia (exercise or pharmacologic stress). The different noninvasive tests vary in their diagnostic discrimination (sensitivity, specificity, and frequency of nondiagnostic results). The sensitivity of stress testing with imaging (SPECT 87 percent, echocardiography 86 percent) is generally higher than that of exercise ECG testing without imaging (68 percent), whereas values for specificity are similar [<a href="#rid20">20-22</a>]. The tests also vary with respect to prognostic accuracy, relative cost, and interobserver variability.

Suboptimal images limit the interpretation in a small percentage of echocardiographic studies, thereby impairing the assessment of segmental and global LV systolic function [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Suboptimal imaging during exercise stress echocardiography can also be exacerbated by respiratory motion due to heavy breathing post-exercise and patient positioning following the transition from treadmill to imaging table.
