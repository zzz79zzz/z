         Bilateral diaphragm paralysis is a severe form of respiratory muscle weakness that needs prompt evaluation and management.
        </p>
        <p>
         An overview of the different therapies available for the treatment of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis will be presented here. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis and the evaluation and treatment of patients with unilateral diaphragm paralysis are discussed separately. (See

         In most patients with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, we suggest treatment of the underlying disorder, if feasible, and general supportive therapies. Select patients may benefit from antiviral therapy or phrenic nerve repair.

         In patients with idiopathic bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis that is acute in onset, we typically treat with a one-week course of antiviral therapy (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10034" href="/z/d/drug information/10034.html" rel="external">
          valacyclovir
         </a>
         1000 mg twice daily for one week). Although data to support this approach are weak, our rationale is based upon the administration of a therapy that has potential benefit but with minimal harm.
        </p>
        <p>
         One preliminary study examined the effect of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10034" href="/z/d/drug information/10034.html" rel="external">
          valacyclovir
         </a>
         1000 mg twice daily for one week in three consecutive patients with recent-onset bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis (suggesting a viral etiology) and found recovery of diaphragmatic function over four to six weeks [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>

         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Whether recovery was specifically valacyclovir related or would have occurred spontaneously is unknown.

         Combined surgical nerve reconstruction with or without diaphragm pacing is an investigational therapy that is performed at very few centers. It can be considered in select patients with phrenic nerve trauma (surgical or other) but requires immediate transfer to a specialized center, which is not universally available. Rarely, some patients can be considered for surgical repair at a later point in time. It is typically more suitable for patients with unilateral disease rather than bilateral paralysis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15134.html" rel="external">
          "Surgical treatment of phrenic nerve injury", section on 'Phrenic nerve reconstruction'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Successful use of combined phrenic nerve repair and diaphragmatic pacing has been reported but is investigational. Patients who are ventilator dependent as a result of combined cervical spinal cord injury and phrenic nerve lesions are generally considered to be unsuitable candidates for diaphragmatic pacing due to loss of phrenic nerve integrity. However, two studies from the same group reported the outcome of such patients who were treated with simultaneous surgical phrenic nerve repair and diaphragm pacing [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. All patients required, at minimum, nocturnal ventilation and over one-half were oxygen dependent. This procedure resulted in diaphragm electromyographic activity in the majority of patients. Two-thirds achieved sustainable periods (&gt;1 hour/day) of ventilator weaning (mean = 10 hours/day). All eight oxygen-dependent patients were able to discontinue oxygen therapy following treatment. Two patients recovered voluntary control of diaphragm activity and regained the capacity for spontaneous respiration. More studies are needed to expand the acceptance of this procedure.

         It is rare for patients to have mild disease or be asymptomatic. Examples include patients with mild stretch injury to the phrenic nerve or patients with progressive disease (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) who are early in the course of their condition and have paresis rather than paralysis. Such patients require clinical observation and monitoring to look for the development of symptoms or frank hypoventilation that warrant ventilatory support.
        </p>
        <p>
         While there is no set protocol for observation, we monitor the patient's symptoms, pulmonary function tests, and respiratory muscle strength testing. The testing frequency depends upon the etiology and may range from daily (eg, acute Guillain-Barré syndrome or myasthenia gravis crisis) to weeks or months (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). (See

Such patients may need to transition to a long-term solution such as tracheostomy or chronic noninvasive ventilation (NIV). (See

          Outcomes associated with NIV
         </strong>
         – In patients with neuromuscular disease, NIV is a supportive therapy that can improve gas exchange, symptoms, and in some cases, survival. However, the outcome is largely dependent upon the patient's willingness to tolerate and comply with NIV and the nature of the underlying disorder (eg, progressive or reversible). Efforts targeted at improving tolerance are key to the success of NIV. Efficacy and outcomes in association with NIV and efforts needed to target adherence are discussed separately. (See

         The diaphragm can be paced by stimulating the phrenic nerve at the level of the neck (or lower branches) and, therefore, requires intact phrenic nerve function and a muscularized diaphragm for success. Patients who have denervated diaphragms cannot be paced. Importantly, pacing is generally a supplementary therapy that allows liberation from or reduction in time spent on mechanical ventilation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Typical candidates include patients with high-level cervical cord injury who have apnea or severe hypoventilation due to bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. Pacing is generally considered late after spinal cord injury (eg, three months) to maximize natural recovery of phrenic nerve function.

          Ventilatory support

         – Most patients with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis have ventilatory failure and are treated with ventilatory support (invasive or noninvasive; nocturnal and/or daytime). Although rare, patients with mild disease (eg, mild stretch injury to the phrenic nerve or patients who are early in the course of their condition) require clinical observation and monitoring to look for the development of symptoms or frank hypoventilation that warrant ventilatory support.

          Noninvasive
         </strong>
         – Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is the most common form of ventilatory support used in the acute and chronic setting  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79358" href="/z/d/graphic/79358.html" rel="external">
          table 3

         ). Indications, weaning, and other issues that face patients with respiratory muscle weakness who need acute or chronic support are discussed separately. (See

          Invasive
         </strong>
         – Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required in the acute setting. Tracheostomy is generally reserved for patients who fail NIV, those in whom NIV is contraindicated  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60442" href="/z/d/graphic/60442.html" rel="external">
          table 2

         ) or declined, patients who fail to wean from mechanical ventilation, and patients who need aggressive secretion clearance. These and other issues surrounding tracheostomy are discussed separately. (See

          Diaphragm pacing
         </strong>
         – For many patients with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis in whom phrenic nerve function is intact and in whom no spontaneous recovery of nerve or diaphragm function is expected, we suggest diaphragmatic pacing (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). This requires evaluation at a specialized center. The best candidates for diaphragmatic pacing are those with high-level spinal cord injury (above the third cervical level). Further details are provided separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5117.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Prognosis
         </strong>
         – The prognosis depends upon the reversibility of the underlying disorder, the severity of the paralysis, the presence of comorbidities, and complications of paralysis or other therapies (eg, pneumonia, sepsis, pulmonary embolism). Patients with paralysis due to reversible pathologies (eg, Guillain-Barré syndrome) have a better prognosis than those due to irreversible or progressive conditions (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).
