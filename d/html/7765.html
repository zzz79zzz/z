Patients deceptively misrepresent, simulate, or cause symptoms of an illness and/or injury in themselves, even in the absence of obvious external rewards such as financial gain, housing, or medications. Factitious disorder imposed on self is distinguished from factitious disorder imposed on another, such as a child or older adult. Early investigation of a possible factitious disorder can prevent patient self-harm as well as iatrogenic complications arising from unnecessary tests and treatments.</p><p>Factitious disorder is sometimes referred to as Munchausen syndrome [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In some studies, the eponym Munchausen syndrome refers to the subset of severe, chronic, and dramatic cases marked by pathological lying (pseudologia fantastica), peregrination, and use of aliases [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, assessment, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and management of factitious disorder imposed on self. Factitious diarrhea, factitious hypoglycemia, dermatitis artefacta, and factitious disorder imposed on a child are discussed in detail separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2628.html" rel="external">"Factitious diarrhea: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1799.html" rel="external">"Factitious hypoglycemia"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13698.html" rel="external">"Skin picking (excoriation) disorder and related disorders", section on 'Other psychocutaneous syndromes'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6608.html" rel="external">"Medical child abuse (Munchausen syndrome by proxy)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H368608749"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prevalence of factitious disorder imposed on self is difficult to estimate because of the secretive nature of the disorder; in addition, patients often deny the illness and seek treatment elsewhere when confronted [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5860912"><span class="h2">General population</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A community study in Italy estimated that the lifetime prevalence of factitious disorder in the general population was 0.1 percent [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5860919"><span class="h2">Clinical settings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multiple studies and reviews suggest that in clinical settings, the estimated incidence of factitious disorder is 1 percent [<a href="#rid1">1,8-10</a>]. However, the prevalence ranges widely across different studies. As an example, retrospective studies of inpatients [<a href="#rid11">11</a>] and outpatients [<a href="#rid12">12</a>] each found a rate of approximately 0.01 percent. By contrast, a prospective study of patients with fever of unknown origin found that factitious disorder was present in 9 percent [<a href="#rid13">13</a>], and a study of psychiatric inpatients found that the incidence was 8 percent [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>The first presentation of factitious disorder is usually in the third or fourth decade of life [<a href="#rid6">6,8,15,16</a>]; however, children have been identified with the disorder [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Onset often occurs following a hospitalization for either a general medical condition or mental disorder, and factitious disorder appears to develop gradually [<a href="#rid8">8,16,18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5861000"><span class="h2">Risk factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Factitious disorder may be more likely to occur in [<a href="#rid6">6,8,14,16,19-21</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Females </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unmarried individuals</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Health care workers (past or present)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Individuals with a psychiatric history</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Individuals who are experiencing family conflict (eg, abuse or parental divorce)</p><p></p><p>Other risk factors for factitious disorder include age ≤40 years, reported history of trauma, and family psychiatric history [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H368608755"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The etiology and pathogenesis of factitious disorder imposed on self are unknown. The disorder is associated with psychosocial factors, neurocognitive impairment, and neuroimaging abnormalities that may perhaps contribute to pathogenesis.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Psychosocial factors</strong> – Factitious disorder imposed on self is commonly associated with psychosocial factors, including early losses via death, sickness, or abandonment; disrupted attachments to others due to neglect, abuse, institutionalization, or other traumas; gratifying (reinforcing) experiences related to the sick role; and a desire for attention [<a href="#rid8">8,20,22,23</a>]. As an example, one study of 93 patients with factitious disorder found a history of physical or sexual abuse in more than 20 percent [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The developmental perspective posits that the abnormal illness behaviors begin in childhood as a mechanism for coping with stress.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">It is hypothesized that the sick role behavior associated with factitious disorder is a means of establishing or stabilizing one's identity, maintaining relationships with others, and addressing emotional dysregulation and unmet needs [<a href="#rid8">8,23</a>]. Chronic illness and/or hospitalization may provide patients with benefits that are otherwise unavailable in more conventional social settings such as the workplace; these benefits include a clear role and sense of importance and belonging, and concern and acceptance by others. A study of comments posted by members of online support groups for individuals who self-identified as having factitious disorder found that receiving affection was the most frequently cited motivation for occupying the sick role [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Another proposed motivation is that patients may enjoy duping clinicians [<a href="#rid20">20,22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neurocognition</strong> – Neuropsychological testing in five patients with factitious disorder revealed deficits in conceptual organization, management of complex information, and judgment, despite intact intelligence and verbal skills [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. These findings may indicate dysfunction in the right hemisphere of the brain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neuroimaging</strong> – Although case reports of neuroimaging have described abnormalities in factitious disorder, it is unclear from these cross-sectional studies whether the findings represent etiologic causes, sequelae, neither, or both. Examples of abnormal findings include the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in one patient detected white matter lesions disseminated bilaterally [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Computed tomography of the head in one patient showed moderate bilateral frontotemporal cortical atrophy and mild cerebellar atrophy [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Single photon emission computed tomography of the brain in a single patient revealed hyperperfusion of the right thalamus [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H368608761"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3211438265"><span class="h2">Signs and symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Factitious disorder imposed on self involves deceptive behaviors that are used to falsify symptoms or induce injuries [<a href="#rid1">1,23</a>]. Patients present themselves as ill or injured, even in the absence of obvious external benefits such as financial gain or avoiding work or criminal prosecution. The disorder is associated with psychological distress and functional impairment, and the severity of illness ranges from mild to severe.</p><p>Patients with factitious disorder may feign general medical and/or psychiatric symptoms and illnesses [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. However, in the large majority of cases reported in the literature, patients present with somatic complaints and assert that they have a general medical illness. Any symptom or disease may be simulated or induced in factitious disorder (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef97536" href="/z/d/graphic/97536.html" rel="external">table 1</a>); as an example, one study identified several cases of factitious decompression syndrome [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p>The most common falsified symptoms and diseases include [<a href="#rid4">4,16,20,28,30</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abdominal pain</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Arthralgia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chest pain</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Coagulopathy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diarrhea</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hematuria</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypercortisolism</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hyperthyroidism</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypoglycemia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Infections</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Seizures</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Skin wounds that do not heal</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vomiting</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Weakness</p><p></p><p>The most frequent factitious psychiatric symptoms and illnesses include bereavement, depression, psychosis, and suicidal ideation and behavior [<a href="#rid20">20,28</a>].</p><p>Deception is a key feature of factitious disorder [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. While deceptive behavior itself is not necessarily pathological, the persistent nature of factitious behaviors can lead to significant morbidity and mortality [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>Patients may feign symptoms and illnesses by [<a href="#rid1">1,8</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Exaggerating or fabricating their symptoms and/or medical history</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Exacerbating or inducing signs, physiologic disturbances, or illnesses (eg, ingesting or injecting medications such as anticoagulants, insulin, laxatives, or thyroid hormone; applying or injecting contaminants such as feces, bacteria, or sputum; delaying wound healing via self-contamination, intentional dehiscence, or self-administered trauma; or swallowing or instilling blood)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Aggravating genuine, existing illness by not adhering to medical recommendations (eg, triggering seizures by not taking prescribed medication)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Presenting benign physical findings as pathological (eg, patient with congenitally constricted pupil complaining of head trauma or patient with known ECG abnormality complaining of chest pain)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tampering with medical instruments, tests, or laboratory specimens</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Forging medical records</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Coaching others to provide false information to clinicians related to medical history or symptoms</p><p></p><p>More than one method may be utilized by patients with factitious disorder, even during a single episode of feigned symptoms and/or illness.</p><p>When questioned, doubted, or presented with evidence of falsification or tampering, the typical response is denial, often followed by departure against medical advice. Patients may also become disruptive or physically threatening. (See <a class="local">'Discussing the diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with factitious disorder imposed on self use a number of techniques to disrupt the clinician's standard practices. They may exploit the clinician's fear of missing a rare life-threatening disease, play into the clinician's fascination of solving a medical mystery, or convince the clinician that it would be redundant to conduct basic, definitive diagnostic procedures [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>Multiple clinicians often simultaneously care for a patient with factitious disorder, who may behave in such a way as to "split" the treatment team, pitting different clinicians against each other [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2413654127"><span class="h2">Comorbidity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Factitious disorder imposed on self is frequently observed in individuals with factitious disorder imposed on another. Across multiple studies of those with factitious disorder imposed on another, approximately 55 to 65 percent also had factitious disorder imposed on self [<a href="#rid31">31-33</a>]. These studies also found that among those with both types of factitious disorder, many patients had personality disorders (eg, borderline and histrionic types); our clinical experience is that nearly all patients with factitious disorder imposed on self also have at least one personality disorder. Other common comorbidities in factitious disorder imposed on self include somatic symptom and related disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorder [<a href="#rid31">31-33</a>]. In addition, two of the studies suggested that approximately half or more of the patients had a history of self-harm [<a href="#rid31">31,32</a>]. </p><p>Factitious disorder imposed on self can be comorbid with true general medical conditions, including the condition that is feigned [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. As an example, patients with diabetes may manipulate blood glucose measurements to mislead clinicians and appear more ill than is actually the case.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H368608773"><span class="h2">Course of illness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Information about the course of illness in factitious disorder imposed on self is largely based upon retrospective chart review studies because patients often drop out of care and follow-up [<a href="#rid6">6,8</a>]. The usual course of illness appears to be one of intermittent episodes, although single episodes as well as chronic and unremitting episodes are also reported [<a href="#rid1">1,8,34</a>]. Long-term recovery from factitious disorder may occur, but appears to be rare [<a href="#rid5">5,35,36</a>].</p><p>Factitious disorder can lead to diagnostic and therapeutic procedures that result in irreversible morbidity [<a href="#rid37">37,38</a>]. Deaths may also occur because patients underestimate the lethality of their behavior [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]; a case series of 20 patients found that factitious behavior directly led to the death of 20 percent [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Suicide can occur as well, but it is not clear how often this occurs [<a href="#rid8">8,36,40</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H121099183"><span class="h1">ASSESSMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The evaluation of patients who may have factitious disorder imposed on self includes a general medical and psychiatric history, physical and mental status examination, as well as a detailed chronological analysis of the medical record, which is described below (see <a class="local">'Medical record analysis'</a> below). In addition, collateral information from family or friends as well as other records can be useful. Although laboratory tests can provide definitive evidence of factitious behavior, there is no specific diagnostic test for factitious disorder, and it is important to consider the reliability and validity of the medical tests that are performed.</p><p>The diagnosis of factitious disorder requires the presence of falsified general medical or psychological symptoms. In addition, evidence is required to show that the individual is taking deceptive actions that misrepresent, simulate, or cause symptoms of illness.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1264726"><span class="h2">Evidence of factitious behavior</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evidence of illness falsification may be gathered from observations during the current hospitalization, medical records from prior episodes of factitious disorder, or family members. In addition, other types of records, other collateral contacts, and the Internet can also help identify evidence of illness falsification. Findings that constitute evidence of factitious disorder include the following [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Self-induction – The patient is observed (either directly or via video) in the act of inducing illness. Alternatively, suggestive evidence (eg, syringe or medication), which was not left by nursing staff, is found in the patient's room. Permission to conduct room searches is often part of the consent form patients sign before hospital admission. Inconsistent and abnormal clinical findings may cease if the patient is constantly observed by a member of the nursing staff. In addition, serum or urine laboratory results or toxicology screens may reveal unexpected exogenous substances. (See <a class="local">'Laboratory tests'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tampering with records or laboratory specimens – The chain of custody is critical to detect tampering. Was the patient alone with the medical chart? Did the patient bring in previous records rather than sign a release so that records could be obtained directly from previous clinicians? Was the patient alone during a medical test or when a biological fluid was collected?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inconsistencies – A pattern of inconsistencies in the patient's presentation suggests volitional falsification. Examples of inconsistencies include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Symptoms do not match objective findings on the physical examination or laboratory tests</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Reported medical history does not match previous medical records</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Reported diagnoses do not match objective findings</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Level of distress does not match symptom report or disease prognosis</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Medical record names and numbers do not match</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Exaggerated or false statements (eg, psychosocial history is determined to be false)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient admits factitious behavior following feedback from clinicians (see <a class="local">'Discussing the diagnosis'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H39001363"><span class="h2">Medical record analysis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Analyzing records of all clinic visits, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and home visits can help identify patients with factitious disorder [<a href="#rid6">6,8,23</a>]. Clinicians reviewing a medical record should assess the source of the documented information, review primary data (eg, test results rather than solely the interpretation of test results), evaluate if clinician diagnoses match objective data, consider ways in which objective findings could have been falsified or induced, and assess if the medical record makes sense.</p><p>We suggest chronologically summarizing the medical contacts with a table that includes columns for variables such as contact data (date of contact and location), subjective information (eg, chief complaint, symptoms, and history of present illness), objective information (such as findings on clinical examinations, objective test results, and observations by clinicians), outcome (eg, diagnoses, treatment provided, and efficacy of treatment), and other comments (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef97624" href="/z/d/graphic/97624.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Creating a table allows for pattern analysis (eg, health care utilization) and a description of the patient's illness and medical treatment trajectories. Additionally, the table may reveal gaps, contradictions, or evidence of marked evasiveness, which increases the suspicion of a factitious disorder.</p><p>Finding evidence or a past diagnosis of factitious disorder in the record may be easier in systems with electronic medical records [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Although patients may use aliases for different factitious episodes or medical encounters, if the same date of birth or social security number is used, these can serve as the search term [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. Such searches are ethically justified if they are conducted for the purpose of sparing patients iatrogenic morbidity.</p><p>Insurance records might also provide information about high rates of health care utilization, which are associated with factitious disorder. Other potentially helpful resources include fire department or ambulance company records, dental records, police reports, court documents (depositions, testimony, letters, and other correspondence), disability records, employment records, and school records (eg, attendance, academic performance, and visits to the nursing office).

However, malingering is defined as illness falsification to obtain obvious external benefits such as money, medications (eg, opioids or benzodiazepines), time off work, child custody, or avoiding criminal prosecution, whereas the deception observed in factitious disorder is not fully accounted for by external rewards. In addition, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (especially those that are painful or invasive) are avoided in malingering but readily accepted in factitious disorder [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>If malingering and factitious disorder are comorbid, diagnosing factitious disorder requires clinicians to determine that the patient is taking surreptitious actions to misrepresent, simulate, or cause symptoms beyond what one would expect, in order to obtain external rewards. As an example, drug seeking may be present, but this does not account for the pervasiveness of the abnormal illness behavior.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H39001827"><span class="h2">General medical and mental disorders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Factitious disorder imposed on self is distinguished from true general medical illnesses and mental disorders in that factitious disorder is characterized by evidence of deceptive behavior to simulate symptoms or illnesses.

(See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical features</strong> – Factitious disorder imposed on self involves deceptive behaviors that are used to falsify symptoms or induce injuries. The most common falsified symptoms and diseases include abdominal pain, arthralgia, chest pain, coagulopathy, diarrhea, hematuria, hyperthyroidism, hypercortisolism, hypoglycemia, infections, seizures, skin wounds that do not heal, vomiting, and weakness. Patients may feign symptoms and illnesses by fabricating symptoms; inducing illnesses; aggravating genuine, existing illness by not adhering to medical recommendations; tampering with medical instruments, tests, or laboratory specimens; and forging medical records. The usual course of illness appears to be one of intermittent episodes, and long-term recovery is rare.
