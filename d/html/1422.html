         Progress in medical and surgical treatment has resulted in larger numbers of women with congenital heart disease surviving to child-bearing years and proceeding with pregnancy [

         The general principles of management of pregnancy and contraception in women who have unrepaired or repaired congenital malformations of the heart or great vessels will be reviewed here. Pregnancy in women with specific congenital cardiac anomalies, the management of valvular heart disease during pregnancy, and the management of heart failure and arrhythmias during pregnancy are discussed separately.

         Because of improving medical and surgical management, most infants born with congenital heart disease will reach reproductive age, and women are now presenting for obstetric and congenital cardiac care, many following reparative cardiac surgery or intervention [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The maternal and fetal risk of a pregnancy for this population will depend on the anatomic and physiologic classification of the type of congenital heart disease as defined by the 2018 AHA/ACC Guidelines for the Management of Adults with Congenital Heart Disease [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In the Registry of Pregnancy and Cardiac Disease (ROPAC), among 5739 pregnancies in 53 countries from 2007 to 2018, congenital heart disease was the most prevalent form of structural heart disease (57 percent); the number of high-risk pregnancies (modified World Health Organization Class IV) increased from 0.7 percent in 2007 to 2010 to 10.9 percent in 2015 to 2018 [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. United Kingdom and Ireland Confidential Enquiries into maternal deaths reported that of 910 maternal deaths between 2009 and 2014, 22.5 percent were caused by heart disease, and a minority from congenital heart disease [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Gravidas with congenital heart disease may be at higher risk during an individual pregnancy, but if they survive, the risk of pregnancy is generally not cumulative. Thus, successive pregnancies generally entail the same but not greater risk, assuming the cardiovascular status remains stable. This was illustrated in a case-control study of 58 females with mild to moderate congenital heart disease who were matched by maternal congenital cardiovascular risk (ie, WHO classification). In this study, women having ≥3 live births compared with &lt;3 live births did not have materially different cardiac function by NYHA class or echocardiography.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pregnancy (especially if complicated) has been proposed to have adverse effects on the long-term outcomes of females with congenital heart disease [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Further studies are needed to determine whether pregnancy is related to adverse cardiac outcomes in people with congenital heart disease.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Normal alterations in circulatory and respiratory physiology during pregnancy can have deleterious effects on the mother with congenital heart disease and on her developing fetus. There are two major hemodynamic changes: fall in systemic vascular resistance and increase in cardiac output. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/443.html" rel="external">
          "Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Cardiovascular and hemodynamic changes"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Systemic blood pressure typically falls early in gestation and is usually 10 mmHg below baseline in the second trimester, declining to a mean of 105/60 mmHg. This response reflects a reduction in systemic vascular resistance. In patients with up to moderate mitral or aortic regurgitation, pregnancy is well tolerated due to this lower SVR state.
        </p>
        <p>
         A 30 to 50 percent increase in intravascular volume occurs in normal pregnancy beginning at 12 to 14 weeks gestation and peaking early to mid-third trimester. Cardiac output increases to accommodate for these volume changes by elevation in heart rate of approximately 10 to 20 beats per minute and an increase in stroke volume. In patients whose cardiac output is limited by myocardial dysfunction or valvular lesions (eg, mitral stenosis), volume overload is poorly tolerated and may result in heart failure.
        </p>
        <p>
         Marked fluctuations in cardiac output occur during normal labor and delivery. Cardiac output increases progressively from the first stage of labor, sometimes reaching an additional 50 percent by the late second stage. The potential for dramatic volume shifts is heightened at the time of delivery in response to the physiologic transfusion, which occurs with release of vena caval obstruction and blood from the now contracted uterus; postpartum hemorrhage may exacerbate these volume shifts, which are tolerated poorly by women whose cardiac output is highly dependent upon adequate preload.

          Risk of thromboembolism

          —
         </span>
         Women with preexisting heart disease are at increased risk for thromboembolism during pregnancy. Pregnancy is associated with an increased thromboembolic risk due to lower extremity venous stasis resulting from inferior vena cava compression by the gravid uterus, compression of the left common iliac vein by the right iliac artery, increased venous vasodilation to increased plasma progesterone, augmented endothelial production of prostacyclin, and nitric oxide combined with a hypercoagulable state due to an increase in vitamin-K-dependent clotting factors and a reduction in free protein S [

          "Venous thromboembolism in pregnancy: Prevention"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         A review cited above found a 2 percent incidence of thromboembolic events in 688 completed pregnancies in women with congenital heart disease [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ] compared to an expected rate of 0.05 to 0.10 percent during uncomplicated completed pregnancies [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Potential risk factors for thromboembolism were not evaluated.
        </p>
        <p>
         The issue of hypercoagulability is of relevance in women at risk for thrombosis related to prosthetic heart valves, atrial arrhythmias, passive cavopulmonary (Fontan) connection, or previous thromboembolic events. (See

         A prospective study examined outcomes in 213 pregnancies in 203 women with congenital heart disease and compared the performance of the modified WHO classification, CARPREG and ZAHARA risk scores, as well as total numbers of cardiovascular predictors and offspring risk predictors:

         The initial CARPREG risk score was based upon a retrospective study that examined the risks and predictors of pregnancy-related cardiac complications in women with heart disease [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16

         ]. The findings were then applied by the Cardiac Disease in Pregnancy (CARPREG) investigators in a prospective study of 562 women with congenital or acquired cardiac disease or arrhythmias who had endured 617 pregnancies. Seventy-four percent of the pregnancies occurred in women with congenital heart disease [

         One point was assigned to each finding. The overall rate of cardiac events (pulmonary edema, arrhythmia requiring treatment, stroke, cardiac arrest, or death) was 13 percent, with 55 percent occurring antepartum. There was high agreement between the rates that were observed in the two studies and those predicted by the CARPREG risk index: 0 points (4 versus 5 percent); 1 point (26 versus 27 percent); and ≥2 points (62 versus 75 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         The predictive value of the CARPREG risk index in women with congenital heart disease was subsequently evaluated in 53 such women who had 90 pregnancies [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Adverse cardiac events occurred in 25 percent of the pregnancies; the events included heart failure with pulmonary edema, symptomatic arrhythmias, and the need for urgent invasive intervention. There were no significant differences between the rates of adverse cardiac events and those predicted by the CARPREG risk index: 0 points (12 versus 5 percent); 1 point (30 versus 27 percent); and ≥2 points (100 versus 75 percent). Overall risk assessment was improved, primarily in patients with 1 point, by incorporating the presence (high risk) or absence (low risk) of subpulmonary ventricular dysfunction and/or severe pulmonary regurgitation.
        </p>
        <p>
         The CARPREG II risk score was later developed based on data from 1938 pregnancies in two large Canadian hospitals [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. In the study population, 63.7 percent of patients had congenital heart disease, 22.9 percent had acquired heart disease, and 13.4 percent had isolated cardiac arrhythmias; 13.6 percent had at least mild left ventricular dysfunction, and 2 percent had coronary artery disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         The CARPREG II risk score includes 10 predictors of risk for the development of cardiac complications.
        </p>
        <p>
         Five are general predictors: prior cardiac events or arrhythmias (3 points), poor functional class or cyanosis (3 points), high-risk valve disease or LVOT obstruction (2 points), systemic ventricular dysfunction defined as an ejection fraction less than 55 percent (2 points), and no prior cardiac intervention (1 point).
        </p>
        <p>
         Four are lesion-specific predictors: mechanical valves (3 points), high-risk aortopathy with aortic dimension &gt;45 mm (2 points), pulmonary hypertension (2 points), and coronary artery disease (2 points)
        </p>
        <p>
         The one delivery-of-care predictor is late pregnancy assessment (1 point).
        </p>
        <p>
         Cardiac complications, primarily arrhythmias and heart failure, occurred in 16 percent of the study patients. The risk of a primary cardiac event was 5 percent for 0 to 1 point, 10 percent for 2 points, 15 percent for 3 points, 22 percent for 4 points, and 41 percent for &gt;4 points. Each WHO class included a wide range of cardiac event rates, and the CARPREG II risk score further stratified risk with each modified WHO class.

         Neither of these studies included patients with the Eisenmenger syndrome which, as noted below, is associated with a high maternal mortality. (See

         The most serious risk to the mother is pulmonary hypertension [

         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Pulmonary hypertension limits appropriate adaptive responses to the circulatory changes of pregnancy and to the volatile changes during labor, delivery, and the postpartum period. Women with Eisenmenger syndrome can develop potentially fatal hypoxemia during pregnancy or the postpartum period. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/105507.html" rel="external">
          "Pulmonary hypertension with congenital heart disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"

        </p>
        <p>
         The maternal mortality in women with Eisenmenger syndrome is as high as 50 percent [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. A study evaluating whether new advanced therapies had an impact on outcomes suggested that there was a reduction in overall mortality from 38 to 25 percent compared to historical controls but that the risk of maternal mortality remains prohibitively high [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. In addition to appreciable fetal morbidity and mortality, Eisenmenger patients poorly tolerate the hemodynamic changes associated with pregnancy and delivery, and are particularly susceptible to complications such as pre-eclampsia and postpartum hemorrhage. Preterm delivery and fetal growth restriction occur in at least 50 percent of cases, with only 15 to 25 percent of pregnancies progressing to term. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/119400.html" rel="external">
          "Pulmonary hypertension in adults with congenital heart disease: General management and prognosis"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The majority of maternal deaths occur during delivery or in the first week postpartum. A gestational fall in systemic vascular resistance augments the right-to-left intracardiac or extracardiac shunt. A sudden fall in systemic resistance can precipitate intense cyanosis, and a sudden rise in resistance with bearing down during labor can abruptly depress cardiac output and provoke fatal syncope.
        </p>
        <p>
         Women with Eisenmenger syndrome should be counseled to avoid pregnancy because of high maternal mortality, appreciable fetal risk, and increased risk of thromboembolism. When pregnancy occurs, and termination is declined, heparin is recommended beginning at 20 weeks by some groups. (See

         The arterial oxygen saturation before pregnancy is one of the most important predictors of fetal and maternal outcomes [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,23,27,28
         </a>
         ]. The impact of maternal oxygen saturation was illustrated in a series of 96 pregnancies in 44 women with cyanotic congenital heart disease: only 43 percent of the pregnancies resulted in a live birth, 15 of which were premature [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. The likelihood of a live birth was much lower in women when their resting arterial oxygen saturation was below 85 percent.
        </p>
        <p>
         Adverse maternal outcomes were also reported in a series of 104 pregnancies in 74 women: 90 percent of mothers with cyanotic lesions had significant postpartum cardiac complications compared to 19 percent with acyanotic lesions [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>

         Application of the NYHA classification is problematic in women with cyanotic malformations and pulmonary vascular disease. Cardiac dyspnea, culminating in pulmonary edema, is a major maternal risk but is more common in acquired heart disease involving the left heart and left-sided valves.

         A fetal risk assessment score has not been established. In the above cited registry of 5739 pregnancies, fetal mortality and prematurity were associated with modified World Health Organization (WHO) class [

         ]. A prospective study of 213 pregnancies in 203 women with congenital heart disease found that risk assessment using modified WHO classification, ZAHARA offspring risk score, CARPREG offspring risk score, and number of offspring predictors showed increases in class or risk score with increased offspring risk [

         Antepartum fetal monitoring should begin as soon as an increased risk of fetal demise is identified and delivery for perinatal benefit would be considered if test results are abnormal.

         When possible, women should receive preconception assessment and counseling so that they are able to make informed pregnancy decisions. Medical centers have established cardio-obstetrics teams composed of maternal fetal medicine physicians and cardiologists as well as other specialists (geneticists, anesthesiologists) [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40

         <a href="#rid41">
          41,42
         </a>
         ]. For women who have not had preconception counseling, a complete risk evaluation should occur at the first prenatal visit. Women with congenital heart disease should receive a preconception evaluation by a cardiologist with expertise in pregnancy and congenital heart disease. Risk assessment should involve a focused evaluation of the risk of pregnancy for the mother and baby. Many women with heart disease are unaware of the risks of pregnancy, and patient education is an important aspect of the preconception assessment [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43

         Preconception (or initial prenatal if the patient presents during pregnancy) evaluation should include a detailed history, information on prior interventions (surgical and percutaneous), symptom status, a complete physical exam, a 12-lead electrocardiogram, a transthoracic echocardiogram, and an assessment of functional status (which may include exercise testing).
        </p>
        <p>
         A transthoracic echocardiogram is important to determine the type and severity of cardiac lesions, ventricular size and function, assessment of valve function, and pulmonary pressures. Valvular or vascular gradients may increase during pregnancy and should be interpreted accordingly. (See

         One of the best ways to simplify cardiovascular care during pregnancy is to perform indicated cardiac intervention (surgical or percutaneous) before conception. Successful cardiac intervention may improve fertility, may enable the mother to better tolerate the physiologic changes of pregnancy, can eliminate the fetal risk from maternal cyanosis, and benefits the subsequent health of mother and child. Women with congenital heart disease who have indications for cardiac intervention are generally advised to proceed with intervention prior to pregnancy (eg, percutaneous aortic balloon valvuloplasty for asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis to reduce maternal and fetal risks). However, the decision is much more complex when a valve replacement is required and a detailed discussion on the risk and benefits of bioprosthetic and mechanical valve options (specifically, conflicting maternal and fetal risk and benefits of anticoagulation) must be discussed with the patient.

         Pulmonary edema and marked peripheral edema should be distinguished from the normal physiologic edema of pregnancy. The peripheral edema typically seen during pregnancy does not connote excess risk and is due to an increase in total exchangeable sodium and water and inferior vena caval compression. Diuretics are not indicated and sodium restriction is not helpful for physiologic edema. (See

         The value of antepartum oxygen in cyanotic women is questionable.

         In women with functionally mild unrepaired congenital heart disease, and in women who have undergone successful cardiac surgery without major residua, the management of labor and delivery is the same as for normal pregnant women, except for potential increase in risk of infective endocarditis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pregnant women with unrepaired or postoperative congenital heart disease who are considered functionally normal are allowed to go into spontaneous labor. However, when there are concerns about the functional adequacy of the heart and circulation, labor should be induced under controlled conditions if there are no obstetrical contraindications to vaginal delivery. The timing of induction is individualized, taking into account the gravida's cardiac status, “inducibility” of the cervix, and probability of fetal lung maturity as determined by gestational age and/or amniocentesis. Long inductions in women with an unfavorable cervix should be avoided.
        </p>
        <p>
         Induction of labor in gravidas with a favorable cervix usually requires only

          oxytocin
         </a>
         administration and artificial rupture of the membranes. An unfavorable cervix can be ripened by a variety of methods. The softened, dilated cervix is more responsive to the subsequent induction of labor. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         The method of choice for cervical ripening may vary with the clinical setting. Mechanical methods are preferable in the patient with cyanosis where a drop in systemic vascular resistance and/or blood pressure would be detrimental. If a mechanical method is not possible, we favor

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         A mechanical method, such as a Foley catheter, is favored due to concerns of potential adverse effects from pharmacologic agents for cervical ripening. However, there is a theoretical risk of infection from introduction of a foreign body. While there is no categorical contraindication to

        </p>
        <p>
         During labor, the gravida should be in a lateral decubitus position to minimize uterine compression of the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava, and thus to attenuate the hemodynamic fluctuations associated with major uterine contractions in the supine position. The fetal head should be allowed to descend to the perineum in response to the forces of labor, unassisted by maternal pushing, in order to avoid the undesirable circulatory effects of the Valsalva maneuver. Delivery can then be assisted by low forceps or vacuum extraction. (See

         For the pregnant woman with a functionally significant congenital cardiac malformation, regardless of whether or not there has been surgical repair, the anticipation and management of labor, delivery, and the puerperium are crucial if risk is to be minimized. There is consensus that cesarean delivery should be reserved for obstetrical indications, such as breech presentation, failure to progress, placenta previa, or some abnormal fetal heart rate patterns.

         </span>
         Ovarian function in women with congenital heart disease is an important concern. Whether or not ovarian function varies with the type of heart defect, and how reparative surgery affects ovarian function, remain largely unknown. In a report of 98 women (mean age 33), those who were cyanotic had a delay in onset of menstruation (by about one year) and an increased incidence of abnormally short or long cycle lengths. Women with acyanotic congenital heart disease had menstrual patterns similar to normal controls [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Abnormal menstrual patterns in cyanotic women are believed to represent a chronic anovulatory state related to dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis or to abnormal uterine hemostasis in response to chronic hypoxemia and erythrocytosis. It is not known if there is an age beyond which reparative cardiac surgery is unlikely to be followed by normal ovarian function, especially in cyanotic women. For women with subfertility due to anovulation, standard treatment such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9281" href="/z/d/drug information/9281.html" rel="external">

Although these methods are generally less effective than other techniques, they pose virtually no risk of complications. In women needing to avoid pregnancy due to their cardiac status, these methods should be avoided due to their high failure rate (18 percent for male condom).

         An intrauterine device (IUD) is an option for acyanotic or mildly cyanotic women who want a reversible method of contraception and are at low risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection. (See

         The higher dose levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (Mirena) has the advantage of reducing menstrual blood loss by 40 to 50 percent but may induce amenorrhea. It is effective for five years. A lower dose device is also available and is effective for three years. Systemic hormonal effects are minimal.

         A copper containing IUD has the advantage of lasting for at least 10 years, hence, less need to change the IUD and thus minimizing risk of infection. It will not interfere with medication metabolism, it causes no hormonal side effects, and has few contraindications related to medical conditions. It is not recommended in women who are anemic or cyanotic with hematocrit levels above 55 percent because intrinsic hemostatic defects increase the risk of excessive menstrual bleeding, which is more common with the copper containing IUD than the levonorgestrel-releasing IUD.

          Impact of physiologic changes in pregnancy
         </strong>
         – Normal alterations in circulatory and respiratory physiology during pregnancy can have deleterious effects on the mother with congenital heart disease and on her developing fetus. There are two major hemodynamic changes: fall in systemic vascular resistance and increase in cardiac output. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Hemodynamic changes'

         Edema – Pulmonary edema and marked peripheral edema should be distinguished from the normal physiologic peripheral edema of pregnancy. The edema typically seen during pregnancy does not connote excess risk and is due to an increase in total exchangeable sodium and water and inferior vena caval compression. Diuretics are not indicated and sodium restriction is not helpful for physiologic edema. (See

         Hypercoagulability – This is a particular concern in women at risk for thrombosis related to prosthetic heart valves, atrial fibrillation, previous thromboembolic events, or intracardiac shunts. Such patients are candidates for anticoagulation. Considerations in choosing an anticoagulation regimen should include adverse fetal effects (eg,
