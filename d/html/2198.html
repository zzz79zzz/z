It encompasses the individual’s search for meaning and purpose in life and the experience of the transcendent [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Spirituality also encompasses the connections one makes with others, themselves, nature, and to the sacred realms, inside as well as outside of traditional religion [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Viewed in this way, spirituality is an important component of quality of life (QOL) and may be a key factor in how people cope with illness, experience healing, and achieve a sense of coherence [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of chronic or life-threatening illness can lead to spiritual struggles for patients. The turmoil may be short for some patients and protracted for others as individuals attempt to make sense of the reality of their diagnosis with what gives them value and meaning in life. The journey may result in growth and transformation for some patients and families, distress and despair for others, and both for many people [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Spiritual care is an essential domain of palliative care. This topic will provide an overview of key spiritual issues in palliative care, describe approaches to spiritual assessment in the clinical setting, and propose a way to integrate treatment of spiritual distress into a palliative care treatment or care plan. Specific discussions on the incorporation of palliative care with regard to various religious traditions are beyond the scope of this topic [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. For more information regarding their role in clinical care, the clinician is advised to seek input from their local and institutionally based chaplaincy services. </p><p>A discussion about the influence of spirituality and religiousness on outcomes (ie, health care decision-making, QOL) in palliative care patients is provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94167.html" rel="external">"Influence of spirituality and religiousness on outcomes in palliative care patients"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H884321232"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For purposes of this discussion, the following definitions will apply:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Palliative care</strong> is an approach that improves the quality of life (QOL) of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification, impeccable assessment, and treatment of pain and suffering, including psychosocial, spiritual, and existential suffering as well as physical pain. The field of palliative care is broadly defined as applying to patients from the time of diagnosis of a serious or life-threatening illness until death [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14240.html" rel="external">"Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care", section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Spirituality</strong> can be defined as an individual’s relationship to and experience of transcendence [<a href="#rid6">6</a>] or the individual’s sense of peace, purpose, and interconnectedness, including existential concerns and beliefs about the meaning of life [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Because of the need to standardize a definition for spirituality in palliative care, a group of interprofessional experts in palliative and spiritual care produced a consensus definition of spirituality as “the aspect of humanity that refers to the way individuals seek and express meaning and purpose, and the way they experience their connectedness to the moment, to self, to others, to nature, and to the significant or sacred” [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. It may include religion, culture, and other worldviews but encompasses far more general ways these experiences are expressed, including through the arts, relationships with nature and others, and, for some, through the concept of secular humanism, the latter of which emphasizes reason, scientific inquiry, individual freedom and responsibility, human values, compassion, and the needs for tolerance and cooperation [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Religion</strong> is a formal structure through which a person expresses spirituality within a community. A religious community is then organized around common beliefs, attitudes, practices, traditions, and relationships [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Spiritual care</strong> is defined as interventions, individual or communal, that facilitate the ability to express the integration of the body, mind, and spirit to achieve wholeness, health, and a sense of connection to self, others, and/or a higher power [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p>The relationship between spirituality and health has gained attention in the United States and internationally. Spirituality (which includes religious and existential aspects of care) is one of eight specific domains of quality within palliative care, endorsed by the National Consensus Project (NCP) for Quality Palliative Care and numerous national organizations [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Illness can be seen as an injury to the wholeness of the human being, affecting the interrelated biologic, psychological, interpersonal, and spiritual dimensions of human experience [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Healing is seen as the restoration of these disruptions in both self-functioning and in relationships. It also asserts that the goal of any treatment must address the totality of the patient, including spiritual wellbeing [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>As patients approach the end of life, healing takes on greater significance. Despite our inability to ameliorate the patient’s disease, relief of suffering can be accomplished by focusing on other domains associated with the value and meaning of life; healing takes on broader significance as the patient approaches the end of life. Despite the inability to physically<em> </em>cure the patient in palliative care or hospice (particularly as they move closer to death), attention to the issues associated with the value and meaning of life, suffering, and death become important [<a href="#rid13">13</a>], including attention to physical suffering, psychological wellbeing, and strengthening of relationships with self and with the significant or sacred, however people understand that, which might include a relationship with God or another higher power [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14620056"><span class="h1">INFLUENCE OF SPIRITUALITY IN PALLIATIVE CARE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A growing body of literature supports the notion that spiritual care is a patient need and common quality of life (QOL) concern [<a href="#rid6">6,7,11,14</a>]. The data also suggest that patients’ spiritual, religious, and cultural beliefs affect health care decision-making and health care outcomes, including coping and QOL and pain management. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94167.html" rel="external">"Influence of spirituality and religiousness on outcomes in palliative care patients", section on 'Religiousness and health care decision-making'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94167.html" rel="external">"Influence of spirituality and religiousness on outcomes in palliative care patients", section on 'Impact of spirituality/religion on quality-of-life outcomes'</a>.)</p><p>Increasing evidence demonstrates that spiritual distress is a significant aspect of overall distress in palliative care patients, and that spiritual resources of strength are also important to assess. One study involving 491 patients with lung cancer and 366 family caregivers tested a palliative care intervention which included spiritual wellbeing as one of four QOL domains of the intervention [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The intervention led to improvements in several key areas of spiritual wellbeing. The study also supports the multidimensionality of spirituality, which includes constructs such as meaning and faith in both religious and nonreligious patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14620274"><span class="h2">Spiritual needs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As they approach the end of life, patients experience a myriad of struggles and needs that have been described as “spiritual.” Spiritual needs tend to be similar across all diseases and are related to love and belonging, hope, coping, meaning and purpose, faith and belief, and making the most of their time left [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. As such, spiritual needs are related to QOL [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p>The majority of patients with serious illness want their spiritual issues addressed in their care [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Patients cite a variety of reasons including increased trust in their clinician, feeling that their wishes are respected, that realistic hope can be encouraged, that their spiritual beliefs help them cope with their illness, and that it gives them a sense of meaning in their lives. Meeting these needs may influence health care utilization, especially as patients approach the end of life [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]. As the disease status changes and patients decline, it is important to periodically reevaluate spiritual needs [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14620370"><span class="h2">Spirituality and health care decision-making</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Spirituality and/or religion may influence end-of-life medical decision-making, along with personal philosophies [<a href="#rid22">22-24</a>]. For example, a naturalist may decline medications in favor of dietary and other interventions. Patients may also delay treatment choices in order to participate in spiritual rituals such as celebration of the solstice in the woods or participation in a religious ceremony [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94167.html" rel="external">"Influence of spirituality and religiousness on outcomes in palliative care patients", section on 'Influence of spirituality and religiousness on outcomes'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H884322348"><span class="h2">Spiritual coping and support</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Spiritual coping is the reliance on spiritual and/or cultural or religious beliefs to adapt to the stress related to illness [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. The available data suggest that spirituality or religious beliefs and practices can profoundly impact how patients cope with the suffering that accompanies a serious life-threatening illness, but the impact may be negative or positive. Most patients identify themselves as being religious or spiritual and also recognize elements of their lives which provide meaning and purpose [<a href="#rid1">1,6</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Negative religious coping (ie, statements regarding disease as punishment or an indicator of abandonment by God) is associated with higher levels of distress, confusion, and depression, and lower levels of physical and emotional wellbeing and QOL [<a href="#rid1">1,6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Most data examining the influence of spiritual coping on outcomes come from studies of patients with advanced malignancy [<a href="#rid1">1,6,19</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A study published in 2012 reported a positive impact of spirituality on QOL among patients undergoing palliative radiation therapy for advanced cancer [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. The impact of positive coping remained significant after controlling for other variables that impact cancer-related outcomes (eg, sex, age, race, and disease variables).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In other studies, cancer patients report that their spirituality is a source of strength that helps them cope, find meaning in their lives, and make sense of the cancer experience as they recover from treatment [<a href="#rid15">15,16,26-28</a>].</p><p></p><p>However, the importance of spirituality in coping has also been shown in other diseases, including motor neuron disease such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), sickle cell disease, HIV infection and AIDS, Alzheimer disease, multiple sclerosis, and heart failure. The National Consensus Project (NCP) Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care [<a href="#rid5">5</a>] includes spiritual care as one of the eight essential domains of care and stresses that this care applies to all of these diseases and any serious illness, across ages and setting.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H884322355"><span class="h2">Spiritual wellbeing and quality of life</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Spiritual wellbeing is the opposite construct of spiritual distress. Theoretically, spiritual wellbeing has an impact on QOL because it can impact other QOL dimensions, including the physical, psychological, interpersonal, or emotional [<a href="#rid9">9,29-34</a>]. Spiritual wellbeing is strongly associated with overall QOL, mental wellbeing, physical wellbeing, emotional wellbeing, and social wellbeing. Supporting spiritual wellbeing may be useful, especially as patients approach the end of life. Spirituality is associated with an improved QOL for those with chronic and serious illness, which appears to hold true regardless of life expectancy.</p><p>Cancer patients have reported their spirituality helped them find hope, gratitude, and positivity in their cancer experience, and that their spirituality is a source of strength that helps them cope, find meaning in their lives, and make sense of the cancer experience [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Other studies have shown that spiritual wellbeing in cancer patients has been associated with lower levels of depression, better QOL near death, and protection against end-of-life despair and desire for hastened death [<a href="#rid1">1,6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14620890"><span class="h2">Spiritual distress and existential suffering</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Spiritual distress as a distress category is supported by the Improving the Quality of Spiritual Care as a Dimension of Palliative Care Consensus Conference [<a href="#rid35">35</a>] and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Identifying spiritual distress as a “diagnosis” is important for several reasons. First, some degree of medicalization is necessary to ensure it is integrated as a dimension of the routine care of these patients. Second, in order to treat and support spiritual suffering, further classification of that suffering is needed to provide more holistic and appropriate care for the patients. Evidence of spiritual distress should prompt referral to chaplains for further assessment [<a href="#rid36">36-39</a>]. In the National Palliative Care Consensus conference entitled “Improving the Quality of Spiritual Care in Palliative Care” [<a href="#rid40">40</a>], a table of proposed spiritual distress diagnosis based on the NCCN spiritual assessment list and modified to address diagnosis applicable to clinician assessment of distress was developed and has been referenced in many papers and is used in the Interprofessional Spiritual Care Education Curriculum (ISPEC) [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. This table includes spiritual distress categories, as well as the proposed diagnosis or issue, listed with sample features from the history and examples of statements patients may say (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95002" href="/z/d/graphic/95002.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Further discussion on distress secondary to physical or psychosocial etiologies is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2196.html" rel="external">"Approach to symptom assessment in palliative care"</a>.)</p><p>The NCCN identified spiritual distress as a range extending from common, normal feelings of vulnerability, sadness, and fear to disabling issues resulting in depression, anxiety, panic, social isolation, and existential spiritual crises [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Spiritual distress might also present clinically as anger, low self-esteem, uncontrollable pain, or other symptoms. The incidence of spiritual distress ranges, with estimates between 40 and 73 percent reported [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. While specific to patients with cancer, we believe this definition also applies to patients with other medical conditions, where the prevalence is likely to be as high, including military veterans [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].</p><p>Studies have found that older adult patients or patients with chronic illness or cancer who experience spiritual distress are at risk for poorer health outcomes, including worse physical health, worse QOL, and greater depression [<a href="#rid1">1,3,6,23</a>]. Patients who report longstanding spiritual or religious struggles have been reported to be at greater risk of disability, higher indices of pain and fatigue, and more difficulties with daily physical functioning [<a href="#rid1">1,6</a>]. Although more limited data are available, spiritual distress may also predict a greater mortality risk, even when controlling for demographic, physical health, and mental health factors [<a href="#rid1">1,6</a>].</p><p>There are overlaps between spiritual distress and psychological distress and disorders, and patients vary on how these issues are discussed. All patients presenting with intense distress require a differential diagnosis to ascertain whether a psychological disorder (depression, unresolved grief, anxiety disorder, etc) is a primary driver or secondary result of spiritual distress. Similarly, mental health assessments require attention to spiritual issues that may be contributing to emotional suffering.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1662647145"><span class="h3">Differentiating spiritual, existential, and psychological suffering</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The lines differentiating spiritual distress, existential distress, and psychological distress are not always clear [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Different patients use different language for describing distress, some speaking more psychologically, others with more spiritual references, and others from an existential framework. Effective care requires open-minded and open-ended efforts to understand these multiple ways of thinking about and experiencing distress. Effective exploration requires eliciting and responding to the patient’s framework and language [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>It is also important to use clinical discernment to distinguish the source of the distress. As an example, a patient with major depression and spiritual or existential distress may benefit from referrals to both a mental health professional and a chaplain. Patients who are struggling with questions such as “Why is this happening to me? What is the meaning of my suffering?” may be asking a spiritual or psychological question, or may be viewing their distress within an existential framework. Four existential domains are recognized through which existential suffering can manifest (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef112202" href="/z/d/graphic/112202.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid43">43,44</a>]. Exploring the patient’s concerns using the patient’s framework is critical to good care. Including different members of the health care team to address the patient’s distress, based on a full assessment, and utilizing a person-centered approach are appropriate. (See <a class="local">'Interprofessional collaboration'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients may not disclose spiritual/psychological/existential suffering unless the clinician asks about it. A tool to aid health care providers in the diagnosis of existential suffering involves simply asking the patient, “Are you at peace?” [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. This very broad question allows patients to respond within their own framework, whether it is spiritual, psychological, or existential. A “no” answer should prompt further exploration for signs of distress and the nature of the distress, which may clarify whether referral to a chaplain or mental health clinician is appropriate [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. However, some patients may answer that they are at peace but still have spiritual distress, such as hopelessness. Therefore, a specific spiritual distress assessment is recommended as part of a thorough clinical history [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Spiritual screening'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2533760251"><span class="h1">SPIRITUAL STRENGTH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Spirituality also may present as a source of strength for patients and is sometimes referred to as an inner strength. Examples include the ability to find meaning, the ability to seek forgiveness or to forgive, or having a strong spiritual community involvement [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. Another example of spiritual strength may be a patient’s connection to God or the sacred. Spiritual strengths may help patients cope, find hope in the midst of suffering, find joy in life, and/or find the ability to be grateful [<a href="#rid22">22,47,48</a>]. Finally, some practices such as meditation, mindfulness, or prayer may be a resource of strength for patients. Interdisciplinary approaches to spiritual care are important to provide these resources, which requires training of clinicians in these modalities.</p><p>Spirituality also may present as a source of strength for patients and is sometimes referred to as an inner strength.

Fundamental to this model is the recognition of the role of all clinicians to attend to the whole person: body, mind, and spirit. This includes the obligation of all clinicians to attend to all dimensions of the suffering of a patient and family and to elicit the patient’s spiritual needs and then respect those beliefs and struggles.</p><p>This model has two main components:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The clinician-patient relationship – This is a relational component whereby spiritual care builds on the relationship between the clinician and patient and acknowledges the patient’s serious illness. Inherent to this aspect of spiritual care is the practice of compassionate presence, which can be characterized as being fully present with another as a witness to their own experience. The experience of compassionate presence by the clinician to the patient may result in a sense of healing by the patient within the context of the relationship with the clinician. This was described by the consensus conference as the concept of a transformational healing relationship. Healing may be finding meaning, hope, or a sense of coherence in the midst of their illness [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The clinical assessment and treatment of spiritual distress defined in two domains.

As a result, it requires extensive training, which is part of the certification process for professional chaplains. Chaplains are trained to deal with both spiritual and emotional issues.

Additional interventions might include art or music therapy, yoga, mindfulness meditation, and psychosocial therapy, such as dignity-based therapy [<a href="#rid63">63</a>].

For example, clinician-led prayer is not recommended.</p><p>Occasionally patients may ask their clinicians to pray with them or to participate in a spiritual ritual. Clinicians should respond according to their own comfort level. In such a scenario, clinicians can ask the patient to lead the prayer in their own tradition, or the clinician may ask the patient if they would like a chaplain to be present and lead the prayer.

Meaning, however, is patient-centered and not provider-centered. Thus, for some patients, loss might be reframed in the context of a life legacy. For others, meaning might be in reconciliation with a higher power or in doing a life review and finding meaning in significant moments of one’s life [<a href="#rid68">68</a>]. However, not all patients are able to frame their goals in these terms.</p><p>Concerns about symptoms and family wellbeing are usually paramount. Reconciliation with loved ones or with God and peacefulness are commonly additional goals for this phase of life. The clinician’s role is to help the patient identify their own goals of care in light of their medical condition, treatment options, and prognosis and to develop a care plan that addresses the patient’s goals of care (spiritual and psychosocial as well as physical goals) and to help put in place a personalized plan that respects what is most meaningful to the patient. Engaging the spiritual resources of the patient, either through the institution or the community, can provide comfort, not only to the patient but to the family as well.</p><p>Clinicians should be aware that decisions around life-sustaining treatment may be heavily influenced by the patient’s (and/or their loved ones’) cultural, spiritual or religious beliefs. Therefore, it is important to explore these beliefs in order to help patients think through preferences around specific interventions.</p><p>Some patients may not openly express spiritual, existential, or religious concerns, despite being troubled by them. Clinicians should listen to patients empathetically so that they might be able to learn and understand what these concerns are. This should be done without trying to alleviate the spiritual suffering or by providing premature (or false) reassurances.</p><p>End-of-life decisions can be very difficult for patients. It is important that the clinician respectfully shares prognostic data but in a way that honors each patient’s uniqueness and does not take away a sense of hope and meaning for the patient. The clinician should respond by listening to the patient, aiming for a better understanding of the patient’s viewpoint, and helping the patient understand the medical realities of their situation and what treatment can and cannot achieve, recognizing that scientific data are one part of a larger understanding of the patient’s illness and what that means to the patient. Thus, a goals of care discussion must be centered on what the patient and family value most, what their spiritual beliefs or values are, what their preferences are in the context of their illness, and how best to honor those for the patient.</p><p>Suffering of patients and families is often challenging for clinicians as many clinicians are trained to “fix” and attempt to resolve distress for patients. Not all suffering can be fixed. Clinicians cannot find and assign goals or legacy building for a patient. Most patients simply need to be heard fully by a compassionate clinician or chaplain who can be present to the patient’s suffering and pain. Most patients can find answers for themselves within the process of sharing their feelings and their pain with a caring clinician. This requires the clinician to be able to listen compassionately without an agenda, often in silence, to the pain of others and, in so doing, create an environment of trust where the patient feels safe to share their deepest concerns.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1299339356"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
