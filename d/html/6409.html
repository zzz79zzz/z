JDM is characterized by symmetric, proximal muscle weakness and distinct rashes of heliotrope dermatitis and Gottron papules. It is primarily a capillary vasculopathy. Juvenile polymyositis (JPM) probably is not a single disorder but rather is a name given to forms of IIM (a subgroup of IIM) without skin disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults"</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of JDM and other IIM of childhood is reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatment of these disorders are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6419.html" rel="external">"Juvenile dermatomyositis and other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6418.html" rel="external">"Juvenile dermatomyositis and polymyositis: Treatment, complications, and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CLASSIFICATION AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2122805104"><span class="h2">Criteria and scoring for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR; formerly known as European League Against Rheumatism)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) developed and validated revised classification and diagnostic criteria for adult and juvenile IIMs in 2017 (no points are given for age of onset &lt;18 years of age)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115665" href="/d/graphic/115665.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. These criteria replace the longstanding Bohan and Peter classification schema and diagnostic criteria for the various forms of myositis, including JDM, that were proposed in 1975 [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>The EULAR/ACR criteria include four variables related to muscle weakness and three related to skin manifestations, as well as variables related to laboratory measurements and other clinical manifestations. Muscle biopsies are infrequently performed in children. Thus, the EULAR/ACR criteria have one scoring system if no muscle biopsy is available and a separate scoring system if the patient has had a muscle biopsy.</p><p>The EULAR/ACR score in the absence of a muscle biopsy is interpreted as follows  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115665" href="/d/graphic/115665.html" rel="external">table 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Definite IIM</strong> – Score of ≥7.5; level of probability ≥90 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Probable IIM</strong> – Score of ≥5.5 to &lt;7.5; level of probability ≥55 to &lt;90 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Possible IIM</strong> – Score of 5.3 or 5.4; level of probability ≥50 to &lt;55 percent</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1427770633"><span class="h2">Categories of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The categories of IIM include [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM)</strong> – Pediatric patients who meet the criteria for IIM are classified as having JDM if they have objective, symmetric, proximal greater than distal, muscle weakness that is chronic and usually progressive <strong>and</strong> a heliotrope rash (reddish-purple rash on the upper eyelids with periorbital edema), Gottron papules (erythematous, papulosquamous eruption over the dorsal surfaces of the knuckles), and/or Gottron sign (flat, erythematous rash over the dorsal surfaces of the knuckles)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52062" href="/d/graphic/52062.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Amyopathic/hypomyopathic JDM</strong> – Patients with amyopathic/hypomyopathic JDM lack clinically evident weakness but have the characteristic JDM cutaneous findings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adermatitic JDM</strong> – Patients with this rare form of JDM lack skin findings but have the same muscle pathology as patients with JDM.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other IIM without skin findings</strong> – This category includes patients labeled as juvenile polymyositis (JPM). However, as the diagnostic tools become more sophisticated (eg, biopsies that demonstrate inflammatory dystrophies or autoantibodies that are markers of particular types of myositis such as anti-signal recognition particle [SRP] or anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase [HMGCR] for immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy [IMNM]), fewer patients are diagnosed with JPM, calling into question whether JPM is a specific entity. JPM probably is not a single disorder but rather is a name given to IIM without skin disease. IMNM seems to account for the cases previously labeled JPM [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p>Other forms of juvenile myositis in the differential diagnosis are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Other forms of myositis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2485106118"><span class="h2">When to suspect</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>JDM is suspected if there is both chronic, progressive muscle weakness that is symmetric (eg, both upper extremities or both lower extremities) and affects proximal muscles more than distal and/or characteristic cutaneous findings, including heliotrope rash, Gottron papules, and nailfold capillary abnormalities  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52062" href="/d/graphic/52062.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63190" href="/d/graphic/63190.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The diagnosis is more challenging when there is lack of cutaneous manifestations (adermatitic JDM), immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) and other forms of inflammatory myopathy, or lack of clinically evident weakness (amyopathic/hypomyopathic JDM). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6419.html" rel="external">"Juvenile dermatomyositis and other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H515393324"><span class="h2">Our diagnostic approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of JDM and other forms of IIM is primarily a clinical one  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115665" href="/d/graphic/115665.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) (see <a class="local">'Classification and diagnostic criteria'</a> above), although specific testing helps confirm the diagnosis (see <a class="local">'Specific tests'</a> below). The authors use the following approach in making the diagnosis of JDM and other IIM in their practice  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef138817" href="/d/graphic/138817.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial evaluation in all patients </strong>– All patients with suspected JDM or other IIM are examined for the characteristic cutaneous findings of JDM, including the rashes and nailfold capillary changes, and muscle strength testing is performed to evaluate for symmetric proximal muscle weakness. The diagnosis of JDM is suspected if cutaneous findings and weakness are present, amyopathic/hypomyopathic JDM if rash is present but weakness is absent, and adermatitic JDM or other IIM if weakness is present but cutaneous manifestations are absent. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6419.html" rel="external">"Juvenile dermatomyositis and other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations", section on 'Muscle weakness'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6419.html" rel="external">"Juvenile dermatomyositis and other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations", section on 'Cutaneous manifestations'</a> and <a class="local">'Muscle strength testing'</a> below and <a class="local">'Nailfold capillaroscopy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients whose muscle weakness is not typical of an IIM and who lack characteristic cutaneous findings should be evaluated for other myopathic disease or disorders due to denervation or neuropathy.

(See <a class="local">'Muscle biopsy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Measurement of muscle enzymes'</a> below and <a class="local">'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Antibody testing</strong> – We also perform myositis-specific antibody (MSA) and myositis-associated antibody (MAA) testing (best done by immunoprecipitation, but commercial line blot assays are more widely available). (See <a class="local">'Antibody testing'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6419.html" rel="external">"Juvenile dermatomyositis and other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations", section on 'Immunologic mechanisms'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Patients with characteristic cutaneous findings with or without proximal muscle weakness (suspected JDM, hypomyopathic JDM, amyopathic JDM, or other IIM):</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Muscle enzyme levels</strong> –<strong> </strong>In these patients, we measure serum muscle enzyme levels. These studies often provide evidence of the presence of myositis but not always (sensitivity approximately 60 to 80 percent; low specificity). Thus, further testing should still be performed even if levels are not elevated. (See <a class="local">'Measurement of muscle enzymes'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>MRI</strong> – We next perform short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence MRI of the whole body, or of the thigh and shoulder girdle muscles, to document evidence of muscle inflammation and confirm a diagnosis of JDM in a patient with typical clinical findings. If the MRI findings are consistent with JDM, we usually do not perform any further testing. (See <a class="local">'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Treatment should not be delayed if these additional testing modalities are not available, the presentation is typical, and disease is moderate to severe.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients with unusual clinical features or in whom the diagnosis remains uncertain</strong> – In these patients, we perform a muscle biopsy. Atypical clinical features include absence of rash, normal nailfold capillaries, and responses indicating lactic acidosis with exercise suggesting metabolic disease. (See <a class="local">'Muscle biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Electromyography (EMG) is a classically used test, but we almost never use it anymore because of its painful, invasive nature and availability of other diagnostic testing. (See <a class="local">'Electromyography'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3419268476"><span class="h2">Specific tests</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Elevation of muscle enzymes and STIR (fat-suppressed, T2-weighted) MRI are indicative of muscle edema and inflammation. A muscle biopsy may be used to confirm the diagnosis whenever the clinical evaluation and initial laboratory testing are inconclusive. As with any test, there are false positives and false negatives. Thus, any of these tests can be "normal" in a patient with juvenile IIM. (See <a class="local">'Our diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4275724159"><span class="h3">Test performed in all patients with suspected JDM/IIM</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Tests used to make the diagnosis of JDM/IIM in all patients include muscle strength testing and nailfold capillaroscopy. (See <a class="local">'Our diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h4">Muscle strength testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Testing of weakness is essential in assessing any child with suspected JDM or other IIM because symmetric proximal muscle weakness is a diagnostic requirement [<a href="#rid5">5,8</a>]. Any decrement in proximal muscle strength is considered a positive finding. Distal muscles are often weak in JDM and other IIM, but distal muscle weakness in the absence of proximal muscle weakness should prompt suspicion of other diagnoses.</p><p>A standardized confrontational (manual) muscle strength testing score of eight muscle groups, the MMT8, has been validated for use in assessing strength in JDM [<a href="#rid9">9</a>] and is also used in assessing patients suspected of having another form of IIM. Tested muscles comprise the deltoid, biceps, wrist extensors, quadriceps, ankle dorsiflexors, neck flexors, gluteus medius, and gluteus maximus [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. For the MMT8, muscle strength is scored on a 0 to 10 point scale (Kendall scale)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126332" href="/d/graphic/126332.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>].</p><p>The Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale (CMAS) is a clinical assessment tool that provides an objective measure of muscle strength  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef104902" href="/d/graphic/104902.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). The CMAS tests function and endurance by having a child complete a number of different physical maneuvers that assess primarily axial and proximal muscle groups [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. A score is assigned from 0 to 51, with a higher score indicating greater strength. In a validation study of 10 children with JDM or other IIM and 12 clinicians, the CMAS was found to correlate with the clinician global assessment of disease activity, manual muscle testing, and serum creatine kinase (CK) level, with excellent intra- and inter-rater reliability [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h4">Nailfold capillaroscopy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Abnormalities in nailfold capillaroscopy suggest an underlying connective tissue disease such as JDM, mixed connective tissue disease, or scleroderma (systemic sclerosis). Nailfold capillaroscopy is easily performed at the bedside or in clinic. A drop of oil or water-soluble gel is placed on the patient's fingernail bed, and a light microscope, dermatoscope, otoscope, or ophthalmoscope (set on the highest level of magnification) is used to assess nailfold capillary dilatation, tortuosity, dropout (loss of capillary loops), and the total number of capillaries per millimeter  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63190" href="/d/graphic/63190.html" rel="external">picture 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79285" href="/d/graphic/79285.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>In one study, nailfold capillary microscopy demonstrated a lower density of capillaries (4.9 versus 6.9 capillaries per millimeter) and increased capillary width in 18 children with connective tissue disease, including 8 with JDM, compared with 17 healthy control children [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>In another study of 84 children with a variety of rheumatologic disorders and 34 healthy controls, nailfold capillaroscopy demonstrated significant dropout and dilatation of nailfold capillaries in patients with childhood dermatomyositis or scleroderma compared with children with other rheumatologic diseases and controls [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Of the 25 patients with JDM for whom muscle biopsies were available, there was good correlation between the severity and number of vascular abnormalities on biopsy (eg, nonnecrotizing vasculitis or significant loss of capillary bed) and an increased likelihood of having nailfold capillaroscopic abnormalities.</p><p>In patients with JDM, abnormal nailfold capillaroscopy correlated with increased skin involvement, but not muscle weakness, in several studies [<a href="#rid14">14,17</a>]. However, in one study, loss of nailfold capillary density correlated with both muscle weakness and skin disease activity over time [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The likelihood of nailfold changes increases with the duration of untreated disease [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H796718344"><span class="h3">Tests performed in selected patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Muscle enzyme levels, MRI, antibody testing, and muscle biopsy are performed in select patients.

However, these enzymes may arise from sources other than muscle, even in patients with muscle weakness. In addition, normal levels do not exclude these diagnoses.</p><p>Although the majority of children with JDM or other IIM will have serum elevation of one or more of these enzymes, some patients may have normal values despite clinically evident weakness. This was illustrated in a retrospective study of 166 patients with JDM that reported normal serum levels of CK, LDH, and aldolase in 26, 13, and 17 percent of patients, respectively [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. The muscle enzyme levels were more likely to be normal with prolonged disease duration prior to treatment, particularly beyond four months.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h4">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>MRI, specifically T2-weighted and fat-suppressed (eg, STIR) images, shows muscle inflammation as edema (bright spots). Thus, MRI, either full body or of the thigh and shoulder muscles, is increasingly used in the diagnosis of childhood inflammatory myopathy to avoid the morbidity of muscle biopsy and EMG  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63190" href="/d/graphic/63190.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). Whole-body MRI is also emerging as an important method of determining the extent of muscle disease and following patients with JDM and other IIM [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>].</p><p>Of 122 children with various stages of JDM evaluated in one study from the United Kingdom and Ireland, 78 of 102 patients (76 percent) who underwent MRI had abnormalities consistent with myositis [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].
