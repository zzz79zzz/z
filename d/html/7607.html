For patients with cutaneous melanoma, the prognosis is related to the location, depth, and other biologic properties of the primary tumor, and the presence or absence of locoregional and distant metastatic disease. Surgery represents the principal treatment modality for primary cutaneous melanoma, and adequate excision is important to lessen the risk of a local recurrence. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7620.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of primary cutaneous melanoma or melanoma at other unusual sites"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7618.html" rel="external">"Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system and other prognostic factors in cutaneous melanoma"</a>.)</p><p>Local recurrence is defined (albeit somewhat arbitrarily) as tumor regrowth within 2 cm of the surgical scar following definitive excision of a primary melanoma with appropriate surgical margins in order to standardize treatment endpoints in clinical trials [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Recurrences that are more than 2 cm from the primary lesion but are not beyond the regional nodal basin are termed in-transit metastases [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p>The management of locally recurrent melanoma will be discussed here. The management of in-transit metastases is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7608.html" rel="external">"Cutaneous melanoma: In-transit metastases"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">MECHANISMS OF LOCAL RECURRENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Local recurrence potentially can arise as a result of one of several mechanisms. These include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Incomplete excision of the primary</strong> – Local recurrence may be due to incomplete excision of the primary tumor, even in the absence of a "positive surgical margin" in the resection specimen. Sampling error can prevent an accurate analysis of all margins of the surgical specimen. In theory, a wider excision with more generous margins might prevent this form of local recurrence. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7620.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of primary cutaneous melanoma or melanoma at other unusual sites", section on 'Resection margins'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>In-transit metastases</strong> – Another source of melanoma regrowth in close proximity to the original primary tumor is microsatellite or "in-transit" melanoma nodules that are not excised with the primary tumor mass because they are physically discontinuous from it. The presumed mechanism, lymphatic spread, is supported by the observation that the presence of satellite metastases in a primary excision specimen increases the risk for a subsequent local recurrence [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7608.html" rel="external">"Cutaneous melanoma: In-transit metastases"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Second primary melanomas </strong>– Misclassification of a new (de novo) primary melanoma that arises at the periphery of a previously excised melanoma may also be confused with a local recurrence. Histologic evidence of a melanoma precursor lesion within a suspected local recurrence should suggest the correct diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4843.html" rel="external">"Pathologic characteristics of melanoma"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hematogenous dissemination </strong>– A local recurrence can result from hematogenous dissemination with implantation of tumor cells close to the original excision site. A close association between hematogenous dissemination and local recurrence is suggested by data showing a high rate of distant metastases as the next site of relapse in patients with a local melanoma recurrence [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">RISK FACTORS FOR LOCAL RECURRENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The incidence of local recurrence as a first event in disease progression is approximately 3 to 5 percent [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. The majority of local recurrences occur early, but delayed recurrences are not infrequent and are more common with thinner lesions than with thicker ones  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57991" href="/z/d/graphic/57991.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>Several risk factors for local recurrence have been identified:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tumor thickness and excision margin </strong>– Thick primary melanomas are associated with an increased risk of local recurrence. However, resection of large amounts of normal tissue can affect both function and cosmesis, thus limiting the extent of surgical margins employed in some cases. Recommendations for margin width vary according to tumor thickness and are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7620.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of primary cutaneous melanoma or melanoma at other unusual sites", section on 'Resection margins'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anatomic site and ulceration </strong>– Melanomas arising in the head and neck region and melanomas with ulceration of the primary tumor are at high risk of local recurrence. In the Intergroup Melanoma Trial, the incidence of local recurrence for primary lesions of the proximal extremities, trunk, distal extremities, and head and neck area were 1, 3, 5, and 9 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Among those with melanomas at low-risk sites (ie, proximal extremities or trunk), the risk of local recurrence was significantly increased if ulceration was present (6.6 versus 1.1 percent without ulceration). Those with primary lesions in high-risk locations (head and neck or distal extremities) also had a significantly increased risk of local recurrence if ulceration was present (16.2 versus 2.1 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Desmoplastic histology </strong>– Desmoplastic melanomas have been associated with substantially higher rates of local recurrence than other cutaneous melanomas. For this reason, adjuvant radiation therapy is sometimes indicated following initial resection of these melanomas. Neurotropism, often associated with desmoplastic melanoma, is not an independent risk factor for local recurrence [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7614.html" rel="external">"Radiation therapy in the management of melanoma", section on 'Cutaneous primary lesions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lymph node positive disease </strong>– Patients who have lymph node involvement (especially multiple positive bulky nodes or extracapsular extension) are at an increased risk of local recurrence as well as in the regional nodal basin. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7614.html" rel="external">"Radiation therapy in the management of melanoma", section on 'Regional lymph nodes'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Satellitosis </strong>– The presence of satellite lesions increases the risk of melanoma recurrence [<a href="#rid4">4,5,7,9</a>]. In the Intergroup Melanoma Trial there was a significantly higher rate of local recurrence in patients with satellite lesions (32 versus 2 percent in those without satellite lesions) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">LOCAL RECURRENCE AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The development of a local recurrence in a patient with cutaneous melanoma following adequate resection of the primary tumor has historically been associated with a relatively poor prognosis. In the Intergroup Melanoma Trial, the 5 and 10-year survival rates were 9 and 5 percent, respectively, when local recurrence was the first site of failure. In contrast, there was an 86 percent five-year survival rate for those who did not develop a local recurrence [<a href="#rid1">1,5,7</a>]. More recent series that predate the approvals of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16084" href="/z/d/drug information/16084.html" rel="external">ipilimumab</a> and BRAF inhibitors suggest 5 and 10-year survival rates in the 50 and 35 percent range, respectively [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Given these advances in systemic therapy, the survival of patients with a local recurrence continues to improve.</p><p>Whether distant metastases result from local or regional recurrences rather than as a manifestation of aggressive tumor biology is not known. Although it is unlikely that local recurrences are responsible for seeding most distant metastases, local recurrences may seed distant metastases in a subset of patients, and all reasonable measures should be taken to avoid a local recurrence. </p><p>Historically, the use of a skin graft to cover the melanoma excision site was advocated to allow early detection of a local recurrence with the goal of improving survival. However, multivariate analysis of the Intergroup Melanoma Trial found that closure by skin graft versus primary closure with full-thickness flap had no impact on survival rates, even after accounting for all other factors that influenced the risk of a local recurrence [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>One unusual form of "true local recurrence" may be an exception that can be associated with a better prognosis. A local recurrence that is contiguous with the scar and that bears an in situ component that can be excised with a 1 to 2 cm margin is associated with five-year survival rates as high as 89 percent [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. These lesions have been termed "true local cutaneous recurrent melanoma." Many of these lesions probably represent new primary melanomas occurring within a "field defect" (see <a class="local">'Mechanisms of local recurrence'</a> above).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who develop a local recurrence of their primary melanoma have a range of therapeutic options available to them. Given the variable availability of these therapies, these patients should be discussed at a multidisciplinary tumor board with expertise in melanoma management whenever possible. These discussions should include both the initial work up as well as the therapeutic options, which can range from simple surgical excision through various regional treatments to systemic therapies potentially used in a neoadjuvant fashion. There are numerous clinical trials available for this group of patients as well. A summary of various staging and therapeutic options are outlined below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H556504976"><span class="h2">Evaluation</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H901188806"><span class="h3">Imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with a local recurrence of melanoma should undergo a careful evaluation for other sites of recurrence, including a careful history and physical examination and appropriate imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and full body positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). The evaluation of patients with locoregional recurrence of melanoma is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7625.html" rel="external">"Imaging studies in melanoma", section on 'Approach to patient imaging based on disease site'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H556505035"><span class="h3">Lymphatic mapping and SLNB</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Appropriate patients with isolated local recurrence or in-transit disease should be evaluated for lymphatic mapping and a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) because of its prognostic significance and the potential for additional therapeutic options in the setting of a positive SLNB. Factors influencing this decision should be similar to those for patients with an aggressive primary melanoma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7616.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of regional nodes in primary cutaneous melanoma", section on 'SLNB timing and technique'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7616.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of regional nodes in primary cutaneous melanoma"</a>.)</p><p>There are two main issues pertaining to SLNB for local recurrence. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Accuracy after wide excision </strong>– Observational studies in patients who underwent SLNB after a wide local excision suggest that an SLNB is accurate and reflects the nodal status of the draining regional basin. Data are as follows: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a series of 104 patients from MD Anderson, the sentinel lymph node was identified in 103 (99 percent) and was positive in 18 percent [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Over a 51-month median follow-up period there were no nodal basin recurrences in any of the patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In another series of 76 patients, the sentinel lymph node was successfully identified in 75 cases (98 percent) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In this study, 11 patients (15 percent) had a positive SLNB. Among those with a negative SLNB, only 3 of 64 (4 percent) subsequently developed regional lymph node recurrence in conjunction with a systemic recurrence, and one patient had an isolated regional recurrence.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prognostic significance </strong>– Limited data suggest that SLNB has prognostic significance in patients with local and in-transit metastases. In a study involving 30 patients with local or in-transit recurrence, the median disease-free survival was 16 months when SLNB was positive and 36 months when SLNB was negative [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p></p><p>Regarding the role of SLNB in patients with in-transit disease, one study looking at SLNB in 33 patients with in-transit disease found that the technique could be performed successfully in patients who had undergone a previous SLNB, although a previous biopsy can make a repeat procedure more difficult [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Using a technique in which the most proximal in-transit lesion was injected with radioactive sulfa colloid, the sentinel lymph node was identified 97 percent of the time and was positive 33 percent of the time. There was a statistically significant difference in the time to development of distant metastatic disease in patients who had a positive sentinel lymph node as compared with those who did not. The authors suggested considering SLNB when patients had a small volume of in-transit disease (&lt;3 lesions) and where surgery was being considered as the primary treatment modality. The role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with more advanced in-transit disease is less clear.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Resection is the treatment of choice for most patients with local recurrences of cutaneous melanoma. For patients with a local recurrence <strong>and</strong> evidence of regional nodal disease either clinically or on imaging studies, discussion at a multidisciplinary tumor board should take place for evaluation of neoadjuvant systemic therapy prior to surgery to remove the local recurrence and further therapeutic nodal dissection.</p><p>For patients who are examined at regular intervals following the treatment of a primary melanoma, local recurrences are more likely to be detected at a stage in which they can be successfully managed by surgical resection [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Most melanoma surgeons recommend the use of resection margins for recurrences that are sufficient to ensure a grossly and microscopically clear margin, although there are no data that definitively address this issue. Radical surgery employing extensive margins for a local recurrence is not justified. However, even when more conservative margins are used to excise a local recurrence, the surgical defect often requires use of a skin graft because of the previous wide local excision. If surgical excision of the local recurrence cannot be closed primarily and is going to require some type of reconstruction, then patients should be evaluated for alternative initial treatment approaches, such as neoadjuvant treatment or regional therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7615.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy for cutaneous melanoma"</a>.)</p><p>If microscopic lymph node disease is identified on SLNB, controversy exists as to the benefit of completion nodal dissection given the results of the MSLT-II and DeCOG randomized phase III trials. This group of patients should be discussed at a multidisciplinary tumor board to determine the benefit of additional surgery and/or adjuvant systemic therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7616.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of regional nodes in primary cutaneous melanoma", section on 'Subsequent management'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h2">Adjuvant therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with melanoma local recurrences are at high risk for the development of disseminated disease.</p><p>Randomized clinical trials are not available to address the value of adjuvant immunotherapy in patients who are rendered disease free following resection of a local recurrence. However, patients who have undergone resection of a local recurrence and have no other evidence of disease could be considered equivalent to stage III and have been included in adjuvant trials; as such, adjuvant therapy (immunotherapy with an anti-programmed cell death 1 [PD-1] agent or targeted therapy for those with a <em>BRAF</em> V600 mutation) should be discussed with patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7608.html" rel="external">"Cutaneous melanoma: In-transit metastases", section on 'Adjuvant systemic therapy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7615.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy for cutaneous melanoma", section on 'Factors that influence therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H267696561"><span class="h2">Isolated limb perfusion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Resection is not an option for some patients because of the extensive nature of their local recurrences. For such patients, hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion (ILP) can be an effective treatment option if the recurrence is located on an extremity. However, increasingly, neoadjuvant systemic approaches are being attempted rather than regional chemotherapy approaches. Regional chemotherapy in the form of ILP or isolated limb infusion tends to be reserved for individuals with large BRAF wild-type lesions who are unable to tolerate systemic immunotherapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7615.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy for cutaneous melanoma"</a>.)</p><p>ILP is more commonly applied to patients with extensive in-transit metastases, and these patients predominate in most series. The technique and results with this approach in patients with advanced locoregional disease are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7608.html" rel="external">"Cutaneous melanoma: In-transit metastases", section on 'Regional chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H267696567"><span class="h3">Adjuvant ILP</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The rationale for applying isolated limb perfusion (ILP) in the adjuvant (ie, postoperative setting) is to eliminate any microscopic residual cells that may remain locoregionally. Although adjuvant limb perfusion decreases the incidence of both in-transit and local recurrences, clinical trials have not demonstrated an improvement in survival. The results with adjuvant ILP are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7608.html" rel="external">"Cutaneous melanoma: In-transit metastases"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H267696573"><span class="h2">Isolated limb infusion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because of the technical complexities associated with hyperthermic ILP, investigators have examined intraarterial infusion of chemotherapy alone as an alternative. This technique and results in patients with in-transit metastases and local recurrences are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7608.html" rel="external">"Cutaneous melanoma: In-transit metastases", section on 'Regional chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H267696638"><span class="h2">Systemic therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Systemic treatment of melanoma results in a complete response in a fraction of patients with disseminated disease. Such an approach is generally reserved for situations in which the local recurrence is not readily resectable. In some cases, initial treatment with systemic therapy (eg, neoadjuvant therapy) can decrease tumor burden and reduce surgical morbidity [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7615.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy for cutaneous melanoma"</a>.)</p><p>Systemic treatment options that have been shown to alter the natural history of metastatic melanoma include therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors and molecularly targeted therapy against BRAF and MEK in patients whose tumors contain a V600 mutation in <em>BRAF</em>.

However, systemic therapy has gained preference to regional therapy options. There are limited head-to-head randomized trials comparing regional therapy with systemic therapy approaches. However, there is some evidence that isolated limb infusion followed by immunotherapy may improve antitumor responses [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h2">Intralesional therapy of cutaneous disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Intralesional therapy has several goals including local disease control with limited systemic toxicity and the theoretical potential to induce a systemic antitumor immune reaction. </p><p>Initially, intralesional Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) was used in an attempt to eradicate dermal and subcutaneous melanoma lesions with the hope of generating a systemic immune response, but severe toxicities led to a marked reduction in the clinical use of BCG. In early reports tumor regressions were seen in approximately 90 percent of injected lesions with regression of uninjected subcutaneous lesions occurring approximately 20 percent of the time. Regression of visceral disease, while reported, was a rare observation using BCG. As the use of BCG became more widespread, some significant toxicities were reported including severe skin reactions, systemic infections, and even anaphylaxis [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. </p><p>Compounds that are of interest are <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="104964" href="/z/d/drug information/104964.html" rel="external">talimogene laherparepvec</a> (T-VEC), HLA-B7 gene therapy (allovectin 7) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>], and PV-10 because of the perception that they may generate a specific antitumor immune response and be associated with a higher systemic response rate than is seen with other compounds injected into tumors.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H104551421"><span class="h3">Talimogene laherparepvec</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>T-VEC is an intralesional therapy that uses an attenuated oncolytic herpes simplex virus containing the granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene. GM-CSF has been used to enhance cellular immunity [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. When T-VEC is injected directly into tumor, its mechanism of action is due to a combination of a direct oncolytic effect from the viral infection and lytic replication, as well as the induction of a systemic immune response. </p><p>T-VEC was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat unresectable, injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal melanoma with limited visceral disease. This approval was based on data from a phase III trial (OPTiM) of 436 patients with unresectable, injectable stage III or IV melanoma with a limited visceral disease burden [<a href="#rid24">24-26</a>]. In this study, T-VEC improved objective and durable response rates, but had similar overall survival compared with GM-CSF. Further details of this study are discussed separately.
