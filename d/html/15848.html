         percentile or rising sharply) warrant additional steps to monitor growth and potential obesity-related comorbidities and encourage healthy lifestyle behaviors  (

          algorithm 1

         ). The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests early treatment using the highest level of intensity that is appropriate for and available to the child, rather than watchful waiting, when children have developed overweight or obesity [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. A practical application of this guidance is to tailor the intensity of treatment to the individual child and family, based on level of concern (severity of obesity and BMI trend), priorities of the family, and available local resources.
        </p>
        <p>
         Intensive treatment is particularly important for children ≥6 years old with severe obesity or concerning trends. It may require referral to a specialized medical weight management program for children or may be feasible in a primary care setting if the necessary clinician time and expertise are available, which may include collaboration with a registered dietitian and/or behavioral specialist and use of community resources for nutrition (eg, food assistance) and physical activity (eg, sports and recreation programs).
        </p>

         The discussion below provides ideas for how health behavior and lifestyle treatment can be implemented in a primary care setting, as well as considerations for referrals when needed.

         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Use preferred terms for discussing weight (most patients prefer terms such as "unhealthy weight" or "weight problem" rather than "obesity"  (

         Avoid using scare tactics (ie, conversation that emphasizes specific dire, long-term risks or discussion of invasive procedures used to assess comorbid conditions). Scare tactics may garner short-term attention but are rarely effective in achieving long-term change [

          9

         If there are time constraints, the counseling session can be brief (eg, 5 to 10 minutes) and use preprinted handouts. Additional contact time is valuable if time permits or if an allied health care provider (eg, dietitian or nurse) is available to provide counseling, education, or referral to resources. (See

        <p>
         These brief counseling sessions are repeated at each subsequent follow-up visit. To provide continuity and reinforce the message, the clinician should review the same concerns at a follow-up session. If progress has been made, the clinician should praise the family and encourage additional work. If no progress has been made, the clinician should engage in further problem-solving and/or work with the family to identify other goals that seem more achievable, taking care to not instill feelings of failure.

         Many families with obesity are sensitive about discussing the issue, reflecting widespread cultural bias including within the medical community [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15-17
         </a>
         ]. Individuals with obesity have often absorbed the bias themselves, leading to self-criticism, low self-esteem, and hopelessness; these feelings are often barriers to behavior change. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5869.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of the health consequences of obesity in children and adolescents", section on 'Psychosocial'

        </p>
        <p>
         To form a therapeutic alliance and engage the family in addressing weight-related behaviors, the clinician should carefully avoid a blaming approach. This might include discussing weight in a "matter of fact" manner but focusing on health rather than weight or appearance. By using sensitive language, the clinician demonstrates to the child and family that their office is a place of support, not judgment, which is essential to engaging them in behavior change [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. As examples:

         We initiate the discussion of weight management by acknowledging that some individuals gain weight more easily than others, in recognition of the role of genetics, epigenetics, physiology, and environment. It may be helpful to acknowledge the societal and environmental factors that promote weight gain, such as readily available energy-dense foods and mechanized transportation. These messages avoid blaming a patient or family with obesity, while still strongly encouraging them to invest in lifestyle change.

         We generally use neutral words like "excess weight" or "body mass index" because these terms are perceived by parents as less stigmatizing and more motivating than the terms "obese," "fat," or "chubby" [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,18
         </a>
         ]. We avoid discussing an "ideal weight" for the child, both because this is a moving target for a growing child but also because choosing a target ideal weight is often unrealistic and leads to discouragement. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Intensive treatment (when possible)'

         We choose terms that focus on health and function rather than appearance. We advise parents to also not comment on body size or weight, but instead use positive comments on healthy eating habits and goals to build the child's self-confidence. For children who already have overweight or obesity, we discuss the goal of "growing into a healthy body weight" and being "strong and healthy."

         Approaches will vary from child to child and should take into account the child's age, maturity, and overall developmental stage. The clinician may choose to discuss the topic initially with the parent, without the child present. This is especially important if the child has experienced weight-related teasing from peers or if there is a concern that the child might misinterpret the discussion. In our practice, for children 8 to 12 years of age, we often talk in general terms with the child about health, linking the discussion to the importance of healthy habits. More frank discussions are typically held with the parent alone to prevent misunderstanding on the side of the child. For adolescents, if time permits, having separate discussions with similar content with the patient and parent can support the adolescent's desire for autonomy while including the family for support.

         Effective approaches to behavior change are usually collaborative rather than prescriptive. Motivational interviewing is a patient-centered counseling technique that is increasingly used for obesity treatment [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,8,19-22
         </a>
         ]. This technique addresses a patient's ambivalence to change and focuses on their own values as a means to resolve that ambivalence [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. The clinician employs reflective listening to encourage patients to identify their own reasons for making a behavior change, as well as their own solutions. The tone of motivational interviewing is nonjudgmental, empathetic, and encouraging [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,23
         </a>
         ]. Practical tools are available to help clinicians learn and apply motivational interviewing in clinical practice. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Motivational approaches and training'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         To apply these techniques to weight management, clinicians should help the family focus on specific and achievable behavioral goals, which usually means selecting a few specific behaviors related to weight management and overall health and not goals for weight loss itself. Because the family and patient help to choose goals, they are more likely to be invested in the process and have confidence in their ability to change the behaviors, which greatly enhances the chance of success. A clinician using a motivational interviewing approach engages the family in a conversation to select specific behaviors to change, rather than dictates goals to the family [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. The child should be directly involved in decision-making, as appropriate to their age and with reasonable limits and expectations. For example, the child can participate in meal planning, but with proper limits, such as allowing them to help choose meals or recipes but within healthy bounds (eg, the child can choose a favorite vegetable or fruit as a side dish but not candy).
        </p>
        <p>
         The efficacy of motivational interviewing in weight management was summarized in a systematic review of six randomized trials that found an overall beneficial effect of motivational interviewing on anthropometric outcomes [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Several approaches can be used to evaluate a patient or family's readiness to change (or stage of change) [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ], including global assessment through interviewing questions or use of a numerical or visual analog scale (eg, "On a scale of 1 to 10, how ready are you to consider making this change [to diet or exercise]?"). This assessment may help a patient and clinician recognize ambivalence, which is an important step in changing behaviors.

          Rationale for family involvement
         </strong>
         – If possible, use family-based behavioral approaches to pediatric obesity treatment, incorporating at least one of the child's primary parents or caregivers [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,21
         </a>
         ]. Multiple studies demonstrate that having parents/caregivers involved is more effective for long-term weight management than targeting only the referred child without parental participation [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26-30
         </a>
         ]. Indeed, some effective interventions for young children have targeted the parent/caregiver alone [

         <strong>
          Avoid pressure and criticism
         </strong>
         – Advise family members to avoid exerting excessive pressure on the child to change behaviors and avoid teasing the child. They should avoid making comments that focus on weight or weight-related appearance ("weight talk"), even if the comments are phrased as compliments or are focused on individuals other than the child, including the parents themselves. Similarly, encourage the family to focus their conversation about food on healthy choices and healthy eating behaviors rather than dieting (ie, caloric restriction with a goal of weight loss) [

          2
         </a>

         Economic and work schedule challenges – Ask about food insecurity (eg, whether they sometimes run out of money for food); the family's living conditions (eg, whether there is a working stove and/or refrigerator); access to income assistance such as food stamps; and whether/which caregivers are available to help plan, prepare, and supervise the child's meals.

         Cultural factors – Ask the parent(s)/caregiver(s) and child what they think of the child's weight. Misperception of the child's weight status, such as a cultural preference for overweight in children, may affect a family's ability to effectively address the problem. Conversely, excessive anxiety about the child's weight status also can interfere with effective management. To address this issue, it is important to explore reasons for the anxiety in the parent or child. Reasons for excessive anxiety may include an overestimate of the child's risk for future obesity or a personal history of disordered eating in the parent.

         Nutrition and physical activity should be thought of as habitual behaviors, and weight loss counseling should focus on long-term behavior change rather than short-term weight loss. The best-established techniques used for pediatric obesity treatment use a behavioral change model rather than simply providing patients with education on obesity-related health risks, nutrition, and physical activity. Behavioral change counseling includes the following elements [

          Monitoring

         of target behaviors (logs of food, activity, or other behaviors, recorded by the patient or family). This process allows the patient and family to recognize which behaviors may be contributing to weight gain. Clinician feedback throughout the self-monitoring process is essential to behavior change. A patient's food log may also identify other contributors to eating behaviors, such as mealtime environment, boredom, and level of hunger, all of which can be valuable in the evaluation of stimulus control.

The reward should be negotiated by the parent and the child, ideally facilitated by the provider to ensure that the rewards are appropriate. For young children, specific behaviors can be rewarded by awarding tokens or recording stars in a log. When the child earns a certain number of tokens or stars, they receive a concrete reward. Rewards should be small activities or privileges that the child can participate in frequently rather than monetary incentives or toys; food should not be used as a reward.

Moreover, in the United States, low-income, preschool-aged children who participated in a comprehensive intervention that included educational enrichment on health and nutrition, family support, health resources, and community outreach services were less likely to have obesity as adults compared with a matched control group (any obesity 43 versus 48 percent, moderate or severe obesity 19 versus 23 percent) [

          55

          Higher intensity of intervention
         </strong>
         – Most available data suggest that substantial hours of provider contact are necessary to improve a child's weight status. As an example, systematic reviews concluded that behavioral interventions of moderate or high intensity (defined as 26 to 75 hours or &gt;75 hours of provider contact, respectively) are effective in achieving short-term (up to 12 months) weight improvements in children [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,20,61,62
         </a>
         ]. Interventions at this level of intensity are usually impractical for use in a primary care setting, unless ample services from dietitians or other specialized counselors are readily available and funded.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Low-intensity interventions (less than 25 hours of provider contact, typically spread over three to six months) are feasible in a primary care setting, although there is a limited evidence base to support their efficacy. Clinical trials suggest that these low-intensity interventions for treatment of childhood obesity generally have weak or inconsistent effects [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44-46,62-64
         </a>
         ]. However, one randomized study of a guided self-help intervention reported modest but significant benefits on obesity at six months follow-up [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65
         </a>
         ]. The program consisted of a one-hour orientation followed by 13 20-minute follow-up sessions (total of 5.3 hours of provider contact) and home use of a self-help manual that included topics such as the traffic light eating plan, stimulus control, physical activities, motivation, social support, and relapse prevention. Compared with a more intensive family-based behavioral treatment program, guided self-help had similar effects on obesity but lower attrition from the program.

         It is likely that low-intensity interventions may have important effects on obesity and health behaviors in some patients, even if they have little or no measurable effect on the study population as a whole. Moreover, meta-analyses suggest that lifestyle interventions to prevent and treat obesity in children are generally effective, even if some of the included studies are too small to show statistically significant changes in weight status [

         Implementation and efficacy of family-based treatment in a primary care setting was evaluated in a randomized trial of 452 children aged 6 to 12 years with overweight or obesity (mean body mass index [BMI] percentile 97.3) [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. The intervention consisted of diet, activity, and behavior change guidance delivered by a health coach in approximately 30 sessions over two years, compared with usual care. Longitudinal analysis revealed modest benefits on weight outcomes for children that were sustained during the two-year intervention, with minor benefits for parents and siblings. At the end of the intervention, the between-group difference in percentage above median BMI was -6.21 percent (95% CI -10.14 to -2.29), which is a smaller treatment effect than in similar trials performed in a specialty clinic setting and of borderline clinical significance. Nonetheless, the study provides proof of concept for a family-based intervention implemented by behaviorally trained coaches embedded in a primary care practice.

         </sup>
         (95% CI -0.14 to -0.05). While the effect on mean BMI is small, some individuals will experience substantially greater benefits from this type of intervention and a small change represents a clinically important difference across a population. The best supported strategies were interventions focusing on both diet and physical activity for preschool-aged children and physical activity with or without diet in school-aged children or adolescents. Because the intervention strategies and results varied widely among the included studies, the effect of each intervention component is not clear.

         – Assess the parents' weight status (eg, by asking whether the parents or other close family members struggle with their weight or by recording their BMI). Obesity in a child's biologic parents is an important predictor of the child's risk of persistent obesity; if both parents have obesity, the child's risk of being obese as an adult is increased 6- to 15-fold as compared with a child whose parents have healthy body weights [

          Goal setting and counseling
         </strong>
         – Emphasize long-term changes in behaviors that are related to obesity risk rather than structured diet and exercise prescriptions. The approach is similar to that for obesity prevention, except with more specific goal setting and more time spent counseling and providing strategies to overcome obstacles.

         Selection of goals – We use a practical, problem-oriented approach, working collaboratively with the patient and family to identify a few specific goals for behavior change, then tracking progress toward those goals during follow-up visits. Examples of goals, supportive evidence, and counseling tips are shown in the tables for eating and nutrition  (

          table 4

         ). A more detailed assessment of caloric intake and physical activity is often impractical in the primary care setting, has low accuracy, and is not usually necessary to support a brief counseling intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Selection of goals also depends on the family's finances, available caregivers, and schedules. Identifying who is responsible for shopping and meal preparation, how the child spends time outside of school, who is responsible for supervision, and typical context for meals (location and who is at the table) helps to identify the most appropriate people and practices for focused counseling. In motivational interviewing, assisting the family in identifying goals will help in establishing goals that are achievable and pertinent to them.

         Commercial programs – Advise families and children to be cautious about commercial or social media-based weight management approaches, which often do not account for children's ages or developmental status. If the family wants to try one of these approaches, review the program with them, discuss whether it is age appropriate and nutritionally sound, and arrange for follow-up, especially to ensure healthy eating patterns.

          91

         ]. Conversely, restrictive approaches to weight management, such as detailed monitoring of caloric intake and exercise, are not recommended, because they rarely produce long-term weight loss and can promote unhealthy eating patterns [

         For children who are school-aged and older, we generally encourage structured physical activity (ie, participation in team or individual sports or supervised exercise sessions) rather than self-guided activities (eg, unscheduled walking or running). In structured activities, the presence of a coach or leader provides accountability and encourages consistent participation. However, whether a child is willing to engage in structured activities varies, particularly for adolescents. Some adolescents will enjoy engaging in sports or fitness centers, while others may not, due to lack of self-confidence or self-esteem. Directly engaging adolescents in choosing activities to replace sedentary time is helpful.

         – We generally avoid setting specific weight loss goals during discussions with the patient and family and instead emphasize goals for dietary and physical activity behaviors.

         For children and adolescents with mild obesity, the goal of maintaining current body weight is appropriate because this will lead to a decrease in BMI as the child grows taller. If the child is in a phase of rapid linear growth, merely slowing weight gain is more realistic and often improves weight status. For adolescents who have completed linear growth, focus on healthy behaviors and a positive body image, with a long-term goal of gradual weight loss.

          Weight loss surgery

         Pharmacotherapy is increasingly used for adolescents with obesity as an adjunct to diet and physical activity interventions. Appropriate use requires specific expertise in the use of these drugs, associated ongoing intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment, and close follow-up. This combination of services is most readily available in a comprehensive multidisciplinary weight management program.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pharmacotherapy options for adolescents with obesity are limited by cost considerations and lack of information about long-term safety in adolescents; most drugs have relatively low efficacy [

          85,101,102

         ]. For adolescents with severe obesity, the benefit is unlikely to be clinically significant, except for patients with comorbid type 2 diabetes. As a result, surgical management is often the preferred strategy for patients with severe obesity. There may be a role for pharmacotherapy in carefully selected patients and with newer therapeutic agents [

         <strong>
          Rationale
         </strong>
         – Obesity during childhood is influenced by genetic, epigenetic, societal, behavioral, and environmental factors. Among these, only behavioral and environmental factors are modifiable during childhood, so these are the focus of clinical interventions. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5874.html" rel="external">
          "Definition, epidemiology, and etiology of obesity in children and adolescents"

         <strong>
          General approach
         </strong>
         – Counseling about weight and related habits should be supportive rather than blaming  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef141376" href="/z/d/graphic/141376.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), collaborative rather than prescriptive, focused on long-term behavior change rather than short-term diet and exercise prescriptions, and involve the entire family rather than on the child alone. These approaches help to support an ongoing therapeutic alliance and avoid disordered eating patterns. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Strategies for counseling about weight management'

Appropriate use of pharmacotherapy requires specific expertise in the use of these drugs, associated ongoing intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment, and close follow-up; this combination of services is most readily available in a comprehensive weight management program.
