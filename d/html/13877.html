         Minor wound management should reduce the likelihood of infection and be performed to achieve minimal scarring [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. It is especially critical that lip lacerations are repaired correctly to preserve the cosmetic appearance and functionality of the lip. When interacting with people, our vision is immediately directed towards the eyes and lips highlighting the aesthetic importance of lip structure. The lip also serves a critical role in speech articulation, food ingestion, and tactile sensation. Most lacerations can be repaired by the emergency clinician; however, there are rare circumstances where specialist referral may be necessary. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Indications for subspecialty consultation or referral'
         </a>

         The lip is a unique structure in the body and in cross section is composed of three layers: the mucosal layer (within the oral cavity), the middle muscular layer (orbicularis oris muscle), and the outer mucosal layer consisting of the wet vermillion (internal oral) and the dry vermillion (external oral) or the "red lip"  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60055" href="/z/d/graphic/60055.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The cosmetic outline of the lip where the facial skin meets the vermillion is referred to as the vermillion border. Aesthetically the vermillion border is crucial as light reflects at this juncture and misalignment by 1 mm will cause a noticeable scar.
        </p>
        <p>
         The blood supply to the lip arises from the superior and inferior labial arteries which are branches of the facial artery  (

          figure 2
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The lip is innervated by the infraorbital and inferior alveolar nerves which arise from the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V)  (

         In most instances, lip lacerations result from isolated trauma. However, as for all trauma patients, the initial clinical assessment should focus on rapid identification of potentially fatal conditions. For victims of major trauma, there should be immediate evaluation for airway compromise (while maintaining cervical spine immobilization) including the presence of midface (LeFort) injuries and dental or jaw fractures with oral hemorrhage, impaired breathing, hemorrhagic shock, and altered level of consciousness. Systematic evaluation helps ensure that potentially life-threatening injuries are promptly detected.

         In victims of major trauma, lip lacerations should be assessed during a careful and organized secondary survey. (See

         – When suspected, visualization of fractures among the complex curves of facial bones is best achieved using computed tomography (CT). CT scans of the face should include fine cuts and both coronal and sagittal reconstructions. CT angiography may be useful if the patient has a significant or expanding facial hematoma or if injury to or dissection of the carotid artery is a concern. (See

          Mandibular and dental fractures
         </strong>
         – Computed tomography (CT) accurately detects mandible fractures. The U-shape of the mandible and the presence of adjacent bony structures make it impossible to isolate the mandible on a flat x-ray film. Therefore, simple radiographs of the mandible are less sensitive for detecting fractures than panoramic radiographs (ie, Panorex) and can miss fractures of the condyle. If available, Panorex imaging can be used for isolated mandibular fractures, dental fractures, or fractures of the alveolar ridge instead of CT. (See

         Regional nerve blocks are the anesthetic method of choice for lip laceration repair. Direct infiltration of local anesthetic into lip lacerations should be avoided as this can distort the lip tissue, making it more difficult to complete an optimal cosmetic repair. Infraorbital  (

         ) anesthetize the skin and mucosal surfaces of the upper and lower lips respectively. If the laceration crosses the midline, bilateral nerve blocks should be performed.

        <p>
         The techniques for infraorbital and mental nerve blocks are discussed in detail separately. (See

         Local or regional anesthesia prior to initiating irrigation and wound cleansing improves patient comfort. In young children and patients with heavily contaminated wounds, procedural sedation may also be necessary so that wound preparation can be tolerated. (See

         Oral and perioral wounds are contaminated wounds since saliva typically contains one million

         <a href="#rid2">
          2

          saline

         has not been shown to decrease rates of infection, the authors and others still perform irrigation of lip lacerations to enhance removal of gross contaminants within the wound [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. The suggested volume of irrigation solution is approximately 50 to 100 mL per centimeter of laceration. Particularly in sedated patients, care should be taken to frequently perform oral suction and to maintain patients in a head-up position so that aspiration of irrigation solution is prevented.
        </p>

         The presence of nonviable tissue increases the rate of infection after wound closure and such tissue should therefore be removed. However, debridement of lip lacerations and oral wounds should not routinely be performed by emergency clinicians because it distorts the original architecture and alters the cosmetic appearance. The presence of crushed, devitalized or necrotic tissue is a potential indication for surgical specialty consultation. (See

         – Precise repair of the vermillion border is essential for a good cosmetic outcome.

         We suggest that patients with through-and-through lip lacerations as well as those with significant mucosal involvement receive prophylactic antibiotics selected to cover oral flora (eg, penicillin,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8673" href="/z/d/drug information/8673.html" rel="external">
          amoxicillin

         ,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9231" href="/z/d/drug information/9231.html" rel="external">
          cephalexin
         </a>
         , or in penicillin-allergic patients,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9275" href="/z/d/drug information/9275.html" rel="external">
          clindamycin
         </a>
         ). However, evidence does
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         support administration of antibiotics to all patients with lip lacerations, especially clean wounds that do not involve wet mucosal surfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
         The risk of wound infection following lip laceration varies from 9 to 27 percent [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-11
         </a>
         ], and one single center observational study suggests that there is significant practice variation for the prescribing of prophylactic antibiotics to patients with oral lacerations [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Randomized trials have not shown a significant benefit of empiric antibiotics but have enrolled low numbers of patients and have not been blinded [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. One study did find fewer infections in compliant patients and in patients with more extensive lacerations (eg, through-and-through lip lacerations) versus no treatment (0 versus 18 percent and 7 versus 27 percent, respectively) although these results were not statistically significant [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Taken together, the evidence suggests that antibiotics may decrease the rate of wound infection after repair of lip lacerations with significant mucosal involvement and that this is a reasonable therapy given that oral and perioral lacerations are contaminated by abundant facultative species and obligate anaerobes. However, clean lacerations that do not involve wet mucosal surfaces and occur in healthy patients do not require antibiotic prophylaxis.

         <strong>
          Anatomy
         </strong>
         – The lip is a unique structure in the body and in cross section is composed of three layers: the mucosal layer (within the oral cavity), the middle muscular layer (orbicularis oris muscle), and the outer mucosal layer consisting of the wet vermillion (internal oral) and the dry vermillion (external oral) or the "red lip"  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60055" href="/z/d/graphic/60055.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The cosmetic outline of the lip where the facial skin meets the vermillion is referred to as the vermillion border. Aesthetically, the vermillion border is crucial as light reflects at this juncture and misalignment by 1 mm may cause a noticeable cosmetic defect. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Anatomy'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – Patients with lip lacerations require careful evaluation to determine the location and depth of the wound, whether the laceration involves the vermillion border or extends entirely through the lip, or is associated with significant trauma to the midface, dentition, or mandible. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Evaluation'

         <strong>
          Indications for subspecialty consultation
         </strong>
         – Surgical specialty consultation, if available, is appropriate for crush wounds, wounds with large defects, wounds with devitalized or necrotic tissue, and wounds with associated tooth avulsion, dental extrusion or lateral displacement with malocclusion, mandibular fracture, or LeFort fracture. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Anesthesia
         </strong>
         – Regional nerve blocks are the anesthetic method of choice for lip laceration repair. Direct infiltration of local anesthetic into lip lacerations should be avoided, as this can distort the lip tissue making it more difficult to complete an optimal cosmetic repair. Infraorbital  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77549" href="/z/d/graphic/77549.html" rel="external">
          figure 4

         ) and mental nerve blocks  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64720" href="/z/d/graphic/64720.html" rel="external">
          figure 5
         </a>
         ) anesthetize the skin and mucosal surfaces of the upper and lower lips respectively. If the laceration crosses the midline, bilateral nerve blocks should be performed. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Anesthesia and analgesia'

         <strong>
          Irrigation
         </strong>
         – Irrigate oral and perioral wounds with approximately 50 to 100 mL per centimeter of laceration. Although irrigation with normal
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">
          saline
         </a>
         has not been shown to decrease rates of infection, the authors and others still perform irrigation of lip lacerations. Oral and perioral wounds are essentially contaminated wounds, and irrigation enhances removal of gross contaminants within the wound. Antiseptics, such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9244" href="/z/d/drug information/9244.html" rel="external">
          chlorhexidine

          hydrogen peroxide
         </a>
         , should be avoided because they are cytotoxic and can cause tissue injury. Do not shave facial hair near the laceration. Debridement of lip lacerations and oral wounds should not be performed by inexperienced clinicians because it distorts the original architecture and alters the cosmetic appearance. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Irrigation and debridement'

          Wound repair
         </strong>
         – Primary closure (ie, wound repair at the time of presentation) is the preferred treatment for most lip lacerations. Wounds with obvious signs of inflammation (redness, warmth, swelling, pus drainage) should not be closed primarily. Lip laceration repair should also
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         delay further evaluation and definitive care of more urgent traumatic injuries, including underlying midface or jaw injuries. (See

          Prophylactic antibiotics
         </strong>
         – In a patient with a through-and-through lip laceration or significant mucosal involvement, we suggest administering prophylactic antibiotics (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). The antibiotic should cover oral flora (eg, penicillin,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9231" href="/z/d/drug information/9231.html" rel="external">
          cephalexin
         </a>
         , or in penicillin-allergic patients,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9275" href="/z/d/drug information/9275.html" rel="external">
          clindamycin
         </a>
         ). Prophylactic antibiotics may also decrease the risk of wound infection in patients with animal or human bites. However, evidence does
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         support administration of antibiotics to all healthy patients with lip lacerations, especially those with clean wounds that do not involve wet mucosal surfaces. (See
