         Isolated musculoskeletal chest pain has been attributed to a number of conditions  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79217" href="/z/d/graphic/79217.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Their management usually involves a range of general measures, topical agents, analgesics, and anti-inflammatories, which individually or together may be helpful for most patients with isolated musculoskeletal chest pain. Most musculoskeletal chest pain improves over the course of a few weeks or months. However, some patients require specialist referral for persistent symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are few data that specifically address the efficacy and safety of therapeutic interventions for patients with isolated musculoskeletal chest pain. In general, the use of these interventions in treating musculoskeletal chest pain is based upon analogy with their usefulness in treating pain of similar origin elsewhere in the body (eg, neck and low back pain).
        </p>
        <p>
         The management of isolated musculoskeletal chest pain will be discussed here. Causes of chest pain and the evaluation of chest pain in adults and children are discussed separately:

         There are several types of isolated musculoskeletal chest pain, a subset of the many local and systemic diseases and disorders that cause chest pain  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79217" href="/z/d/graphic/79217.html" rel="external">

         ). However, in primary care, pain localization in the sternal or retrosternal region is extremely common and does not reliably distinguish musculoskeletal chest pain from chest pain due to other causes [

         Initial management for most patients includes general nonpharmacologic interventions (see
         <a class="local">
          'General measures for most patients'

          'Analgesia'
         </a>
         below). Most isolated musculoskeletal pain improves over the course of a few weeks or months, and sometimes even within seconds, minutes, or hours. Hence, it is usually appropriate for clinicians to reassure patients, emphasize a favorable prognosis, and channel patients toward therapeutic measures with minimal risk for adverse effects (eg, cryotherapy or

         It is important to first confirm the suspicion of a musculoskeletal cause of the patient's chest pain, which must be differentiated from chest pain due to potentially life-threatening disorders, such as myocardial ischemia or infarction, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, or pneumothorax, and from chest pain due to systemic illnesses for which it may be one of multiple manifestations  (

         A few general measures may be helpful for patients with isolated musculoskeletal chest pain, including education, activity restriction or modification, and local application of heat and/or cold to the affected area. Although the efficacy and safety of these measures have not been specifically evaluated in patients with isolated musculoskeletal chest pain, they have been beneficial in treating musculoskeletal back and neck pain. (See

         All patients should receive education regarding the nature of their condition and the general management strategy. A common patient concern, stated or unstated, is that the pain is due to heart disease, and this concern must be addressed. Demonstration of the ability to reproduce or exacerbate the chest pain by palpation or with various maneuvers helps the patient understand the noncardiac nature of the problem. A careful explanation of the diagnosis may be therapeutic for some patients, with reassurance that watchful waiting without any other specific intervention is appropriate.

         Any activity that causes or reliably exacerbates the pain should be reduced or stopped, at least temporarily, if possible. As examples, overload and overuse, as during weight training, lifting, or pushing heavy objects, may cause musculoskeletal chest pain. Activity modification is particularly important for patients with spontaneous sternoclavicular subluxation (see
         <a class="local">
          'Spontaneous sternoclavicular joint subluxation'
         </a>
         below). Anecdotal reports of benefit from activity restriction are widespread, although not assessed in the scientific literature.

         For isolated musculoskeletal chest pain, the application of cold or heat may be helpful. We usually prefer heat in patients with more muscle spasm and cold for patients experiencing localized swelling, and we advise trying the alternate modality if the first is not beneficial. This approach is based upon clinical experience and common practice, but this approach has not been established in randomized trials.

         ]. Crushed ice (covered, not directly applied) can be compressed against the injured area for up to 20 minutes followed by an exposure to room temperature for one to two hours; this treatment may be repeated every 2 to 2.5 hours and continued for 48 hours.

         <strong>
          Heat therapy
         </strong>
         – Heat therapy increases blood flow and is thought to promote relaxation of tightened muscles. The usual recommendation is to avoid application of heat during the first 48 hours after an injury because of the potential to increase inflammation, although there are few high-quality data to support this approach. Heat is applied with either a heating pad, hot compress, or chemical heat pack for 20 minutes several times daily. Single-use, disposable heating pads or patches that can provide a source of heat for up to eight hours are available without a prescription; they can be applied to any part of the body. Thus, if local heat (eg, a heating pad) helps at home, such pads or patches may provide benefit in other settings, such as at the workplace. Care should be taken to avoid thermal injury from excessive temperature or prolonged exposure time.

         For patients with mild isolated musculoskeletal chest pain, defined as pain that does not interfere with light activity, we typically use
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen
         </a>
         or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in a low to moderate dose, rather than nonpharmacologic or topical measures alone. In addition, patients may also add a topical pain therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Comorbidities, patient preferences, and response to therapy influence the choice of agent. Although use of an oral analgesic has the advantage of ease of use, some patients may have relative or absolute contraindications to such agents (eg, renal, gastrointestinal, or cardiovascular disease). In others, the combination of a systemic and topical analgesic therapy together may be more effective.

         – Topical analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents, applied as creams, gels, or patches, can be used for a trial period of up to two weeks to determine efficacy of a given agent, which should then be discontinued if it does not provide adequate relief of symptoms. The medication can be continued as needed if it improves symptoms. Choice between agents is based upon patient preference and treatment response. Randomized trials lend the strongest support for topical NSAID preparations versus other topical options, including:

If pain relief with oral NSAID treatment alone is inadequate, we add acetaminophen (500 mg; one to two every three to four hours to a maximum, if needed, of up to 3000 mg daily). In addition, if a maximum acceptable dose of a particular NSAID does not relieve symptoms or efficacy wanes, anecdotal reports suggest that switching classes of NSAIDs may prove helpful (from an acetic acid to a propionic acid, for example)  (

         In patients in whom isolated musculoskeletal chest pain persists beyond four to six weeks, or if symptoms are not adequately controlled with initial treatment measures, additional interventions or specialty referral may be warranted depending upon the cause of pain or expertise required for effective management. These interventions are typically provided by a pain management specialist, orthopedist, physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist (physiatrist), rheumatologist, or interventional radiologist, depending upon the specific intervention, local referral and practice patterns, and the expertise and interest of the potential consultant. In some cases, referral to other specialists with an interest in these conditions, including primary care clinicians, pulmonologists, and cardiologists, may be appropriate. (See

          Initial evaluation
         </strong>
         – The first step in the management of suspected musculoskeletal chest pain is to confirm that the patient is not experiencing chest pain due to a potentially life-threatening disorder, such as myocardial ischemia or infarction, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, or pneumothorax, and that the patient does not have pain due to a systemic illness. The diagnostic evaluation of chest pain is described in detail separately. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial management'
         </a>
         above and

         <strong>
          Mild or moderate pain
         </strong>
         – For patients with isolated musculoskeletal chest pain of mild to moderate severity, we suggest initial treatment with both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic measures rather than nonpharmacologic measures alone (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Most isolated musculoskeletal pain improves over the course of a few weeks or months. The use of these interventions in treating musculoskeletal chest pain is similar to other types of musculoskeletal pain (eg, neck and low back pain).

         <strong>
          Nonpharmacologic measures
         </strong>
         – Nonpharmacologic measures include reassurance that the pain is not life threatening, avoidance of activities that cause or aggravate the pain, and local application of heat or cold. (See

         <strong>
          Choice of initial pharmacologic treatment
         </strong>
         – For most patients, we suggest initial treatment with an oral analgesic (ie, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID] or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen
         </a>
         ) rather than topical analgesics (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Analgesia'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Comorbidities, patient preferences, and response to therapy influence the choice of pharmacologic agent. In addition, some patients may have relative or absolute contraindications to oral analgesic agents (eg, kidney, gastrointestinal, or cardiovascular disease). For some patients, the combination of a systemic and topical analgesic therapy together may be more effective, although we generally avoid the concurrent use of topical and systemic NSAID therapy due to the potential increased risk of adverse effects and lack of benefit. (See
         <a class="local">

          Persistent pain

         – Isolated musculoskeletal chest pain that persists beyond six weeks or does not respond to initial treatment measures may warrant specialty referral for injections or other interventional techniques (see
