         Concern over the effects of mild traumatic brain injury, or concussion, sustained during sport has grown substantially in recent decades. While the effects of sports-related concussions (SRCs) are usually benign and self-limited, severe long-term sequelae can occur, and careful evaluation is needed.

         Our approach to the management of patients who have sustained a sports-related concussion (SRC) is provided below. Assuming there are no complicating factors, this approach is the same for the patient with their first SRC and those who have sustained one or two prior injuries. However, a more comprehensive evaluation and more specialized treatment may be needed if an athlete has any of the following:

         Early treatment common to nearly all cases of SRC includes the following:

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         After the initial 24 to 48 hours following injury, light cognitive and physical activity may be reintroduced gradually, provided they do not worsen symptoms. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Exercise'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Previously, therapeutic interventions beyond simple rest were reserved for patients whose concussion symptoms persisted longer than 10 to 14 days. Increasingly, interventions such as graduated aerobic exercise, physiotherapy, and vestibular rehabilitation have been initiated early to good effect [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Such interventions are based on a targeted assessment and determination of the clinical domains affected [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/131174.html" rel="external">
          "Clinic-based evaluation of sports-related concussion in adolescents and adults"

         </span>
         Contrary to earlier protocols that advocated strict physical and cognitive rest until the patient was asymptomatic, exercise has become an important part of treatment for SRC. Consensus guidelines state that the athlete need not be symptom free to begin exercise but recommend that exercise not worsen symptoms either during activity or after [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Multiple studies support this approach [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,6,7
         </a>
         ]. In a randomized trial of 99 patients (ages 11 to 22), no clinically significant differences in symptom reduction, balance, or neurocognitive performance were found between those assigned to strict rest for five days and those permitted an early stepwise return to activity following one to two days of rest [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Before introducing exercise, the clinician should have performed a careful examination that excludes any contraindications, such as cardiac or respiratory disease, significant vestibular problems, and lower limb or cervical spine injury. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/131174.html" rel="external">
          "Clinic-based evaluation of sports-related concussion in adolescents and adults", section on 'Clinic evaluation'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         We and others suggest a brief period of relative physical and cognitive rest for 24 to 48 hours immediately following injury, followed by an introduction and gradual increase in exercise. The initial types of exercise should be easy aerobic activities that
         <strong>
          do not worsen symptoms
         </strong>
         and
         <strong>
          do not entail any risk of falling
         </strong>
         or sustaining further head injury. Examples include riding a stationary bicycle and walking. Standardized exercise testing is a useful method for introducing a controlled physical stress and assessing patient response. Validated protocols that can be used to assess patients and introduce exercise include the Balke Treadmill Test [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ], Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test, and Buffalo Concussion Bike Test [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Heart rate, perceived exertion, and any symptoms should be recorded while the patient is at rest, during all grades of exercise, and during recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
         Gradually, over days to weeks depending on the severity of symptoms, more demanding activity can be introduced based on clinical evaluation and progress (ie, improvement of symptoms). Exercise such as resistance training, intense anaerobic exercise (eg, sprinting, agility work), and controlled contact training should be undertaken only with close supervision and based on appropriate clinical progress. Symptoms should be monitored during and after each exposure [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. A general approach to return to sport is provided  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61318" href="/z/d/graphic/61318.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Exercise, when introduced and performed properly, improves autonomic nervous system function, mood, sleep, and possibly other SRC-related symptoms. Conversely, uncontrolled, intense exercise performed prematurely can exacerbate the effects of SRC on the autonomic nervous system and worsen symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         The exercise intolerance demonstrated by some athletes following a SRC may be related to abnormal regulation of cerebral blood flow. As aerobic exercise tolerance increases, autonomic nervous system function improves. Thus, exercise below the symptom threshold may be therapeutic for SRC, but further research is needed.
        </p>
        <p>
         A systematic assessment of exercise tolerance using the Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test has been safely employed to prescribe a progressive, individualized aerobic exercise program with activity below the symptom threshold that enables patients to return to sport and work [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,11,12
         </a>
         ]. Further study should determine the efficacy and optimal timing, dose, and duration of subthreshold aerobic exercise acutely after SRC.

         There are no medications or supplements that have been shown to speed recovery following concussion. Clinicians should make this clear to athletes, parents/guardians, coaches, and other concerned parties. Depending upon the patient's symptoms and comorbidities, medications may be used to treat specific conditions, such as migraine headache or anxiety.

         Headache is the most common symptom associated with concussion [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13-15
         </a>
         ]. Treatment is guided by the type of headache. The three most common types of postconcussive headache are migraine-like (approximately 50 percent), tension-type (approximately 32 to 37 percent), and cervicogenic (approximately 4 percent) headache [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Postconcussive headache is discussed in greater detail separately. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         In the immediate 24 to 48 hours after injury,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen
         </a>
         is typically recommended for relief of headache, as it does not increase the risk for intracranial bleeding. When the presence of an intracranial bleed is deemed unlikely, most often because of improving symptoms when the patient is reassessed at 24 to 48 hours, patients may use other basic analgesics, such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8547" href="/z/d/drug information/8547.html" rel="external">
          ibuprofen
         </a>
         , for acute post-traumatic headache. Patients with a prior history of migraine headache who develop symptoms typical of previous attacks can be treated with their usual abortive medications. If these interventions are ineffective, additional steps are taken, as outlined in the following discussion. We advise against using medications such as opioids that may affect the patient's sensorium or cognition, as such treatment may impede recovery and complicate assessments of clinical progress. (See

         Headaches associated with an SRC may arise from or be exacerbated by other factors, including visual disturbances, photophobia, cervical injury, anxiety, stress, dehydration, nutritional deficits, and menstruation. In such cases, nonpharmacologic interventions such as physiotherapy, acupuncture, and massage may provide some relief in addition to standard treatments.

         Patients should try to maintain a regular sleep schedule consistent with normal circadian rhythms. Most importantly, patients should allow themselves sufficient time to sleep each day, as an increased need for sleep (pleiosomnia) is frequently observed after concussion and other traumatic brain injury. Individual time needs for sleep can be estimated based on whether the patient feels well rested after sleep and throughout the day or based on sleep times when no limits are set, such as during weekends and holidays. Ideally, sleep should not be curtailed by alarm clocks or other means.
        </p>
        <p>
         If possible, daytime naps are best avoided, unless this was part of an athlete's routine prior to their concussion and should be brief if taken. Naps should be avoided if night-time sleep has become interrupted. Daytime sun exposure combined with light exercise may help address circadian dysregulation. The management of insomnia and of other forms of disturbed sleep is reviewed separately. (See

         In some cases, treatment with melatonin may be helpful. The best-established use is for patients with delayed circadian rhythms, who have difficulty falling asleep until late in the evening and then oversleep in the morning. For such patients, melatonin is typically given nightly, one to two hours before the desired bedtime. Timed dosing, in combination with behavioral modifications, aims to restore healthy circadian rhythms. Administration of melatonin and supporting evidence in this setting are reviewed separately. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Melatonin has also been studied as a treatment for disturbed sleep more generally in patients with traumatic brain injury, with mixed results [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Its effects are generally modest, and the main appeal is its relative safety and tolerability compared with other medications for insomnia. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/96439.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         The use of sedatives, including benzodiazepines and atypical gamma aminobutyric acid agonists, to treat disturbed sleep following SRC is discouraged because of the potential negative effects on cognition [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20

         ]. However, athletes previously prescribed sedatives or other medications for anxiety or depression diagnosed prior to any concussion should continue these therapies as indicated.
        </p>
        <p>
         A variety of other sleep disorders may occur in the subacute to chronic phase of concussion recovery  (

         While not as common as headache or cognitive findings, anxiety and mood-related symptoms are relatively common with SRC. The first step in addressing such problems involves educating the athlete about the injury, specifics of treatment, and the expectation that the vast majority of athletes experience timely improvement in symptoms and dysfunction and ultimately complete resolution. Such education is often effective.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cognitive therapy and psychotherapy can play an important role in managing mood disorders that develop following an SRC. These should be implemented before medication is introduced. However, athletes previously prescribed sedatives or other medications for anxiety or depression diagnosed prior to any concussion should continue these therapies as indicated. Such patients should be evaluated by the clinician who treats their psychiatric illness in addition to the clinician managing their SRC. Specialist psychiatric consultation should be obtained if there is inadequate or no response to cognitive therapy.
        </p>

         Anxiety and mood-related symptoms are associated with delayed recovery and return to sport. (See

         New-onset concentration deficits, which are common in the acute and subacute stages of SRC, should not be treated with stimulant medication initially. However, in patients already taking a stimulant medication for a previously diagnosed attention disorder, the medication should only be withheld during the initial 24 to 48 hours following injury. It should then be resumed. All other cognitive and exercise restrictions should be observed in such patients.

         The goal of return-to-sport protocols is to enable athletes to return safely to sport when they are neurologically and physically able. Return-to-sport planning begins at the time of initial evaluation and requires coordination among clinicians, athletic trainers, coaches, parents/guardians, and the athlete. Only limited evidence is available, and return-to-sport plans are guided primarily by expert opinion. Protocols typically involve a stepwise progression beginning with activities of daily living and advancing through subsequent stages that introduce activities posing greater cognitive and physical demands, culminating in sport-specific activities. The time required for resolution of symptoms and return to full sport is discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prognosis'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The evaluating clinician relies on the athlete and athletic trainer to inform them of the athlete's progress. The clinician needs assurance that the athlete has no unresolved concussion symptoms or functional deficits, and that each stage has been completed without provoking symptoms, before allowing the athlete to return to full competition. The widely used Concussion in Sport Group return-to-sport protocol provides a sound approach and is provided here  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61318" href="/z/d/graphic/61318.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). The approach does not differ based on the type of sport to which the athlete is returning, be it collision (eg, rugby, American football, ice hockey), combat (eg, judo, wrestling), contact (eg, basketball, football [soccer]), or non-contact (eg, tennis, volleyball).
        </p>
        <p>
         Before an athlete begins a return-to-sport protocol, all concussion-related symptoms should be resolved (or, at a minimum, stable and not severe). The content of each stage or phase may be individualized based on the sport, age, level of play, and degree of supervision [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. As a general rule, each stage should last a minimum of 24 hours, and performance of all tasks at a given stage must not provoke symptoms before the athlete is permitted to move to the next stage. If symptoms do develop, the athlete should return to the previous stage. The time course for advancement may be modified based on individual factors such as a history of prior SRCs, previous recovery patterns, or specifics of the current injury.

         More severe symptoms initially and prominent anxiety or mood-related symptoms are associated with delayed recovery and return to sport. In a study of over 2000 high-level collegiate athletes in the United States, the reporting of affective symptoms (ie, more emotional, irritability, sadness, and/or nervousness or anxiety) was associated with significant delays in full return to play [

        <p>
         The athlete and others (eg, parents/guardians of adolescents) should be made aware of the possible long-term risks associated with their return to contact or collision sports.

         The rate at which patients can resume learning, reading, and using a computer will vary based on symptoms. In a systematic review of 278 studies notable for a large degree of heterogeneity, the average time for a concussed athlete to resume learning without restrictions was 8.3 days (95% CI 5.6-11.1), with 93 percent of athletes achieving this milestone by 10 days [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28

          29
         </a>
         ]. Students who resumed full coursework prior to the resolution of symptoms were significantly more likely to experience a prolonged recovery (21.5 percent less likely to return to full sport within 14 days; 95% CI -27.4 to -15.5) and delayed return to full sport (19.1 percent more likely to return after 28 days; 95% CI 13.4-24.7).

         </span>
         The decision to retire from sport because of the effects of an SRC can be difficult, and there is little high-quality evidence available to guide such decisions [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60,61
         </a>
         ]. If symptoms recur frequently or are particularly severe, the decision may be clear. However, the issues around reinjury and long-term risk can be challenging.
        </p>
        <p>
         We believe that the decision to retire from a contact or collision sport should be made by the athlete in close consultation with the primary clinician and other trusted members of the athlete's social network, possibly including parents/guardians, spouse or partner, siblings, friends, coaches, teammates, work colleagues, and members of their academic support team. The decision may be informed by input from medical specialists with expertise in those clinical domains most affected. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/131174.html" rel="external">
          "Clinic-based evaluation of sports-related concussion in adolescents and adults", section on 'Concussion symptom categories (clinical domains)'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The decision need not be made immediately. It is appropriate to consider the decision over weeks to months, during which time symptoms are monitored and feedback is provided. Below, we provide some guidance for approaching the question of retirement from sport following SRC.
        </p>
        <p>
         The question "how many is too many?" has no definitive answer. However, there is evidence of increased neurodegeneration and mortality among some participants in contact and collision sports that must be considered. When concussions are recurrent, occur from less impact, or cause prolonged symptoms, clinicians should warn athletes of potential long-term sequelae. In these situations, it is reasonable to remove the athlete from contact sport for a prolonged period (three to six months). This rest period can be used to address any identified deficits or problems and then re-evaluate. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/111925.html" rel="external">

         In some cases, an athlete may decide to retire from a sport based upon their own interpretation of their symptoms and assessment of their future risk. However, when making this decision, athletes often rely upon input from many people, possibly including their family, spouse or partner, friends, coaches, teammates, work colleagues, academic support team, and medical team. The team doctor, family or personal physician, and neurologist may all act as a sounding board for the athlete. In addition, the athlete may seek input from specialists, possibly including neurosurgeons, otolaryngologists, physical or occupational therapists, psychiatrists, clinical or neuropsychologists, and ophthalmologists.

         As with early assessments following acute injury, the medical evaluation of a player who has suffered numerous concussions, is experiencing prolonged symptoms, or is seeking advice regarding a future in contact sport should be thorough and cover all relevant clinical domains. Those domains that appear to be particularly problematic should prompt referral to a specialist.

         Many specialist evaluations must be repeated to determine whether the athlete's condition is improving. The primary supervising clinician should receive feedback after any specialist consultation and discuss the latest findings with the athlete. Decisions not to participate in sport may be provisional (for weeks or months) pending the results of future reassessments. Conversations about participation and risk may take place at any time, especially when new information comes to light or it becomes clear that the athlete's condition is becoming chronic.

          Exercise
         </strong>
         – Following the initial 24 to 48 hours of relative rest, athletes need not be symptom free to begin light exercise. Exercise should begin with easy aerobic activities that
         <strong>
          do not worsen symptoms
         </strong>
         and
         <strong>
          do not entail any risk of falling
         </strong>
         or sustaining further head injury. Gradually, over days to weeks depending on the severity of symptoms, more demanding activity is introduced while monitoring closely for symptoms, particularly those in the domains predominately affected. (See

          Pharmacologic therapy

         <strong>
          Headache
         </strong>
         – In the immediate 24 to 48 hours after injury,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen

          Mood disorders and anxiety
         </strong>
         – Educating the athlete about SRC and the expectation that the vast majority of players experience timely improvement in symptoms and dysfunction, and ultimately complete resolution, is often helpful. Cognitive therapy and psychotherapy can play an important role in managing mood disorders. Athletes previously prescribed sedatives or other medications for anxiety or depression diagnosed prior to any concussion should continue these therapies as indicated under the supervision of the prescribing clinician. Anxiety and mood disorders are associated with delayed return to sport. (See

          Prognosis
         </strong>
         – Clinical symptoms of SRC resolve in 80 to 90 percent of older adolescents and adults within two weeks. In younger athletes and adults over 40 years of age, this can take longer, but most return to preinjury levels of function within four weeks. Few athletes (2.9 percent) are medically disqualified for the remainder of their season or permanently. Guidance about possible retirement from sport is provided. (See
