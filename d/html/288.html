Patients present with a spectrum of signs and symptoms reflecting the many potential etiologies of chest pain. Diseases of the heart, aorta, lungs, esophagus, stomach, mediastinum, pleura, and abdominal viscera may all cause chest discomfort.</p><p>Clinicians in the ED focus on the immediate recognition and exclusion of life-threatening causes of chest pain. Patients with life-threatening etiologies for chest pain may appear deceptively well, manifesting neither vital sign nor physical examination abnormalities.</p><p>This topic review will discuss life-threatening and common causes of chest pain and provide an approach to the evaluation of chest pain patients in the ED. Detailed discussions of specific causes of chest pain, including the management of a suspected acute coronary syndrome in the ED are found separately.

The 28 day case mortality rate for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) among patients in developed nations is approximately 10 percent, but varies with the severity of disease and the treatment provided. Less than 15 to 30 percent of patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with nontraumatic chest pain have ACS, which includes myocardial infarction and unstable angina [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/184.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the emergency department"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/88.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of emergency department patients with chest pain at low or intermediate risk for acute coronary syndrome"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/66.html" rel="external">"Overview of the acute management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/68.html" rel="external">"Overview of the acute management of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">ACS results from atherosclerotic plaque rupture and thrombus formation via the adhesion, activation, and aggregation of platelets. Coronary blood flow is reduced and myocardial ischemia occurs. The degree and duration of the oxygen supply-demand mismatch determines whether the patient develops reversible myocardial ischemia without injury (unstable angina) or myocardial ischemia with injury (myocardial infarction). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1498.html" rel="external">"The role of platelets in coronary heart disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute aortic dissection</strong> – The incidence of aortic dissection is estimated at 3 per 100,000 patients per year. This number may be a gross underestimation of the true incidence as many patients die prior to diagnosis. Aortic dissection most commonly affects patients with systemic hypertension in their seventh decade of life, but it can affect younger individuals, particularly those with known aortic valve or connective tissue abnormalities. Dissection typically begins with a tear in the inner layer of the aortic wall allowing blood to track between the intima (inner layer) and media (middle layer). Pulsatile blood flow causes propagation of the dissection with subsequent obstruction of branch arteries (eg, coronary, carotid, mesenteric) leading to ischemic injury to areas perfused by those vessels. In approximately 13 percent of cases, no intimal tear is identified. Such patients have an acute intramural hematoma likely caused by bleeding of the vasa vasorum with intramural hematoma formation in the wall of the aorta. The clinical picture of aortic intramural hematoma and other acute aortic syndrome (eg, penetrating aortic ulcer, aortic rupture) is similar to classic acute aortic dissection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8190.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8178.html" rel="external">"Overview of acute aortic dissection and other acute aortic syndromes"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pulmonary embolism</strong> – The incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) is estimated at over 1 in 1000 patients, but the diagnosis is often missed and the incidence may be higher. Mortality rates vary widely based upon comorbid conditions and the size of the embolus. Early diagnosis and treatment reduce mortality for large hemodynamically unstable pulmonary emboli. Pulmonary embolism occurs when a dislodged venous clot migrates through the right side of the heart and becomes lodged at the branch point of the pulmonary arteries (saddle embolus) or more distally. Occlusion of pulmonary blood flow results in pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dysfunction, poor gas exchange, and ultimately parenchymal infarction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8253.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and pathogenesis of acute pulmonary embolism in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pneumothorax</strong> – Pneumothorax can occur following trauma or pulmonary procedures. It also occurs spontaneously in patients with underlying lung disease (secondary pneumothorax) and without (primary pneumothorax)  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef139477" href="/z/d/graphic/139477.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). Patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax tend to be younger males who are tall and thin. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs with greatest frequency in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, and asthma. Regardless of etiology, the accumulation of air in the pleural space can lead to tension pneumothorax with compression of the mediastinum, causing rapid clinical deterioration and death if unrecognized. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6706.html" rel="external">"Pneumothorax in adults: Epidemiology and etiology"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mediastinitis</strong> – Common causes of mediastinitis include odontogenic infections, esophageal perforation, and iatrogenic complications of cardiac surgery or upper gastrointestinal and airway procedures. Mortality for patients with mediastinitis remains high (14 to 42 percent), even when treated with operative debridement and antibiotics [<a href="#rid4">4-7</a>]. Delays in diagnosis further increase mortality. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2260.html" rel="external">"Boerhaave syndrome: Effort rupture of the esophagus"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7014.html" rel="external">"Postoperative mediastinitis after cardiac surgery"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pericardial tamponade</strong> – Pericardial tamponade occurs when there is accumulation of pericardial fluid under pressure, leading to impaired cardiac filling. Tamponade covers a spectrum of clinical severity. Some patients have mild compromise, while others develop a severe compromise in cardiac filling, producing a picture resembling cardiogenic shock that requires immediate reduction in pericardial pressure by pericardiocentesis. Tamponade may occur with aortic dissection, after thoracic trauma, or as a consequence of acute pericarditis from infection, malignancy, uremia, or some other cause. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4921.html" rel="external">"Cardiac tamponade"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Common conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Below is a brief description of diseases that commonly occur among emergency department (ED) patients complaining of chest pain. Gastrointestinal problems, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, comprise a significant number of such patients [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Common causes of chest pain that are not life-threatening are discussed in greater detail separately. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cardiac causes</strong> – Acute heart failure is frequently associated with chest discomfort. Patients with stable angina can usually identify their anginal chest pain and relay a history of exertional triggers. Valvular heart disease, such as aortic stenosis, may cause chest discomfort, which may signify worsening valvular function. Infectious or inflammatory causes of chest discomfort include pericarditis, myocarditis, and endocarditis. Accumulation of pericardial fluid can result in chest discomfort as can cardiac arrhythmias, especially if coronary blood flow is impaired. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3497.html" rel="external">"Approach to diagnosis and evaluation of acute decompensated heart failure in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1483.html" rel="external">"Chronic coronary syndrome: Overview of care"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8164.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aortic stenosis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2143.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and evaluation of adults with suspected left-sided native valve endocarditis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4940.html" rel="external">"Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4939.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pulmonary/pleural causes</strong> – Respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, tracheitis, and bronchitis, are frequently accompanied by chest discomfort and cough. Chest tightness is a common complaint with asthma exacerbations. A number of disease processes can result in increased pulmonary arterial pressures and resultant right sided heart dysfunction (cor pulmonale). Pulmonary malignancy can cause chest pain particularly if there is pleural involvement. Chest heaviness or discomfort may be noted with pleural effusions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7032.html" rel="external">"Clinical evaluation and diagnostic testing for community-acquired pneumonia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/528.html" rel="external">"Acute exacerbations of asthma in adults: Home and office management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8262.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease and/or hypoxemia (group 3 pulmonary hypertension): Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnostic evaluation in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6698.html" rel="external">"Pleural fluid analysis in adults with a pleural effusion"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gastrointestinal causes</strong> – Gastroesophageal reflux and esophageal spasm, rupture (Boerhaave syndrome), or inflammation can all present as chest discomfort. A sliding hiatal hernia may result in chest pain. Pain from pancreatitis can be referred to the chest. Gastrointestinal causes account for the symptoms of a sizable number of patients who complain of chest pain and do not have an acute coronary syndrome. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2265.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2262.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult with chest pain of esophageal origin"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2260.html" rel="external">"Boerhaave syndrome: Effort rupture of the esophagus"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5652.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute pancreatitis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Musculoskeletal causes</strong> – Musculoskeletal causes of chest pain include rib contusions and fractures, intercostal muscle strains, and costochondritis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5622.html" rel="external">"Major causes of musculoskeletal chest pain in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Psychiatric causes</strong> – Patients with panic attack often complain of chest tightness and a sense of impending doom. This remains a diagnosis of exclusion in the ED. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/108804.html" rel="external">"Management of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other conditions</strong> – Less commonly encountered conditions that may manifest as chest pain include: herpes zoster, referred pain, and pain associated with various inflammatory conditions and collagen vascular diseases, including lupus, sarcoid, scleroderma, Kawasaki disease, polyarteritis nodosa, and Takayasu arteritis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5289.html" rel="external">"Postherpetic neuralgia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">HISTORY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Thoracic organs share afferent nervous system pathways. This creates significant overlap in the symptoms patients experience when thoracic organs develop disease, and makes it difficult to distinguish which organ system is involved purely on the basis of history. Patient descriptions of their symptoms can be helpful in some instances, but emergency clinicians must guard against premature diagnostic closure based upon history. Several studies demonstrate that so-called "atypical" presentations occur more often than was previously thought and misinterpretation of such presentations increases the risk for misdiagnosis and adverse outcomes [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">General approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Obtain a detailed history of the patient's chest pain, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Onset of pain (eg, abrupt or gradual)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Provocation/Palliation (which activities provoke pain; which alleviate pain)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Quality of pain (eg, sharp, squeezing, pleuritic)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Radiation (eg, shoulder, jaw, back)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Site of pain (eg, substernal, chest wall, back, diffuse, localized)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Timing (eg, constant or episodic, duration of episodes, when pain began)</p><p></p><p>Ask about prior diagnostic studies (eg, stress test or coronary CT angiography) for similar symptoms or prior procedures (eg, cardiac catheterization). Ask whether the discomfort is similar to prior illness. Associated symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, dyspnea, syncope, and palpitations, can be helpful. Preceding or concomitant symptoms, such as fever or peripheral edema, may point to a diagnosis. Ask about risk factors for life-threatening illness, especially known risk factors for acute coronary syndrome, acute aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolus. These include the following and others discussed below: (See <a class="local">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Comorbidities: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, peripheral artery disease, malignancy, connective tissue disorders, bicuspid aortic valve, recent pregnancy </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recent events: trauma, major surgery or medical procedures (eg, endoscopy, aortic catheterization), periods of immobilization (eg, long plane ride)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other factors: cocaine use, cigarette use, family history</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Onset of pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The timing of the onset of chest pain can help to narrow the differential diagnosis. Pain that starts suddenly and is severe at onset is associated with acute aortic dissection, pneumothorax, and pulmonary embolism. Abrupt onset of pain was reported in 85 percent of patients in one registry of patients with acute aortic dissection [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Chest pain associated with pulmonary embolism can begin suddenly, but may worsen over time. Nontraumatic pneumothorax most often occurs suddenly at rest, without any precipitating event. A history of forceful vomiting preceding symptoms in a toxic appearing patient raises concern for a ruptured esophagus and mediastinitis. However, a significant portion of patients who rupture their esophagus give no history of vomiting and presentations vary [<a href="#rid11">11-13</a>].</p><p>Conversely, discomfort from an acute coronary syndrome typically starts gradually and may worsen with exertion. With stable angina, discomfort occurs only when activity creates an oxygen demand that outstrips supply limitations imposed by a fixed atherosclerotic lesion. This occurs at relatively predictable points and changes slowly over time. Unstable angina represents an abrupt change from baseline functioning, which may manifest as discomfort that begins at lower levels of exercise or at rest.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Pain quality and location</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients often describe the symptoms of an <strong>acute coronary syndrome</strong> (ACS) as discomfort rather than pain. The discomfort may be a pressure, heaviness, tightness, fullness, or squeezing. Ischemia is less likely if the discomfort is knifelike, sharp, pleuritic, or positional. The classic location is substernal or in the left chest, and radiation to the arm, neck, jaw, back, abdomen, or shoulders may occur. Pain that radiates to the shoulders or occurs with exertion significantly increases the relative risk for ACS. </p><p>Relief of pain following the administration of sublingual <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9706" href="/z/d/drug information/9706.html" rel="external">nitroglycerin</a> does <strong>not</strong> reliably distinguish between cardiac ischemia and noncardiac causes of chest pain [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. Beware of "atypical" presentations of ACS, which are common and occur more often in the elderly, diabetics, and women. Patients with "atypical" symptoms (eg, dyspnea, weakness) associated with their myocardial infarction fare worse than patients who experience typical symptoms, likely due to delays in diagnosis and treatment. These issues are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/184.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the emergency department", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/184.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the emergency department", section on 'Atypical presentations'</a>.)</p><p>An acute aortic dissection most often presents with the sudden onset of sharp, severe pain [<a href="#rid10">10,16</a>]. Patients may describe the pain as tearing, or ripping. However, according to the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD), presentations can be diverse and classic findings absent. The pain most often occurs in the chest, but can begin in the back, and may migrate or radiate into other areas of the chest, back, or abdomen, depending upon the portion of the aorta involved and the extent of the dissection. Sharp pain may also accompany pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, or pericarditis.</p><p>A <strong>pulmonary embolism</strong> (PE) can create different kinds of pain, or painless dyspnea. Pain associated with PE may worsen with deep inspiration, and may localize to the chest wall. Patients with <strong>pneumothorax</strong> report ipsilateral chest pain which may initially be sharp and pleuritic but may become dull or achy over time. The discomfort of <strong>pericarditis</strong> is classically positional: worse when lying supine and relieved somewhat when leaning forward. It may also worsen with deep inspiration.</p><p>Sharp, well-localized pain reproduced with movement or palpation of the chest wall is characteristic of <strong>musculoskeletal</strong> causes. Often the patient relates a history of trauma or strenuous activity prior to developing pain.</p><p>Burning pain in the chest and epigastrium is commonly associated with gastrointestinal causes. <strong>Esophageal rupture</strong> can cause chest and/or abdominal pain. Cardiac disease can cause identical symptoms, however, and emergency clinicians must avoid prematurely attributing such symptoms to gastrointestinal disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Associated symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting frequently accompany chest discomfort associated with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but are not predictive of ACS [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Elderly patients with ACS may only complain of symptoms other than chest pain, such as dyspnea, weakness, altered mental status, or syncope. Symptoms, such as diaphoresis and nausea, may also occur with nonischemic chest pain, including aortic dissection, pulmonary embolus, acute heart failure, and esophageal spasm.</p><p>Acute aortic dissection has a wide range of potential associated symptoms, depending on the arterial branches involved, which may confound the diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77441" href="/z/d/graphic/77441.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). According to one review, syncope accompanies 13 percent of dissections involving the ascending aorta [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Neurological symptoms, ranging from hoarseness to paraplegia and altered mental status, occur in 18 to 30 percent of patients with aortic dissection [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. ACS can occur when the dissection involves the coronary arteries.</p><p>Shortness of breath frequently accompanies pulmonary causes of chest pain and may be the predominant symptom in pulmonary embolus, pneumothorax, and pneumonia. Tachypnea is common with PE and may be accompanied by wheezing and fever. Young healthy patients may manifest only a relative tachypnea or tachycardia despite the presence of pneumonia or pulmonary embolism. Dyspnea is often the only complaint among elderly patients with ACS.</p><p>Cough, syncope, and hemoptysis may occur with pulmonary embolism or valvular heart disease (particularly mitral stenosis), although cough and hemoptysis are more common with bronchitis, pharyngitis, or exacerbations of COPD. Dyspnea and cough may accompany pericardial and pleural effusions regardless of etiology.</p><p>Preceding or concomitant pain and swelling in an extremity suggests deep venous thrombosis (DVT) complicated by pulmonary embolism. DVT occurs most often in the lower extremities but clots may also originate in the upper extremities and the large veins of the pelvis, where they may produce bilateral lower extremity swelling if the inferior vena cava becomes occluded.</p><p>Nausea and belching frequently accompany gastrointestinal causes of chest pain, but can also occur in patients with inferior myocardial infarction. Fever raises concern for infectious causes, but is also associated with pericarditis, myocarditis, and rarely acute myocardial infarction. A low-grade fever may accompany pulmonary embolus.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Risk factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Risk factors for <strong>acute coronary syndrome</strong> (ACS) include: male sex, age over 55 years, family history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and tobacco use. Cardiac risk factors are poor predictors of acute risk in symptomatic emergency department (ED) patients, as the presence of chest pain outweighs their predictive value [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. The absence of cardiac risk factors does not identify patients that can safely be discharged from the ED. Cocaine or amphetamine use raises concern for ACS regardless of other risk factors. Cocaine increases the metabolic demands of the heart via its stimulant effects, and also causes coronary artery vasoconstriction and promotes thrombus formation in patients who may otherwise be at low risk for ACS. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1506.html" rel="external">"Overview of established risk factors for cardiovascular disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/303.html" rel="external">"Cocaine: Acute intoxication"</a>.)</p><p>Aortic dissection occurs most often in older patients with systemic hypertension and atherosclerotic disease, but this description alone is not helpful for distinguishing it from other life-threatening conditions. The possibility of <strong>aortic dissection</strong> should be considered in patients with acquired or congenital conditions that weaken the structural architecture of the aortic wall. Patients younger than 40 years of age with connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan's syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, cocaine use, or pregnancy (particularly in combination with bicuspid aortic valve or connective tissue disease) are at risk for aortic dissection. Other factors that predispose to aortic dissection include previous aortic surgery and recent cardiac surgery or aortic instrumentation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8190.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection", section on 'High-risk conditions'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8178.html" rel="external">"Overview of acute aortic dissection and other acute aortic syndromes"</a>.)</p><p>An increased risk for deep vein thrombosis and subsequent <strong>pulmonary embolus</strong> exists among patients with a recent history of prolonged immobilization (eg, long distance travel), surgery (particularly an orthopedic procedure of the lower extremity lasting more than 30 minutes), central venous catheterization, or trauma. Also at risk are pregnant patients, patients with cancer, lung, or chronic heart disease, and those with a personal or family history of hypercoagulability. Use of certain hormonal contraceptives [<a href="#rid20">20</a>] or chemotherapeutic agents that raise serum levels of estrogen and, to a lesser extent, progestin also confer increased risk. A significant number of patients with PE may have no identifiable risk factor at the time of diagnosis, but subsequent evaluation reveals a hematologic predisposition for venous thrombosis (eg, Factor V Leiden mutation) or anatomic predisposition (eg, thoracic outlet syndrome). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8253.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and pathogenesis of acute pulmonary embolism in adults", section on 'Pathogenesis and pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>Tobacco use raises patient risk for cardiovascular and pulmonary disease. Smoking is also an independent risk factor for spontaneous <strong>pneumothorax</strong>, regardless of underlying lung disease. A high prevalence of spontaneous pneumothorax exists among HIV infected patients with pneumocystis carinii (<em>P. jirovecii</em>) pneumonia. Young females with endometriosis may experience menses-related pneumothoraces, also referred to as catamenial pneumothorax, if pleural involvement exists [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].

The ECG can be repeated if the initial ECG is not diagnostic but the patient remains symptomatic and there remains high clinical suspicion for AMI. Prior ECGs are important for determining whether abnormalities are new. The presence of a left bundle branch block makes it difficult to determine the presence of ischemic ECG changes.

Assume that any patient who presents with symptoms of an acute coronary syndrome within a few days or weeks following percutaneous coronary interventions (eg, angioplasty or stent placement) or coronary artery bypass grafting has an abruptly occluded coronary artery or graft until proven otherwise. Remain cautious when assessing the elderly, diabetics, and women, who are more likely to manifest "atypical" symptoms with ACS.

Often the biggest problem with PE is failure to consider the diagnosis. Emergency clinicians must consider PE a potential diagnosis in any patient with acute chest discomfort or dyspnea who lacks a firm alternative diagnosis (eg, myocardial infarction diagnosed by history and elevated ST segments, pericardial tamponade diagnosed by ultrasound).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The approach to patients with potential PE focuses on risk stratification.

For patients at low-clinical risk it is generally reasonable to withhold anticoagulant therapy while a D-dimer test is performed. In patients at low risk, PE can be ruled out with a negative D-dimer test, provided the test is of high sensitivity. Patients at low risk but whose D-dimer test is positive and those at higher risk require further testing. The PERC rule identifies patients at sufficiently low risk for PE that even D-dimer testing may be unnecessary.
