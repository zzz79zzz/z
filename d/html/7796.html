         Cannabis (also called marijuana) is the third most commonly used psychoactive substance worldwide, after alcohol and tobacco (nicotine) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Its psychoactive properties are primarily due to one cannabinoid: delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); THC concentration is commonly used as a measure of cannabis potency. Cannabis can be used by smoking, vaping, dabbing, ingesting (edibles, beverages, and tinctures), and topical cream. The potency of cannabis has increased significantly around the world over the past two decades [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ], which may have contributed to increased rates of cannabis-related adverse effects.
        </p>
        <p>
         The legal status of cannabis use, for medical as well as recreational purposes, varies internationally as well as across the United States. Cannabis use disorder develops in approximately 10 percent of regular cannabis users and up to 50 percent of chronic daily users and may be associated with cognitive impairment, poor school or work performance, and psychiatric comorbidity such as mood disorders and psychosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of cannabis use disorder are reviewed here. Other aspects of cannabis use, including epidemiology, risk factors, acute intoxication, and presentation and treatment of cannabis withdrawal, are reviewed separately:

         Cannabis use disorder presents as a problematic pattern of cannabis use that results in clinically significant functional impairment or distress, with at least two manifestations occurring within a period of 12 months [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The defining feature of cannabis use disorder is loss of control over cannabis use, epitomized by persisting use despite knowledge of adverse consequences. The severity of cannabis use disorder is specified as mild, moderate, or severe by the number of symptoms present. (See
         <a class="local">

         The clinical manifestations of acute intoxication are delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-concentration dependent and include physiologic signs such as tachycardia, blood pressure changes, conjunctival injection (“red eye”), dry mouth, slowed or slurred speech, and ataxia [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Common psychological manifestations include euphoria (“high”) and relaxation. Sedation and increased appetite (“munchies”) are also common. Cannabis use acutely impairs neuropsychological functions, especially attention, concentration, episodic memory, and associative learning [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. Additional undesired effects include depression, anxiety (eg, panic attacks), perceptual disturbances, and changes in thought content (including transient paranoia or frank psychosis).
        </p>
        <p>
         Common emergency department presentations associated with acute cannabis use include psychiatric (acute anxiety, agitation, or psychosis), cardiovascular (chest pain, palpitations), or nausea and vomiting (often due to cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome) [
         <a href="#rid7">

         While patterns of cannabis use vary widely across individuals, most cannabis users who develop cannabis use disorder do so after several years of use [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9

          16

         Prospective, longitudinal studies in nonclinical, community populations suggest that cannabis use and cannabis use disorder have highly variable courses [

          22-26
         </a>
         ]. As an example, a prospective, longitudinal study that followed 817 randomly selected western Oregon high school students from age 14 to 30 years old found them grouped in three trajectories of development of cannabis use disorder: stable cannabis use with negligible risk of developing cannabis use disorder (84 percent of cohort), increasing risk peaking around age 20 years (60 percent risk) then declining to negligible risk by age 30 years (9 percent of cohort), and steadily increasing risk through age 30 years (90 percent risk; 7 percent of cohort) [

         The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening all adults for harmful use of psychoactive drugs, including cannabis, as long as “services for accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate care can be offered or referred” [
         <a href="#rid33">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Screening for cannabis use disorder is often prompted by signs or symptoms from the patient’s history or physical examination [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,26
         </a>
         ]. As examples, impairment in social, academic, or vocational functioning that is otherwise unexplained, exacerbation of conditions known to be worsened by cannabis (ie, depression, anxiety), chronic conjunctival injection, yellowing of fingertips, cannabis odor on clothing, or increase in appetite may be noted. Screening should occur at yearly preventive visits.

         Screening should employ brief questions, rather than testing of biological specimens such as urine.

        <p>
         Brief (one to four items) questionnaires are an economical and efficient means of cannabis screening, either stand-alone or embedded within larger health questionnaires. These methods are typically used in high-volume clinical settings such as primary care practices or emergency departments. Several studies suggest that self-reports of cannabis and other psychoactive substance use can be fairly accurate, as long as there are no adverse consequences (such as criminal charges) for acknowledging use [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. In one review involving 1997 study participants, screening with brief instruments in adults, with structured clinical interviews as the gold standard, had sensitivity of 0.79 to 0.82 and specificity of 0.95 for identifying unhealthy cannabis use and sensitivity of 0.71 to 0.83 and specificity of 0.75 to 0.95 for identifying cannabis use disorder [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. Unhealthy cannabis use was variously defined as either having cannabis-related problems (not necessarily cannabis use disorder) or heavy cannabis use.
        </p>
        <p>
         Based on simplicity of use and favorable test performance characteristics, we favor the use of the single question: “In the past year, how often have you used cannabis (or marijuana)?”
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In a study of 442 adolescents admitted to an emergency department with nonsubstance-related injuries, an answer of “more than once” to this question had a sensitivity of 0.96 (positive predictive value 0.55) and specificity of 0.86 (negative predictive value 0.99) for detecting cannabis use disorder as defined in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV; based on a structured diagnostic interview) [

         Because drug testing is more intrusive and expensive, it is typically reserved for screening in safety-sensitive workplaces or for high-risk populations.

         Drug testing for recent cannabis use has the advantage of objectivity and, when properly administered (eg, observed sample collection), essentially 100 percent sensitivity [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38,39
         </a>
         ]. Because of the complex pharmacokinetics of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other cannabinoids, an individual who last used cannabis weeks ago and is functioning normally may still test positive for cannabis use. This is especially true in persons who use cannabis chronically. THC or its metabolites may be detectable in urine of chronic heavy users of cannabis for up to six weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Urine is most commonly used for testing, but oral fluid (saliva), blood, and hair are alternatives. Although screening tests (typically employing immunoassays) are highly sensitive, they are less specific. A positive screening result should be confirmed by a more specific assay (eg, liquid or gas chromatography, sometimes combined with mass spectrometry) when a positive result has legal or employment implications or major treatment implications such as a change in treatment status (eg, transfer to a different level of treatment or discharge).
        </p>
        <p>
         Drug testing for cannabis almost always measures THC, the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis, and/or its major metabolite carboxy-THC [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. Other clinically relevant pharmacologically active cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol, are detected with less sensitivity or not at all.
        </p>
        <p>
         Drug tests identify cannabis use, not cannabis use disorder. Cannabinoid levels, especially in urine, are poorly correlated with impairment [

         A positive screen should be followed by evaluation of risk level, then brief intervention for individuals considered at low risk or referral for treatment for those at higher risk (moderate-severe cannabis use disorder) or who do not respond to brief intervention. This is the Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment approach widely used in the addiction field [

         We recommend thorough assessment for all patients screening positive for cannabis use. This is often done by a clinician trained to diagnose and treat substance use disorders. The assessment should be conducted in a private setting and in nonjudgmental fashion. In order to establish a level of comfort for the patient, it is often helpful to first ask about socially acceptable substances and then progress to other substances.

         A cannabis use disorder is diagnosed if the patient’s use, signs, symptoms, and functional impairment meet the thresholds established by the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for the disorder. Cannabis intoxication and cannabis withdrawal are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         Key features suggesting the diagnosis of cannabis use disorder include patient denial of cannabis-related problems in the face of reports from reliable collateral sources (eg, family, school, employer) and patient denial of cannabis use in the face of objective evidence to the contrary (eg, urine drug testing).

         Other mental disorders may resemble symptoms associated with cannabis use disorder. As examples, cannabis-related anxiety may resemble panic attacks, and chronic neglect of usual activities may resemble dysthymia or other mood disorders. Careful attention to history, in particular, the temporal relationship between cannabis use and symptoms and behavioral changes, is useful in differentiating these. For example, the onset of symptoms only after a period of heavy cannabis use and their resolution during a period of cannabis abstinence provides strong circumstantial evidence that they do not represent an independent psychiatric condition.

         The treatment goal for cannabis use disorder can be either sustained abstinence from cannabis use or reduced use that ameliorates cannabis-associated problems (so-called “harm reduction”) [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43,44
         </a>
         ]. Reducing frequency of use is associated with greater improvement than reducing quantity of use [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44,45
         </a>
         ]. Young adults and individuals with the DSM-5 mild cannabis use disorder tend to have harm reduction as their goal.
        </p>
        <p>
         Regardless of the initial treatment goal, early sessions should focus on engaging the patient in treatment using motivational enhancement (or interviewing) techniques (see
         <a class="local">
          'Motivational enhancement therapy'
         </a>
         below). The patient is encouraged to explicitly identify the pros and cons of their cannabis use and balance them. Often a series of stepwise intermediate goals may be needed in order to engage the patient in the treatment process. As an example, an initial goal might be mild reduction of frequency or amount of cannabis use or limiting cannabis use to low-risk situations. Other goals for treatment include improved psychological, social, and occupational functioning.
        </p>
        <p>
         Approximately half of patients in treatment for cannabis use disorder experience a withdrawal syndrome on abrupt reduction or cessation of heavy or prolonged cannabis use [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. These uncomfortable symptoms serve as a negative reinforcement for resumption of cannabis use in a large proportion of individuals [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. Patients should be educated about the cannabis withdrawal syndrome at the start of treatment and monitored for symptoms. A variety of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches can be used to reduce withdrawal symptoms and minimize the risk of relapse. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/114326.html" rel="external">

         Treatment for cannabis use disorder usually occurs in the outpatient setting.

         Cannabis users with cannabis-related problems who are identified by screening (ie, who do not present themselves for treatment) may respond to brief intervention, especially when they are an adolescent or young adult and are identified outside of health care settings; however, the evidence of efficacy is limited.
        </p>
        <p>
         Brief intervention typically consists of no more than two short (no more than 15 to 20 minutes) sessions of patient-centered, nonjudgmental counseling using motivational enhancement techniques. (See

         Studies have shown mixed and somewhat limited benefits. A meta-analysis of 26 published studies involved 6318 emerging adults (15 to 30 years old) enrolled primarily from non-health care settings (73 percent of studies non-health care) [

Brief intervention, compared with passive controls, increased the odds of cannabis abstinence one to three months later (odds ratio 1.73, 95% CI 1.13-2.66) and reduced symptoms of cannabis use disorder, but did not impact other outcomes. Another meta-analysis included six studies from health care settings involving more than 2000 primarily adult participants [

         For patients who desire treatment for cannabis use disorder, we suggest psychosocial treatment rather than medication treatment as initial therapy for cannabis use disorder.

In a meta-analysis of seven published controlled clinical trials involving 1724 treatment-seeking adults with cannabis use disorder, patients receiving psychosocial treatment were twice as likely as those receiving no treatment to be abstinent at three- to four-month follow-up (21 percent versus 10 percent; relative risk 2.08, 95% CI 1.51-3.07) [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35

         We suggest cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; where available) as first-line treatment of cannabis use disorder. As compared with other therapies, CBT has the most robust evidence of efficacy for this disorder [

        </p>
        <p>
         CBT is a psychotherapy approach that emphasizes identification and management of thoughts, behaviors, and external triggers that promote substance use. Coping skills and problem-solving skills that promote replacement of cannabis-related behaviors with healthier alternatives are taught. (See

         Motivational enhancement therapy (MET) is another psychosocial treatment that is appropriate for initial therapy. Studies suggest efficacy for cannabis use disorder that is similar to CBT [

         Motivational interviewing is a directive, nonjudgmental, patient-centered psychotherapy that focuses on encouraging patients to change maladaptive behaviors. When combined with personalized feedback and education regarding the patient’s patterns of cannabis use, it is often termed motivational enhancement therapy. MET emphasizes the importance of self-efficacy and positive change and attempts to build motivation for treatment and abstinence in an empathic and nonjudgmental environment. Motivational interviewing for substance use disorders is reviewed in greater detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16752.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         A meta-analysis including four trials with a total of 612 participants with the DSM-IV cannabis dependence (equivalent to moderate to severe cannabis use disorder in the DSM-5) found that MET reduced days of cannabis use at early follow-up as compared with inactive or delayed treatment (mean difference 4.45 days, 95% CI 1.90-7.00) [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50

         ]. However, no difference was seen in one-month abstinence rates. Individual trials have had more favorable results. As an example, a trial of 291 treatment-seeking adult cannabis users were assigned to 14 sessions of CBT versus two sessions of motivational interviewing versus delayed treatment [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53

         We suggest monitoring patients at least weekly at the start of treatment. The frequency and type of monitoring may vary with the goals and the stability of the patient’s condition. Assessment of progress in achieving a treatment goal of abstinence is often done with drug testing to objectively evaluate cannabis use status. Monitoring should involve the patient’s family and close social network as much as possible, always with the patient’s permission. Such collateral monitoring often provides the earliest indications of potential relapse. A patient who has maintained their treatment goals for several months may need monitoring only monthly or less often.

A meta-analysis of three clinical trials with 398 participants found that the combination of MET and CBT reduced patients’ mean days per month of cannabis use at early follow-up compared with delayed treatment (mean difference 7.38, 95% CI 3.18-11.57) [

        </p>
        <p>
         In another trial involving 450 adults with cannabis use disorder, treatment with two sessions of combined CBT and MET over six weeks was compared with nine sessions of the combination therapy over 12 weeks and also to a delayed treatment control [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55

         Contingency management has not been shown to be effective for cannabis use disorder as a stand-alone treatment [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50

        </p>
        <p>
         Contingency management uses behavioral reinforcement techniques (typically a voucher incentive) to encourage specific behaviors that promote treatment adherence or abstinence.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinical trials have found that the addition of contingency management to other psychosocial treatments (eg, CBT, MET) reduces cannabis use as compared with nonaugmented intervention alone [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50,56-60
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in a trial of 240 participants with cannabis dependence treated with combination of contingency management with combined CBT/MET, the combined treatment had a higher percentage of 90-day abstinence rates at 14 months (28 percent) than MET/CBT alone (20 percent), case management (19 percent), or contingency management alone (13 percent) [
         <a href="#rid60">

        </p>
        <p>
         Clinical trials comparing contingency management with other active interventions for cannabis dependence have reported mixed results with some reports suggesting benefit and others no apparent benefit [

         There is little evidence to support the use of drug or addiction counseling in cannabis use disorder. Nonetheless, their efficacy in other clinical situations supports their use when other structured treatments are unavailable.

         Drug or addiction counseling refers to general individual and group psychotherapies whose goal is to help patients reduce substance use. Counseling typically provides fact-based education regarding drug use and health risks along with suggestions for minimizing harm. Counseling may also incorporate various elements of more focused therapy approaches, such as cognitive-behavioral, motivational enhancement, and insight-oriented psychotherapies [

         Mutual help groups (eg, Marijuana Anonymous) consist of individuals with a common experience or problem coming together to share their experiences and provide help and support to one another without professional direction. The goal of mutual help groups for addiction recovery is to help individuals with substance use disorders to achieve and maintain remission and recovery. Mutual help groups are reported to be used by approximately half of adults with current cannabis use disorder [

Additionally, while both groups showed decreases in percentage of days with cannabis use, individuals in the varenicline group showed a greater decrease than individuals in the placebo group (42 [95% CI 26.3-57.0] versus 27 [95% CI 13-42] percent). Urine cannabinoid test results were consistent with self-reported cannabis use in both groups.

          Cannabis use and disorder
         </strong>
         – Cannabis is the third most commonly used psychoactive substance worldwide, after alcohol and tobacco (nicotine). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Cannabis use disorder presents as a problematic pattern of cannabis use that results in at least two manifestations of clinically significant functional impairment or distress occurring within a period of 12 months. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations'

         <strong>
          Acute intoxication
         </strong>
         – Acute intoxication from cannabis causes physiologic signs such as tachycardia, psychological symptoms such as euphoria or anxiety, and neurocognitive impairments. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Acute intoxication'

         <strong>
          Chronic cannabis use
         </strong>
         – Chronic cannabis use is associated with persistent mood changes and psychosocial impairment. Chronic use, particularly during adolescence, is associated with increased risk of psychosis and the development of schizophrenia. Association with long term neurocognitive impairments is unclear. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Screening
         </strong>
         – Screening for cannabis use disorder may be prompted by otherwise unexplained impairment in social, academic, or vocational functioning, exacerbation of conditions known to be worsened by cannabis (ie, depression, anxiety), chronic conjunctival injection, yellowing of fingertips, cannabis odor on clothing, or increase in appetite. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Indicators for screening'

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Brief patient questionnaires are effective means of screening for cannabis use, supplemented by drug testing in appropriate contexts. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Assessment
         </strong>
         – We perform assessment of risk level in all individuals who screen positive for cannabis use. We review patterns of use, attempts to cut back use, symptoms of tolerance or withdrawal, and effects on social, occupational or academic functioning. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Assessment'

          Treatment goals
         </strong>
         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         We develop the goal of treatment for cannabis use disorder in collaboration with the patient. Examples of treatment goals may be sustained abstinence from cannabis use or sustained reduction in use to avoid harmful consequences. The goal of moderation in use may be needed to engage some patients in the treatment process. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Setting treatment goals and initiating treatment'

          Medication
         </strong>
