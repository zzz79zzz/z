The clinical history is <strong>critical</strong> in the diagnosis of food allergy since it is used to determine subsequent testing and interpretation of results. The history and physical examination and the various manifestations of food allergy are reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2397.html" rel="external">"History and physical examination in the patient with possible food allergy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2398.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ROLE OF ALLERGY TESTS IN DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Allergy testing, in the form of skin testing or in vitro tests, must always be selected and interpreted in the context of the patient's specific clinical history because a "positive" test (ie, sensitization, or formation of IgE to a specific substance) does not always indicate clinical allergy [<a href="#rid3">3,7,8</a>]. The details of the history are used to generate an estimate of the patient's <strong>pretest probability</strong> of having allergic disease. The pretest probability is essential for effective use of available testing modalities. Testing is not required for diagnosis in a patient with a clear IgE-mediated reaction such as anaphylaxis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58836" href="/d/graphic/58836.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82831" href="/d/graphic/82831.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) to a single food, but a baseline value is helpful for monitoring over time. Testing should be avoided in most patients without a history consistent with an IgE-mediated reaction, unless it is felt that a negative test will encourage reintroduction of the food into the diet  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131574" href="/d/graphic/131574.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). It is important to note that if a patient is tolerating a food without immediate symptoms, the food should <strong>not</strong> be eliminated from the diet solely because of a "positive" IgE test. Determining whether a reaction is consistent with an IgE-mediated allergy is reviewed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2398.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2397.html" rel="external">"History and physical examination in the patient with possible food allergy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5745.html" rel="external">"Food allergy in children: Prevalence, natural history, and monitoring for resolution"</a>.)</p><p>The sensitivity and specificity of tests for individual foods (and other allergens) have been defined in children for several of the most common foods. However, these values have not been determined or validated for the majority of foods or in adults. These values are reviewed in the topics on specific food allergies.</p><p>The way in which the pretest probability impacts the interpretation of allergy tests is illustrated by the following clinical vignettes [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Consider three different two-year-old children presenting for evaluation of hen's egg allergy:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient 1 has experienced two severe allergic reactions following the isolated ingestion of scrambled egg, requiring and responding to treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> on both occasions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2401.html" rel="external">"Food-induced anaphylaxis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient 2 has severe atopic dermatitis and eats egg regularly. He has never experienced an apparent acute reaction to egg. However, his mother is aware that food allergy can exacerbate this condition and has therefore requested an allergy evaluation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5545.html" rel="external">"Role of allergy in atopic dermatitis (eczema)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient 3 has no history of allergic problems, but her parents think she misbehaves more after eating egg.</p><p></p><p>The pediatrician evaluating these children performs in vitro testing to hen's egg in all three children. In each child, a moderately positive (egg white IgE: 3 kU<sub>A</sub>/L; ImmunoCAP) result is obtained. However, the interpretation of the result would be different in each case.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient 1 has a very high pretest probability of hen's egg allergy, so a moderately positive test is sufficient to validate the clinical suspicion (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2759.html" rel="external">"Glossary of common biostatistical and epidemiological terms", section on 'Measures of diagnostic test performance'</a>). Further testing and referral to an allergy specialist is not necessary but is an option if assistance with management is desired. If the in vitro test had been negative, the pediatrician would be correct to question the result and refer the child to an allergy specialist for further evaluation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient 2 has a moderate pretest probability since up to 40 percent of children with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis have underlying food allergy, and hen's egg is a common cause of childhood food allergy [<a href="#rid10">10-12</a>]. In this patient, the positive result is suggestive of true allergy, although further evaluation is needed to demonstrate that hen's egg allergy is contributing to skin inflammation prior to removal of egg from the diet. This evaluation may require a period of dietary elimination and readministration, perhaps as a medically supervised oral food challenge. For a child with a history of atopic dermatitis who had been ingesting egg in the diet without acute symptoms and, based on a positive test, had it removed, it is important to promptly assess the possibility of reintroducing it back into the diet. Prolonged dietary exclusion in this circumstance could result in acute or anaphylactic reactions upon reintroduction [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5545.html" rel="external">"Role of allergy in atopic dermatitis (eczema)", section on 'Food elimination diets'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient 3 has an extremely low pretest probability, and the test result is not sufficiently positive to impact the clinician's initial impression. Egg should not be removed from the child's diet. This case also illustrates one of the disadvantages of performing testing in patients whose histories are not consistent with allergic disease, as irrelevant results may confuse the situation.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H943506115"><span class="h1">REFERRAL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In vitro testing by a generalist is appropriate when the pretest probability of food allergy is moderate to high. Patients with positive results may be referred to an allergy specialist for further education of the patient/caregivers, particularly if the patient has multiple food allergies, and ongoing monitoring for resolution in pediatric patients. Referral for educational purposes may also be useful when the clinician feels that the pretest probability is low but the patient/caregiver(s) suspect food allergy and are avoiding the particular food(s). Finally, referral is indicated for additional testing and management in the patient with moderate-to-high pretest probability of food allergy and negative in vitro testing. (See <a class="local">'Role of allergy tests in diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3458747653"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO TESTING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An overview of the approach to testing in the patient with a history that is consistent with or suggestive of an IgE-mediated food allergy is reviewed in the algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131575" href="/d/graphic/131575.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). Testing is generally avoided in patients who lack a history suggestive of IgE-mediated allergy, unless it is felt that a negative test will encourage reintroduction of food into the diet, since a "positive" test in these patients is nearly always a false positive.</p><p>Determining whether the history is consistent with an IgE-mediated reaction is based upon several factors including the signs and symptoms of the reaction, the timing in relation to food ingestion, and the suspected food. IgE-mediated food allergy presents with some combination of skin, gastrointestinal, upper and lower respiratory tract, and cardiovascular signs and symptoms  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79448" href="/d/graphic/79448.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). A patient may present with only one or two of these symptoms (eg, urticaria) or virtually all of them (eg, anaphylaxis). IgE-mediated reactions typically occur rapidly after ingestion of the culprit food (ie, within seconds to minutes), but reactions up to two hours and beyond can also occur. IgE-mediated food allergy occurs most often in association with certain foods, although any food has the potential to cause allergy. The history and physical examination and the various manifestations of food allergy are reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2397.html" rel="external">"History and physical examination in the patient with possible food allergy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2398.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview"</a>.)</p><p>The choice of testing depends upon a several factors including availability of testing, patient/caregiver and clinician preferences, and technical limitations and accuracy of the tests [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Options include skin prick testing (SPT) with food extracts or fresh foods, immunoassays to whole foods, and component immunoassays to specific food proteins. The specific tests are reviewed below. (See <a class="local">'Skin testing'</a> below and <a class="local">'In vitro testing'</a> below.)</p><p>Interpretation depends upon both the actual test results and the pretest probability of food allergy, as is described in the scenarios above (see <a class="local">'Role of allergy tests in diagnosis'</a> above). Both an SPT wheal &lt;3 mm and a food-specific IgE (sIgE) &lt;0.35 kU<sub>A</sub>/L have a high sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) but poor specificity and positive predictive value (PPV). Specificity can be improved by using higher cutoffs, which vary depending upon the specific food. Suggested cutoffs are discussed in the topics on specific foods. Test results between these two ranges are more ambiguous. Oral food challenges can help determine if a food allergy is present when test results are not definitive. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2399.html" rel="external">"Oral food challenges for diagnosis and management of food allergies"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">SKIN TESTING</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4224608725"><span class="h2">Overview</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prick/puncture (or epicutaneous) method of skin testing is commonly used in the evaluation of a suspected IgE-mediated food allergy. The test is still valid even if the patient is not eating the food. Allergy skin testing should only be performed by allergy specialists familiar with these tests and in settings equipped with the necessary medications, equipment, and staff to treat anaphylaxis. <strong>Intradermal </strong>skin testing should <strong>not</strong> be performed in the evaluation of food allergy, because it does not add to the diagnostic capability of the epicutaneous skin test and significantly increases the risk of triggering a systemic reaction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5541.html" rel="external">"Overview of skin testing for IgE-mediated allergic disease", section on 'Safety'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Prick/puncture skin tests</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Skin prick testing (SPT) is best used to investigate the possibility of an IgE-mediated reaction to a specific food in a patient with a suggestive clinical history (ie, a high pretest probability) of allergy. It is also highly effective for excluding IgE-mediated allergy, particularly in a patient with a low pretest probability, because of its high sensitivity. Because of the low specificity of SPT, it should <strong>not</strong> be used to screen patients for allergy by testing with broad panels of food allergens without regard for clinical history, since this is likely to yield false-positive (clinically irrelevant) results.</p><p>Prick/puncture skin tests are highly reproducible and less costly to perform than in vitro testing. SPT causes minimal patient discomfort and yields results within 15 minutes. This type of testing can be safely performed in patients of any age. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5541.html" rel="external">"Overview of skin testing for IgE-mediated allergic disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Precautions and preparations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Allergy skin testing is considered a safe procedure [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. However, it occasionally causes systemic reactions in very sensitive patients. Thus, it is recommended that this type of testing be performed by allergy specialists trained in the treatment of anaphylaxis and in a setting where full emergency equipment and medications are available. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5541.html" rel="external">"Overview of skin testing for IgE-mediated allergic disease", section on 'Safety'</a>.)</p><p>The following factors should be considered in the decision to perform skin testing:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>SPT should be performed with caution in patients who, by history, are at high risk for a systemic reaction, such as patients with moderate or severe asthma who have experienced anaphylaxis previously. The decision to skin test such a patient should be made on an individual basis. SPT should be delayed or in vitro testing performed instead if such a patient has active allergy or asthma symptoms, particularly if their asthma is poorly controlled. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5541.html" rel="external">"Overview of skin testing for IgE-mediated allergic disease", section on 'High risk for anaphylaxis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Certain medications, such as antihistamines, can interfere with SPT and must be stopped beforehand. Preparations for SPT are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5541.html" rel="external">"Overview of skin testing for IgE-mediated allergic disease", section on 'Medications that should be discontinued'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Generalized skin conditions, including dermographism and urticaria, uncommonly may preclude accurate SPT. In rare cases, atopic dermatitis is severe and widespread enough that there is not a clear area of skin sufficient for SPT. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5541.html" rel="external">"Overview of skin testing for IgE-mediated allergic disease", section on 'Skin conditions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>SPT is not usually performed for several weeks after an episode of anaphylaxis, because it has been observed that anaphylaxis can render the skin temporarily nonreactive. The reasons for this refractory period have not been studied, although extensive depletion of surface IgE and/or granule contents within cutaneous mast cells are possible explanations. Full restoration of skin reactivity can take two to four weeks. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5541.html" rel="external">"Overview of skin testing for IgE-mediated allergic disease", section on 'Recent anaphylaxis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1751001718"><span class="h3">Testing in infants</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The skin of infants may be less reactive, yielding more false-negative results, although this difference has not been formally studied. Nevertheless, positive results are commonly obtained in infants with a history consistent with food allergy. Unfortunately, very young children may also have more systemic reactions to SPT [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Thus, SPT can be performed even in infants and young children when indicated and with appropriate precautions.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Technique</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>To perform prick/puncture skin testing, a source of food allergen is applied to a testing device or directly to the skin. One of several commercially available devices (plastic probes, metal lancets, bifurcated needles) is used to prick through the allergen into the top layer of the skin. The patient is also tested with appropriate positive (histamine) and negative (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a>) controls.</p><p>The food is pricked into the skin to introduce the allergen to cutaneous mast cells. If food-specific IgE (sIgE) antibody is present on the surface of the patient's mast cells, then the cells degranulate, releasing histamine and other mediators that cause localized cutaneous swelling (ie, a wheal). Vasodilation (ie, a flare) also develops as a result of an axonal reflex. General issues regarding the technique of SPT (for foods as well as other allergens) are reviewed elsewhere.

However, this figure incorporates important variables, including the quality of the extract used and the degree of positivity.</p><p>The quality of commercially available skin testing food reagents is generally good, but there is some variability. Extracts of milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, fish, and shellfish are usually reliable. In contrast, commercial extracts of fruits and vegetables are sometimes inadequate because the responsible allergen may be labile and altered during processing, making false-negative tests more likely.</p><p>Prick-by-prick testing with fresh foods, although less convenient, has a higher correlation to clinical reactivity than testing with commercial extracts for some foods, particularly fruits and vegetables. In a study of children with food allergies, for example, concordance between skin testing and challenge was 59 percent for commercial extracts and 92 percent for fresh food [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>The larger the wheal, the greater the likelihood of clinical allergy [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Importantly, the size of the skin test does <strong>not</strong> correlate with the severity of a clinical allergic reaction. Large positive SPTs in children tested to cow's milk, egg, and peanut were shown in one study to have excellent specificity and PPVs for subsequent positive food challenge [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. In this study, which tested 467 children with a median age of three years using commercial extracts, a peanut SPT &gt;8 mm was "100 percent" diagnostic for a positive food challenge to peanut (the corresponding reaction for children less than two years of age was &gt;4 mm). These findings were confirmed in a subsequent study of children up to 16 years old with peanut sensitivity in which a different manufacturer's extracts were used, suggesting the findings may be generalizable to children suspected of having peanut allergy [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Similar cutoff values have not yet been validated for the other common food allergens or in adults. In addition, these results may not be generalizable to all populations. Additional studies are needed.</p><p>In contrast, the sensitivity and negative predictive accuracy for SPT to foods, other than some fruits and vegetables, is uniformly high.

However, there are no standardized reagents, application methods, or guidelines for interpretation, and this type of testing cannot be recommended outside of research settings.

Although higher concentrations of sIgE correlate to an increased likelihood of a reaction upon ingestion [<a href="#rid28">28-30</a>], an individual patient with a significant food allergy can have a high, medium, low, or even negative in vitro test using these systems [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Importantly, as with skin testing, the sIgE level does <strong>not</strong> correlate well with the severity of a reaction. It is also true that a patient can have a positive sIgE for a food to which they are tolerant. Thus, the patient's clinical history is critical to both determining the tests to perform and confirming the diagnosis. The results of immunoassays are also reported using percentage, class, or numerical ranks that compare the amount of IgE present in the patient's serum to a standard curve, although these values are generally not helpful due to the great variability in thresholds used to improve sensitivity that vary depending upon the food, age of the patient, and history.</p><p>Several large studies have used the ImmunoCAP fluorescent enzyme immunoassay system, and so normative results from studies on selected patient groups are available for this specific product. It is important to understand that values obtained with other testing systems are not necessarily interchangeable [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Very high sensitivity and positive predictive accuracy <strong>in children</strong> can be achieved using the ImmunoCAP system. In a retrospective study of nearly 200 pediatric patients with food allergy, minimum levels of IgE to specific foods were identified that were associated with a 95 percent positive predictive value (PPV) for clinical food hypersensitivity [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Approximately 90 percent of these children had atopic dermatitis.</p><p>The validity of these values in a less selected population was then prospectively evaluated in a study in which the sera of 100 children and adolescents (mean age of 3.8 years, range 0.4 to 14 years) with possible food allergy was assessed for reactivity to hen's egg, cow's milk, peanuts, and fish [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. The concentrations of specific IgE antibodies were compared with the clinical history and the results obtained by skin testing and/or double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). Based upon the same minimum values obtained in the previous study, PPVs of 96, 100, 100, and 100 percent were obtained for clinical allergies to hen's egg, cow's milk, peanut, and fish, respectively.</p><p>Subsequent studies have generated somewhat different predictive values, most likely due to variations in the patient populations and/or testing protocols [<a href="#rid30">30,33,34</a>]. In addition, the predictive values vary with age, such that younger children and infants display symptoms at lower serum levels of sIgE compared with older children [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p>Based primarily upon studies performed in the United States in children with a history of food allergy and eczema older than two years of age, the 95 percent positive predictive levels for hen's egg, cow's milk, peanut, tree nuts, and fish are as follow [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hen's egg, 7 kU<sub>A</sub>/L (2 kU<sub>A</sub>/L for children less than two years of age)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cow's milk, 15 kU<sub>A</sub>/L (5 kU<sub>A</sub>/L for children less than two years of age)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Peanut, 14 kU<sub>A</sub>/L</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tree nuts, approximately 15 kU<sub>A</sub>/L</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fish, 20 kU<sub>A</sub>/L</p><p></p><p>Thus, <strong>children</strong> over two years old with a convincing history of hen's egg allergy have a greater than 95 percent likelihood of experiencing an allergic reaction to egg upon challenge if their egg-specific IgE <strong>exceeds</strong> 7 kU<sub>A</sub>/L. Therefore, challenge is unnecessary in such children. Equivalent predictive positive levels for soy and wheat have <strong>not</strong> yet been established. To reiterate, these data were developed in children, and there are no recommendations regarding their interpretation in adults with food allergy.</p><p>Some children with hen's egg allergy may tolerate egg in baked goods but react on ingestion of lightly cooked egg.

The potency of individual proteins in a food may relate to their lability. Proteins that are destroyed easily by heating or digestion are less likely to cause significant allergic reactions compared with heat or digestion-stable proteins. Ara h 2, for example, is a peanut seed storage protein that is stable. IgE responses to this protein are associated with allergic reactions compared with IgE responses to the peanut protein Ara h 8, which is a labile protein homologous to a protein in birch tree pollen. An individual with a strong immune response to Ara h 2 and no response to Ara h 8 will probably have peanut allergy compared with a person with no response to Ara h 2 and a modest response to Ara h 8, even though a positive test to whole peanut extract would be positive in both, possibly with the same result [<a href="#rid35">35,36</a>].

This essential component of food allergy diagnosis is discussed separately.

SPT is more sensitive than in vitro testing in some cases. It should be performed by an allergy specialist because of both the risk of anaphylaxis and the skill required for proper interpretation. SPT is contraindicated or unreliable in certain subsets of patients, such as those with unstable asthma and a history of anaphylaxis or those with dermographism. Intradermal skin testing should <strong>not</strong> be performed in the evaluation of food allergy, since it does not add diagnostic value and carries a greater risk of inducing a systemic reaction than does SPT.

Further tests or challenges may be needed to confirm that the patient is truly reactive to the food upon ingestion, depending upon the patient's pretest probability of having allergy. By contrast and importantly, a negative skin test result has a high sensitivity and indicates the absence of an IgE-mediated allergy upon subsequent challenge with a 90 to 95 percent predictive accuracy.
