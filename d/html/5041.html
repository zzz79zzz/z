         Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) can be lifesaving in patients with severe anemia. However, RBC transfusion has risks, including volume overload, transmission of infectious agents, transfusion reactions, and various immunologic consequences.

         The rationale and indications for RBC transfusion in neonates, as well as selection of RBC products and their administration will be reviewed here. Other aspects of transfusion in neonates, infants, and children are discussed in separate topic reviews:

         </span>
         The principal rationale for RBC transfusion in neonates is to prevent or reverse tissue hypoxia due to reduced oxygen availability. Symptoms of anemia (eg, increased heart rate, apnea, need for increased respiratory support, poor weight gain, acidosis) occur when the RBC mass is not adequate to meet the oxygen demands of tissues. An RBC transfusion provides an immediate increase in oxygen delivery to tissues and is an effective and rapid intervention to treat severe symptomatic anemia. Optimal transfusion practice aims to avoid unnecessary transfusions while ensuring that a transfusion isn't withheld from neonates who would truly benefit from it. However, based on the available data, it is not possible to precisely define a minimum hemoglobin (Hgb) or hematocrit (Hct) level required for sufficient oxygen delivery in neonates. Nevertheless, clinical trials have demonstrated that using more a restrictive threshold for transfusion does not increase morbidity and mortality compared with using a more liberal threshold [

         </a>

         For most neonates, we recommend a restrictive transfusion strategy (ie, giving fewer transfusions and transfusing at a lower Hgb level) over a liberal transfusion strategy (ie, giving more transfusions, transfusing at a higher Hgb level). Our approach is based on Hgb/Hct levels and the clinical status of the infant (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef140490" href="/z/d/graphic/140490.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Transfusion thresholds'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         This practice is supported by multicenter clinical trials involving preterm infants in which restrictive transfusion thresholds reduced transfusions without increasing mortality or serious morbidity [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-5
         </a>
         ]. The two largest trials were the TOP trial (Transfusion of Prematures) and the ETTNO trial (Effects of liberal versus restrictive Transfusion Thresholds on survival and Neurocognitive Outcomes) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. In both trials, neurodevelopmental outcomes were similar between restrictive and liberal transfusion groups. Further details of these trials are provided separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4962.html" rel="external">
          "Anemia of prematurity (AOP)", section on 'Transfusion'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Additional support comes from trials in older infants and children, which also reported similar outcomes between restrictive and liberal transfusion groups. These data are discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5910.html" rel="external">

         The overall prevalence of transfusion across all neonates is approximately 0.4 to 0.5 percent (4 to 5 per 1000 live births) [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,20
         </a>
         ]. Among neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), approximately 15 to 20 percent receive at least one transfusion [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21,22
         </a>
         ]. The prevalence varies by gestational age (GA), with the highest prevalence among extremely preterm (EPT) and extremely low birth weight (ELBW) neonates. For preterm neonates ≤32 weeks GA, the prevalence is approximately 20 percent. For EPT and ELBW neonates, the prevalence is approximately 60 to 75 percent [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,21,22
         </a>
         ]. The prevalence is lower among ELBW infants treated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents, as discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4962.html" rel="external">
          "Anemia of prematurity (AOP)", section on 'Erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs)'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The prevalence of transfusion in preterm neonates has decreased over time due to the shift towards more restrictive transfusion practices. In a multicenter retrospective study conducted over nine years, rates of RBC transfusion among preterm neonates ≤30 weeks GA declined from 62 percent in the study's earlier era (2004 to 2006) to 53 percent in the later era (2010 to 2012) [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22

         ]. The decline was most notable among neonates born at 26 to 29 weeks GA.

         For most neonates, we recommend using a restrictive transfusion strategy (ie, transfusing at a lower hemoglobin (Hgb) level) rather than a liberal strategy (transfusing at a higher Hgb level). However, clinicians should not use the Hgb/hematocrit (Hct) alone as the sole basis for decision-making. Other factors to consider include the neonate's postnatal age, cardiopulmonary status, degree of symptoms, acuity of anemia, whether there is ongoing blood loss, and whether the infant has other underlying conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
         At our institution, the thresholds we use to trigger transfusion are based chiefly upon the Hgb/Hct level, gestational age (GA), postnatal age, and clinical status (

         ). These thresholds are appropriate for most term and preterm neonates cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). However, they do

          not
         </strong>
         apply to neonates with cyanotic congenital heart disease, severe alloimmune hemolytic disease (ie, requiring exchange transfusion), acute severe or ongoing blood loss, severe persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), or those requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [

         Alloimmune hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) is a condition in which the red blood cells of the fetus or newborn are destroyed by maternally derived alloantibodies. These antibodies arise in the mother as a direct result of a blood group incompatibility, generally from previous transfusions or pregnancies. Some neonates with HDN may require exchange transfusion to manage severe hyperbilirubinemia. Management of HDN is discussed in detail separately. (See

         All neonates who require transfusion should receive "cytomegalovirus (CMV)-safe" (also called "CMV-reduced risk") blood products. This refers to RBC units that are leukoreduced and/or CMV-seronegative. Leukoreduction removes nearly all white blood cells (WBCs) from blood products at the time of collection by highly efficient filters [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. Both leukoreduction and CMV-negative products are effective in reducing the risk of CMV transmission; combining both strategies essentially eliminates the risk of transfusion-related CMV infection [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,28
         </a>
         ].

         It is standard practice at most institutions to use leukoreduced RBCs for

         neonatal transfusions [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,29
         </a>
         ]. The practice of using CMV-seronegative blood for neonatal transfusion varies from center to center. In settings where the seropositivity for CMV is high, there may be insufficient CMV-seronegative donors to fill the need for CMV-safe blood products. Thus, leukoreduction alone may be used in many centers. Additional details are provided separately. (See

         Note that leukoreduction and irradiation are not the same thing. Irradiation alone does
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         provide a CMV-safe product. Conversely, though leukoreduction greatly reduces the number of WBCs, the few remaining WBCs are capable of replication and can cause transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD) in susceptible individuals. Thus, leukoreduction alone is insufficient to prevent TA-GVHD. (See

         Irradiated RBCs are used in patients at risk for TA-GVHD, including patients with acquired or congenital immunodeficiency. Many institutions, including ours, routinely use irradiated RBC units for all neonatal transfusions, particularly preterm neonates [

        <p>
         Irradiated RBC units are exposed to gamma or x-ray radiation at a standard dose prior to transfusion. This dose of radiation stops proliferation of foreign lymphocytes and eliminates the risk of TA-GVHD; however, it is not sufficient to kill viruses. Thus, irradiation does not provide a CMV-safe product and does not eliminate the need for either leukoreduction or CMV-seronegative blood products if a CMV-safe product is required. Other indications for irradiated RBCs are discussed in a separate topic review. (See

         RBC transfusions generally are given in aliquots of 10 to 20 mL/kg, over two to four hours. We typically use 20 mL/kg volumes. In some circumstances, such as hemodynamic instability or hypovolemia due to blood loss, a smaller volume (10 mL/kg) is given more rapidly (over one to two hours).

         The optimal volume for neonatal RBC transfusion is uncertain, and there are few data comparing different approaches. A systematic review identified two trials (89 neonates) comparing higher transfusion volume (20 mL/kg) with lower volume (10 mL/kg) [

          Special techniques for ELBW and VLBW infants

         – In extremely low birth weight (ELBW) and very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates, the total volume for a single transfusion may be as low as 5 to 10 mL of blood. Special equipment can maximize the use of a single unit from a donor and allow for serial transfusions to an individual neonate from the same donor. This includes the following two systems:

         Small bags may come as part of a transfusion set (referred to as satellite packs) in which four or six aliquots can be made from a single red cell unit. If the blood bank has a sterile connecting device, the small bags can be connected to the large blood unit, and an appropriate amount can be withdrawn at any time.
        </p>
        <p>

          •
         </span>
         A syringe set in which the syringe is sterilely connected to the original unit may also be used for small-volume transfusions. Blood is drawn through a filter into a syringe, and can be used within four hours without further filtration. Such systems have been shown to be safe and can increase the number of transfusions from a single unit [
         <a href="#rid31">

         With both systems, the original expiration date of the unit is maintained if the sampling device remains connected to the original unit in a sterile manner. This period may be up to six weeks for use of a single unit in a nutrient solution such as Adsol (AS-1) and Nutricel (AS-2). However, irradiated RBC units have a shelf life of only 28 days. If a single unit is designated for a premature infant and is used until its expiration date, as many as 13 individual transfusions can be made from a single donor unit, which markedly decreases donor exposure [

          Iron supplementation
         </strong>
         – Optimal nutrition, including iron supplementation, is important for all neonates, particularly those requiring neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) care. Neonates in the NICU often receive iron supplementation to replace iron lost through hemorrhage or phlebotomy. (See

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Iron supplementation should be continued even in neonates who have received RBC transfusions. This is because the iron provided from an RBC transfusion (which is approximately 8 mg/kg of iron for a 10 mL/kg aliquot of packed RBCs) isn't available until the transfused RBCs reach the end of their lifespan.

          Limiting blood loss from phlebotomy

         – In neonates requiring NICU care, iatrogenic blood loss for laboratory testing is an important contributor to development of anemia, particularly in ELBW neonates [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33,34
         </a>
         ]. There is a strong correlation between the amount of blood lost from phlebotomy and the number of transfusions ELBW neonates require, regardless of whether restrictive transfusion thresholds are used. (See

          Use of cord blood
         </strong>
         – Initial laboratory tests can be obtained using fetal blood remaining in the placenta and umbilical vessels (cord blood). Use of cord blood for initial blood tests decreases initial phlebotomy losses and may reduce the need for transfusion, particularly in preterm very low birth weight (VLBW; &lt;1500 g) neonates. In one study, this method was successful for obtaining initial blood samples in 95 percent (91 of 96) VLBW neonates [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. Compared with matched controls in whom initial blood tests drawn from the neonate, the use of cord blood for initial laboratory evaluation was associated with higher hematocrit (Hct) at 12 to 24 hours and lower rates of transfusion in the first week after birth. Additional details of cord blood sampling for initial laboratory testing are provided separately. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Cord blood has also been suggested as a form of autologous blood donation. However, most birthing hospitals are not prepared for collecting and storing neonatal cord blood. Even with a program in place to collect and process umbilical cord blood, one study found that autologous blood was only available in one-third of neonates who required transfusion [
         <a href="#rid36">

          Rationale for transfusion
         </strong>
         – The principal rationale for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in neonates is to prevent or reverse tissue hypoxia from reduced oxygen carrying capacity. Optimal transfusion practice aims to avoid unnecessary transfusions while ensuring that transfusion isn't withheld from neonates who would truly benefit from it. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Rationale for transfusion'
         </a>

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Overall, &lt;1 percent of newborns require RBC transfusion. However, approximately 15 to 20 percent of neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) receive at least one transfusion. Common reasons for RBC transfusion in neonates include anemia of prematurity, alloimmune hemolytic disease, perinatal blood loss, and iatrogenic withdrawal of blood for laboratory testing. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Risks
         </strong>
         – Transfusion has rare but established risks, including transfusion-transmitted infections, immune-mediated transfusion reactions, graft-versus-host disease, and toxic effects of anticoagulants or preservatives. (See

        <p>
        </p>

         In addition, observational studies suggest that exposure to RBC transfusions is associated with adverse neonatal outcomes including intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and neurodevelopment impairment; however, causality has not been established.

          Grade 1B
         </a>
         ). The thresholds we use are based upon gestational and postnatal age, hemoglobin (Hgb) or hematocrit (Hct) levels, and the clinical status of the infant, as summarized in the table (

          table 1
