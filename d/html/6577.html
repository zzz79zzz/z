It is a common problem in children and constitutes up to 40 percent of pediatric urology clinic visits [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In some children, bladder dysfunction is associated with constipation referred to as bowel bladder dysfunction, which had been previously called dysfunctional elimination syndrome (DES).</p><p>Daytime urinary incontinence, a common feature of bladder dysfunction, can cause major stress in school-age children [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>], and negatively impact a child's self-esteem [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Thus, it is desirable to identify and treat affected school-age children as early as possible.</p><p>The evaluation of non-neurologic bladder dysfunction in children will be reviewed here. The etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children are discussed separately. The clinical features, evaluation, and management of children with bladder dysfunction due to myelomeningocele also are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6580.html" rel="external">"Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6578.html" rel="external">"Management of bladder dysfunction in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6209.html" rel="external">"Myelomeningocele (spina bifida): Urinary tract complications"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">GOALS OF EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goals of the evaluation for suspected bladder dysfunction in children are to:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Determine whether the child has an abnormality in either filling and/or emptying of the bladder.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If there is a bladder function abnormality, the evaluation should determine the underlying cause. Specifically, the assessment should distinguish organic (ie, neurogenic or anatomical) from functional causes of bladder dysfunction because management differs depending upon the etiology. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6580.html" rel="external">"Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children", section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The evaluation for most children with bladder dysfunction can be limited to a thorough history, physical examination, and noninvasive testing, such as a urinalysis and urine culture. In selected children, more extensive evaluation includes urologic imaging studies, measurements of urinary flow, and post-void residual determination. In an even more select group of children, formal urodynamic studies may be required to diagnose the underlying problem and determine the most appropriate therapeutic approach.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">WHEN TO SUSPECT BLADDER DYSFUNCTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bladder dysfunction should be considered in the following settings:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Daytime urinary incontinence in school-age or previously toilet-trained children.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Persistent urinary symptoms such as urgency, dribbling, or pain during urination. (See <a class="local">'History'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bladder dysfunction has been associated with conditions such as vesicoureteral reflux, recurrent urinary infections, and chronic constipation or encopresis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6094.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and course of primary vesicoureteral reflux"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99538.html" rel="external">"Functional constipation in infants, children, and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6066.html" rel="external">"Urinary tract infections in children: Long-term management and prevention", section on 'Identify and treat bowel and bladder dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial evaluation for suspected bladder dysfunction in a child includes a thorough history including voiding diary, focused physical examination, and minimal laboratory testing.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A thorough history is important in determining whether bladder dysfunction is present and, if so, may identify the underlying cause. The history should be tailored to the age of the patient and the appropriate stage in his/her development of bladder control. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6580.html" rel="external">"Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children", section on 'Normal voiding'</a>.)</p><p>The history should seek information about the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Voiding schedule</strong> – Voiding schedule includes the frequency of voids and, in toilet-trained children, the frequency of incontinent episodes. If possible, an estimation of the voided volume should also be obtained. Large voids may indicate a large capacity bladder seen in children with underactive bladders or polyuria.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptoms of bladder dysfunction</strong> – Bladder dysfunctional symptoms include urgency, pain during urination, holding maneuvers, hesitancy, dribbling, straining, and an intermittent or weak urinary stream. The definitions for these symptoms are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6580.html" rel="external">"Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children", section on 'Definitions of symptoms'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Validated survey tools include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The Dysfunctional Voiding Symptom Survey, a questionnaire consisting of 10 questions that assess daytime incontinence, constipation, urgency, voiding frequency, and dysuria  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef100505" href="/d/graphic/100505.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. A scoring system based upon a scale of 0 to 3 for each question results in an overall score indicative of the severity of bladder dysfunction. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Incontinence Symptom Index-Pediatric, an 11-item questionnaire that is divided into two domains impairment and symptom severity [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Dysfunctional Voiding and Incontinence Symptoms Score that assesses daytime symptoms, nighttime symptoms, voiding habits, bowel habits, and quality of life [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although these validated survey tools have been shown to correlate with clinician clinical impression, the mean symptom scores from these questionnaires were higher than the clinician rating for symptom severity [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. A comparison found that all three questionnaires were equivalent when evaluating response to treatment [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The survey tool we use in our institution uses questions from several validated instruments [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bowel habits</strong> – Because constipation is often seen in children with bladder dysfunction, information regarding the child's bowel habits should be obtained. This includes the frequency of bowel movements; the consistency, caliber, and size of stool; presence of pain during defection; and any history of stool withholding behavior, or fecal incontinence and/or soiling [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6580.html" rel="external">"Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children", section on 'Bowel and bladder dysfunction'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5906.html" rel="external">"Constipation in infants and children: Evaluation", section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Family history</strong> – A family history should screen for any kidney or urologic disorders including bladder dysfunction. It is also useful to obtain the age that other family members achieved urinary continence to determine whether there is a familial maturational delay in achieving bladder control.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Perinatal and neonatal history</strong> – Screening for any evidence of any perinatal or neonatal insult should be included. As examples, perinatal anoxia or congenital infection could alter the central and peripheral nervous system normal coordination of bladder function, resulting in bladder dysfunction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diet intake</strong> – The amount and type of fluid should be determined. Excessive fluid intake and/or fluid intake during the nighttime may be reflective of polyuria due to a concentrating defect, diabetes mellitus, or, less often, primary polydipsia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2381.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of patients with polyuria"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Previous urinary tract infection</strong> – Urinary tract infection (UTI) with and without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) are often seen in children with bladder dysfunction. The management of VUR is more difficult in children with bladder dysfunction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6580.html" rel="external">"Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children", section on 'Urinary tract infection'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6580.html" rel="external">"Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children", section on 'Vesicoureteral reflux'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neurodevelopment delay and psychological disorders</strong> – Children who are developmentally delayed may also be delayed in gaining voluntary bladder control. Although most children with bladder dysfunction do not have behavior problems [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], there appears to be an increased risk of bladder dysfunction in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. Several studies report an estimated prevalence of 20 to 50 percent of psychological disorders including depression, anxiety, and ADHD in children with urinary or fecal incontinence [<a href="#rid14">14-16</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6580.html" rel="external">"Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children", section on 'Behavioral and neurodevelopmental issues'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Family/parent/caregiver conflict or stress</strong> – Functional causes of bladder dysfunction are often believed to originate from behavioral issues arising from toilet training or personal stress. Voluntary holding with postponement of voiding may be reflective of a conflict between the parent/caregiver and child [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The level of stress on the parents/caregivers correlates with the severity of the child's bladder-bowel dysfunction as well as his or her psychosocial difficulties [<a href="#rid14">14,17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Toilet training history</strong> – The history should include whether toilet training was prolonged, delayed, or stressful, and whether there was a period of dryness after toilet training. As noted above, a stressful or prolonged history of toilet training may be indicative of parent/caregiver and child conflict. Anatomic causes of incontinency, such as an ectopic ureter, will typically have no period of complete dryness after toilet training.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Voiding diary</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The use of a three-day voiding diary is helpful to obtain an objective record of bowel and urinary voiding patterns. It should include the time and volume of each void, the time of each incontinent episode, fluid intake, the time of each bowel movement, and any episode of fecal soiling  (<a class="graphic graphic_form graphicRef102378" href="/d/graphic/102378.html" rel="external">form 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The physical examination is focused on detecting neurologic or urologic abnormalities and includes the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lower back</strong> – The back is examined for cutaneous signs of occult spinal dysraphism or sacral agenesis, such as a presacral dimple, hair patch, lipoma, or asymmetric gluteal cleft. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/93935.html" rel="external">"Closed spinal dysraphism: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management", section on 'Examination'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neurologic examination</strong> – A focused neurologic examination should include assessing lower extremity strength and deep tendon reflexes, gait, fine-motor coordination, perineal and anal sensation, anal wink (anocutaneous reflex), and rectal tone. Any abnormality of the neurologic examination may be indicative of a neurologic lesion that also affects the function of the bladder, which is coordinated by an integrated neural network involving both the peripheral and central nervous system  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65433" href="/d/graphic/65433.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15360.html" rel="external">"Detailed neurologic assessment of infants and children", section on 'Neurologic examination'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>External urological and perianal examination</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In boys, the examination includes inspection of the meatus to detect any evidence of meatal stenosis [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6587.html" rel="external">"Complications of circumcision", section on 'Meatal stenosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In girls, examination of the labia and vaginal introitus is performed to detect any evidence of labial adhesions  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102362" href="/d/graphic/102362.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). These findings may be a cause of bladder outlet obstruction. Areas of skin excoriation or redness may be present, which may be a sign of continuous or severe urinary leakage.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Perianal inspection provides information about the position of the anus, and the presence of gluteal cleft deviation, dermatitis, and perianal feces, fissures, or hemorrhoids [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2858.html" rel="external">"The pediatric physical examination: The perineum", section on 'Anus and rectum'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Abdominal and rectal examination</strong> – Constipation is often an associated comorbidity with bladder dysfunction [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In a child with constipation, the abdominal examination may detect low to moderate tenderness due to colonic distension secondary to fecal impaction. The digital rectal examination may reveal a distended rectum that is full of stool. In addition, it provides information on perianal sensation and tone, and function of the anal sphincter. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5906.html" rel="external">"Constipation in infants and children: Evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Observation of the urine stream</strong> – If possible, direct observation of the urinary stream during voiding should be performed. It allows the clinician to determine whether there is any evidence of hesitancy, dribbling, intermittency of voiding, or weak stream, which are all signs of bladder dysfunction  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef102364" href="/d/graphic/102364.html" rel="external">movie 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evidence of sexual or physical abuse</strong> – The physical examination should look for signs of physical or sexual abuse because bladder dysfunction can be a presenting sign for child abuse [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6605.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents", section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Laboratory studies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Initial laboratory testing generally does not provide additional useful diagnostic information and should be limited to a urinalysis and urine culture.</p><p>Findings on a urinalysis, preferably performed on a first morning void (ie, after a period of fluid restriction), may be suggestive of conditions that present with polyuria such as diabetes insipidus. These include a low specific gravity due to a renal concentrating defect or glycosuria due to diabetes mellitus. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7196.html" rel="external">"Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease", section on 'Glucose'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7196.html" rel="external">"Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease", section on 'Specific gravity'</a>.)</p><p>A urine culture should be obtained if the urinalysis is positive for urine leukocyte esterase and nitrite because children with bladder dysfunction have an increased risk of UTI. Children with UTI will often have a positive urinalysis for pyuria. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6580.html" rel="external">"Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children", section on 'Urinary tract infection'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6089.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of microscopic hematuria in children"</a>.)</p><p>Serum laboratory studies (eg, creatinine) are typically not part of the initial evaluation because abnormalities in overall kidney function are rare in children with a normal urinalysis. If there is an abnormal urinalysis suggesting kidney injury or disease (eg, urinary concentrating defect, proteinuria), a serum creatinine is obtained to estimate the glomerular filtration rate and check serum electrolytes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6091.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of proteinuria in children", section on 'Approach to the child with proteinuria'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of bladder dysfunction is based upon the presence of one or more of the following lower urinary tract symptoms, which are defined elsewhere.
