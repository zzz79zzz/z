         Human milk is widely recognized as the optimal feeding for virtually all infants because of its proven health benefits to infants and their mothers [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>
         ]. It has particularly important health benefits for preterm infants. However, premature birth also poses several unique challenges to breast milk production and feeding. Mothers of premature infants need early and ongoing support to ensure optimal human milk feeding through breast milk expression and transitioning to direct breastfeeding when the infant is ready.
        </p>

         Breast milk expression for the premature infant will be reviewed here. Breastfeeding the premature infant, the nutritional composition and fortification of human milk, and the approach to enteral feeds in the preterm infant are discussed separately. (See

         For preterm infants, human milk feeding has particularly important health benefits, including protection from infection and necrotizing enterocolitis, improved tolerance of enteral feeding with shorter hospital stay, possible protection from severe retinopathy of prematurity, and improved neurodevelopment [
         <a href="#rid7">

         Premature birth also poses several unique challenges to breast milk production and feeding. Because infants with gestational age &lt;28 weeks are unable to breastfeed effectively for at least six weeks after birth, their mothers must establish and maintain milk production by expressing milk, typically by using a breast pump [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Moreover, mothers who deliver prematurely have difficulty in establishing an adequate milk supply [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The following factors are associated with decreased likelihood that mother's milk will be used for infant feeding [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10

         Extreme prematurity – Milk production decreases with lower gestational age. Milk production is particularly reduced in mothers of extremely preterm infants (gestational age &lt;28 weeks) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,12
         </a>
         ]. Extremely preterm infants typically are also unable to breastfeed effectively for some time after birth, which requires their mothers to establish and maintain milk production by milk expression either by hand or by use of a pump.

         In many cases, mothers who deliver prematurely have not made a final decision on whether to breastfeed their infant and may not have the necessary information to make an informed decision. Mothers who are educated about the benefits of human milk and breastfeeding usually opt to feed their infant breast milk and are willing to express their milk for at least one to two weeks until the infant is able to breastfeed directly [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Universal prenatal education ensures that all mothers, including those who will deliver preterm, are informed about the benefits of breastfeeding prior to infant's birth.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because many preterm infants cannot initially feed at the breast, mothers need instructions regarding expression and collection of milk. When the infant is mature enough to breastfeed, mothers will require additional instructions on how best to initiate breastfeeding [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16

         Lactational counseling improves breast milk expression and, ultimately, the rates of breastfeeding for preterm infants [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,17-19
         </a>
         ]. Efforts to promote breastfeeding should be directed and coordinated by a clinician with expertise in both lactation and intensive neonatal care to capture the benefits of human milk feeding and a comprehensive understanding of how to address the unique challenges in this population. Optimal care practice policy, which promotes breastfeeding, is outlined in the criteria required for the Baby-Friendly Hospital and is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4986.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Additional support should be directed towards subgroups of women who are less likely to breastfeed, and counseling should focus on the specific maternal issues that negatively impact breastfeeding. (See

         Milk expression with a mechanical breast pump is the best way to empty the breasts thoroughly and efficiently. Several randomized trials demonstrate the superiority of electric breast pumps over hand expression for optimal milk removal [
         <a href="#rid20">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Supplementary manual milk expression ("hand expression") during the first 48 hours after birth, in addition to mechanical pumping, provides additional breast stimulation and yields higher volumes of colostrum [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Ongoing combined manual and mechanical milk expression over the first eight weeks after birth helps to establish sustainable daily milk volumes (&gt;500 mL) [

          23

         For mothers who are totally dependent upon expression of their milk to initiate and maintain their milk production, we recommend a hospital-grade electric breast pump. Electric pumps programmed with suction patterns that mimic the human infant during breastfeeding result in greater milk output in less time spent pumping [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Pumping both breasts simultaneously (double pumping) is more effective than sequential pumping in the first two weeks after birth [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20,25
         </a>
         ]. Compared with single pumping, double pumping stimulates more milk ejections and yields higher milk volume and with higher energy content [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. Mothers should be advised to use the maximum
         <strong>
          comfortable
         </strong>
         vacuum, which has been found to enhance milk flow rate and milk yield compared with vacuum pressures above this comfort threshold [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A hospital-grade double pump may be rented through hospitals, pharmacies, lactation consultants, and home health agencies. For women in the United States who are participants of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), these pumps are available at no charge in most states. A single-user (personal) double pump can be used as an alternative. However, it is important to note that the hospital-grade double pump has been shown to be more effective than the personal use pump during the "coming to volume" lactation phase. For mothers who do not have access to an electric pump, manual pumping can be successful, although the pumping time is longer [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Selection of the correct-size breast shield is important in order to maximize the amount of milk expressed. If a breast shield is too small, the nipple will rub against the sides of the tunnel, causing discomfort and possible nipple trauma, which can inhibit milk ejection and reduce milk flow [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. If a breast shield is too large, this can cause air leakage and reduced suction, resulting in ineffective stimulation, milk ejection, and milk flow. A properly fitted shield allows the nipple and areola to move in and out of the shield freely without touching the sides of the tunnel  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107721" href="/z/d/graphic/107721.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Mothers should be reevaluated for proper shield size following several weeks of pumping to ensure that the fit is still appropriate.

          Duration of pumping session

         – Mothers should be advised to pump the breasts simultaneously for 15 minutes prior to the onset of lactogenesis II (defined as the first of two consecutive pumping sessions for which the total milk output is &gt;20 mL, which typically occurs around the third or fourth day after birth). After the onset of lactogenesis II, each pumping session should continue until only drops are expressed, with a minimum of 15 minutes [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Typical duration for a pumping session is approximately 15 to 25 minutes [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Once lactation is fully established, some mothers may find that less time is required to achieve satisfactory breast emptying.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Emptying the breast completely is important to stimulate milk production and also to maximize fat content of the expressed milk, which increases from the beginning to the end of an expression session. The final drops of milk (hindmilk) have the highest fat and caloric content and contribute disproportionately to the infant's calorie intake [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35,36
         </a>
         ]. Breast massage during the final minutes of pumping can increase breast emptying and assist in extraction of hindmilk. This technique also allows the mother to locate and drain alveoli containing residual milk, thereby reducing the potential for developing plugged ducts and mastitis. (See

         After the first two weeks after birth, once milk production is established, some mothers can extend the interpumping intervals for convenience (eg, at night), although they should still pump at least six times in every 24-hour period. For other mothers, extending the interpumping interval will interfere with milk production because the response to milk stasis during interpumping intervals varies [

          37

         The single most important factor predicting breastfeeding success is the ability of the mother to produce enough milk to meet the requirements of her infant at hospital discharge [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,38,39
         </a>
         ]. Most mothers of preterm infants, including those born extremely preterm (gestational age &lt;28 weeks), can produce sufficient amounts of breast milk for the nutritional needs of their infants using a combination of mechanical and hand expression, supported by ongoing lactation counseling [
         <a href="#rid23">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         At discharge, most preterm infants require approximately 150 to 170 mL/kg per day of milk (300 to 500 mL per day for an infant weighing 3 kg). Some preterm infants will take as much as 200 mL/kg per day, which is tolerated in the absence of significant chronic pulmonary diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Volumes on the higher end of the above range may be needed for larger preterm infants and for infants who are preparing for hospital discharge who will be fed human milk exclusively after discharge. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5014.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Mothers of premature infants who produce less than approximately 350 mL of milk per day by days 10 to 14 postpartum are at risk of producing insufficient milk to feed their infants at discharge [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. Efforts to increase production should be initiated at that time and continued during the infant's hospitalization. (See

        <p>
         Lactation can be optimized by providing mothers with a method to document the frequency and volume of milk expression in the first few weeks after birth  (

          41
         </a>
         ]. These records reflect volume patterns following different lengths of interpumping intervals, which we use to adjust pumping frequency and optimize volume production. Daily monitoring of maternal milk volume during this early critical period provides objective, quantifiable information to optimize lactation outcomes. In our practice, we use a simple assessment score to monitor risk factors for low milk volume during the first 14 days postpartum; this is modified from the "coming to volume" log [

         Transport containers (coolers or ice chest) should be thoroughly cleaned, inside and outside, on a regular basis.

         Glass (Pyrex) and hard plastic (polypropylene) containers are recommended for human milk storage because they provide stability for water-soluble constituents and are easy to handle [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45,46

         ]. When a hard plastic container becomes scratched with use, it will be more difficult to clean and should be replaced.
        </p>
        <p>
         Storage materials that should be avoided include flexible polyethylene bags, which are not recommended for milk collection and storage, because they cause more loss of the cellular component of the milk (maternal macrophages and lymphocytes) and also leak during storage and handling [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. Transparent plastic containers or bottles that contain bisphenol A also should be avoided because exposure to bisphenol A, an endocrine-disrupting chemical, may have adverse effects on infant development. These containers often are marked with the recycling number 7 or the letters PC, which stand for "polycarbonate" plastic.
        </p>
        <p>
         Each container should be labeled with the infant's name, medical record number, date and time of collection, and current maternal medications, if any. Mothers should be provided with labels for this purpose and instructed to use pens/markers that will not smudge or wash off when exposed to water. If the milk is to be transferred to another container by the nurse or other designated staff prior to feeding, each individual syringe/bottle should be labeled appropriately. Prior to feeding, the information from the labeled milk should be verified against the infant's name band. To reduce errors of feeding milk to the wrong baby, some hospitals are using barcode scanning labels in place of manual verification processes [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47

         The temperature at which milk is stored depends upon the intended duration of storage prior to feeding. Many of the protective antimicrobial properties of human milk are temperature sensitive. Heating, freezing, thawing, and prolonged storage result in some loss of bioactivity [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48,49
         </a>
         ]. Although stored and frozen milk remain superior to formula in their protective antimicrobial and nutrient properties, milk that is fed immediately after expression offers the highest degree of natural bioactivity. Due to these beneficial components in fresh milk, whenever possible, we recommend that at least one daily feed include fresh milk (never frozen and pumped within 96 hours).

         The guideline for storage of refrigerated milk is supported by a study in which milk storage for up to 96 hours at 4ºC did not significantly change its osmolality, total bacterial colony counts, or concentrations of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), lactoferrin, and fat [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51

         ]. There was a 16 percent decrease in the white blood cell concentration and a decrease in pH from 7.21 to 6.68, but neither change was clinically significant. In another study, lactoferrin concentration was stable in human milk samples that were refrigerated for five days but decreased on average by one-third in samples that were frozen for over three months at -18 to -20ºC [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52

          53

         If milk from a single expression is divided into multiple aliquots, mothers should mix the milk thoroughly but gently before distributing it into the storage containers. Fat distribution in expressed milk is uneven not only because of changing lipid content as the breast is emptied but also because milk fat (cream) rises to the top after expression. If the milk is not mixed, the infant can receive feedings with markedly different fat and caloric values, which might affect metabolic processes and overall weight gain [

        <p>
         It is also acceptable to pool the milk expressed over 24 hours into one container before separating into aliquots for storage. This approach leads to less variability in caloric and nutrient content and no differences in bacterial growth compared with using individual containers at each pumping [

         Following secretory activation, maintenance of milk production depends upon the removal of milk on a regular basis. Failure to remove milk results in excessive and prolonged accumulation of milk within the alveolar lumen, leading to alveolar distension and elevation of intramammary pressure, which result in decreased milk production.

         Complete emptying of the breast should be done on a regular and frequent basis, at least six times a day. If milk extraction techniques are performed efficiently, increasing the frequency of breast emptying by two sessions per 24 hours results in an average milk volume increase of 80 mL per day over a two-week time period [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30

         Pumping at the infant's bedside is beneficial because it allows clinical staff to directly observe and correct (as needed) the mother's technique, including the use of breast shields and ability to completely empty the breasts, and also to monitor the mother's pumping schedule. It enables physical contact between the mother and infant during milk expression, which augments release of lactogenic hormones (eg, oxytocin) [

          Mothers who are primarily breastfeeding

         – During the transition from partial to exclusive breastfeeding, mothers should continue pumping after nursing to ensure complete breast emptying. This is because preterm infants are often unable to withdraw milk from the breast effectively until their oral feeding ability matures. (See

         Nonnutritive sucking, in which the preterm infant suckles the emptied breast after the mother has pumped, provides tactile nipple stimulation, which enhances milk production and the infant's transition from tube to oral feeding. Although the hormonal regulation of lactogenesis and milk ejection is complex and not completely understood, it is known that nipple stimulation early after birth increases the number of secretory cells and the density of prolactin receptors in the mammary epithelial cells.

          68-72
         </a>
         ]. Regular sessions of STS contact are optimally continued throughout the hospitalization.
        </p>
        <p>
         STS is performed with the mother positioned reclining at an angle of 45 to 60 degrees. Using reclining chairs and foot stools provides an appropriate and comfortable position for the mother and infant. Infants are placed prone and upright between the mother's breasts with the head turned so that the side of the face rests against the surface of one breast. Mirrors positioned to allow mothers to observe their infant's face enhance the maternal experience. For optimal results, sessions should last for two or more hours.

         Mothers who demonstrate similar milk production during short and long interpumping intervals can safely extend the interpumping interval at night. In contrast, mothers whose milk production decreases with longer interpumping intervals should not extend the interpumping interval, to optimize their milk production. The daily pumping log should reveal the impact of changes in the interpumping interval on the 24-hour milk supply and allow the mother to make necessary adjustments.

         Galactagogues (or lactagogues) are medications or other substances believed to assist initiation, maintenance, or augmentation of maternal milk production. Data are generally inconclusive regarding whether these drugs significantly increase milk production, based on small studies. Therefore, galactagogues are not routinely recommended, due to limited efficacy and potential side effects of the available agents. However, we occasionally offer a galactagogue to selected mothers with low breast milk volume who failed to increase their milk production despite expert lactation counseling.

         The agents most commonly used are dopamine receptor antagonists (eg,

Fenugreek is the most widely used herbal agent, but data are insufficient to determine its efficacy and safety, especially for preterm infants, and therefore it is not recommended.
