A nontargeted liver biopsy (also termed medical liver biopsy) is typically performed for patients with persistently elevated liver enzyme tests without a clear cause identified by clinical features, laboratory studies, or imaging. The clinical history, and results of viral serologies and autoimmune markers should be made available to the pathologist so that the histologic findings can be interpreted within the clinical context. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3576.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests"</a>.)</p><p>The histologic interpretation of nontargeted liver biopsy specimens in adults will be reviewed here. The approach to obtaining a liver biopsy, including transjugular liver biopsy, is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3587.html" rel="external">"Approach to liver biopsy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3586.html" rel="external">"Transjugular liver biopsy"</a>.)</p><p>The pathology and histologic features of focal liver lesions are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3597.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3590.html" rel="external">"Hepatocellular adenoma"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3577.html" rel="external">"Focal nodular hyperplasia"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3594.html" rel="external">"Hepatic hemangioma"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1763618062"><span class="h1">LIVER MICROSTRUCTURE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The microscopic structure of liver parenchyma has been commonly conceptualized in two ways: the acinar model and the traditional lobule model  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59968" href="/d/graphic/59968.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acinar model – The acinus is a unit that contains a small portal tract at the center and terminal hepatic venules at the periphery. The acinar model (also known as the Rappaport classification) is based on the functional microcirculatory pattern. The acinar model is divided into three zones that represent gradients where the nutrient and oxygen content of the hepatic microcirculation differ. The center of the acinus (periportal) is zone 1; the periphery (perivenular) is zone 3; and the region in between is zone 2 [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Zone 1 receives blood with the highest levels of oxygen and nutrients compared with zone 3. Thus, zone 3 is particularly vulnerable to circulatory insults. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the acinar model, blood supply to an area of hepatic parenchyma and the bile duct draining it are located in one portal tract (ie, hepatic arteriole, portal venule, and bile duct). The acinus consists of a cluster of hepatocytes (approximately 2 mm in diameter) that are grouped around terminal branches of a hepatic arteriole and portal venule. Blood flow is from the portal areas to the central veins. More specifically, blood from a branch of the portal vein and hepatic artery enter the acinus in the portal and periportal regions, flow through the hepatic sinusoids, and drain into a terminal hepatic venule. Blood becomes progressively deoxygenated and depleted of nutrients toward central veins.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Hepatocytes within these zones are adapted to their micro-location. Zone 1 hepatocytes have high oxidative activities and contain many large mitochondria. Their dominant processes include gluconeogenesis, beta oxidation of fatty acids, amino acid catabolism, ureagenesis, cholesterol synthesis, and bile acid secretion. By contrast, zone 3 hepatocytes are more involved with glycolysis and lipogenesis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Traditional lobule model – In the lobule model, the central structure of microcirculation is the terminal hepatic venule (also referred to as central vein/venule). Thus, this area is known as the centrilobular zone, while the periphery is delineated by portal tracts with the parenchyma surrounding portal zones referred to as periportal.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H180144294"><span class="h1">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1111245081"><span class="h2">Correlating histology with clinical data</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Histologic findings of the liver may often be nonspecific; for example, there is substantial overlap in the cellular and morphologic changes caused by viral infection, autoimmune disease, drug-induced injury, or a metabolic process [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. As a result, most cases require clinical and histologic correlation to arrive at the most accurate final diagnosis.</p><p>Data provided to the pathologist by the clinician at the time of liver biopsy should include (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3576.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests"</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age and sex of the patient.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Timing of onset and duration of disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Suspected clinical diagnosis, which will often lead to a more targeted search by the pathologist.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Laboratory studies (ie, liver biochemical and function tests, viral and autoimmune serologies, if available).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Radiographic findings, if available.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4276333923"><span class="h2">Assessing adequacy of the specimen</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial step in evaluating a liver biopsy is a visual inspection of the adequacy of the sample and the type and quality of staining. It is generally agreed that an adequate specimen is at least 15 mm in length and contains six to eight complete portal tracts. Longer specimens (&gt;15 mm) improve reliability for staging fibrosis and grading histologic activity [<a href="#rid2">2,5</a>]. However, a percutaneous or transjugular liver biopsy typically samples about 1/50,000 of the liver and thus is always vulnerable to sampling variability. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3587.html" rel="external">"Approach to liver biopsy", section on 'Limitations'</a>.) </p><p>Prior to microscopic examination, a gross examination of the slides can evaluate not only for an adequate specimen but also for the presence of tissue fragmentation. The latter finding suggests advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis. (See <a class="local">'Recognizing histologic patterns'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H137226482"><span class="h2">Staining the specimen</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Staining of liver biopsy specimens typically includes hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and Masson or Gomori trichrome stains. H&amp;E staining colors the nuclei of cells blue, while other structures appear as various hues of pink or red [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Trichrome stain is useful for evaluating the amount of fibrous tissue and assessing the degree of chronic liver injury. The connective tissue (ie, fibrosis or cirrhosis) appears as various shades of blue or purple.  </p><p>Special staining may be performed when evaluating for specific disorders [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In most institutions, Perls stain for presence of iron is routinely performed. Other histochemical stains include periodic acid-Schiff stain with diastase digestion for identifying alpha-1 anti-trypsin inclusions, oil red O staining performed on fresh frozen specimens for suspected acute fatty liver of pregnancy or Reye syndrome, stains for copper (eg, rhodanine) for suspected Wilson disease, and reticulin stains for type III collagen for evaluating the liver microarchitecture for hepatocyte necrosis and regeneration. Reticulin staining is also used to assess collapse of the reticulin framework that indicates severe hepatocyte loss and to diagnose idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension. (See <a class="local">'Recognizing histologic patterns'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1834721780"><span class="h1">RECOGNIZING HISTOLOGIC PATTERNS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Histologic patterns of hepatic injury have been generally grouped by the cell or function that is most affected (eg, hepatocyte, bile ducts, vascular). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H278983613"><span class="h2">Hepatocellular injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Diseases of hepatocellular injury are characterized by damage to hepatocytes (ie, cytotoxic injury) and histologically may be seen as ballooning or feathery degeneration. These diseases are usually associated with elevated levels of serum aminotransferases (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase). Bilirubin levels may be elevated in patients who have extensive damage to hepatocytes. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2809647737"><span class="h3">Viral hepatitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A liver biopsy is rarely performed for patients with suspected acute viral hepatitis, but when obtained, the biopsy specimen may show severe lobular and portal inflammation. Examples of liver injury related to viral infection include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute viral hepatitis – Most patients with acute viral hepatitis have elevated serum aminotransferases. The histologic features of acute viral hepatitis may have various degrees of severity ranging from inflammatory infiltrate consisting mostly of lymphocytes that surround hepatocytes (spotty necrosis) to widespread (panlobular) involvement by necroinflammation. In some patients, bridging necrosis that typically links one vascular structure to another  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93218 graphicRef93219" href="/d/graphic/93218.html" rel="external">picture 1A-B</a>) and confluent necrosis are present.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) – Patients with chronic HBV infection may present with chronic portal inflammation and varying degrees of interface and lobular activity. Ground-glass hepatocytes are pathognomonic. Ground-glass cytoplasm is due to the presence of hyperplastic smooth endoplasmic reticulum filled with hepatitis B surface antigen  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef130636" href="/d/graphic/130636.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) – Patients with chronic HCV infection may be asymptomatic and have elevated serum aminotransferases.

Hepatic injury in patients with chronic HCV infection has been quantified into grades of inflammation and stages of fibrosis. Several scoring systems have been developed, and these are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3635.html" rel="external">"Histologic scoring systems for chronic liver disease"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Epstein-Barr virus hepatitis – Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been associated with hepatitis and cholestasis, while more typical features of infectious mononucleosis include fever, pharyngitis, adenopathy, fatigue and atypical lymphocytosis. Although liver biopsy is rarely performed for patients with suspected EBV-associated hepatitis, liver histology is characterized by slightly atypical lymphoid cells filling the sinusoids  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108834" href="/d/graphic/108834.html" rel="external">picture 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef130639" href="/d/graphic/130639.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>).

In this regard, the damage has been mostly hepatocellular. Bile duct damage has also been seen, which may be associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef130637" href="/d/graphic/130637.html" rel="external">picture 7</a>).

Autoimmune hepatitis can be characterized histologically by lobular inflammation and portal inflammation with many plasma cells. A portal mononuclear cell infiltrate (generally lymphoplasmacytic with occasional eosinophils) invades the sharply demarcated hepatocyte boundary (limiting plate) surrounding the portal tract and infiltrates into the surrounding lobule  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67909 graphicRef108839" href="/d/graphic/67909.html" rel="external">picture 8A-B</a>). The periportal lesion, referred to as interface hepatitis (formerly termed piecemeal necrosis), may involve more of the lobule  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93231" href="/d/graphic/93231.html" rel="external">picture 9</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93229 graphicRef93230" href="/d/graphic/93229.html" rel="external">picture 10A-B</a>). There may also be zone 3 (centrilobular) necrosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3665.html" rel="external">"Overview of autoimmune hepatitis"</a>.)</p><p>Some degree of fibrosis is usually present in all but the mildest forms or earliest presentations of autoimmune hepatitis. Advanced fibrosis connects portal and central areas (bridging), which ultimately, by architectural distortion of the hepatic lobule and the appearance of regenerating nodules, results in cirrhosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93233 graphicRef108841 graphicRef93228" href="/d/graphic/93233.html" rel="external">picture 11A-C</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1057752612"><span class="h3">Drug-induced liver injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Histologic findings in patients with drug-induced liver injury (DILI) have been categorized by liver histology, resulting in a spectrum ranging from mild lobular inflammation with focal necrosis to severe hepatocellular necrosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108835" href="/d/graphic/108835.html" rel="external">picture 12</a>), and for some patients, cholestasis.

Histologic features of acetaminophen toxicity initially affect centrilobular (zone 3) hepatocytes and will eventually include the entire lobule, depending on the severity. The cytoplasm of the affected hepatocytes is typically eosinophilic (stained dark pink) and may appear mummified. Zonal necrosis is characteristic of drugs such as acetaminophen with predictable, dose-dependent, intrinsic toxicity  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93235 graphicRef93274" href="/d/graphic/93235.html" rel="external">picture 13A-B</a>).
