         The optimal management for hypertension in neonates and older infants remains uncertain due to the lack of evidence regarding long-term outcome and clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of antihypertensive agents in this age group. As a result, therapeutic recommendations generally rely on expert opinion based on clinical experience and judgment.

         Because data are extremely limited regarding the treatment of hypertension in infancy, the approach to management is largely empiric and differs widely from that used in older children. Management decisions depend on the severity of hypertension, underlying cause, and other clinical factors that impact the infant's clinical status.
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment consists of identifying and correcting any curable cause of hypertension and, when indicated, initiating pharmacologic therapy to lower blood pressure (BP).
        </p>
        <p>
         However, clinical criteria (ie, BP thresholds) for starting antihypertensive medications in infancy are not well defined, because of a paucity of robust normative data and long-term outcome data. As a result, indications for initiation of antihypertensive therapy are primarily based on expert clinical opinion [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In addition, there is limited information on the efficacy and safety of specific agents to control hypertension in neonates and older infants and most of the available data are from small observational case series [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-7
         </a>
         ]. Thus, most treatment decisions regarding pharmacologic intervention must rely on clinical experience and judgment. Prior to starting antihypertensive medications in a neonate or infant, consultation with a pediatric nephrologist and/or other clinician with experience in the management of hypertension in this age group is recommended.

         Antihypertensive therapy should be started in neonates and infants with persistent asymptomatic mild hypertension with evidence of target-organ involvement, typically LVH detected by echocardiography. There are no clinical trial data to guide medication choice in this age group; therefore, choice of agent is at the discretion of the treating clinician. Similar to patients with asymptomatic hypertension, reasonable choices include calcium channel blockers, diuretics, beta blockers (may wish to avoid in patients with a history of chronic lung disease), and agents blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (if the patient is greater than 44 weeks postmenstrual age).

Reasonable choices include calcium channel blockers, diuretics, beta blockers (may wish to avoid in patients with a history of chronic lung disease), and, if the patient is greater than 44 weeks postmenstrual age (gestational age at birth plus chronologic age), agents blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

Continuous infusions of IV medications should be used as they act quickly and have short onset and offset of action, which allow titration to the desired effect. As in older children, BP should be lowered in a controlled fashion by no more than 25 percent of the planned reduction over the first eight hours. Further reduction to the target BP (usually the 95

         However, there is a paucity of data on the use of specific antihypertensive agents to treat neonates and infants with hypertension. Information is derived from small case series reporting use of antihypertensive drugs in newborns and/or older infants [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-7,13,14
         </a>
         ]. Given the lack of properly conducted clinical trials in this age group, treatment is usually empiric and the choice of therapy relies on clinical experience and judgment and the clinical setting. In addition, the availability of specific agents, especially extemporaneously prepared oral liquid formulations, will vary among institutions. Thus, consultation with a pediatric nephrologist or other clinician with experience in the management of neonatal hypertension is recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
         The choice of antihypertensive agent depends on the severity of hypertension. For neonates and infants with acute severe hypertension, continuous IV antihypertensive administration (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12925" href="/z/d/drug information/12925.html" rel="external">
          nicardipine
         </a>
         ) is preferred so that BP can be rapidly modified and safely lowered based on patient response. Oral agents can be used in patients with less severe hypertension. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5001.html" rel="external">
          "Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of neonatal hypertension", section on 'Definition'

        </p>
        <p>
         Despite the paucity of data, all classes of antihypertensive agents have been used in the treatment of hypertension in neonates and older infants, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and direct vasodilators [

         Diuretics reduce extracellular and plasma volume, resulting in a modest decrease in blood pressure (BP). Their use in infancy usually is limited to mild hypertension resulting from volume overload or as a second-line medication when BP cannot be controlled using a single agent. Diuretic therapy may also be beneficial in improving lung function in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. (See

         If diuretics are used in the treatment of hypertension in infants, thiazide diuretics (eg,

         ]. IV nicardipine is generally considered the drug of choice for management of severe hypertension because its administration decreases BP within minutes. Because of its short half-life of 10 to 15 minutes, it is given as a continuous infusion. Nicardipine is started as a continuous IV infusion at a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg per minute. If the target BP goal is not achieved within 15 minutes, the infusion can be increased in increments of 0.25 to 0.5 mcg/kg per minute every 15 minutes to a maximum of 3 mcg/kg per minute. In the rare patient whose BP does not respond to nicardipine or whose BP remains elevated on the maximum dose of nicardipine, infusions of either sodium

         is a direct vasodilator of both arteriolar and venous smooth muscle cells. It is metabolized to nitric oxide, which dilates both arterioles and venules, thereby reducing total peripheral resistance, accounting for its efficacy in the treatment of severe hypertension. Because of its rapid onset of action and short duration of effect, BP can be carefully titrated. Complications include hypotension and thiocyanate toxicity, which can occur with prolonged administration (&gt;72 hours) or reduced kidney function. Thiocyanate levels should be monitored in these settings.

         In most cases of neonatal hypertension, blood pressure (BP) control can be readily achieved with antihypertensive medications. In any neonate treated with antihypertensive medications, the infant should not be discharged from the nursery until the desired goals of treatment are determined and the potential adverse effects of the prescribed agents are reviewed with the parents/caregivers.
        </p>
        <p>
         After discharge from the nursery, infants with chronic hypertension may require increasing doses of their antihypertensive medication as they grow. As a result, ongoing BP monitoring will be needed to assure that BP control is being maintained. In these patients, proper equipment needs to be arranged for home use (usually an oscillometric device) and the parents/caregivers instructed on the use of the equipment. At our center, we routinely provide home oscillometric devices to the families of infants discharged on antihypertensive medications and home BP measurements are used to adjust medication dosing.

         Renovascular hypertension secondary to umbilical catheter-associated thromboembolism is typically transient, with some patients requiring treatment for only a few weeks or months. It is typical for infants to initially require increased dosing of medications as they gain weight after discharge, then for the BP to remain controlled on the same dose despite ongoing growth. When the dosing remains unchanged despite ongoing growth, the medication can be slowly weaned and discontinued. The following two studies illustrate the relatively good prognosis of hypertension due to aortic and/or renal thromboembolism:

         No data have been published regarding the outcome of hypertensive infants in late childhood, let alone adulthood. For this reason, we recommend that patients with neonatal hypertension should be closely followed. Monitoring of blood pressure (BP) and kidney function should be performed on a regular basis. In our practice, patients are generally seen monthly for the first three to six months after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit, then every three months after that. Given the high prevalence of renovascular and other kidney parenchymal causes of hypertension, serial kidney imaging should also be considered to monitor kidney growth. There is a great need for long-term outcome studies to better define the prognosis of hypertensive infants.

          Pharmacologic management
         </strong>
         – When antihypertensive therapy is initiated, it is best to begin with a single drug, increasing the dose in a stepwise fashion to the maximum dose until the BP is controlled. If hypertension persists, or adverse effects of the first drug are seen, a second drug should be added. (See
         <a class="local">

          Choice of pharmacologic agent

         – There are no clinical trials to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of specific antihypertensive drugs in infants with hypertension. Classes of antihypertensive agents used in the management of infant hypertension include diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and direct vasodilators such as

          Ongoing management
         </strong>
         – Infants treated with antihypertensive therapy need to have ongoing BP monitoring. These infants may require increasing doses of their medication as they grow. In any neonate treated with antihypertensive medications, the infant should not be discharged from the nursery until the desired goals of treatment are determined and the potential adverse effects of the prescribed agents are reviewed with the parents/caregivers.

          Duration of therapy
         </strong>
         – The duration of therapy is influenced by the underlying cause of hypertension. In many cases, hypertension will resolve with recovery or treatment of the underlying disorder and chronic long-term antihypertensive therapy may not be needed. (See

          Outcome
