Distinction between these two forms of HIT is made based on clinical parameters such as the timing and degree of platelet count drop, and laboratory testing if needed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>HIT type I (HIT I) is a mild, transient drop in platelet count that typically occurs within the first two days of heparin exposure. The platelet count typically returns to normal with continued heparin administration. The mechanism appears to be a direct effect of heparin on platelets, causing non-immune platelet aggregation. The typical platelet count nadir is approximately 100,000/microL. This form of HIT is not considered clinically significant, is <strong>not</strong> associated with thrombosis, and patients can be managed expectantly without discontinuation of heparin.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>HIT type II (HIT II) is a clinically significant syndrome due to antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4) complexed to heparin, referred to as "HIT antibodies" or "PF4/heparin antibodies" [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. These antibodies can cause thrombosis along with thrombocytopenia; hence, this syndrome has also been called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). The risk of thrombosis, including life-threatening limb gangrene, persists until both heparin is eliminated <strong>and</strong> a non-heparin anticoagulant is initiated.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Phases of HIT</strong> – Phases of HIT have been defined that include the acute condition as well as various phases of recovery  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119930" href="/d/graphic/119930.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Acute</strong> – Acute HIT refers to the acute episode with thrombocytopenia and HIT antibodies, with or without thrombosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Subacute</strong> – Subacute HIT refers to the state where a patient has recovered from an episode of HIT (ie, their platelet count has returned to normal or the patient's baseline) but has persistent HIT antibodies. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Remote</strong> – Remote HIT refers to platelet count recovery and negative heparin-PF4 antibodies.

The following diagnostic criteria have been proposed for this disorder [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Otherwise unexplained thrombocytopenia and/or thrombosis without significant recent heparin exposure</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Demonstration of anti-PF4 antibodies of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass that cause strong in vitro platelet activation in the absence of heparin</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">SpHIT likely represents a form of autoimmune reaction to endogenous heparins [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>VITT</strong> – Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare complication of adenoviral vectored coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines including the ChAdOx1 CoV-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca, University of Oxford, and Serum Institute of India) and the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Janssen; Johnson &amp; Johnson). The antibodies activate platelets in the absence of heparin. A similar syndrome has been described after adenovirus infection. Evaluation and management of VITT and supporting evidence are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/131333.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Heparin-induced antibodies (HIA)</strong> – Some patients produce antibodies that react in laboratory assays for HIT but do not cause thrombocytopenia or thrombosis. These antibodies can occur in patients exposed to heparin (eg, during cardiopulmonary bypass) or with other conditions in the absence of heparin exposure (eg, lupus) and are sometimes referred to as heparin-induced antibodies (HIA). (See <a class="local">'Formation of HIT antibodies'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8927918"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8928576"><span class="h2">Formation of HIT antibodies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HIT has an unusual immunobiology compared with other drug-induced antibodies, which includes the following features [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>IgG antibodies are formed rapidly (within days). There is no primary IgM response for clinically significant platelet factor 4 (PF4)/heparin antibodies.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>IgG antibodies disappear over time; however, this does not imply that heparin can be used routinely upon disappearance of the antibodies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1369.html" rel="external">"Management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia", section on 'Lifelong heparin avoidance (list of sources)'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Immune memory does not always occur (ie, rechallenge does not always cause an anamnestic response), although individuals with recent heparin exposure may develop clinical findings of HIT in a shorter timeframe than those without recent heparin exposure. (See <a class="local">'Timing'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>HIT antibodies are directed against PF4 complexed with heparin  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50473" href="/d/graphic/50473.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1,8-11</a>]. It is thought that the binding of heparin (or other polyanions) induces a conformational change in the PF4 protein that creates a neoantigen, and HIT antibodies bind to this PF4 neoantigen [<a href="#rid12">12-14</a>]. As a result of this heparin dependency, these antibodies usually only cause clinical symptoms when heparin is present. Initial formation of HIT antibodies typically requires exposure to heparin for four or more days, with rare exceptions listed above. </p><p>Anti-heparin-PF4 antibodies can be of the IgG, IgM, and IgA subclass. IgG is thought to be the only pathogenic antibody because the platelet surface Fc receptor only recognizes IgG.</p><p>Naturally occurring antibodies that react with PF4 bound to heparin are present in 3 to 8 percent of the general population without HIT [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. The prevalence of high-titer antibodies is significantly lower (0.3 percent with an optical density &gt;1.0 in one study) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. It has been suggested that these antibodies are induced when PF4 binds to negatively charged polysaccharides on the surface of bacteria, creating an antigen in PF4 that mimics PF4 bound to heparin [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. This pre-exposure to the PF4 antigen may be responsible for the rapid appearance of HIT antibodies following treatment of some patients with heparin.</p><p>The HIT immune response is similar to the T-cell-independent B-cell activation that is seen with immune reactions against viruses with repetitive epitopes [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Preliminary evidence suggests that this may be the explanation for the syndrome seen with adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccines. (See <a class="local">'Terminology and HIT variants'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1028059297"><span class="h2">Platelet factor 4 (PF4)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The PF4 protein is stored in platelet alpha granules. It is a small cytokine belonging to the CXC chemokine family. Platelet activation causes release of PF4, which forms a tetramer that binds to and neutralizes heparin and related endogenous proteoglycan molecules (eg, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate) on endothelial surfaces [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Heparin-PF4 complexes also form on the platelet surface. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1371.html" rel="external">"Overview of hemostasis", section on 'Platelet secretion'</a>.)</p><p>HIT antibodies may bind to heparin-PF4 complexes on the platelet surface (via heparin binding to cell surface proteins) or to PF4 attached to platelet surface glycosaminoglycans (heparin-like molecules) [<a href="#rid8">8,18</a>]. In an in vitro assay, HIT antibodies were shown to also bind to PF4 complexed with high molecular weight multimer strings of von Willebrand factor (VWF) released from injured endothelium under flow conditions, which also promoted platelet binding and activation [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. </p><p>Once HIT antibodies bind to PF4 on the platelet surface, their Fc region is captured by Fc receptors on the surface of the same or adjacent platelets (Fc gamma Receptor IIA [FcγRIIA]), as well as glycoprotein (GP) Ib/IX, creating a positive feedback loop of further platelet activation [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. This in turn leads to release of more PF4, which creates more antigenic substrate for HIT antibodies [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8928737"><span class="h2">Mechanism of thrombocytopenia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The mechanisms of thrombocytopenia in HIT include removal of IgG-coated platelets by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system (eg, spleen, liver, bone marrow), via binding to the FcγRIIA, similar to other types of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia; consumption of platelets at sites of thrombosis; and platelet destruction due to the development of a consumptive coagulopathy. A second cause of thrombocytopenia is consumption of platelets within thrombi.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3663178141"><span class="h2">Mechanism of thrombosis</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2622020091"><span class="h3">Platelet activation and endothelial cell injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Unlike most other forms of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia, HIT is also associated with arterial and venous thrombosis. The mechanism is likely multifactorial, but the primary mechanism is thought to be due to activation of platelets and injury to endothelial cells via activation of the cell surface FcγRIIA on platelets and endothelial cells, respectively. This results in the following downstream effects  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50473" href="/d/graphic/50473.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Externalization of platelet membrane phosphatidyl serine [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].

In a study of 89 patients with HIT, thrombosis was more frequent in individuals with an arginine rather than a histidine at amino acid position 131 on both alleles of the receptor (ie, FcγRIIA 131RR rather than FcγRIIA 131HH) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. The odds ratio (OR) for thromboembolic events with the 131RR allele was 5.9 (95% CI 1.7-20).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H892701962"><span class="h3">Neutrophil activation and NETosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are structures created when neutrophils extrude their DNA as uncoiled strands of chromatin that incorporate cellular contents such as histones, myeloperoxidase, and elastase. NETs play a central role in host defense against infection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13572.html" rel="external">"An overview of the innate immune system", section on 'Neutrophils'</a>.)</p><p>Studies suggest that NETosis also plays a key role in thrombosis in individuals with HIT [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>].</p><p>HIT immune complexes can activate neutrophils by two pathways: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Directly, via FcγRIIA</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Indirectly, by activation of platelets via FcγRIIA followed by interaction and activation of neutrophils via P-selectin and its ligand P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1)</p><p></p><p>In a study involving 21 individuals with HIT, plasma markers of NETosis including cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase, "low density granulocytes," and citrullinated histone H3 were increased substantially compared with control plasma [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Plasma from HIT patients and purified antibodies to heparin-PF4 were able to induce release of DNA from purified neutrophils. In a mouse model of HIT, depletion of neutrophils or blockage of nuclear decondensation in neutrophils by a NETosis inhibitor prevented thrombosis, while thrombocytopenia was unaffected, supporting the important role of NETosis in HIT thrombosis. The data also suggest that thrombosis and thrombocytopenia in HIT are separable events. </p><p>HIT antibodies also activate monocytes [<a href="#rid31">31-33</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8927930"><span class="h2">Clinical variability</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical presentation of HIT (eg, risk of thrombosis, duration of antibody persistence) varies in different patient populations. While many of the mechanisms are unknown, increases in systemic inflammation and differences in platelet surface glycoproteins may be involved [<a href="#rid34">34-39</a>]. The greater incidence of HIT in women is unexplained. (See <a class="local">'Incidence and risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>HIT can occur with any heparin dose, schedule, and administration route. However, the molar ratio of PF4 to heparin influences the concentration and size of PF4-heparin complexes on the platelet surface, which in turn influences antigenicity and clinical sequelae.

This is an immunoassay that detects the presence of anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4)/heparin antibodies in patient serum. The turnaround time for ELISA testing varies among centers, often as a reflection of the volume of HIT testing performed, which determines how frequently a batch of tests is run. As noted below, rapid immunoassays that can be performed on single samples (turnaround time 20 to 30 minutes) are being developed and some appear to have comparable accuracy to the ELISA.</p><p>The assay is performed by adding patient serum to a microtiter plate coated with heparin-PF4 complexes or polyanion-PF4 complexes that generate the HIT antigen on PF4. If HIT antibodies are present in the patient sample, they will bind the PF4 complex and can be identified by adding a second antibody coupled to an enzyme for detection. The intensity of a colorimetric change correlates with the concentration of the HIT antibody in the patient sample. This intensity is reported as the optical density (OD) at a specific wavelength (typically 405 nm). A higher OD represents a higher titer of antibody in the patient's serum, which is more strongly suggestive of HIT than a low titer.</p><p>Most laboratories report the results of a HIT ELISA assay as positive or negative based on a predetermined OD cutoff value. However, it is important that laboratories make available the OD of the ELISA assay because the OD correlates with the likelihood of HIT [<a href="#rid90">90,107-109</a>].
