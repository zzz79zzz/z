They are a significant problem in critically ill patients, older adults, and in persons with spinal cord injury.</p><p>Pressure ulcers cause pain, decrease quality of life, and lead to significant morbidity and prolonged hospital stays, in part due to complicating infection. Infected pressure ulcers are a common problem, occurring in 4 to 6 percent of nursing home patients in two series [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>The infectious complications of pressure ulcers are reviewed in this topic. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, staging, prevention, and treatment of noninfected pressure skin and soft tissue injuries are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2884.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and risk assessment of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2885.html" rel="external">"Prevention of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2887.html" rel="external">"Clinical staging and general management of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury"</a>.)</p><p>Pressure ulcers that occur in the feet of patients with severe neuropathy and/or vascular insufficiency, often due to diabetes mellitus, are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7651.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of diabetic infections of the lower extremities"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H621893729"><span class="h1">CLASSIFICATION AND TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel made changes to its classification in April 2016 and suggested using the terminology "pressure injury" instead of "pressure ulcer" to describe these wounds. The details of the terminology are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2887.html" rel="external">"Clinical staging and general management of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury", section on 'Definitions and terminology'</a>.)</p><p>We use the term "pressure ulcer" for the specific circumstance where the integrity of the skin surface is disrupted.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Local factors that contribute to infection of pressure ulcers include breaks in the integrity of the skin barrier, pressure-induced edema and tissue damage, and contamination from contiguous dirty areas, such as from fecal incontinence. Among patients with spinal cord injury, the majority of pressure ulcers develop in areas adjacent to the ischium, sacrum, and greater trochanter. Other common sites in immobile individuals include the heels, back of the head, and elbows [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2884.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and risk assessment of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Colonization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pressure ulcer colonization by microorganisms precedes development of infection. The ulcer is first colonized with skin flora, which is rapidly replaced by bacteria from the local environment and the urogenital or gastrointestinal tracts, often from direct fecal contamination [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Pressure ulcers are generally associated with a bacteria count of &lt;10<sup>2</sup> colony forming units (CFU) per gram of tissue if cared for and kept free of necrotic tissue [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Higher concentrations of bacteria in pressure ulcers may inhibit normal wound healing without inducing a host response, a state known as critical colonization [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In one study, delayed healing of pressure ulcers occurred when bacterial counts were &gt;10<sup>5</sup> CFU per gram of tissue [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Quantitative bacterial counts to identify critical colonization, however, are not widely used in clinical practice. </p><p>The presence of biofilms is also being increasingly recognized as a cause of delayed healing [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Bacterial biofilms may form on the necrotic and avascular debris in pressure ulcers. Bacteria within these biofilms are protected from normal host defenses and have markedly reduced susceptibility to antibacterial therapy [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pressure ulcers, even those that are not infected, are colonized with multiple organisms. Therefore, infection of pressure ulcers is typically caused by multiple organisms. Organisms causing infection, however, are not always identical to those colonizing an ulcer surface. </p><p>A retrospective study of 168 surgical samples evaluated the microbiology of infected pressure ulcers in 101 spinal cord injury patients [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The predominant organisms were <em>Enterobacter</em> (29 percent), staphylococci (28 percent), and <em>Enterococcus faecalis</em> (16 percent). In a separate study of pressure ulcer-related bacteremia in spinal cord injury patients, the major organisms were staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>[MRSA], methicillin-susceptible <em>S. aureus</em>, and coagulase-negative staphylococci), streptococci, <em>Proteus mirabilis</em>, and anaerobes [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H537861989"><span class="h1">DETERMINING EXTENT OF INFECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Infection occurs when microorganisms invade normal tissues, replicate, and overwhelm host immune defenses. The extent of local infection associated with a pressure ulcer is variable. Infection may be limited to the base of a superficial ulcer, result in a rim of surrounding cellulitis, or progress to extensive infection and necrosis of deeper structures (including fascia, muscle, and bone). </p><p>A poorly healing superficial ulcer with increased drainage but no surrounding erythema is suggestive of a limited superficial infection of the ulcer base; spreading erythema around an ulcer is suggestive of cellulitis; and a deep ulcer with necrotic muscle, undermined tissue, or sinus tracts is characteristic of deeper infection of the soft tissue or bone. Clinical assessment should focus on identifying these features. However, the full extent of local infection may not be apparent until surgical debridement when adequate visualization of underlying tissue is achieved. </p><p>Determining extent of infection is important since the approach to evaluation and management varies depending on whether infection is superficial or deep (involving either soft tissue or bone). These are outlined below. (See <a class="local">'Superficial infection'</a> below and <a class="local">'Soft tissue infection'</a> below and <a class="local">'Osteomyelitis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1598297790"><span class="h1">SUPERFICIAL INFECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Limited superficial infection of a pressure ulcer typically presents as a poorly healing ulcer, often with increased exudate or wound drainage without associated soft tissue erythema. Systemic manifestations, including fever, chills, and malaise, are not typically seen; if present, they suggest either a deeper local infection or an unrelated infection. The diagnosis is based on clinical features alone.</p><p>Most pressure ulcers with superficial infection can be treated with local wound care followed by a one- to two-week trial of topical antiseptics to reduce bacterial concentrations  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef76470" href="/z/d/graphic/76470.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Local wound care includes debridement of necrotic tissue, use of a moist wound dressing, nutritional support, and pressure relief. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2887.html" rel="external">"Clinical staging and general management of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury"</a>.)</p><p>Topical antiseptic agents that reduce bacterial counts without damaging the wound include <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9890" href="/z/d/drug information/9890.html" rel="external">silver sulfadiazine</a> 1% cream and other silver compounds [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. We typically use silver sulfadiazine. Dressings impregnated with silver, honey, or cadexomer iodine are reasonable alternatives to topical antiseptics. Oher antiseptic agents such as peroxide and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9244" href="/z/d/drug information/9244.html" rel="external">chlorhexidine</a> gluconate are cytotoxic to human fibroblasts, may delay healing, and are not recommended [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Povidone-iodine or other iodine-containing products are often used, although reports on their potential harm are mixed [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. As opposed to topical antiseptics, topical antibiotics are generally not recommended due to concerns of adverse drug reactions and development of antibiotic resistance [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15912.html" rel="external">"Basic principles of wound management", section on 'Antiseptics and antimicrobial agents'</a>.) </p><p>The above recommended approach is designed to reduce the microbial burden and is consistent with guidelines from the National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. However, evidence supporting the benefit of topical antiseptics is inconclusive, as reflected in a systematic review of 12 trials [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Furthermore, a subsequent meta-analysis of 39 studies was unable to determine specific dressings or topical agents that were most likely to heal pressure ulcers, and it was not clear that any were more effective than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> gauze [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. </p><p>If there is no clinical improvement with optimal wound care and topical antiseptics, then the wound should be carefully examined, consideration given to other diagnoses, and further workup pursued. This could include a soft tissue biopsy for culture and evaluation for underlying osteomyelitis. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1574007566"><span class="h1">SOFT TISSUE INFECTION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Clinical features</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Soft tissue infection of pressure ulcers may manifest as one or more of the following signs or symptoms depending on the depth of infection: warmth, erythema, induration, necrosis, tenderness, purulent discharge, and a foul odor [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cellulitis (ie, infection limited to the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous fat) associated with pressure ulcers typically presents as a limited area of erythema, warmth, induration, or tenderness of the surrounding skin or superficial subcutaneous tissue. Systemic signs of infection including fever, chills, and malaise may or may not occur. Mental status changes, such as confusion or lethargy, may be noted in older adult patients. The presence of leukocytosis is variable. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Involvement of deeper tissue, such as fascia and muscle, may cause tissue discoloration or frank necrosis. In some cases, necrosis of deep tissue may extend to bony surfaces. Often, systemic signs of infection (eg, fever) or sepsis are present, and occasionally these are the only presenting signs, since changes in the surrounding soft tissue can be subtle. </p><p></p><p>Bloodstream infection, with or without sepsis, may occur in patients with pressure ulcer-related soft tissue infections.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2754993376"><span class="h2">Diagnostic evaluation</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3023508582"><span class="h3">Clinical suspicion and presumptive diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Diagnosis of soft tissue infection of a pressure ulcer is based on clinical features and is straightforward in patients with typical findings of erythema, warmth, induration, fluctuance, tenderness, drainage, odor, or tissue necrosis (see <a class="local">'Clinical features'</a> above). A higher index of suspicion may be necessary in cases in which the ulcer and surrounding tissue have not significantly worsened but the patient has symptoms of systemic infection (eg, fever, chills, malaise, mental status changes, leukocytosis) or sepsis. In such cases, the possibility of a pressure ulcer-related infection should be suspected if evaluation does not identify an alternate source of infection. Additional workup involves microbiologic evaluation, as discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Microbiologic evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Conversely, exudate alone without additional signs or symptoms of soft tissue or systemic involvement should prompt consideration of a limited, superficial infection amenable to local debridement and wound care. (See <a class="local">'Superficial infection'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2496982779"><span class="h3">Microbiologic evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Identification of causal pathogen(s) with antimicrobial susceptibility testing is essential to ensure optimal antibiotic therapy. A challenge of microbiologic evaluation is distinguishing between bacterial invasion and colonization since all pressure ulcers are colonized with microorganisms. </p><p>The most useful specimen for culture is a biopsy of the deepest tissue involved in the infection. Sampling techniques for cultures include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Deep tissue biopsy obtained during surgical debridement</strong> – Surgical debridement is often necessary for management of pressure ulcer-associated infections, and deep tissue biopsies should be obtained at the time of debridement. Cultures of the biopsied tissue should be sent promptly to the laboratory in appropriate containers for both aerobic and anaerobic cultures. Surgically obtained deep tissue biopsies remain the gold standard for wound culture because they prevent culture contamination by bypassing colonizing bacteria on the surface of the ulcer [<a href="#rid10">10,20-22</a>]. Details regarding the technique for obtaining surgical wound cultures are found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129217.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries", section on 'Debridement'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Needle aspiration</strong> – Aspiration of material below the ulcer margin is a reasonable alternative to deep tissue biopsy in patients in whom surgery is not performed [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]. Local anesthesia should not be used during collection of the samples because of its potential antibacterial activity. Cultures from needle aspirations should be sent promptly to the laboratory in appropriate containers for both aerobic and anaerobic cultures. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In one study from 30 nursing home residents with infected pressure ulcers, excellent concordance was reported between cultures recovered by needle aspiration and those recovered by tissue biopsy; sensitivity and specificity of aspirate cultures were 93 and 99 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. However, another study of 72 pressure ulcers found that 43 percent of needle aspirations were positive for microorganisms compared to 63 percent of deep tissue biopsies, suggesting that needle aspiration may not be as highly sensitive as some studies suggest [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Superficial swab cultures</strong> – Superficial swab cultures of pressure ulcers are not adequate to guide antibiotic therapy. Although swab cultures are frequently used to avoid pain or complications from aspiration or biopsy, results of swab cultures often reflect surface colonization rather than infection [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. If performed, we only use results of swab cultures to determine the need for ongoing coverage of methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) if the patient is not otherwise known to be colonized and cultures of deeper samples are not available. For organisms other than MRSA, we do not use swab culture results to broaden or narrow empiric coverage.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Basing antibiotic regimens on swab cultures may result in inadequate or unnecessarily broad coverage. In one study, for example, the microbiology of 72 pressure ulcers was assessed by superficial swab and deep tissue biopsy [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. More swab cultures were positive for microorganisms (96 percent) than deep tissue biopsies (63 percent), and the higher rate of positive cultures from swabs most likely represented colonization. In another study of 25 individuals with spinal cord injury and infected pressure ulcers, a 75 percent concordance rate was found between swab and biopsy cultures [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Additionally, swab cultures may not identify all infected pathogens identified by surgical biopsy. In a retrospective study of 77 patients who underwent both surgical biopsy and surface swab for culture, almost two-thirds of surgical specimens grew different bacterial species than surface swabs [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Identification of antimicrobial resistance among swab culture isolates may be useful in determining whether enhanced infection prevention and control interventions are necessary.</p><p></p><p>In addition to obtaining samples from the site of infection, blood cultures should be obtained during the initial evaluation of patients who have systemic symptoms such as fever.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3184997872"><span class="h3">Select radiologic imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Imaging is not necessary for evaluation of all patients with pressure ulcer-related soft tissue infections. However, in patients with systemic manifestations of infection, positive blood cultures, or indwelling medical devices (eg, cardiac valves, cardiac implantable electronic devices, vascular grafts, prosthetic joints), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; or computed tomography if MRI is not feasible) may be useful in identifying underlying necrotic tissue or abscess requiring debridement that may represent an unrecognized focus of infection [<a href="#rid20">20,23</a>]. </p><p>Imaging is also warranted when there is suspicion for underlying osteomyelitis. (See <a class="local">'Clinical suspicion and initial evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Management of soft tissue infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ulcers complicated by soft tissue infection require systemic antimicrobial therapy in addition to debridement of necrotic tissue. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3581077176"><span class="h3">Debridement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Full debridement of all necrotic tissue is essential to achieve control of associated soft tissue infection. For patients who present with sepsis, surgical debridement should be performed urgently.

The frequency of bloodstream infection and/or sepsis in patients with pressure ulcers is illustrated by the following retrospective studies in different patient populations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In 123 episodes of bloodstream infection in a chronic spinal cord injury population, the source was the decubitus ulcer in 21 (17 percent) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In 44 patients with HIV and pressure ulcers, 12 had bloodstream infection; in 6, the source was the pressure ulcer [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p></p><p>Other infectious complications of pressure ulcers include septic arthritis, endocarditis, and meningitis [<a href="#rid29">29,39</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1531761043"><span class="h2">Concurrent carcinoma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cases of carcinoma, including squamous cell carcinoma and sarcoma, at the site of chronic osteomyelitis have been reported, mostly in individuals with osteomyelitis of an extremity [<a href="#rid40">40-43</a>].

The diagnosis should be considered in individuals whose infection unexpectedly fails to improve.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18"><span class="h1">INFECTION CONTROL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most pressure ulcers occur in institutionalized patients with spinal cord injuries or nursing home residents. Infection control is important in limiting the spread of resistant microorganisms by cross-contamination and in reducing colonization and infection rates of pressure ulcers. Recommendations include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Follow universal precautions that are appropriate for the health care setting and the patient's condition.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use clean gloves for each patient. When treating multiple ulcers on the same patient, attend to the most contaminated ulcer last (eg, in the perianal region). Remove gloves and wash hands between patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use sterile instruments to debride pressure ulcers.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use clean dressings, rather than sterile ones, to treat pressure ulcers, as long as dressing procedures comply with institutional infection control guidelines.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clean dressings may also be used in the home setting.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Special isolation precautions for patients infected or colonized with methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing gram-negative bacilli.</p><p></p><p>General issues of infection control are discussed in detail elsewhere.

This is one of the most important aspects of care of the poorly mobile or immobile patient. Efforts to minimize the extrinsic risk factors of pressure, friction, shear stress, and moisture are pivotal. Health care workers and family members who provide care should be educated on ways to reduce these extrinsic factors [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].

The most common organisms include staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci, <em>Enterobacter</em>, <em>Proteus</em>, and anaerobes. (See <a class="local">'Microbiology'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical presentation and approach to diagnosis</strong> – Clinical presentation and diagnosis vary based on the depth of infection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Superficial infection</strong> – Superficial infection typically presents as a poorly healing ulcer with increased drainage but no surrounding erythema or systemic symptoms (eg, fever). (See <a class="local">'Superficial infection'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Cellulitis</strong> – Cellulitis involves the skin structures (ie, epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous fat) surrounding the ulcer. Clinical findings include erythema, warmth, induration, or tenderness with or without systemic symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a class="local">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Deep soft tissue infection</strong> – Deep infection involves fascia or muscle, or abscess formation below the subcutaneous fat. Clinical findings may include tissue discoloration or necrosis, undermined tissue, or sinus tracts, with or without systemic symptoms or exposed bone. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be helpful for determining extent of infection  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef76470" href="/z/d/graphic/76470.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a class="local">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Osteomyelitis</strong> – Presentation ranges from a poorly healing wound to exposed necrotic bone with or without systemic illness or surrounding soft tissue infection. MRI is useful to assess for evidence of osteomyelitis and extent of infection. Bone biopsy with culture and histopathology is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef76470" href="/z/d/graphic/76470.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – Optimal treatment requires a multidisciplinary team and careful consideration of the patient's goals of care.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Wound care</strong> – For all infections, proper wound care is critical. (See <a class="local">'Wound management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Surgical intervention</strong> – Regardless of the depth of infection, surgical debridement is necessary if abscess or necrotic infected tissue is present. When surgery is performed, biopsies of the deepest area of infection should be sent for culture and histopathology. Wound closure, often by placement of a flap, is sometimes attempted to minimize recurrence  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef76470" href="/z/d/graphic/76470.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Surgical therapy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Debridement'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Antimicrobial therapy</strong> – Empiric antimicrobial selection depends on the depth of infection and severity of illness. Once culture results return, antimicrobials are narrowed  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef76470" href="/z/d/graphic/76470.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Superficial infection</strong> – For patients with superficial infection, we suggest a topical antimicrobial agent (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9890" href="/z/d/drug information/9890.html" rel="external">silver sulfadiazine</a> 1% cream) for one to two weeks (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Superficial infection'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Cellulitis, deep soft tissue infection, or osteomyelitis</strong> – For empiric treatment, appropriate regimens are active against methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA), streptococci, enteric gram-negative organisms, and anaerobes. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">For mild cellulitis without systemic symptoms, we suggest oral antibiotic treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8676" href="/z/d/drug information/8676.html" rel="external">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> plus either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9785" href="/z/d/drug information/9785.html" rel="external">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9393" href="/z/d/drug information/9393.html" rel="external">doxycycline</a> (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Antibiotic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">For severe cellulitis, deep soft tissue infection, or osteomyelitis, we suggest parenteral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10037" href="/z/d/drug information/10037.html" rel="external">vancomycin</a> plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9226" href="/z/d/drug information/9226.html" rel="external">ceftazidime</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9215" href="/z/d/drug information/9215.html" rel="external">cefepime</a> plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9646" href="/z/d/drug information/9646.html" rel="external">metronidazole</a> (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). If no osteomyelitis is present, transition to oral therapy is appropriate once clinical improvement has occurred. (See <a class="local">'Antibiotic therapy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Timing and regimen selection'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Duration of therapy</strong> – The typical duration of antibiotics is 5 to 14 days for infection limited to the soft tissue and six weeks for osteomyelitis; the goal of treatment in these cases is sustained resolution of the infection. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, for patients with osteomyelitis who do not undergo adequate debridement or wound closure and cannot mitigate ongoing pressure at the ulcer site, we suggest stopping antibiotics once any soft tissue infection has resolved rather than completing a full six-week course (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). In such patients, sustained resolution of osteomyelitis is unlikely, and the risks of prolonged antibiotic therapy may outweigh the benefit. (See <a class="local">'Antibiotic therapy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Timing and regimen selection'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Recurrent or refractory infection</strong> – In these situations, addressing predisposing factors (eg, ongoing pressure) and undebrided infected tissue is paramount to management. The antimicrobial approach is the same as that for initial infection. (See <a class="local">'Management of soft tissue infection'</a> above and <a class="local">'Refractory or recurrent osteomyelitis'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Garibaldi RA, Brodine S, Matsumiya S.
