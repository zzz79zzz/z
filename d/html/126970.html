         is legal in much of the United States as well as other parts of the world and is used in many clinical scenarios.

         California was the first state in the United States to legalize cannabis for therapeutic purposes in 1996 [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. This occurred in the context of advocacy from people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and people with cancer who were experiencing intractable symptoms such as pain, cachexia, and nausea. Despite discouragement from the federal government, and cannabis's continued categorization as a Schedule I substance by the United States Controlled Substances Act, other states have progressively followed California's lead. As of November 2022,

         ]. In general, medical cannabis products are labeled with a specific ratio of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) content and many states legislate these ratios. States differ in how much and what type of training health care practitioners must have to recommend medical cannabis, the relationship health care providers must have with patients to recommend it, as well as the degree to which medical cannabis products are regulated by the state (including limits on THC content and legality of products with different ratios of THC and CBD). For this reason, health care providers are encouraged to review state laws on medical cannabis in the state(s) in which they practice [

Laws on legalization of adult-use cannabis are rapidly evolving; 10 of the 21 state laws legalizing adult-use cannabis were passed in or after 2020. Twenty-seven states have decriminalized adult-use cannabis, reducing penalties for possession of small amounts of cannabis from state crimes that could lead to jail time to minor offenses [

         In addition to limiting interactions with the unregulated market and with the criminal justice system, regulated cannabis is safer and more predictable. Unregulated cannabis has been found in many studies to be contaminated with harmful pesticides, heavy metals, molds, microbes, or mycotoxins [

         People with preexisting substance use disorders may be at increased risk for developing cannabis use disorder. In these patients, clinicians should review with patients the risk of cannabis use disorder, assess for existing cannabis use disorder, and offer treatment if it exists. (See

         If patients plan to use cannabis regardless of a recommendation to avoid it, clinicians should take a harm reduction approach by encouraging patients to use regulated cannabis (medical or adult-use) if it is available to them, use safer modes of cannabis delivery, and reduce their THC dose over time. Patients would likely benefit from more frequent follow-up visits and monitoring for cannabis use disorder if they have a history of substance use disorder.

         Choosing a starting product and route of administration requires an in-depth discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of each of the available products. In patients who are naïve to cannabis, our practice is to advise initiating sublingual tinctures to address acute symptoms because of its relatively quick onset of action and lack of respiratory side effects. For chronic, daily symptoms, we advise use of ingested cannabis products because of their long duration and lack of respiratory side effects. In patients who are experienced with using cannabis, the choice of starting cannabis products is driven by a harm reduction approach. We explain to patients that there is a spectrum of risks and benefits with each cannabis product and that sublingual tinctures or ingested cannabis products are the ideal. If patients are not willing to try these alternatives to smoked cannabis, or if they try them and find them to be ineffective, we encourage patients to use vaporized forms of cannabis if they are going to use inhaled cannabis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Choice of cannabis product may also depend on the condition that is being treated. For example, patients using

         In patients who are naïve to cannabis, we advise that patients start with formulations that have equal parts THC and cannabidiol (CBD). We instruct patients to start at the lowest possible dose (usually 2.5 mg THC:2.5 mg CBD) and increase their dose in 2.5 mg THC increments every two to five days.

        <p>
         Patients who are experienced with cannabis often need cannabinoid formulations that are THC predominant (usually 2:1, 10:1, or 20:1 THC:CBD). To select a starting dose, we use one-half of the patient's estimated daily unregulated THC consumption. This is administered either at night before bed or as a split dose (afternoon and evening). Patients are advised to cease unregulated cannabis use for 24 to 48 hours prior to initiating

         ). To mitigate the adverse effects of cannabis, patients should be advised to start at a low dose of THC and slowly increase their dose until they experience symptom improvement. In studies examining the effect of cannabis dosed two different ways (low and slow versus full dose at initiation), starting at a low dose of THC and slowly increasing it was associated with fewer adverse effects such as dry mouth, vertigo, dizziness, and somnolence [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57,58
         </a>
         ]. Another strategy to limit adverse effects is to combine THC with cannabidiol (CBD), which is associated with fewer adverse events and can dampen THC effects. Inhaled products may also have respiratory side effects, the etiologies of which are not clearly THC related.

         In patients who experience adverse effects of cannabis use or who wish to cease cannabis use after a period of chronic use, abrupt cessation may lead to cannabis withdrawal.

          Choosing a cannabis product
         </strong>
         – Choosing a starting product and route of administration is based on the risks and benefits of each of the available products. Our general approach is as follows (see

          'Choosing a cannabis product'

         For cannabis-naïve patients who are using cannabis to treat acute symptoms, we suggest a sublingual tincture rather than other products (

          Starting dose

         – In patients who are naïve to cannabis, we advise that patients start with formulations that have equal parts THC and CBD, at the lowest possible dose (usually 2.5 mg THC:2.5 mg CBD), and increase their dose in 2.5 mg THC increments every two to five days. Patients who are experienced with cannabis often need cannabinoid formulations that are THC predominant (usually 2:1, 10:1, or 20:1 THC:CBD). (See
