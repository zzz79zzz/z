In addition, some forms of combined immunodeficiency cause milder impairment of T cell function and do not necessitate HCT but do require lifelong immune globulin replacement. Among patients who have already undergone HCT, immune globulin therapy is frequently required for at least one year after the transplant because full B cell function takes longer to reconstitute than T cell numbers or function. A significant fraction of patients may fail to reconstitute B cell function and may require lifelong immune globulin therapy, even after HCT. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/115988.html" rel="external">"Hematopoietic cell transplantation for severe combined immunodeficiencies"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Other specific inborn errors of immunity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are numerous other IEI in which the production of antibodies is or can be abnormal.

It is also important to consider instances where the B cells may have been depleted owing to a therapeutic intervention such as in the use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> or chimeric antigen receptor T cells directed against CD19 as therapy for B cell malignancy.

These are the major criteria for licensing purposes [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. All adequately designed studies of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) for the treatment of immunodeficiency have demonstrated these clinical benefits for immune globulin products licensed in the United States by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for replacement therapy in IEI.</p><p>Most of these studies report rates of infections in a specific population of patients before and after <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> was initiated since the importance of this therapy in immunodeficient patients prohibits the performance of placebo-controlled studies. As an example, a review of IVIG therapy for common variable immunodeficiency found that 84 percent of a cohort of 50 patients experienced at least one episode of bacterial pneumonia prior to therapy [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. During IVIG treatment (mean period of observation 6.6 years, range 1 to 26 years), only 11 percent of patients experienced bacterial pneumonia.</p><p>Estimates of the size of the treatment effect are dependent upon several variables, including the serum IgG levels achieved, the patient's underlying IEI, and associated conditions, such as bronchiectasis. However, several studies have confirmed the aggregate clinical impression that higher serum IgG levels are associated with increased freedom from infection [<a href="#rid9">9-12</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Individualizing the dose'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to serious acute infections, patients with immunodeficiency may also have subclinical chronic infection of the lungs and/or sinuses, which can result in bronchiectasis and progressive loss of pulmonary function. It is presumed that <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> therapy, if given in sufficient doses, can ameliorate the long-term consequences of these conditions, although adequate longitudinal studies have not been performed. In patients with IEI who have existing chronic lung disease, higher doses of immune globulin have been associated with quantifiable benefits [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3952.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prognosis of common variable immunodeficiency", section on 'Indications for higher dosing'</a>.)</p><p>The impact of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> on infections in various conditions is discussed in specific topic reviews.

Among patients with IEI, regular treatment with immune globulin is associated with higher scores of perceived health [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1188180"><span class="h2">Limitations of therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">Immune globulin</a> replacement therapy does not correct all of the manifestations of IEI. As an example, patients with common variable immunodeficiency may be protected from clinical pneumonia by immune globulin treatment [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], but they can continue to experience chronic or recurrent sinusitis, progression of lung disease, or certain ongoing autoimmune disorders. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3952.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prognosis of common variable immunodeficiency"</a>.)</p><p>Patients with common variable immunodeficiency are also susceptible to the development of new autoimmune disease and malignancy. There is insufficient evidence to determine if the doses of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> that are adequate to prevent acute infections will also reduce the risk of these complications or even treat autoimmunity, which might otherwise be modified by immune globulin at higher doses.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h1">CONSTITUENTS AND PRODUCTION METHODS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">Immune globulin</a> is purified from pooled human plasma, obtained from thousands of donors. The use of many donors helps to ensure that the preparation contains a broad spectrum of protective antibodies and is relatively uniform. However, it also increases the risk of transmission of bloodborne pathogens and has necessitated the use of multiple purification steps. These steps are reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4431.html" rel="external">"Overview of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy", section on 'Production and composition'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3944.html" rel="external">"Intravenous immune globulin: Adverse effects", section on 'Infectious risks'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Immunoglobulins</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) and subcutaneous immune globulin (SCIG) principally contain IgG. Most products approximate the distribution of IgG subclasses found in normal plasma, while specific efforts are made to reduce immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin M (IgM).</p><p>All production processes begin with cold ethanol fractionation, which is done according to Cohn-Oncley or Kistler-Nitschmann procedures [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. Different manufacturers then use various combinations of precipitation, filtration, and/or chromatography steps to obtain final preparations that consist of greater than 95 percent IgG in all available products. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> also contains a small amount of IgA, which varies among the different products  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116460" href="/d/graphic/116460.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12871146"><span class="h2">Antibodies to specific antigens</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Testing of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> to determine the content of specific antibodies is routinely performed only for antibodies to measles, poliovirus, and diphtheria toxin antigen as mandated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA; Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 640.104) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Aside from these titers, products are neither standardized nor routinely tested for their content of specific antibodies against other pathogens. Thus, product-to-product and lot-to-lot variation in specific antibody titers is likely, although the different preparations are assumed to have equivalent therapeutic efficacy overall in protecting antibody-deficient patients against infection.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Other constituents</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Manufacturers use various stabilizers to obtain a final product, and these preparations differ in storage requirements and shelf-life. Stabilizers include sugars, such as glucose or maltose. Other products contain amino acids, such as glycine or proline. The sodium content of different products varies. The pH and osmolality of products vary as well, but this is not known to be of clinical significance. The resulting products differ from each other in ways that may be important in a particular patient  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116460" href="/d/graphic/116460.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). There are also numerous differences between available preparations that are of unknown significance [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4431.html" rel="external">"Overview of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy", section on 'Selecting a product'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H88515019"><span class="h1">PATIENT EDUCATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several medical centers require signed specific informed consent prior to administering <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> and/or other blood products, although this practice is not universal. Regardless of the policy, a discussion with the patient/guardian is indicated prior to administration to discuss the reasons immune globulin therapy is necessary, the fact that treatment is often lifelong, and to review the risks of therapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6405834"><span class="h2">Risks of therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When therapy is initiated, clinicians should also educate patients about possible adverse effects, which include headache, infusion reactions, kidney complications, hemolytic anemia, neutropenia, thromboembolic events, rare but serious allergic reactions, and the theoretical risk of transmission of bloodborne diseases [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Adverse effects are reviewed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3944.html" rel="external">"Intravenous immune globulin: Adverse effects"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h1">ADMINISTRATION AND DOSING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the United States, intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) is usually administered in an infusion center or health care facility. It may also be infused in the home setting, usually by a trained home infusion provider. Home infusion may be more cost effective and has been shown to result in improved quality-of-life measures [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Subcutaneous immune globulin (SCIG) is most often self-administered in the home setting by the patient or given to a child by a parent/caregiver once training in the appropriate techniques has been accomplished. A third option is facilitated SCIG (fSCIG), in which SCIG is administered along with hyaluronidase that allows for the absorption of a larger dose of SCIG into a single subcutaneous infusion site [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].

The liquid preparations come in several vial or prefilled syringe sizes, as do the lyophilized powdered forms (to a lesser degree).

Therefore, it is prudent to consult with the pharmacist preparing the immune globulin and determine how much rounding is necessary to avoid waste.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">As an example, if a patient weighing 52 kg is prescribed 400 mg/kg of a 10% liquid preparation of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">IVIG</a>, then the amount of drug required would be (0.4 grams/kg) x (52 kg) x (100 mL/10 grams) = 208 mL. Since the smallest vial of most products contains 10 mL, the dose can be rounded up to 210 mL to avoid wasting the 2 mL. If the pharmacy does not have the 10 mL bottle, then the dose could be rounded down to 200 mL.

Alternatively, 100 to 200 mg/kg, given on four to five consecutive days, could be used as a loading dose, and this approach may have fewer or milder systemic adverse effects. The latter approach is often better tolerated by patients with active infection or those with frail physiology (eg, a neonate, a patient on fluid restriction, those with kidney or cardiac disease). Subcutaneous loading can be accomplished by administering 100 to 200 mg/kg daily for five days, although this manner of use is not specifically approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

An example would be starting an infusion at 0.5 mL/kg/hour and increasing by 0.5 mL/kg/hour every 15 minutes until a final infusion rate is achieved.

In a 2003 survey by the Immune Deficiency Foundation (which was subsequently repeated in a separate survey), 68 percent of patients reported that they could "feel their IVIG wearing off" before their next infusion was due. Many clinicians consider this an indication to shorten that interval to every three or even every two weeks in a stepwise fashion. Intravenous dosing intervals shorter than two weeks are not usually necessary. SCIG should be considered if shorter dosing intervals are desired.

Periodic measurement of trough levels will ensure that complications of the primary disease causing protein loss have not occurred to a degree where they affect IgG retention. For those receiving treatment at home, monitoring assures adequate adherence to prescribed regimens. In addition, the dose can be adjusted regularly in growing children in order to maintain a consistent trough level in the face of increasing body mass.</p><p>There is no single target trough level that correlates to protection from infection in all patients. One set of guidelines in the United States recommends 500 mg/dL as a minimally acceptable trough level [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], while another suggests that higher trough levels at 800 mg/dL is associated with better outcomes.

However, some patients appear to derive clinical benefit from IVIG only at trough levels considerably above 800 mg/dL (occasionally above 1000 mg/dL). The data supporting this were evaluated in aggregate in a meta-analysis [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. In a subsequent meta-analysis, higher IgG trough levels progressively reduced the rate of infections, up to a ceiling of 960 mg/dL, beyond which there may be less additional benefit [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].

Some patients demonstrate a threshold level, above which the incidence of infections dramatically decreases. In some patients with chronic infections, the optimal dose of IgG replacement can also be assessed by following the white blood cell count and/or laboratory indicators of infection and/or inflammation, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and/or the C-reactive protein.</p><p>If a patient is continuing to get infections, it is prudent to determine if the patient is still adherent to other therapies before increasing the dose or shortening the infusion interval of the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a>. For example, patients with asthma or chronic rhinosinusitis who are continuing to get pulmonary or sinus infections should be asked if they are still taking their inhaled or topical nasal glucocorticoid. Sometimes patients will begin to feel better after starting immune globulin and may not be as consistent with concomitant therapies or assume those therapies are no longer needed.

This has been hypothesized to represent a feature of subphysiologic IgG levels or subphysiologic levels of specific IgG that may result in increased susceptibility to subclinical or clinical infections. In some but not all cases, this can be ameliorated by the addition of adjunct prophylactic antibiotics [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Patients who are bothered by these symptoms may benefit from increasing the dose slightly or shortening the infusion interval (changing both dose and interval simultaneously is discouraged) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Alternatively, the patient could be changed to subcutaneous administration as wear-off effects are rarely seen with SCIG.

The total IgG level may be similarly unhelpful in cases in which antibody deficiency coexists with monoclonal gammopathy or polyclonal B cell activation, such as may occur in systemic lupus erythematosus and Epstein-Barr virus-induced lymphoproliferative disease. Thus, patients should be monitored to determine the dose that successfully reduces the incidence and severity of infections for that individual [<a href="#rid9">9,31</a>].

Early exposure to maternal IgG is believed to influence the developing immune system of the fetus, and the impact of maternal immunoglobulin deficiency on the fetus in the absence of replacement therapy has not been thoroughly studied. In addition, the presence of normal immunoglobulin levels protects the mother through pregnancy and the peripartum period and provides protective antibody for the newborn. Protection of the newborn is important because adequate IgG production in the baby is not usually achieved until six months of age. Since most of the IgG present in the newborn is transferred transplacentally during the third trimester, preterm babies may have very low IgG levels, putting them at increased risk of infection.
