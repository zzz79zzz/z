         Respiratory distress immediately after birth is common and is typically caused by abnormal respiratory function during the transition from fetal to neonatal life. It is manifested by tachypnea, nasal flaring, intercostal or subcostal retractions, audible grunting, and cyanosis. Neonatal respiratory distress may be transient; however, persistent distress requires a rational diagnostic and therapeutic approach to optimize outcome and minimize morbidity.

         Although most neonates successfully transition between intrauterine and extrauterine life, approximately 10 percent will have difficulty and require resuscitative efforts at birth. This difficulty may be a consequence of impaired lung function due to fluid retention, airway obstruction associated with congenital anomalies, persistent pulmonary hypertension, or apnea associated with lack of respiratory effort.

         TTN is caused by failure of adequate lung fluid clearance at birth, resulting in excess lung liquid. The liquid fills the air spaces and moves into the extra-alveolar interstitium, where it pools in perivascular tissues and interlobar fissures until it is cleared by the lymphatic or vascular circulation. (See

         Activation of amiloride-sensitive sodium channels, which increases sodium reabsorption, thereby creating an osmotic gradient for water uptake across the pulmonary epithelium [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The ability to reabsorb sodium appears relatively late in fetal life. Low pulmonary expression or activity of airway epithelial sodium channels may delay lung fluid clearance, especially in preterm infants [

         Lung inflation that generates a transepithelial hydrostatic pressure gradient, which promotes fluid movement of liquid from the airway. This is consistent with the finding that positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) facilitates airway liquid clearance and lung aeration in animal models mechanically ventilated from birth [

         The excess lung water in TTN causes decreased pulmonary compliance, and possibly increased airway resistance due to extrinsic compression of small airways by fluid in the extra-alveolar interstitium.

         </span>
         RDS is caused by deficiency of surfactant, the phospholipid mixture (predominantly desaturated palmitoyl phosphatidyl choline) that reduces alveolar surface tension, which decreases the pressure needed to keep the alveoli inflated, and maintains alveolar stability. When surfactant is deficient, the infant may not be able to generate the increased inspiratory pressure needed to inflate alveolar units, resulting in the development of progressive and diffuse atelectasis. Surfactant deficiency also leads to an inability to maintain open alveoli at low lung volume, for example, during end expiration [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Diffuse atelectasis leads to low compliance and low functional residual capacity. Hypoxemia results primarily from mismatching of ventilation and perfusion as blood bypasses atelectatic air spaces (intrapulmonary shunting). Right-to-left shunting that occurs through the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale, because of increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), also contributes to decreased oxygenation. Hypoxemia is often accompanied by respiratory and/or metabolic acidosis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5055.html" rel="external">
          "Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in the newborn: Clinical features and diagnosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although surfactant deficiency plays the major etiologic role for neonatal RDS, the inability to clear lung fluid from air spaces may also contribute to RDS in the preterm infant [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. In addition, data from a twin cohort study demonstrate a significant genetic susceptibility to RDS, although the underlying genetic component(s) remains to be elucidated [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>

         </span>
         PPHN is caused by the abnormal persistence of elevated PVR that leads to right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood through the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus, resulting in hypoxemia.
        </p>
        <p>
         The normal transition from fetal life must include a dramatic decrease in PVR. This is mediated by mechanical factors that result in the opening of air spaces and improved oxygenation and decrease pulmonary vasoconstriction. The balance of vascular mediators (ie, endothelin and nitric oxide, which induce vasoconstriction and vasorelaxation, respectively) also plays a key role in changing pulmonary vascular tone.
        </p>
        <p>
         It has been proposed that PPHN is caused by a combination of underdevelopment, maldevelopment, or maladaptation of the pulmonary vascular bed. PPHN is also often associated with nonacute conditions due to a structural abnormality (eg, congenital diaphragmatic hernia) or chronic in utero stress (eg, meconium aspiration syndrome). These concurrent findings suggest that a structural etiology (eg, increased musculature of pulmonary vessels), rather than simply a functional change in pulmonary vascular reactivity at birth, contributes to PPHN in many cases.

         TTN is most frequently seen in late preterm infants born at a gestational age between 34 and 37 weeks, many of whom are delivered by elective caesarean section [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Term and postterm babies are also at risk for TTN.
        </p>
        <p>
         The onset of TTN usually occurs within two hours after delivery. Tachypnea (respiratory rate ≥60 breaths per minute) is the most prominent feature. Affected infants also may have increased work of breathing manifested by nasal flaring, mild intercostal and subcostal retractions, and expiratory grunting (the sound produced by expiration through partially closed vocal cords). These signs of respiratory distress are generally mild and often resolve more quickly than tachypnea. Cyanosis may be present and is usually corrected with low concentrations of supplemental oxygen. Respiratory acidosis, if present, is mild. While TTN frequently resolves within 24 hours, a persistent course of up to 72 hours is not uncommon. (See

         Infants with RDS are nearly always preterm. Respiratory distress (ie, tachypnea and labored breathing) and cyanosis occur at or soon after birth. Typical signs include grunting (which prevents end-expiratory alveolar collapse), nasal flaring (which reduces nasal resistance and reflects increased use of accessory muscles of respiration), and intercostal and subcostal retractions (due to decreased lung compliance and the highly compliant chest wall).

         PPHN usually affects term infants, although it can occur in late preterm or postterm infants. PPHN is usually associated with an underlying respiratory or systemic condition (eg, meconium aspiration, sepsis, pneumonia, perinatal asphyxia, congenital diaphragmatic hernia) though 15 to 20 percent of cases are idiopathic.

         TTN is a frequent cause of respiratory distress in term and late preterm neonates after cesarean delivery without labor, because of the failure to initiate the normal physiologic mechanisms that contribute to lung fluid clearance. (See

         Infants born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid and those who have perinatal depression are at increased risk for PPHN. PPHN also is more likely in infants with a history of bacterial infection, poor intrauterine growth, and nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns, suggesting poor placental function and chronic fetal hypoxemia. Although the presence of respiratory distress and precipitating factor(s) are clinical findings that help distinguish PPHN from structural cyanotic heart disease in term infants with severe cyanosis, the diagnosis should be confirmed by echocardiography.

         Because early-onset sepsis is an important cause of respiratory distress in the newborn, all neonates with significant respiratory distress and/or hypoxemia should undergo evaluation for neonatal sepsis and should receive empiric antibiotics pending culture results.

          Transitional disorders
         </strong>
         – Three common causes of respiratory distress in newborns are transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN).

         <strong>
          TTN
         </strong>
         is typically seen in late preterm infants, although term and postterm infants are also at risk. It is caused by inadequate lung fluid clearance at birth that results in excess lung fluid, which leads to decreased pulmonary compliance and possibly increased airway resistance. TTN is characterized by the onset of tachypnea usually within two hours after delivery. Symptoms generally resolve after 12 to 24 hours but may persist as long as 72 hours in severe cases. The chest radiograph typically exhibits bilateral perihilar linear streaking  (

         <strong>
          RDS
         </strong>
         typically occurs in preterm infants, and its incidence increases with decreasing gestational age. It is caused by surfactant deficiency that leads to alveolar collapse and diffuse atelectasis. Respiratory distress and cyanosis occur at or soon after birth. The chest radiograph is characterized by low lung volumes and the classical findings of a diffuse, reticulogranular, ground glass appearance with air bronchograms  (

         <strong>
          PPHN
         </strong>
         usually occurs in term infants, although it may also present in late preterm or postterm infants. It is caused by the abnormal persistence of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) that leads to right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood through the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus, resulting in hypoxemia. PPHN is usually associated with an underlying respiratory or systemic condition (eg, meconium aspiration syndrome [MAS], sepsis, pneumonia, perinatal asphyxia, congenital diaphragmatic hernia [CDH]) though 15 to 20 percent of cases are idiopathic. Neonates with PPHN typically present within the first 24 hours after birth with signs of respiratory distress (eg, tachypnea, retractions, and grunting) and cyanosis. Differential pre- and postductal oxygen saturation is a common finding. Echocardiography is required to confirm the diagnosis of PPHN and differentiate it from structural cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD). (See
