The data from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) Fourth Task Force Report are based on ausculatory measurements, whereas the data presented previously are obtained by oscillometric measurements. Because accurate measurement of BP by auscultation in young infants is often difficult, initial BP measurement in this age group is typically performed by oscillometric devices. If using the NHBPEP Fourth Task Force Report tables to determine the BP percentile, one needs to verify the BP by auscultation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6087.html" rel="external">"Definition and diagnosis of hypertension in children and adolescents", section on 'Oscillometric devices'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Appropriately sized BP cuff</strong> ‒ Using the appropriately sized arm cuff is vital for accurate BP measurement. The appropriate size is a cuff with an inflatable bladder width that is approximately 50 percent of the arm circumference at a point midway between the olecranon and the acromion [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], and the bladder length should cover 80 to 100 percent of the circumference of the arm. If the choice is between a cuff that is too small or one that is too large, use of the larger cuff will result in less error. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6087.html" rel="external">"Definition and diagnosis of hypertension in children and adolescents", section on 'Cuff size and placement'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sleeping versus awake measurement</strong> ‒ BP measured while the infant is sleeping may be lower than awake BP [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. In a study in infants between the ages of five to nine weeks, the mean systolic BP was approximately 6 mmHg higher in awake infants compared with those who were asleep (96±11 versus 89±11 mmHg) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].

However, it is challenging to make the diagnosis of hypertension in infants because of the lack of robust normative data and because BP is not routinely measured. As a result, BP measurement should be obtained in patients in whom there is a high index of suspicion for hypertension. (See <a class="local">'When should blood pressure be measured'</a> above.)</p><p>The diagnosis of childhood hypertension is made when repeat blood pressure (BP) values on <strong>three </strong>separate occasions are greater than the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for the age, sex, and height of the patient [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Because there are no normative data to determine the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for BP for infants below one year of age, normative data for one-year-old children is used to help define infantile hypertension. In addition, we diagnosis hypertension on &lt;3 measurements for those infants with a high BP and in the presence of a risk factor or if there is associated clinical findings. (See <a class="local">'Normal blood pressure'</a> above.)</p><p>In our practice, we use the following clinical threshold to diagnosis and treat hypertension based normative data for one-year-old children from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) Task Force [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Etiology'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5001.html" rel="external">"Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of neonatal hypertension", section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>The assessment includes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>History</strong> ‒ A focused history that reviews perinatal exposures (eg, maternal use of prescribed and illicit drugs, history of perinatal asphyxia), neonatal course (eg, umbilical arterial catheterization), presence or family history of congenital kidney or urinary tract anomalies, or concurrent conditions associated with hypertension (eg, bronchopulmonary dysplasia).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Physical examination</strong> ‒ Physical examination must include four-limb blood pressure (BP) measurement and palpation of femoral pulses to rule out the possibility of coarctation of the aorta. Other findings that may explain the cause of hypertension include presence of dysmorphic features (eg, Williams syndrome), birth marks (eg, café au lait spots), ambiguous genitalia (eg, congenital adrenal hyperplasia), bulging and tense anterior fontanel, palpable kidneys, or any other abdominal masses, cardiac murmurs, heart failure (gallop rhythm and hepatomegaly), or abdominal bruit.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Laboratory evaluation</strong> ‒ Initial laboratory evaluation includes urinalysis, complete blood count, and measurement of serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, electrolytes, and calcium. Further testing is guided by the initial evaluation and individualized for each patient. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6088.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of hypertension in children and adolescents", section on 'Further evaluation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Additional tests</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Echocardiography is performed to determine whether there is left ventricular hypertrophy as evidence of end-organ involvement and to diagnose coarctation of the aorta, if present.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Kidney ultrasound examination and Doppler flow study for kidney/renovascular pathology.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Selected cases may need additional investigations such as urine catecholamines, renal angiography or serum renin, aldosterone, cortisol levels, or thyroid function tests.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3065819338"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/z/d/html/109575.html" rel="external">"Society guideline links: Hypertension in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3754418"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Definition </strong>‒ As is true in older children, hypertension in infants is defined as either systolic or diastolic BP that is ≥95<sup>th</sup> normative BP percentile measured upon three or more separate occasions. However, hypertension is uncommon in infants, and blood pressure (BP) is not routinely measured in infants and young children beyond the neonatal period. As a result, there is limited information on normal BP in infants less than one year of age. Currently available literature suggests that normative data from one-year-old children can be used to help guide BP management in younger infants. (See <a class="local">'Normal blood pressure'</a> above and <a class="local">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Etiology</strong> ‒ The causes of hypertension in infants between one month and one year of age are similar to those seen in patients with neonatal hypertension. In addition, many of these patients develop hypertension because of neonatal complications, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, renovascular injury due to umbilical artery catheterization, renal vein thrombosis, and neurologic sequelae (eg, intraventricular hemorrhage). Other causes of infantile hypertension include congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), endocrine disorders (eg, congenital adrenal hyperplasia and hyperthyroidism), medications, and coarctation of the aorta. (See <a class="local">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications for BP measurement</strong> ‒ Because the incidence of hypertension is low in children less than three years of age, routine BP monitoring is not recommended unless the patient is at risk for hypertension. Infants at risk for hypertension include those with complications that required admission to a neonatal intensive care unit, congenital heart disease, CAKUT, and other illnesses and conditions associated with hypertension. (See <a class="local">'When should blood pressure be measured'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Blood pressure measurement</strong> ‒ BP measurement in infants should be performed in a standardized approach that routinely measures BP in the same extremity and position, using an appropriate size BP cuff in a quietly awake or sleeping infant. (See <a class="local">'Blood pressure measurement'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis </strong>‒ The diagnosis of hypertension is typically made by comparing BP with normative BP values. However, it is challenging to make the diagnosis of hypertension in infants because of the lack of robust normative data and because BP is not routinely measured in healthy infants. In our practice, BP measurement is performed for infants who are at risk for elevated BP and the diagnosis of hypertension is made when repeat BP measurement on three separate occasions exceeds the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for BP for one-year-old children. In addition, hypertension is diagnosed based on fewer BP measurements for infants with significantly elevated BP or if there are additional risk factors. We use the following BP threshold based on currently available data. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For infants with an oscillometric awake BP of &gt;100/60, management consists of confirmation with manual reading and monitor with manual BP measurements at follow-up visits. An evaluation for an underlying cause is initiated for confirmed manually measured BP of &gt;110/70.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Treatment is generally initiated for manually measured BP persistently ≥110/70, or sooner if patient is symptomatic or left ventricular hypertrophy is present.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation </strong>‒ Once it has been determined that the infant is hypertensive, an evaluation is performed to identify the cause of hypertension, treat any curable cause, and determine the extent of target organ damage. Because the causes of hypertension in this age group are often due to perinatal events, the evaluation is similar to that performed for neonatal hypertension.
