Families may seek to adopt because of infertility, fetal loss, death of a child, desire for more children, or simply to provide a home to a child in need of a home. Pediatric health care providers may provide preadoption counseling to prospective adoptive parents, evaluate children after adoption, and/or provide ongoing care to adoptees.</p><p>This topic provides a general overview of adoption within the United States and describes the potential role of the primary care provider as an advocate for adopted children and their families. The recommendations below are largely consistent with those of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Early Childhood and Council on Foster Care, Adoption, and Kinship Care [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Specific infectious disease and immunization considerations in children adopted from outside the United States are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16709.html" rel="external">"International adoption: Infectious disease aspects"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89453.html" rel="external">"International adoption: Immunization considerations"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16119100"><span class="h2">General terms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>General terms that are used commonly in adoption are defined below [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adoption – A legal (formal) mechanism that allows full family membership and privileges to children who were not born into the family [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Informal adoption occurs when the birth mother allows another person to take parental responsibility for her child without obtaining legal approval or recognition of that relationship.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Birth parent or biologic parent – The individuals who conceived the child; referring to these individuals as the "real" or "natural" parents should be avoided.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adoptive parent(s) – The individual(s) rearing the child.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adoption constellation – Birth parents, adoptive parents, the adopted child, siblings, extended family members, and adoption professionals.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adoption plan – An arrangement made by a birth parent to relinquish parental rights, via a legal process, to another individual; referring to the adoption plan as "giving up" the child should be avoided [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Kinship adoption – Adoption by a biologic relative of the child.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Referral – The time in the adoption process when the prospective family is given information concerning a prospective adopted child.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Finalization – Completion of the legal process that transfers parental rights to the adoptive parents; it generally occurs two to six months after the child has been placed with the adoptive parent(s).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dissolution – The legal process of severing the relationship between the adoptive parents and the adopted child after the adoption has been finalized; dissolution may be voluntary or involuntary.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Disruption – An adoption that is terminated before it is legally finalized; disruption often occurs after the child is placed in the adoptive home, which requires a new placement plan for the child.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adoption medical specialist – A pediatric health care provider who has special interest and expertise in medical issues associated with adoption. An adoption medical specialist can provide preadoption consultation, travel support, postadoption screening, and/or ongoing primary care [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H354386891"><span class="h2">Confidentiality</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Regulation of confidentiality in adoption seeks to balance the privacy and anonymity of biologic parents with the "right-to-know" interest of the adopted child. Statutes regarding confidentiality vary from state to state; information regarding the statutes in particular states is available through the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.childwelfare.gov%2Ftopics%2Fsystemwide%2Flaws-policies%2Fstatutes%2Finfoaccessap%2F&amp;token=jMDGfzmICBapOfDOj34x1n6Z9L90INW%2F8fVSJEr4nMatu4cSUHj1Fvbt4TzXPgaL1rlYCjl%2BSTM0O4BEtDXg1EnIl34HCzjmMxcYg3klGBw%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=2854" target="_blank">Child Welfare Information Gateway</a>. There are four general approaches:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Confidential records</strong> – The original birth certificate and adoption records are kept sealed by the courts and can be inspected only with court approval. This approach is used in a small and declining number of states.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Open records</strong> – Adopted adults are given access to their adoption records or original birth certificate upon request and with no restrictions. This is the policy in an increasing number of states.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The American Academy of Pediatrics endorses the National Adoption Center's policy supporting provision of both the original and amended birth certificate to the adoptive family at the time of adoption (unless specifically denied by the birth parent[s]) and of granting the adopted person access to the original birth certificate at age 18 years [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Search and consent</strong> – An adoption agency or other intermediary investigates the location of one party at the request of another party who would like identifying information. The adopted person may petition the court to open the records if the biologic parent does not consent to release of the identifying information. This approach is used in approximately one-half of states.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mutual consent</strong> – In mutual-consent voluntary adoption registries, information is maintained in a central file where adopted adults, biologic parents, and, in some cases, adoptive parents register their names to give consent to release identifying information if it is requested by one of the other parties. Identifying information can be released only if all parties agree.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Types of adoption</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Agency adoption</strong> – Adoption services traditionally are provided by licensed public or private agencies that offer services to birth parents, adoptive parents, and children who need families.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Agencies work with prospective adoptive families to assess whether adoption is appropriate. A home study is conducted to educate families about adoption and to determine their suitability to adopt [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The home study includes information regarding the adoptive parents' motivation for adoption, financial status, religious beliefs, employment, education, relationship stability, childrearing practices, and housing. The adoptive parents must provide copies of birth and marriage certificates, financial statements, letters of recommendation, and reports of physical and mental health from a health care provider. They also must undergo a criminal background check.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In addition to performing the home study, agencies share medical and social information with the adoptive families and provide services to various members of the adoption constellation through the adjustment period and beyond [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Agencies may have a consulting clinician available to offer advice if children manifest physical, emotional, or developmental problems. In addition, the agency can receive and relay new medical information from the birth parents to the adoptive parents (eg, regarding inherited disease).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Independent adoption</strong> – Adoptions can be arranged privately through clinicians, attorneys, or other facilitators [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Approximately 65 percent of states allow facilitators to work with prospective adoptive parents to find an expectant birth mother.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Subsidized adoption</strong> – In subsidized adoption, also called adoption assistance, adoptive families receive financial support (eg, monthly cash payments and Medicaid coverage) from the federal and state governments to assist in caring for an adopted child with special health care needs [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Support may include access to medical care, counseling/therapy, special equipment, and tutoring services [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Subsidized adoption has facilitated the adoption of children with special needs, whose medical and special educational expenses might otherwise deter an adoptive family. Most families that adopt children from foster care receive adoption subsidies.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Open adoption</strong> – Openness in adoption refers to an agreement between the birth and adoptive parents to maintain some amount of communication. The degree of openness varies and usually is agreed upon by all of the involved parties, including the adoption agency and the adopted child if they are of appropriate age. Approximately 68 percent of domestic adoptions are open adoptions [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Openness arrangements vary and can change over time based upon the wishes of the birth and adoptive families. (See <a class="local">'Confidentiality'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Most adoption professionals believe that adoptive families should have information about the health of their adopted child's birth relatives. Some degree of ongoing openness is helpful if birth relatives develop medical conditions after the child's placement [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Legal-risk placement</strong> – In legal-risk placement, the child is placed in foster care with caregivers who are interested in adopting the child if reunification with the birth parents is not possible [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The legal adoption of the child cannot be guaranteed to the foster parents because of the continuing rights of the birth parents. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/596.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology of foster care placement and overview of the foster care system in the United States", section on 'Birth parents'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Approximately 120,000 children are waiting to be adopted in the United States each year and approximately 60,000 are adopted with public health agency involvement [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Among children adopted with public health agency involvement, approximately one-half are adopted by a foster parent and one-third by a relative.</p><p>Trends in adoption include increasing numbers of transracial, same-sex-parents, and single-parent adoptions and increasing numbers of adoption of children with special health care needs, as well as increasing openness in adoption [<a href="#rid2">2,12</a>]. These trends result from the shortage of healthy newborns available for placement, cultural changes, and increasing attempts to find permanent families for children with special health care needs in foster care.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Trends in domestic adoption</strong> – Most domestic adoptions occur through the national public welfare system (ie, foster care) or through independent agencies [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Public welfare adoptions</strong> – The numbers of children adopted from the foster care system increased between 2016 and 2019 (from approximately 55,500 to approximately 66,000), but declined in 2020 (to approximately 58,000) [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. In fiscal year 2020, the mean age of children adopted from foster care was 6.5 years.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Between 25 and 30 percent of the children in foster care in the United States are eligible for adoption [<a href="#rid11">11,13</a>]. Among those who were adopted in 2020, 54 percent were adopted by foster parents, 35 percent by relatives, and 11 percent by nonrelatives [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. However, many of the children in the foster care system who are available for adoption are difficult to place in permanent homes because of certain characteristics (eg, older children; children with physical, mental, or emotional problems; and children who are part of a sibling group) [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/588.html" rel="external">"Comprehensive health care for children in foster care"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Other types of adoption</strong> – In 2012, approximately 49 percent of all United States adoptions were from sources other than foster care or intercountry [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. These included private agencies, tribes, and step-parent or other forms of kinship care. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Trends in adoption of children with special health care needs</strong> – Adoptions of children with special health care needs has increased since the mid-1990s. Many adopted children have complex medical, developmental, behavioral, educational, and psychological challenges [<a href="#rid17">17-20</a>]. The special health care needs often are identified and managed before adoption but may not be apparent until months or years after adoption. (See <a class="local">'Children with special health care needs'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Trends in international adoption </strong>– Trends in international adoption are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16709.html" rel="external">"International adoption: Infectious disease aspects", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2532218996"><span class="h1">MEDICAL EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h2">Preadoption</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preadoption visit information gathering</strong> – Before adoption, pediatric health care providers may be asked to review the prospective adoptive child's health information. Prospective adoptive families generally seek information about potential long-term care needs, prognosis for specific medical problems, and availability of community resources. Clinicians who lack expertise in preadoption evaluation may refer families to an adoption medical specialist.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Families should obtain as much information as possible about their prospective child before the preadoption evaluation; the clinician (or clinician's office personnel) can advise the family regarding the type of information necessary to assess the child's health. Although most referrals are incomplete, it is useful to obtain the following information about the child and the birth family [<a href="#rid1">1,2,4</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Health history of birth parents, siblings, and extended family of origin members – Ages, medical issues, developmental or cognitive delays, mental health conditions or diagnoses, history of smoking, alcohol or drug use, genetic conditions, medications.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Social history of birth parents, siblings, and extended family of origin members – Educational attainment, history of incarcerations, domestic violence, previous foster care placement, religious preferences, etc.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Circumstances of the adoption – Why was the child placed for adoption?

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14381.html" rel="external">"Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Child's current medical and social issues, strengths, special interests, and abilities.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preadoption visit</strong> – During the preadoption evaluation, the clinician should review all available medical records; determine whether additional information should be sought by the family; discuss the medical, developmental, and behavioral issues that can be anticipated for the child based upon the information that is available; and provide guidance regarding the timing of the first appointment for the adopted child. Options for feeding adopted newborns should be discussed so that adoptive mothers who wish to breastfeed can be referred to a lactation consultant and have adequate time to prepare for induced lactation [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The clinician also may discuss the upcoming transitions for the adoptive family and the child. Adoptive parents should be encouraged to educate themselves about ways they can ease the adjustment for everyone and set realistic expectations for the changes to their family.

(See <a class="local">'Resources'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Adoptive parents may expect the guarantee of a "healthy child," request unnecessary tests, or expect the pediatric health care provider to provide unrealistic predictions. Such requests require thoughtful responses and appropriate anticipatory guidance. The role of the pediatric health care provider is not to judge the advisability of a proposed adoption but to clearly and realistically apprise the prospective adoptive parents of any physical or mental health needs detected now or anticipated in the future [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Pediatric health care providers should define and explain the risks to the family so that potential problems can be anticipated and addressed appropriately. The pediatric health care provider can also assist with making sure that the proper social support systems are in place to help the family cope with externalizing behaviors or other adjustment issues as they arise. (See <a class="local">'Early adjustment issues'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3098661938"><span class="h2">Postadoption</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3840411290"><span class="h3">Medical evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial medical evaluation of an adopted child should be a comprehensive assessment of medical, developmental, and psychosocial issues. The timing of the first postadoption visit is determined by the age of the child and the circumstances related to the adoption.

Children of all ages must feel safe in their new environment. They need time to create a trusting bond with their caregivers. Adoption agencies often encourage a period of "cocooning," during which the family remains within the home to promote bonding. However, a cocooning period may not be realistic for many families, as adoptive parents have to tend to other children or need to return to work and rely on other adults to help provide childcare. Clinicians can help adoptive parents recognize, understand, and respond to their newly adopted child's adjustment issues. Recognizing and addressing differences in culture (eg, religious preference, race, ethnicity) can play an important role in early adjustment.</p><p>Some adoptive parents describe a "honeymoon" period, during which the child is compliant and seemingly quite happy. Others describe children who are withdrawn, hypervigilant, easily overstimulated, aggressive, or defiant. Any of these observations can be typical transitional behaviors and often worrisome to adoptive parents, who may not have anticipated the behaviors or may have concerns that they will persist.</p><p>Some children struggle with sleep issues or regulation of their eating patterns. These behaviors can be best understood by considering the child's circumstances before adoption: Was the sleep environment safe? Was the child potentially always hungry or never learned to recognize satiety?</p><p>At some point, most children will enter a period of "testing," during which their behavior suggests that they are seeking information about the permanency of their new home environment. Adoptive parents should be patient and reassuring and, at the same time, provide appropriate structure and consistency in their messaging and discipline.

(See <a class="local">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preadoption visit</strong> – The preadoption visit allows pediatric health care providers to review available information about the prospective adopted child, apprise the prospective adoptive parents of any current or anticipated special health needs, and help prepare the adoptive family for the upcoming transitions. (See <a class="local">'Preadoption'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial postadoption visit</strong> – The initial postadoption visit should include a comprehensive assessment of medical, developmental, and psychosocial issues. The health care provider also should educate the adoptive family about the physical, nutritional, safety, developmental, social, and emotional needs of their child. (See <a class="local">'Postadoption'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Early adjustment issues – Newly adopted children undergo an adjustment period before they can create a trusting bond with their adoptive families. Clinicians can help adoptive parents recognize, understand, and respond to their child's adjustment issues. (See <a class="local">'Early adjustment issues'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Other mental health issues – Screening older infants and children who have been adopted for behavioral and mental health problems is recommended. The adoptive parents should be counseled regarding the special needs of adopted children related to the adverse life experiences that may have influenced the adoption placement. (See <a class="local">'Other mental health issues'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications for referral</strong> – For families who adopt children with special health care needs, referrals for counseling, support groups, special education services, and financial aid should be provided as necessary. (See <a class="local">'Children with special health care needs'</a> above and <a class="local">'Indications for referral'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Developmental stages of adoption</strong> – Adoption is a lifelong process; particular questions, concerns, and emotional issues related to adoption emerge for the adopted child and adoptive parents at various developmental stages or at the time of "anniversaries." Pediatric health care providers can help the families anticipate and prepare for these specific adoption-related issues. (See <a class="local">'Developmental stages of adoption'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Communicating about adoption</strong> – Open discussion of adoption is encouraged. Developmentally appropriate information should be provided to the child with love and respect in an open, matter-of-fact manner  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109541" href="/d/graphic/109541.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). The information may need to be repeated and modified depending upon the child's emotional reaction. (See <a class="local">'Communicating about adoption'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Resources</strong> – Pediatric health care providers should be familiar with local support groups and referral resources that address adoption issues  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65533" href="/d/graphic/65533.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).
