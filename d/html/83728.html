         Hypersensitivity reactions, or allergic reactions, are immunologic reactions to a drug. There are several types of hypersensitivity reactions, which are broadly divided into immediate and delayed reactions based on the time between administration and the appearance of signs or symptoms [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Immediate reactions begin within one hour of the first administered dose, and delayed reactions begin later than one hour (and sometimes days) after the first dose. The intent of this classification system is to distinguish immediate reactions from other types since immediate reactions are more likely to progress to potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis if the patient is reexposed to the causative drug. Unfortunately, patients often do not recall the chronology of drug reactions, and thus, it is often not possible to classify reactions based on timing alone. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2079.html" rel="external">

         These two types of fluoroquinolone-induced hypersensitivity reactions are relatively common, and, in some studies, the incidence of fluoroquinolone-related anaphylaxis is comparable with that due to beta-lactams [

          2,3

         A variety of other uncommon hypersensitivity reactions have been attributed to fluoroquinolones, including fixed drug eruptions, drug fever, vasculitis, serum sickness-like syndromes, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms/drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DRESS/DiHS), symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-9
         </a>
         ]. There is no diagnostic testing for these types of reactions, and avoidance of the causative drug is uniformly recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
         SJS and TEN are severe and potentially life threatening, and any future reexposure, which can result in recurrence, is contraindicated, except in extreme circumstances. (See

         Evaluation of the patient with a past drug reaction always begins with a careful clinical history and an assessment of the type of hypersensitivity reaction the patient most likely experienced. Important questions for the patient with drug allergy are reviewed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2079.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         A thorough history of the reaction is essential since many patients labeled as allergic to fluoroquinolones actually experienced nonallergic adverse reactions, such as tendon inflammation or damage, myalgias, neurologic side effects, or gastrointestinal symptoms. In some cases, such patients should continue to avoid the causative drug, but they are not candidates for allergy evaluation. Nonallergic adverse effects of fluoroquinolones are reviewed separately.

         </span>
         The term "multiple drug allergy syndrome" is applied to patients who report hypersensitivity reactions to two or more classes of medications. A subset of these patients reacts only to antibiotics. Typically, such patients have reacted to commonly used antibiotics, such as penicillins, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides and have limited antibiotic options remaining to treat infections. Evaluation of one or more of these antibiotics to determine whether the same or related drugs are actually tolerated can be very helpful in avoiding the use of expensive broad-spectrum antibiotics and in reducing anxiety on the part of the patient and providers. In such individuals, the management goal is the identification of two or more classes of antibiotics that the patient can safely receive, focusing on those that are most clinically useful.

         Referral to an allergy expert with experience in evaluation of drug-allergic reactions is appropriate in any of the following situations:

         The patient experienced a life-threatening reaction to a fluoroquinolone and requires advice about how best to prevent reexposure and whether related antibiotics can be safely administered.

         <span class="glyph">

         The patient has a high likelihood of needing future treatment with a problematic drug due to the nature of their underlying medical problems (eg, fluoroquinolones in chronic urologic problems).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         A careful clinical history can avoid unnecessary referrals. Many patients labeled as allergic to fluoroquinolones experienced nonallergic adverse reactions, such as tendon inflammation or damage, myalgias, neurologic side effects, or gastrointestinal symptoms. In some cases, such patients with adverse reactions should continue to avoid the causative drug, but they are not candidates for allergy evaluation. Nonallergic adverse effects of fluoroquinolones are reviewed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/490.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Immediate-type skin testing and challenge procedures are often required in the evaluation of antibiotic hypersensitivity. These procedures should be performed by allergy specialists. Although these procedures are considered safe, they are not without risk and should be performed in a setting prepared to identify and treat possible allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. In addition, any procedure that involves the deliberate exposure of a patient to a substance to which they may be allergic should be undertaken by someone with specific training in these techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unlike diagnostic tests for penicillin allergy, methods for evaluating fluoroquinolone hypersensitivity are not standardized or validated, and allergy experts may have different approaches to the use of fluoroquinolone skin testing and challenge.

         </span>
         The most common type of reaction to fluoroquinolones is a delayed-onset (defined as greater than one hour after the first administered dose) maculopapular eruption or exanthema that is nonpruritic. Such eruptions occur in 2 to 3 percent of patients treated with fluoroquinolones and are likely mediated by drug-specific T cells [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10-13
         </a>
         ]. These reactions are self-limited and generally benign and do
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         feature urticaria, angioedema, fever, systemic symptoms, involvement of the mucous membranes or other organs, or skin desquamation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Delayed exanthema may occur with any of the fluoroquinolones, although certain agents (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8760" href="/z/d/drug information/8760.html" rel="external">
          gemifloxacin

         ) have particularly high rates, and the incidence is higher with prolonged durations of therapy and possibly in females [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. As an example, the incidence of maculopapular rash in patients treated with gemifloxacin (who were receiving the drug for an infection) ranged from 1.2 percent for 5-day therapy to 7.4 percent for 14-day therapy [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Females &lt;40 years old were found to have a higher incidence of exanthema compared with other groups of patients (2.1 and 22.6 percent for 5- and 14-day therapy, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11

Interestingly, some females who initially tolerated ciprofloxacin for 10 days went on to develop a rash when treatment was repeated for another 10 days.

         Discontinuation of the culprit fluoroquinolone is the primary treatment for maculopapular exanthema. The median time to resolution of the rash is five days [

         After resolution of an exanthema to a fluoroquinolone, evaluation is appropriate, although there is a lack of consensus about the best approach. In the United States, these reactions are usually diagnosed based on the clinical history (and physical findings if the reaction is witnessed by a clinician). Photographs or detailed descriptions in the medical record are invaluable for future reference. Further evaluation is not usually performed.

         The largest study to undertake challenge of patients with history of delayed reactions to fluoroquinolones evaluated 66 patients [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17

         useful. In a study of 101 patients with fluoroquinolone allergy, 37 had delayed reactions (defined in this study as symptoms appearing greater than six hours after the last dose) [

          5
         </a>
         ]. Approximately one-half of these reactions began within 24 hours of the first dose. All 37 patients underwent patch testing, and all had negative results. Twenty-eight underwent fluoroquinolone graded challenges with the culprit drug, and two patients reacted with recurrence exanthema, both after the fourth dose. Thus, patch testing was not helpful for identifying patients at risk for this type of reaction.

         Since cross-reactivity among fluoroquinolones for delayed maculopapular reactions appears to be low [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ], it is reasonable to perform graded challenge in patients with a history of a self-limited maculopapular exanthema, with a fluoroquinolone different from the one that caused the reaction. However, it is important to understand the limitations of challenge procedures for delayed maculopapular exanthema. Many of these reactions only recur after several days of therapy, and there is no practical way to elicit such reactions without administering a full therapeutic course. This should be explained to patients.

         The author's approach to challenge in this setting is to administer 1/10
         <sup>

         </sup>
         of a full dose, wait one hour, and, if there is no adverse reaction, then administer the remaining 9/10
         <sup>
          ths
         </sup>
         of the dose and observe for an additional hour. The primary rationale for giving the initial dose under observation is to reassure the patient that the drug can be safely ingested. Otherwise, there may be continued reluctance to use it in the future. A delayed reaction may occur during the 24 hours following the initial dose, and patients should be instructed to inform the clinician if this occurs. In the study mentioned previously, 28 patients with delayed reactions were challenged, and the two who reacted developed symptoms at 15 and 20 hours after the last of the graded doses [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         After receiving a full dose under observation, patients who do not need the antibiotic at that time can simply take it normally in the future. Patients who need fluoroquinolone therapy at the time can continue the treatment for a full course.
        </p>
        <p>
         If a patient develops a mild exanthema during future courses of therapy, it may be reasonable to attempt to continue the drug and add antihistamine therapy provided that the reaction lacks any worrisome features. This approach has not been formally studied and is only appropriate when the benefit of continued treatment clearly outweighs the risk of further reaction. Such situations require clinical judgement.

         If a previous reaction to a fluoroquinolone was poorly documented, if the clinical history is uncertain, or if the reaction involved a pruritic skin component, then the possibility of an immediate reaction should be considered. (See

         Immediate reactions are characterized by symptoms that begin within one hour of the first administered dose. Immediate reactions result from activation of mast cells and basophils. Common signs and symptoms include urticaria; pruritus; flushing; angioedema of the face, extremities, or laryngeal tissues (leading to throat tightness with stridor or, rarely, asphyxiation); wheezing; nausea; abdominal cramping or diarrhea; hypotension; and/or anaphylactic shock. Fatal immediate reactions to fluoroquinolones have been reported [

         There is evidence for both immunoglobulin E (IgE) and non-IgE mechanisms for immediate reactions caused by fluoroquinolones. Animal studies have shown that fluoroquinolones at supratherapeutic doses can cause histamine release and/or generalized rash [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,20
         </a>
         ]. This nonspecific mast cell degranulation caused by fluoroquinolones has been shown to be due to interaction with the surface receptor Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 (MRGPRX2) [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Unlike IgE-mediated allergic reactions, non-IgE-mediated reactions may occur with first exposure since prior sensitization is not necessary. Apart from this difference, IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated reactions may be clinically indistinguishable, and their relative incidence is not known.

         There is some evidence that fluoroquinolone-specific IgE declines over time, implying that some patients could lose the allergy if not reexposed for a period of time. In the study (mentioned above) of 55 patients with convincing histories of immediate-type reactions to fluoroquinolones occurring 1 to 48 months prior to evaluation, 30 of the 55 had detectable drug-specific IgE by RIA [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. In those patients who had detectable drug-specific IgE, an average of 9.7 months had elapsed since the reaction compared with 15.6 months in those without detectable IgE. Also, among the 30 IgE-positive patients, those with recent reactions (defined as less than eight months prior to evaluation) had significantly higher RIA values than those with more distant reactions. Although none of the patients were challenged with fluoroquinolones to confirm allergic status, these data suggest that fluoroquinolone allergy will eventually resolve in some patients.

         Other types of tests remain investigational. Specifically, we are aware of no published studies reporting the accuracy of commercial assays for fluoroquinolone-specific IgE, and BATs and lymphocyte stimulation tests are either not widely available or have not been adequately validated.

         Evaluation for fluoroquinolone allergy is not indicated in every patient, as it may be adequate to simply avoid this class of antimicrobials altogether in some patients. The author's experience is that evaluation is most helpful in patients who report immediate reactions that were less severe than full anaphylaxis, such as pruritic rashes, urticaria, or angioedema

         We do not perform skin testing or challenge for patients with recent anaphylaxis, since skin testing is not sufficiently reliable and a challenge would pose risk to the patient. If such a patient required treatment with a fluoroquinolone antibiotic and there were no acceptable alternatives, it should be administered using rapid desensitization protocol (also known as rapid induction of drug tolerance) [

         Immediate-type skin testing with fluoroquinolones is not validated or standardized, and it may not distinguish between IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated immediate reactions, since fluoroquinolones can cause nonspecific mast cell degranulation. Further, the allergenic determinants are not known, and some may be reactive metabolites. Because of these limitations, some experts do not advocate skin testing with fluoroquinolones [

         Despite the above, it is the author's opinion that the negative predictive value of skin testing is sufficiently high that it can be clinically useful in some cases, as described in the following section. (See

         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>

         <a href="#rid5">
          5

Of 64 patients with immediate reactions, 12 were skin test positive, and 52 were negative. Six of the 12 with positive skin testing underwent fluoroquinolone graded challenges (including to the culprit drug), and three developed reactions (mostly urticarial, none of which required

         ]. It is the author's approach to advise patients with positive results to avoid all fluoroquinolones because of possible cross-reactivity among fluoroquinolones in causing immediate reactions. If the patient requires treatment with that fluoroquinolone and there are no acceptable antibiotic alternatives, it should be administered via a rapid desensitization. (See

         Graded challenge is the cautious administration of a drug to a patient who is

         to be allergic to it [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. Negative fluoroquinolone skin testing should be followed by graded challenge in order to confirm lack of allergy (or, if the challenge is positive, to demonstrate that the skin test was falsely negative). Otherwise, patients or other clinicians may misinterpret the skin test result to mean that fluoroquinolone allergy has been conclusively ruled out, which is not the case.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because of the uncertain utility of skin testing with fluoroquinolones, another option for evaluating patients with immediate reactions is to forego skin testing and perform a graded challenge with a fluoroquinolone other than the one that caused the reaction. The author's approach is to challenge with an alternate equally efficacious fluoroquinolone since cross-reactivity is approximately 50 percent based on a limited number of challenges reported in the literature [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,28,35-39
         </a>
         ]. This is a reasonable approach in patients with isolated urticaria and/or angioedema. The author does not do this in patients with anaphylaxis, although others have reported performing challenges in such patients safely [
         <a href="#rid5">

         of the full dose and includes two to four steps until the full dose is reached. The degree of caution exercised is determined by the severity of the historical reaction and the time elapsed since the reaction. For example, an outpatient graded challenge with

          levofloxacin

         for a patient with immediate urticaria in the past could be carried out under continuous supervision with 5 mg, 50 mg, and then 500 mg of levofloxacin (oral solution), each given one hour apart. The patient is observed for two hours after the final dose.

         – Evaluation of a patient with a past drug reaction always begins with a careful clinical history and an assessment of the type of hypersensitivity reaction the patient most likely experienced. Referral to an allergy expert is appropriate if the patient has experienced a serious reaction, has an underlying medical condition that will likely require fluoroquinolone therapy in the future, or reports multiple drug allergies and has limited drug options left.

          Delayed maculopapular exanthema
         </strong>
         – Fluoroquinolones cause a delayed-onset maculopapular, nonpruritic rash in 2 to 3 percent of patients. These reactions are likely mediated by drug-specific T cells. In most cases, no specific testing is useful. Cross-reactivity among the fluoroquinolones for this type of reaction appears to be low. For patients who require fluoroquinolone therapy in the future, we suggest identifying a safe alternative using a graded challenge with a fluoroquinolone, other than the one that caused the reaction (

          Grade 2C

          Rare immediate reactions
         </strong>
         – Fluoroquinolones can cause rare immediate reactions, including anaphylaxis, through both immunoglobulin E (IgE) and non-IgE-mediated mechanisms. There is evidence of cross-reactivity among fluoroquinolones in patients with immediate reactions, but no clear patterns have been distinguished. Diagnostic tests for immediate fluoroquinolone hypersensitivity are not validated or standardized, in contrast to tests for penicillin hypersensitivity. If skin testing is performed, it is critical to use nonirritating concentrations of the drugs in question since fluoroquinolones can cause irritant false-positive reactions. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Immediate reactions'

         </span>
         We suggest that patients with anaphylaxis in the recent past (ie, less than five years) empirically avoid all fluoroquinolones (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). We do not perform skin testing or challenge in such patients. If a fluoroquinolone is absolutely required in the near future, it should be administered using a desensitization protocol. (See
         <a class="local">

         Skin testing for immediate reactions is not standardized or well validated, although we find it helpful in some clinical circumstances. Skin testing and challenge procedures are most useful in patients who experienced relatively mild immediate reactions, such as pruritic rashes, urticaria, or angioedema or whose reactions occurred in the remote past (more than five years)
         <strong>
          and
