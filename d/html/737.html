         In the United States, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed non-skin cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death in women [
         <a href="#rid1">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Breast cancer is treated with a multidisciplinary approach involving surgical oncology, radiation oncology, and medical oncology, which has been associated with a reduction in breast cancer mortality [
         <a href="#rid2">

         This topic will provide an overview of the initial treatment of breast cancer and post-treatment surveillance. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, staging of breast cancer, and specific discussions of the multimodality treatments for early breast cancer and the approach to metastatic disease are discussed elsewhere.

         Because ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive breast cancer are managed differently, we will restrict discussion in this topic to invasive breast cancer. A discussion on DCIS is covered separately. (See

         The vast majority of patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer in the United States and developed countries have no evidence of metastatic disease. For these patients, the treatment approach depends on the stage at presentation. For treatment purposes, breast cancer is characterized using the Tumor, Node, Metastasis system (TNM). Where clinical guidance is provided in this topic, the anatomic staging system set forth in the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging Manual is used  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848" href="/z/d/graphic/110848.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Moreover, the AJCC recommends use of the prognostic staging system for breast cancer that incorporates biomarkers, if resources are available  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110851" href="/z/d/graphic/110851.html" rel="external">
          table 2

          table 3
         </a>
         ). This staging system is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/800.html" rel="external">
          "Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging classification for breast cancer"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Nonmetastatic breast cancer is broadly considered in two categories:

         Approximately 5 percent of patients will have simultaneous metastatic disease identified at the initial presentation (de novo stage IV breast cancer). The treatment approach to these patients is discussed separately. (See

         In general, patients with early-stage breast cancer undergo primary surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) to the breast and regional nodes with or without radiation therapy (RT)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef142348" href="/z/d/graphic/142348.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Following definitive local treatment, adjuvant systemic therapy may be offered, based on primary tumor characteristics such as tumor size, grade, number of involved lymph nodes, the status of estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors, and expression of the human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) receptor.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, some patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer (particularly those with HER2-positive or triple-negative disease) may be treated with neoadjuvant therapy first, followed by surgery. Neoadjuvant therapy is discussed below. (See

         Breast-conserving therapy (BCT) is comprised of breast-conserving surgery (BCS; ie, lumpectomy) plus RT. The goals of BCT are to provide the survival equivalent of mastectomy, a cosmetically acceptable breast, and a low rate of recurrence in the treated breast. BCT allows patients with invasive breast cancer to preserve their breast without sacrificing oncologic outcome. Successful BCT requires complete surgical removal of the tumor (with negative surgical margins) followed by moderate-dose RT to eradicate any residual disease. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/807.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Among women with operable breast cancer, randomized trials have demonstrated equivalent disease-free and overall survival between mastectomy and breast-conserving therapy [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-7
         </a>
         ]. However, since the time that these trials were conducted, progress has been made in adjuvant therapy, and more recent observational studies suggest that breast-conserving therapy is associated with at least comparable survival to mastectomy and even with improved survival in some studies [
         <a href="#rid8">

         For patients who desire BCT but are not candidates at the time of presentation, an alternative approach is the use of neoadjuvant therapy, which may allow for BCS without compromising survival outcomes. (See

         Postmastectomy radiation therapy (RT) is indicated for patients at high risk for local recurrence, such as those with cancer involving the deep margins and pathologically involved axillary lymph nodes.

        <p>
         If the likelihood of postmastectomy RT is high preoperatively, this may affect the choice of mastectomy type, the choice of the reconstructive approach, and optimal timing of the breast reconstruction (immediate versus delayed).

         Thus, preoperative coordination of care assures the best outcome. In many centers, this is accomplished by multi-disciplinary breast clinics.

         The risk for metastases to the axillary nodes is related to tumor size and location, histologic grade, and the presence of lymphatic invasion within the primary tumor. Although internal mammary or supraclavicular nodes may be involved at the initial presentation, they rarely occur in the absence of axillary node involvement. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/813.html" rel="external">

         The evaluation of the regional nodes depends on whether axillary involvement is suspected prior to surgery:

         </span>
         For patients presenting with clinically suspicious axillary lymph nodes, a preoperative work-up including ultrasound plus fine needle aspiration or core biopsy can help to determine the best surgical approach and whether neoadjuvant therapy should be considered. (See
         <a class="local">

         Patients with a clinically negative axillary examination should undergo an SLNB at the time of surgery. Further evaluation of the regional nodes depends on the findings at SLNB. Patients who have one or two pathologically involved sentinel nodes may not require a complete axillary node dissection [

         For patients with ER/PR and HER2-negative disease (triple-negative breast cancer), we typically administer adjuvant chemotherapy if the tumor size is ≥0.5 cm. Because these patients are not candidates for endocrine therapy or treatment with HER2-directed agents, chemotherapy is their only option for adjuvant treatment, following or before radiotherapy. Patients with a triple-negative breast cancer &lt;0.5 cm in size may forego adjuvant chemotherapy in most cases, due to minimal, if any, survival advantage. (See

         Most patients with locally advanced breast cancer, and some with earlier-stage disease (particularly if triple negative or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2] positive), are treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy. The goal of treatment is to induce a tumor response before surgery and enable breast conservation. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy also provides information about response to therapy that may be useful at a future time, if the cancer recurs.

         Neoadjuvant therapy results in long-term distant disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) comparable to that achieved with primary surgery followed by adjuvant systemic therapy. (See

         For most patients with hormone receptor-positive disease receiving neoadjuvant therapy, we offer chemotherapy rather than neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. Chemotherapy is associated with higher response rates in a shorter time period. For select patients with hormone-positive disease, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy may be an appropriate option if there are serious comorbidities or other factors (eg, patient preference) that necessitate that strategy. Patient selection for neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus endocrine therapy among those with hormone receptor-positive disease is discussed elsewhere. (See

         The choice between breast conservation and mastectomy after neoadjuvant treatment is dependent on the treatment response and patient characteristics (eg, breast size in relation to residual tumor size).

         Certain very rare subtypes of metaplastic carcinoma (eg, low-grade adenosquamous and low-grade fibromatosis-like carcinoma) have a favorable prognosis without adjuvant systemic therapies [

         ]. Patients with tumors of such histologies may be offered observation rather than adjuvant systemic therapies, provided that the favorable histologic type is pure (&gt;90 percent as classified on the surgical excision, not core biopsy alone). The critical step in evaluation of such tumors, because of their rarity, is pathologic review by a highly experienced pathology service to corroborate the diagnosis. This is particularly true when omission of adjuvant therapy is being contemplated. (See

         Clinicians should discuss with patients the risk of infertility and possible interventions to preserve fertility prior to initiating potentially gonadotoxic therapy (eg, cryopreservation of embryos or oocytes). This discussion should occur soon after diagnosis, since some interventions to preserve fertility take time and could delay the start of treatment.

         The majority of breast cancer recurrences occur within the first five years of diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18

         ], particularly with hormone receptor-negative disease [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19

         ]. A discussion of the influence of hormone receptor status on short- and long-term outcomes is found elsewhere. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         In a study of over 4000 women with operable breast cancer treated on International Breast Cancer Study Group clinical trials I to V, the annual risk of recurrence was highest during the first five years (10.4 percent) with a peak between years 1 and 2 (15.2 percent) [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. While the highest rate of relapse is within the first few years of treatment, some recurrences occur much later. In one study of patients with stage I, II, or III breast cancer who were without evidence of disease five years out from the original diagnosis, the recurrence risks in the subsequent 5 and 10 years were still 11 and 19 percent, respectively [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20

         ]. While these results reflect outcomes among patients with all biologic subtypes of disease, the long-term risk of recurrence differs according to hormone receptor status, with late recurrences occurring more frequently among hormone receptor-positive cancers rather than hormone receptor-negative ones. A discussion of prognostic factors including hormone receptor status and other factors is found elsewhere. (See

         Cancer survivors who have completed treatment for breast cancer should undergo regular follow-up. Annual mammography should also be performed in patients who underwent breast-conserving therapy. The routine use of breast magnetic resonance imaging or whole-breast ultrasound is not recommended for breast cancer survivors because of a lack of evidence to inform their role in this population.

         The surgical approach to the primary tumor depends on the size of the tumor and the breast, and whether multifocal disease is present. Options include breast-conserving therapy (breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy [RT]) or mastectomy. Both approaches result in equivalent cancer-specific outcomes. (See

          Locally advanced breast cancer
         </strong>
         – Most patients with locally advanced breast cancer and some with earlier-stage breast cancer (particularly if HER2 positive or triple negative) are treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy prior to surgery. Neoadjuvant treatment improves the rate of breast conservation without compromising survival outcomes. (See

         For most patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment, we offer chemotherapy rather than endocrine therapy. A HER2-directed agent should be added to the chemotherapy regimen for tumors that are HER2 positive. For select patients with high-risk triple-negative breast cancer, we incorporate immunotherapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. (See
