Although patients with mild to moderate illness may respond to psychotherapy, patients with severe (eg, suicidality or psychosis), chronic, or recurrent syndromes often require pharmacotherapy.</p><p>The decision to prescribe antidepressants for pregnant patients requires clinicians to weigh the negative impact of untreated mood and anxiety disorders against the adverse effects of antidepressants. Although the risks to infants from antenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) appear to be small, the potential risks are uncertain due to the lack of high-quality data on the impact of these drugs. The complexity of managing pregnant women with mood and anxiety disorders requires coordinated efforts among psychiatrists, primary care clinicians, obstetricians, and pediatricians.</p><p>Maternal use of SSRIs and SNRIs during pregnancy is estimated at approximately 8 percent [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. SSRIs and SNRIs are first- and second-line medications for unipolar depressive disorders and anxiety disorders, as well as other disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. In addition, these antidepressants are often combined with second-generation antipsychotics for treating bipolar and unipolar major depression in pregnant women.</p><p>This topic reviews the association between antenatal exposure to SSRIs and SNRIs and neonatal outcomes. Antenatal exposure to SSRIs and SNRIs and the risk of abnormalities in growth, motor skills, and cognition in the offspring, as well as the risk of psychopathology, are discussed separately.

Rather, the literature consists of observational studies that have compared pregnant women who chose to use antidepressants with pregnant women who chose not to use antidepressants, and there may be important prognostic differences between these two groups. Most postnatal adverse events possibly related to antenatal SSRI or SNRI exposure occur in less than 1 percent of infants. Thus, a sufficient number of exposures is required to detect an association, and large observational studies are preferable to case reports and series. In addition, the timing of exposure and dose during pregnancy varies between studies.</p><p>In designing observational studies to examine the adverse effects of antenatal exposure to antidepressants, it is preferable to prospectively measure exposures, covariates, and outcomes. However, neonatal outcomes are often examined with retrospective, population based registry studies that were not designed expressly to examine the effects of antenatal exposure. Registry studies have the advantage of high generalizability, large sample size to detect the small risks associated with SSRI and/or SNRI exposure, and outcomes that include clinical disorders rather than scores on rating scales. Limitations include difficulty in determining exactly when exposure occurred during the pregnancy, medication dose, and/or whether infants were truly exposed (as opposed to mothers filling prescriptions, but not taking the medication). Ascertainment bias can also be a problem because patients and clinicians may be more likely to report and document adverse events in neonates after a drug exposure, compared with infants with no antenatal drug exposure.</p><p>Another type of observational study is the case control study, in which infants experiencing the outcome under study (cases) are matched to infants not experiencing the outcome (controls), to look for differential odds of in utero exposure to antidepressants. Limitations of these studies can include inflated risk estimates due to the study design itself and recall bias (one is more likely to recall an exposure if one experiences an adverse event).</p><p>General information about study designs is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2759.html" rel="external">"Glossary of common biostatistical and epidemiological terms", section on 'Study designs'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H90522767"><span class="h3">Confounding factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Associations between antidepressant exposures and adverse outcomes that are found in observational studies do not prove that the exposures caused the outcomes. One variable that may explain at least part of the association is the severity of the maternal psychiatric illness, which is difficult to quantify without clinical interviews. Pregnant patients with more severe psychiatric illness are more likely to receive antidepressants.</p><p>Other variables that could explain associations between antenatal use of SSRIs and SNRIs and infant outcomes include the gestational age at exposure; antidepressant dose; comorbid general medical disorders (including obesity); comorbid psychiatric disorders; exposure to tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs; exposure to prescription and nonprescription medications; poor nutrition; inadequate antenatal care; and delivery complications. It is often not possible to account for these factors using the registry data that comprise much of the evidence; eg, comorbidity is difficult to quantify without clinical interviews.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H368227"><span class="h2">Differences among antidepressants</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is not clear whether the risk of neonatal complications following antenatal exposure to antidepressants differs between SSRIs and SNRIs; it is also not clear whether differences exist among individual drugs. Adverse effects may differ among drugs because of differences in potency, receptor selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties (such as half-life and the presence of active and nonactive metabolites). However, most studies analyze pooled data from mothers treated with a variety of SSRIs and SNRIs. In studies that have performed subgroup analyses with specific drug classes or individual antidepressants, confidence intervals around the effect sizes of different classes/drugs typically overlap, which suggests that any observed adverse effects are likely attributable to all of the drug classes, or all of the drugs within a class.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H90522773"><span class="h1">TERATOGENICITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The teratogenicity of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors is discussed separately.

The adult discontinuation syndrome is thought to arise from decreased serotonin concentrations at neuronal synapses, which produces cholinergic overactivity characterized by anxiety, hyperactivity, insomnia, irritability, dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, chills, fatigue, and myalgias.

A small prospective study enrolled mothers who were treated with SSRIs during pregnancy, along with their infants who were screened for poor neonatal adaptation syndrome; there were 30 infants with the syndrome and 52 without the syndrome [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. The children were then assessed with neurodevelopmental tests at age two to six years. Although cognitive and developmental scores were similar between the two groups of children, abnormal scores on the social behavior component of the test battery were more likely to occur in children who had experienced neonatal abstinence syndrome than children who had not (47 versus 19 percent). However, this may have been a spurious finding due to the number of tests applied, and lack of information about maternal psychopathology and the impact of the postnatal environment. Additional information about the potential association between gestational exposure to SSRIs and childhood psychiatric symptoms is discussed separately.

As an example, a prospective observational study compared infants who were exposed in utero to SSRIs during the last month of pregnancy with infants exposed earlier in pregnancy but not during the last month; among the eight neurobehavioral variables assessed during the first postnatal month, only attention was worse in the infants exposed to SSRIs during the last month [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. In addition, the highest risk for relapse of psychiatric disorders is in the immediate postpartum period (eg, the first two to three weeks) [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Thus, curtailing antidepressants prior to delivery is inconsistent with good clinical practice.</p><p>Although the poor neonatal adaptation syndrome is transient and self-limiting, women taking antidepressants should deliver in a hospital with pediatric support to monitor babies’ cardio-respiratory functioning and temperature for at least 48 hours [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. Supportive measures such as maternal reassurance, frequent infant feeding, and encouragement of skin-to-skin contact between mother and infant are usually sufficient to manage poor neonatal adaptation. Observation and supportive care for the infant should continue until the syndrome has resolved [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Breastfeeding of infants with the poor neonatal adaptation syndrome is not contraindicated; although the impact of breastfeeding upon the syndrome is not clear, some evidence suggests that the incidence of the syndrome may be lower in breastfed babies. In a prospective observational study that examined infants (n = 247) exposed to antidepressants (largely SSRIs) during the third trimester, the incidence of poor neonatal adaptation was lower among infants who were breastfed or fed both breast milk and formula, compared with infants exclusively fed formula (odds ratio 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.7) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H90522798"><span class="h2">Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multiple observational studies have found that using SSRIs during late pregnancy (eg, third trimester) is associated with a small absolute increase of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, a potentially fatal condition that occurs in approximately 2 per 1000 live births in the general population [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. However, different studies have yielded conflicting results that may reflect differences in methods; for example, some studies do not control for confounding by indication (the possible association between maternal depression and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn). In addition, the risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn with SSRI exposure needs to be balanced against the risks of antenatal depression [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A systematic review conducted multiple meta-analyses examining the association between antenatal exposure to SSRIs and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. In one meta-analysis of five observational studies (sample size not reported), exposure to SSRIs in late pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (odds ratio 2.5, 95% CI 1.3-4.7). However, heterogeneity across studies was moderate. A second meta-analysis of three observational studies found no association between early pregnancy (eg, first trimester) SSRI exposure and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (odds ratio 1.2, 95% CI 0.6-2.6).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The low incidence of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn in the general population means that the absolute increase due to late pregnancy SSRI exposure is also low [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].

The investigators found that the risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn was greater in the group with late pregnancy exposure to SSRIs (odds ratio 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.5).

The primary findings included the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The incidence of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn in exposed and unexposed infants was 2.9/1000 and 1.8/1000.

However, heterogeneity across studies was moderate to large.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A meta-analysis of eight observational studies with over 7 million pregnancies found that the risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn was greater among infants exposed to SSRIs than unexposed infants (odds ratio 1.52, 95% CI 1.04-2.00) [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. However, the absolute increase in risk was small (0.6 per 1000 live births), with a corresponding number needed to harm of 1615 infants.</p><p></p><p>The risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn may vary among specific SSRIs. A network meta-analysis (11 observational studies, n &gt;6 million participants) ranked each SSRI according to the probability of an association with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, by using results from direct, head-to-head comparisons between the drugs, as well as indirectly comparing drugs through their relative effect with a common comparator (eg, no exposure) [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].

In addition, the analyses included propensity score matching to balance the exposed and unexposed groups with regard to potential confounders such as maternal age, chronic general medical illnesses (eg, hypertension, diabetes, and asthma), and other medications (eg, other psychotropic drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and antidiabetic drugs).
