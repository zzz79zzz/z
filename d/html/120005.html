Although most use by adolescents will attenuate over time, many youth who use alcohol and other drugs suffer negative health and social consequences. Some advance to more severe levels of use and impairment, meeting the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for substance use disorders (SUDs) during adolescence or later as adults.</p><p>Although the general approach to the treatment of adolescents with SUD is similar in some respects to the assessment and treatment of adults with SUD, developmental considerations require an assessment and interventional approach tailored to the cognitive, social, and legal status of adolescents. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/101699.html" rel="external">"Substance use disorder in adolescents: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>This topic reviews treatment of SUD in adolescents.

The limited ability of interventions to reach this goal and the frequently self-limited nature of the substance use during adolescence suggest that harm reduction (ie, reducing use and adverse consequences) may be an acceptable outcome of treatment. In addition to substance use, associated problems should be targeted for treatment. Problems may involve individual behaviors, family functioning, peer and interpersonal relationships, and academic or vocational functioning.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1834492733"><span class="h1">INITIAL TREATMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H446888697"><span class="h2">Medically supervised withdrawal</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Adolescents with opioid use disorder, alcohol use disorder, and benzodiazepine use disorder who experience or are at significant risk to experience withdrawal upon stopping use should undergo medically supervised withdrawal. Medically supervised withdrawal generally uses agonists or other medications that provide symptomatic relief. In the absence of well tested withdrawal treatment protocols for the adolescent population, it is reasonable to use protocols developed for adults [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Alcohol withdrawal</strong> – Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal include: autonomic hyperactivity (eg, sweating, pulse rate greater than 100), increased hand tremor, insomnia, nausea or vomiting, transient visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, and grand mal seizures [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Supportive care (reassurance and encouragement in a quiet environment with limited interpersonal interactions, plenty of fluids and good nutrition, and administration of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12833" href="/z/d/drug information/12833.html" rel="external">thiamine</a> and multivitamins) is sufficient to manage mild alcohol withdrawal.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In severe cases, particularly when an alcohol withdrawal scale exceeds a specific threshold and/or if the risk of seizures is high (eg, history of previous seizures, abnormal electrolytes), as in adults, benzodiazepines are suggested for first-line treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms in adolescents. This can be done either on a fixed schedule (doses are given at specified amounts and intervals) or, preferably, following a symptom triggered regime (benzodiazepines are administered if the score in an alcohol withdrawal rating scale is above a specified threshold). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/108527.html" rel="external">"Alcohol withdrawal: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/323.html" rel="external">"Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Opioid withdrawal</strong> – Tolerance and physical and psychologic dependence on opioids usually occur after three weeks of daily usage. The abstinence syndrome or withdrawal symptoms usually are noted if opioid use is discontinued after several months of daily usage and include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Three to four hours after blood levels decline – Drug craving, anxiety, fear of withdrawal.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Eight to 14 hours – Anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, yawning, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, diaphoresis, stomach cramps, and mydriasis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>One to three days – Tremor, muscle spasms, vomiting, diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, fever, chills, and piloerection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Clinical trials support the use of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12918" href="/z/d/drug information/12918.html" rel="external">buprenorphine</a> for treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms in adolescents using dosing protocols developed for use in adults.

Of medications for adolescents with SUD, only <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12918" href="/z/d/drug information/12918.html" rel="external">buprenorphine</a> for opioid use disorder has been tested in a clinical trial. Additional research influencing treatment decisions has been limited to trials of adults with links to those topics below.</p><p>Based on our clinical experience, we generally select among treatment options based on factors such as the substance used, severity of the SUD, the degree to which the adolescent is motivated to participate in treatment, and whether or not they live with family:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2908947259"><span class="h3">Opioid use disorder</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3971307149"><span class="h4">Mild</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For adolescents with mild opioid use disorder who are motivated to achieve abstinence, we suggest first-line treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9679" href="/z/d/drug information/9679.html" rel="external">naltrexone</a> in conjunction with addiction counseling and participation in a mutual help group.</p><p>As an example of a mild disorder, the adolescent may be using opioids intermittently, reporting craving and social isolation, but not reporting other consequences of opioid use and not demonstrating withdrawal symptoms.</p><p>There are no clinical trials supporting the efficacy of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9679" href="/z/d/drug information/9679.html" rel="external">naltrexone</a> in adolescents; naltrexone appears to be helpful in our clinical experience and in published case series [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Clinical trials of the oral formulation in adults suggest that supervised medication taking may be needed for effective treatment.</p><p>Further information on the efficacy, side effects, and administration of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9679" href="/z/d/drug information/9679.html" rel="external">naltrexone</a> is reviewed below. (See <a class="local">'Naltrexone'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H841515955"><span class="h4">Moderate to severe</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For adolescents with moderate to severe opioid use disorder (ie, the presence of 6 or more of the 11 possible symptoms of DSM-5 opioid use disorder), we suggest first-line treatment with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12918" href="/z/d/drug information/12918.html" rel="external">buprenorphine</a> with adjunctive psychosocial treatment rather than with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12590" href="/z/d/drug information/12590.html" rel="external">methadone</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13171" href="/z/d/drug information/13171.html" rel="external">clonidine</a>, or with psychosocial intervention alone. In adolescents, two clinical trials have found that buprenorphine reduced opioid use compared with treatment as usual following medically supervised withdrawal [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. Further information on buprenorphine’s efficacy, side effects, and dosing in adolescents is reviewed below. Further evidence in support of buprenorphine has been conducted in adults and is reviewed separately. (See <a class="local">'Buprenorphine'</a> below.)</p><p>As an example, a clinical trial comparing <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12918" href="/z/d/drug information/12918.html" rel="external">buprenorphine</a> with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13171" href="/z/d/drug information/13171.html" rel="external">clonidine</a> in adolescents with opioid use disorder found buprenorphine to be effective in a larger proportion of patients [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The trial randomly assigned 36 adolescents with DSM-IV opioid dependence, aged 13 to 18, to receive either transmucosal buprenorphine or a transdermal clonidine patch for four weeks. High rates of abstinence were seen among completers in both the buprenorphine and clonidine groups (78 versus 81 percent), but nearly twice as many buprenorphine as clonidine recipients completed the four-week treatment (72 versus 39 percent).</p><p>Dosing and adverse effects of these medications are the same as that for adults. Information on the efficacy, side effects, and administration of these medications in adults is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7803.html" rel="external">"Opioid use disorder: Pharmacologic management"</a>.)</p><p>For patients who are treated with medication for opioid use disorder, we suggest adjunctive treatment with individual or group addiction counseling and participation in a mutual help groups such as Narcotics Anonymous. Augmentation of pharmacotherapy with a program employing contingency management is suggested in patients for whom opioid agonists and antagonists are ineffective or when motivation is an issue. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/99647.html" rel="external">"Opioid use disorder: Psychosocial management"</a>.)</p><p>Regulatory requirements in the United States and other countries require that patients receiving <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12590" href="/z/d/drug information/12590.html" rel="external">methadone</a> also receive psychosocial treatment. Clinicians providing patients with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12918" href="/z/d/drug information/12918.html" rel="external">buprenorphine</a> in office-based practice are required to have the capacity to provide or refer patients for psychosocial care, but patients are not required to receive such care. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7803.html" rel="external">"Opioid use disorder: Pharmacologic management", section on 'Regulation of methadone in United States'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7803.html" rel="external">"Opioid use disorder: Pharmacologic management", section on 'Regulation of buprenorphine in United States'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2781596305"><span class="h3">Mild alcohol use disorder</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For adolescents with a mild alcohol use disorder, we suggest initial treatment with a brief intervention, alcohol counseling, and participation in a mutual health group. Brief interventions have not been tested specifically in adolescents with mild alcohol use disorder, but systematic reviews have generally found brief interventions to be efficacious in adolescents with unhealthy drinking [<a href="#rid8">8-10</a>]. As an example, a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials and controlled quasi-experimental trials found brief intervention led to small reductions to alcohol consumption and other drug use [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. The research is reviewed in detail separately.

Evidence-based models of addiction counseling have been developed but are not widely available.

As an example, CBT might be the best choice for a motivated adolescent who has little parental support, while family therapy may be the best choice for an unmotivated adolescent with an involved family.</p><p>In adolescents treated for an SUD, structured interventions are typically augmented with addiction counseling and participation in a mutual help group.</p><p>Availability and patient preference play key roles in the selection of psychosocial interventions. A key question is, what type of treatment is the adolescent willing to participate in? Patients with SUD vary widely in their motivation for treatment and willingness to follow through on clinical recommendations.</p><p>We favor starting with certain interventions for patients with particular characteristics and needs:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Low motivation</strong> – For adolescents with an SUD who lack motivation to reduce substance use, we suggest treatment with motivational interviewing. Motivational interviewing is often added to another psychosocial intervention rather than provided as monotherapy.
