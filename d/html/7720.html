They can arise at any body site, but are most common in the extremities, particularly the lower limbs. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14259.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>In treating STS of the extremities, the major therapeutic goals are long-term survival, avoidance of a local recurrence, maximizing function, and minimizing morbidity. Surgical resection is the cornerstone of potentially curative treatment. For nearly all patients with extremity sarcomas &gt;5 cm, the addition of radiation therapy (RT) improves local control, and it has also had a significant impact on limb salvage. There are advantages to preoperative (neoadjuvant) as compared with postoperative (adjuvant) administration of RT, and for neoadjuvant therapy utilizing combinations of RT and chemotherapy, particularly for recurrent and large, high-grade primary tumors. These topics are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7734.html" rel="external">"Overview of multimodality treatment for primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and superficial trunk"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7732.html" rel="external">"Treatment of locally recurrent and unresectable, locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities"</a>.)</p><p>Systemic chemotherapy is nearly always a mandatory component of treatment for several STS that occur predominantly in children (eg, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and extraosseous osteogenic sarcoma). However, the value of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients undergoing resection of the adult-type localized extremity STS (eg, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, synovial sarcoma) remains controversial due to the complexity of the group of diagnoses involved.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the use of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of adult-type extremity STS. The role of chemotherapy in the treatment of retroperitoneal STS, rhabdomyosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma, and neoadjuvant combined modality approaches for patients with large, high-grade or recurrent extremity STS are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7721.html" rel="external">"Rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood: Treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7740.html" rel="external">"Treatment of Ewing sarcoma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7738.html" rel="external">"Surgical treatment and other localized therapy for metastatic soft tissue sarcoma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/142600.html" rel="external">"Initial management of retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Pediatric-type sarcomas</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The addition of systemic chemotherapy to local therapy significantly improves outcomes for the common pediatric types of sarcoma (rhabdomyosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma). Most modern treatment plans utilize initial (induction or neoadjuvant) chemotherapy followed by local treatment and additional (adjuvant) chemotherapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">Rhabdomyosarcoma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The vast majority of patients with rhabdomyosarcoma are children. The routine use of multiagent chemotherapy (typically <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10045" href="/d/drug information/10045.html" rel="external">vincristine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9318" href="/d/drug information/9318.html" rel="external">dactinomycin</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>, VAC, or regimens used for Ewing sarcoma), in addition to surgery and radiation therapy (RT), has contributed significantly toward increasing cure rates among those with localized disease. The rare cases of rhabdomyosarcoma that arise in adults are managed similarly, with the exception of older adults who may not be eligible for multiagent chemotherapy due to age or comorbidities. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7721.html" rel="external">"Rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood: Treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Ewing sarcoma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among children, Ewing sarcoma is much more common in bone than in soft tissue, while in adults, it more often presents in soft tissue. Regardless of whether it arises in bone or soft tissue, the tumor is treated in the same multidisciplinary manner in adults as in children. A combination of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy using <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10045" href="/d/drug information/10045.html" rel="external">vincristine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9391" href="/d/drug information/9391.html" rel="external">doxorubicin</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a> (VAC), with alternating cycles of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8552" href="/d/drug information/8552.html" rel="external">ifosfamide</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8430" href="/d/drug information/8430.html" rel="external">etoposide</a>, is a United States standard of care in addition to local therapy; in Europe a somewhat different combination of many of these agents is recommended (vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin, etoposide [VIDE]). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7740.html" rel="external">"Treatment of Ewing sarcoma", section on 'Treatment for localized disease'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Extraosseous osteogenic sarcomas</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Osteosarcomas rarely arise in the soft tissue rather than bone  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83187" href="/d/graphic/83187.html" rel="external">image 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83419" href="/d/graphic/83419.html" rel="external">image 2</a>). In contrast with Ewing sarcoma, when osteogenic sarcomas arise in soft tissue rather than bone, management has, to date, followed the principles established for soft tissue tumors rather than primary bone tumors, although this remains a topic of some controversy.</p><p>In particular, while adjuvant chemotherapy is a standard component of treatment for primary bone osteosarcomas in all age groups, it has been thought to be much less effective for tumors of extraosseous origin [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, at least one study suggests that outcomes may be better when children with extraosseous osteosarcoma are treated with the same combination chemotherapy protocols as used for bone-primary osteogenic sarcoma [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7722.html" rel="external">"Osteosarcoma: Epidemiology, pathology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7723.html" rel="external">"Chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the management of osteosarcoma"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Sarcomas more commonly seen in adults</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The remainder of this discussion will focus on the use of adjuvant chemotherapy for the more common adult-type STS, such as liposarcomas, leiomyosarcomas, and synovial sarcomas.</p><p>Over 20 randomized trials and two meta-analyses have addressed the potential benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for resected extremity STS in adults. Unfortunately, these have yielded conflicting data, and as a result, the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy remains uncertain.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Early randomized trials</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The majority of early trials used <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9391" href="/d/drug information/9391.html" rel="external">doxorubicin</a> alone or with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9316" href="/d/drug information/9316.html" rel="external">dacarbazine</a> but did not employ <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8552" href="/d/drug information/8552.html" rel="external">ifosfamide</a>, a compound only developed in the mid-1980s. Among the first 14 published randomized trials of adjuvant doxorubicin-based therapy versus surgery alone, two reported a significant survival advantage for combination chemotherapy, three found higher survival in the observation arm, and the remainder showed no difference in outcome in the treated group [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">SMAC meta-analysis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Individual patient data from these trials, which involved 1568 adults with localized resectable STS (only some of which were localized to an extremity), were analyzed by the Sarcoma Meta-Analysis Collaboration (SMAC) and published in 1997 [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. All evaluated studies randomly assigned patients postoperatively to receive or not receive adjuvant doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy; fewer than 5 percent of patients received a chemotherapy regimen that included <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8552" href="/d/drug information/8552.html" rel="external">ifosfamide</a>. The following benefits were noted in the chemotherapy group:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Significantly longer local recurrence-free interval (hazard ratio [HR] for local recurrence 0.73, 95% CI 0.56-0.94).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Significantly longer distant recurrence-free interval (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57-0.85).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Significantly higher overall recurrence-free survival (HR for any recurrence 0.75, 95% CI 0.64-0.87). This corresponded to an absolute 6 to 10 percent improvement in recurrence-free survival at 10 years.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There was a trend towards better overall survival that favored chemotherapy, but it was not statistically significant (HR for death 0.89, 95% CI 0.76-1.03).</p><p></p><p>There was no consistent evidence of a difference in any endpoint according to age, sex, stage, site, grade, histology (although there was no central pathology review), extent of resection, tumor size, or exposure to RT. However, the strongest evidence of a beneficial effect on survival was shown in the subset of patients with extremity and truncal sarcomas. Among these patients who received adjuvant doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy, there was a modest but statistically significant benefit for chemotherapy (HR for death 0.80, p = 0.029), which translated into a 7 percent absolute benefit in overall survival at 10 years.</p><p>The updated meta-analysis from this group, which includes many later trials, is presented below. (See <a class="local">'Updated meta-analyses'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Later randomized trials</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Given the suggestion of a survival benefit for extremity and truncal STS in the SMAC meta-analysis, later randomized trials largely focused on these sites. There are few randomized trials addressing the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for visceral or head and neck STS.</p><p>Four additional randomized trials explored the benefit of anthracycline and ifosfamide-based combination adjuvant chemotherapy in extremity STS [<a href="#rid6">6-10</a>], two of which suggest a possible survival benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In an Italian trial in which 46 percent of the enrolled patients had either synovial sarcoma or liposarcoma (two relatively chemosensitive histologies), 104 patients with high-grade, large (≥5 cm) or recurrent spindle cell sarcomas involving the extremities or girdles were randomly assigned to no postoperative therapy or to five cycles of chemotherapy [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. Chemotherapy consisted of a dose intensive <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8663" href="/d/drug information/8663.html" rel="external">epirubicin</a>/<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8552" href="/d/drug information/8552.html" rel="external">ifosfamide</a> combination (epirubicin 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1 and 2 plus ifosfamide 1.8 g/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1 to 5) with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9615" href="/d/drug information/9615.html" rel="external">mesna</a> and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support. Accrual was prematurely discontinued at two years, when a significant difference in the cumulative incidence of distant metastasis was found (45 versus 28 percent), favoring the chemotherapy group.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Four-year overall survival was significantly greater in favor of chemotherapy (69 versus 50 percent), but the difference that favored the chemotherapy group lost statistical significance with median follow-up of over seven years, a finding that was attributed to the limited number of enrolled patients. Curiously, overall relapse rates (local and distant) were similar in the two groups (44 and 45 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">It is difficult to interpret these results since the main expected benefit of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy is to reduce the rate of distant relapse. However, this may have reflected a preponderance of patients with local recurrence later amenable to local surgical salvage approaches.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A follow-up Italian trial randomly assigned 88 patients with high-risk extremity sarcoma to surgery with or without RT (n = 43) or to surgery plus chemotherapy (n = 45, 26 with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8663" href="/d/drug information/8663.html" rel="external">epirubicin</a> alone and 19 to epirubicin plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8552" href="/d/drug information/8552.html" rel="external">ifosfamide</a>) with or without RT [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The five-year survival rate of patients treated with chemotherapy was significantly higher than that of patients who did not receive chemotherapy (72 versus 47 percent). However, the large number of treatment variables and the small number of studied patients makes interpretation of this result difficult.</p><p></p><p>In contrast with these results, a survival benefit from adjuvant <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9391" href="/d/drug information/9391.html" rel="external">doxorubicin</a> and ifosfamide-containing chemotherapy could not be shown in two other trials [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) randomly assigned 351 patients with completely resected STS (67 percent extremity tumors, 60 percent high-grade, 40 percent ≥10 cm) to observation versus five cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9391" href="/d/drug information/9391.html" rel="external">doxorubicin</a> 75 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8552" href="/d/drug information/8552.html" rel="external">ifosfamide</a> 5 g/m<sup>2 </sup>per cycle) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The estimated five-year relapse-free survival was similar in both arms as was overall survival (67 versus 68 percent, HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.68-1.31). Interpretation of these results is limited by the inclusion of patients with nonextremity, small, and low/intermediate-grade primaries, as well as the relatively low ifosfamide dose.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An Austrian trial of 59 patients assigned to perioperative chemotherapy or surgery alone was also negative, but the small number of patients makes it likely that the study was underpowered to detect a small difference between the arms, if one were present [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h3">Updated meta-analyses</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An updated 2008 meta-analysis was conducted on published data from 18 randomized trials of 1953 patients with localized and potentially resectable STS that were reported between 1973 and 2002, including the Austrian and both Italian trials discussed above, but not the EORTC trial [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Five of the trials used <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9391" href="/d/drug information/9391.html" rel="external">doxorubicin</a> plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8552" href="/d/drug information/8552.html" rel="external">ifosfamide</a>, while the others used doxorubicin alone or in combination with other agents.</p><p>The odds ratio (OR) for local recurrence was 0.73 (95% CI 0.56-0.94) in favor of chemotherapy; the corresponding value for distant and overall recurrence was 0.67 (95% CI 0.56-0.82), again favoring chemotherapy. These values are nearly identical to those found in the earlier meta-analysis. (See <a class="local">'SMAC meta-analysis'</a> above.)</p><p>However, in contrast with the earlier analysis, the use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9391" href="/d/drug information/9391.html" rel="external">doxorubicin</a> with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8552" href="/d/drug information/8552.html" rel="external">ifosfamide</a> was associated with a statistically significant overall survival benefit (OR for death 0.56, 95% CI 0.36-0.85). The absolute risk reduction for doxorubicin in combination with ifosfamide was 11 percent (30 versus 41 percent risk of death). Benefit could not be shown for doxorubicin alone (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68-1.03), implying the fundamental importance of ifosfamide in the adjuvant treatment of sarcomas overall.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Pooled analysis of the EORTC trials</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In contrast with this result, a pooled analysis of individual patient data from the two largest adjuvant trials of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9391" href="/d/drug information/9391.html" rel="external">doxorubicin</a> and ifosfamide-based chemotherapy (both performed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC [<a href="#rid10">10,12</a>]] and totaling 819 patients) was negative [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Compared with surgery alone, the use of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with a significant survival benefit, except in the subset of patients undergoing incomplete (R1) resection.

It is well recognized that myxoid/round cell liposarcomas and synovial sarcomas are relatively chemosensitive histologic types of STS, at least in the setting of metastatic disease.

The updated meta-analysis from the Sarcoma Meta-Analysis Collaboration [<a href="#rid11">11</a>] suggests that use of an optimal, adequately dosed anthracycline/ifosfamide-containing regimen significantly prolongs survival in patients with resected extremity STS [<a href="#rid11">11</a>] with the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8552" href="/d/drug information/8552.html" rel="external">ifosfamide</a> component as the more important of the two drugs. However, the analysis did not include data from the single largest negative trial [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. A pooled analysis of this trial and another European trial, both of which tested the value of an anthracycline and ifosfamide-containing regimen, indicated no benefit from adjuvant anthracycline-ifosfamide chemotherapy [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>Taken together, despite positive meta-analysis, it is difficult to recommend adjuvant chemotherapy as a standard practice for all patients with extremity STS. If there is a survival benefit for doxorubicin-based adjuvant chemotherapy, it appears to be small, no more than a 5 percent absolute increase in survival at 5 to 10 years [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Conversely, the positive meta-analysis from 2008 is arguably the strongest evidence in support of the use of adjuvant chemotherapy. The approach of treating many different sarcoma types with one therapeutic plan has not worked in other cancers, and should be not be expected to apply to what are 50 or more sarcoma types.</p><p>In keeping with the consensus-based guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>] and the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>], which endorse adjuvant chemotherapy as an option for high-risk patients, our present approach is to individualize therapy, taking into consideration the patient's performance status, comorbid factors (including age), site of disease, and histologic types which may be more likely to benefit from adjuvant therapy (eg, younger patients with high-risk synovial sarcoma or myxoid liposarcoma ). The potential for benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy must be discussed in the context of expected treatment-related toxicities, including potential sterility, cardiomyopathy, renal damage, second cancers, and overall impairment of quality of life.</p><p>Even for those patients in whom the decision has been made to administer adjuvant chemotherapy, the optimal regimen is undefined. We prefer five to six cycles of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9391" href="/d/drug information/9391.html" rel="external">doxorubicin</a> (usually 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per cycle in split bolus doses or continuous infusion over three days), <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8552" href="/d/drug information/8552.html" rel="external">ifosfamide</a> (9 to 10 g/m<sup>2</sup> in split doses over three hours per day for three to four days), and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9615" href="/d/drug information/9615.html" rel="external">mesna</a> (AIM  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67985" href="/d/graphic/67985.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81370" href="/d/graphic/81370.html" rel="external">table 2</a>)) rather than MAID (mesna, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9316" href="/d/drug information/9316.html" rel="external">dacarbazine</a> [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]) since this permits the administration of maximal doses of the two most active drugs for sarcoma (doxorubicin and ifosfamide), rather than adding myelotoxicity with dacarbazine. Three cycles of chemotherapy may suffice, although the data supporting this statement are limited to a single trial of three versus five cycles of chemotherapy in 328 patients with high-risk (deeply seated, high-grade, or large [≥5 cm] primary, or locally recurrent) extremity sarcomas [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Given the limitations of the available data, with the understanding that microscopic metastatic disease may ultimately require more, rather than fewer, cycles of chemotherapy, we still consider that five or six cycles of chemotherapy represents the preferred approach.
