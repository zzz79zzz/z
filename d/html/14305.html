         Cyanosis is a bluish discoloration of the tissues that results when the absolute level of deoxygenated hemoglobin in the capillary bed exceeds 3 g/dL [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. Cyanosis is a common clinical finding in newborn infants. Neonatal cyanosis, particularly central cyanosis, can be associated with significant and potentially life-threatening diseases, including pulmonary, cardiac, metabolic, neurologic, infectious, and hematologic disorders  (

          Acrocyanosis –
         </strong>
         Acrocyanosis is often seen in healthy newborns and refers to peripheral cyanosis around the mouth and the extremities (hands and feet)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108319" href="/z/d/graphic/108319.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). It is a benign condition caused by vasomotor changes resulting from the transition from fetal to extrauterine life. These vascular changes often result in peripheral vasoconstriction and increased tissue oxygen extraction [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4970.html" rel="external">
          "Physiologic transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life", section on 'Circulatory changes'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Acrocyanosis is differentiated from pathologic causes of peripheral cyanosis (eg, septic shock) by its clinical course. It occurs in otherwise healthy infants immediately after delivery and does not persist beyond 24 to 48 hours after birth.

         <strong>
          Peripheral cyanosis
         </strong>
         – In peripheral cyanosis, the concentration of deoxygenated hemoglobin on the venous side of the capillary bed is increased due to increased tissue oxygen extraction, whereas the systemic arterial oxygen saturation is normal. Peripheral cyanosis may be associated with peripheral vasoconstriction. It typically affects the distal extremities and sometimes the circumoral or periorbital areas [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The extremities may be cool or clammy. In neonates with isolated peripheral cyanosis, the mucus membranes remain pink, which differentiates it from central cyanosis. It can be a benign (eg, acrocyanosis) or pathologic finding. Causes include cold exposure, sepsis, shock, venous obstruction, and polycythemia. Some of these causes may be associated with both central cyanosis and peripheral vasoconstriction. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Causes of peripheral cyanosis'

         <strong>
          Central cyanosis
         </strong>
         – Central cyanosis refers to reduced oxygen saturation in the arterial circulation. Newborn infants normally have central cyanosis until up to 5 to 10 minutes after birth, as the oxygen saturation rises to 85 to 95 percent by 10 minutes of age [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Persistent central cyanosis is always pathologic and should be evaluated and treated promptly.

         Neonatal central cyanosis is most commonly due to hypoxia due to one or more of the following mechanisms:

         <strong>
          Alveolar hypoventilation
         </strong>
         – Although the primary effect of alveolar hypoventilation is hypercarbia (eg, recurrent apnea), decreased ventilation of the lung can cause hypoxemia and cyanosis. Causes of hypoventilation include central nervous system depression (eg, perinatal asphyxia), airway obstruction (choanal atresia), or neuromuscular disorders (eg, spinal muscular atrophy type 1).

         <strong>
          Ventilation-perfusion mismatch
         </strong>
         – Normally, areas of decreased ventilation are matched with decreased blood flow. Alterations of this relationship can cause hypoxemia and cyanosis (eg, neonatal pneumonia, pneumothorax).

         <strong>
          Right-to-left shunt
         </strong>
         – In right-to-left shunting, systemic venous blood bypasses ventilated alveoli and returns to the left side of the heart without being oxygenated, resulting in cyanosis. The site of shunting can be intracardiac (eg, cyanotic congenital heart disease [CCHD]), through the ductus arteriosus (eg, persistent pulmonary hypertension), or intrapulmonary (eg, perfusion of non-ventilated areas of the lung).

         <strong>
          Diffusion impairment
         </strong>
         – Oxygen molecules must diffuse from the alveoli to the pulmonary capillaries to oxygenate hemoglobin. Interference with alveolar-arterial diffusion (eg, pulmonary edema) results in reduced oxygen saturation.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, reduced arterial oxygen saturation can be caused by hemoglobinopathies that inadequately transport oxygen or polycythemia.
        </p>
        <p>
         The etiology of persistent central cyanosis varies from a wide range of disorders that include cardiac, metabolic, neurologic, infectious, hematologic, and parenchymal and non-parenchymal pulmonary disorders  (

         <strong>
          Hemoglobin concentration
         </strong>
         – The total hemoglobin concentration affects the level of oxygen saturation at which cyanosis is perceptible. This is because the perception of cyanosis depends upon the absolute concentration of deoxygenated hemoglobin, not the ratio of deoxygenated to oxygenated hemoglobin. Cyanosis is visually perceptible when deoxygenated hemoglobin exceeds 3 g/dL, which generally corresponds to an oxygen saturation level &lt;85 percent in a neonate with a hemoglobin concentration of 15 g/dL  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70325" href="/z/d/graphic/70325.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). In patients with polycythemia, cyanosis can be detected at higher oxygen saturations; whereas an anemic patient may not have perceptible cyanosis despite significant hypoxemia. For example, in a patient with a hemoglobin concentration of 8 g/dL, cyanosis is not perceptible until the oxygen saturation falls below 63 percent.

         <strong>
          Fetal hemoglobin
         </strong>
         – Fetal hemoglobin, the predominant form of hemoglobin in newborn erythrocytes, binds oxygen more avidly than adult hemoglobin, which aids in fetal uptake of oxygen from the placenta but results in less oxygen delivery to the tissues. The oxygen dissociation curve for fetal versus adult hemoglobin is shifted to the left, so that for a given level of arterial oxygen tension (PaO
         <sub>

         ) is higher in newborns than older infants or adults  (

         – Micrognathia or retrognathia that is severe enough to be symptomatic is readily apparent on physical examination. Airway obstruction is caused by the posterior tongue obstructing the retropharyngeal airway while the infant is supine. Generally, obstruction is relieved by placing the infant prone, but an oral airway may be necessary.

         Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a condition in which the normal circulatory transition from fetal to newborn circulation fails to occur. In newborns with PPHN, the pulmonary vascular resistance remains abnormally elevated after birth, and right to left shunting of blood persists through the fetal circulatory channels (ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale). This shunting leads to severe hypoxemia and cyanosis. PPHN is most frequently associated with parenchymal lung disease, including meconium aspiration syndrome, neonatal pneumonia, and RDS. As a result, the majority of infants with PPHN will present with respiratory distress and cyanosis. However, idiopathic PPHN may also occur unaccompanied by underlying parenchymal lung disease. PPHN including its pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management is discussed separately. (See

         Neonatal polycythemia, usually defined as a hematocrit &gt;65 percent or a hemoglobin concentration &gt;22 g/dL, occurs in approximately 1 to 5 percent of births. It is observed more frequently in infants of diabetic mothers, with delayed clamping or stripping of the umbilical cord, chronic fetal hypoxia, and fetal growth restriction. (See

        <p>
         The SpO2 should be measured in both preductal (right hand) and postductal (either foot) locations. A difference of ≥4 percent between the pre- and postductal SpO2 suggests either congenital heart disease (eg, critical aortic stenosis or coarctation of the aorta) or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). However, in infants with PPHN, if right-to-left shunting is predominantly through the foramen ovale rather than the ductus, pre- and postductal saturations may not be different. These cases are difficult to differentiate from cyanotic heart disease. (See

         The physical examination is central to determining the cause of cyanosis. In particular, signs of respiratory distress (eg, tachypnea, inter- and subcostal retractions, nasal flaring, and audible grunting) are suggestive of pulmonary disease, whereas abnormal cardiac findings (eg, abnormal heart rate and sounds, and pathologic murmurs) indicate a cardiac etiology [

        </p>
        <p>
         However, some cardiac lesions may have a prominent component of respiratory distress (eg, obstructed total anomalous pulmonary venous return and left-sided obstructive disease); thus, its presence does not rule out congenital heart disease. As a result, both CHD and sepsis should be considered as the underlying diagnosis in any critically ill infant who presents with respiratory distress, cyanosis, poor perfusion and/or shock. Left-sided obstructive lesions in which ductal closure has severely affected systemic blood flow may be indistinguishable from severe sepsis on physical exam and usually requires echocardiographic confirmation of the diagnosis.

         Measurement of the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) by pulse oximetry is generally sufficient to confirm hypoxemia and asses the severity. However, direct measurement of the arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) with an arterial blood gas (ABG) provides a more accurate assessment of hypoxemia. ABG analysis is generally warranted in neonates with severe hypoxemia or if the pulse oximetry tracing is unreliable (eg, due to poor perfusion). Clinicians should be aware that the pain associated with an arterial puncture may cause agitation in the newborn, and a resultant decrease in the PaO

         Other parameters on the ABG include the arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) and measurements of acid-base status (pH, base excess, calculated bicarbonate level). An elevated PaCO

         suggests pulmonary disease. Metabolic acidosis generally indicates poor perfusion, which may be due to inadequate cardiac output or distributive shock.

         It is no longer routine practice to perform hyperoxia testing (ie, measuring the PaO2 with and without 100 percent oxygen). The hyperoxia test was used in the past to distinguish cyanotic CHD from pulmonary disorders. In the contemporary era, it is generally preferred to proceed directly to echocardiography if there is suspicion of cardiac disease. This is because echocardiography is readily available in most institutions, and it is far more accurate for distinguishing between CHD versus noncardiac causes of cyanosis. In addition, it is well recognized that there are potential harmful effects of exposing neonates to 100 percent oxygen, especially preterm neonates. The hyperoxia test should only be used if reliable echocardiography is not immediately available. The hyperoxia test and its interpretation are discussed in detail separately. (See

          Definition
         </strong>
         – Cyanosis is a bluish discoloration of the tissues that is perceptible when the absolute level of deoxygenated hemoglobin in the capillary bed exceeds 3 g/dL. It is a common clinical finding in newborn infants. (See
         <a class="local">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Factors that affect the detection of cyanosis include hemoglobin concentration, the presence of fetal hemoglobin, skin pigmentation, and other physiologic factors that affect the oxygen dissociation curve (eg, acid-base status, temperature of the infant, and levels of 2,3 diphosphoglycerate)  (

         <strong>
          Central cyanosis
         </strong>
         – Central cyanosis refers to reduced oxygen saturation in the arterial circulation. Newborn infants normally have central cyanosis until up to 5 to 10 minutes after birth. Persistent central cyanosis is pathologic and should be evaluated and addressed promptly. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Causes

         – Neonatal cyanosis can be associated with significant and sometimes life-threatening diseases due to cardiac, pulmonary, metabolic, neurological, infectious, and hematologic disorders  (

         <strong>
          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – Infants with persistent cyanosis after birth should be promptly evaluated and treated as they are at-risk for potentially life-threatening consequences. The goals of the evaluation are to assess the severity of illness and to determine the underlying cause of cyanosis so that treatment can focus on correcting or managing the specific disorder. (See
