         Bladder cancer is the most common malignancy involving the urinary system. Urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma is the predominant histologic type in the United States and Europe, where it accounts for 90 percent of all bladder cancers. In other areas of the world, non-urothelial carcinomas are more frequent. Much less commonly, urothelial cancers can arise in the renal pelvis, ureter, or urethra. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2957.html" rel="external">
          "Epidemiology and risk factors of urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma of the bladder", section on 'Epidemiology'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The spectrum of bladder cancer includes non-muscle invasive (superficial), muscle invasive, and metastatic disease, each with its own clinical behavior, biology, prognosis, and treatment.

         </span>
         Patients with bladder cancer classically present with painless hematuria (grossly visible or microscopic), although irritative voiding symptoms (frequency, urgency, dysuria) can be the initial manifestation. The diagnosis is often delayed due to the similarity of these symptoms to those of benign disorders (urinary tract infection, cystitis, prostatitis, passage of renal calculi), and delays can lead to a worsened prognosis due to more advanced stage at diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. There is evidence to suggest that delayed diagnosis accounts for the poorer survival in females diagnosed with bladder cancer compared with males [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, symptoms are often intermittent. In some patients, metastases will cause the initial symptoms. Incidental bladder cancer is rare at autopsy, suggesting that most cancers eventually become symptomatic [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>

         The most common presenting symptom is hematuria, which is typically intermittent, gross, painless, and present throughout micturition. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7208.html" rel="external">
          "Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Hematuria is typically due to benign causes in most patients and can be seen in up to 18 percent of adults [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6
         </a>
         ]. However, the likelihood of bladder cancer increases when the hematuria is gross (visible) rather than microscopic [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ], with an incidence of bladder cancer of approximately 2 to 5 percent among patients with microscopic hematuria [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5,9,10
         </a>
         ] and 10 to 20 percent among those with gross hematuria [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,9,11
         </a>
         ]. The risk for bladder cancer is higher in males, older patients, and smokers.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with microscopic hematuria, the American Urological Association (AUA) recommends diagnostic evaluation for bladder and other urothelial cancers using the following risk-based approach [

        </p>
        <p>
         However, guidelines among expert groups differ. Recognizing a lower risk among younger females who do not smoke, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Urogynecologic Society (AUGS) recommend that asymptomatic, low-risk, never-smoking females aged 35 to 50 years undergo evaluation only if they have more than 25 RBCs per HPF [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The importance of evaluating hematuria was illustrated by a study of 1930 patients, in which 61 percent had no abnormality diagnosed [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Abnormalities that were found included bladder cancer (12 percent), urinary tract infections (13 percent), medical renal disease (10 percent), stone disease (4 percent), kidney cancer (0.6 percent), and prostate cancer (0.4 percent) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Bladder cancer was much more frequent in older patients, but seven patients with bladder cancer were younger than 40 years, including one with microscopic hematuria.

         The point at which gross hematuria is noted during urination can be helpful in localizing its source:

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         Blood that is only noticed as a discharge between voidings or as a stain on undergarments, while the voided urine itself appears clear, indicates an origin at the urethral meatus or the anterior urethra.

         Pain associated with bladder cancer is usually the result of locally advanced or metastatic tumors. Its distribution is related to the size and location of the primary tumor or its metastases:

         Flank pain may result when a tumor obstructs the ureter at any level (bladder, ureter, or renal pelvis). Although obstruction usually is associated with muscle invasive disease, large noninvasive tumors at the ureteral orifice may also cause symptoms. The pain is similar to that experienced with the passage of urinary stones, and may or may not be associated with hematuria. (See

         Voiding symptoms are most common in patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the bladder and may result from a functional decrease in the bladder capacity, detrusor overactivity, invasion of the trigone, or obstruction of the bladder neck or urethra.

         Irritative voiding symptoms (eg, daytime and/or nocturnal frequency, urgency, dysuria, or urge incontinence) occur in approximately one-third of patients. The complex of dysuria, frequency, and urgency in particular is highly suggestive of bladder CIS. (See

         Obstructive voiding symptoms are less common and may be due to tumor location at the bladder neck or prostatic urethra. Symptoms include straining, an intermittent stream, nocturia, decreased force of stream, and a feeling of incomplete voiding. On occasion, gross hematuria may result in "clot retention."

         The presence of otherwise unexplained hematuria may represent urothelial cancer in individuals until proven otherwise. Nevertheless, many causes are benign, such as hematuria from enlarged prostates, urinary tract infection, cystitis, prostatitis, and passage of renal calculi. The goal of the diagnostic evaluation is to determine the diagnosis, site, and extent of cancer, and the presence or absence of muscle invasive disease. However, the extent and need for evaluation is based on risk for bladder cancer. (See

         A full urologic evaluation of the entire urinary tract is indicated in such patients unless there is clear evidence of glomerular bleeding (eg, red cell casts, proteinuria, dysmorphic red cells [particularly acanthocytes], and in patients with gross hematuria, a smoky brown color). (See

         If evaluation is pursued, it should consist of cystourethroscopy and an evaluation of the upper tracts, since urothelial malignancy can be multifocal, with one or more lesions anywhere from the renal pelvis to the proximal urethra.

         Radiographic imaging of the upper tract aims to detect disease in the kidney, renal pelvis, or ureter. The choice of imaging study should balance risk of disease with concerns about radiation exposure and nephrotoxicity of contrast agents. For patients at low and intermediate risk of disease, renal ultrasound (US) balances the likelihood of disease with toxicity of other imaging modalities. For patients at high risk for disease, imaging can consist of either a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis with urography with oral and intravenous contrast or intravenous pyelography (IVP) plus nephrograms or renal US to evaluate both the collecting systems and the renal cortex. IVP is rarely used and has been largely replaced by CT. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used in patients with allergy to iodinated contrast and poor kidney function. (See

         The urinalysis should include a microscopic and gross examination as well as a dipstick chemical test. Nonrefrigerated urine should be examined within 30 minutes of collection. (See

         The average individual excretes approximately 30,000 red blood cells (RBCs) per hour, which equates to approximately one RBC per high-power field (HPF) on microscopic examination. Hematuria is usually not considered significant unless there are more than three RBCs per HPF. RBC morphology may also suggest the etiology of the hematuria; cells of glomerular origin are often dysmorphic or formed in casts, indicating intrinsic renal disease, while normally shaped RBCs are more likely from an extrinsic source such as calculi, tumor, obstruction, or infection.

         On occasion, dipstick analysis will be positive for blood, but microscopic examination fails to show RBCs. This can occur when myoglobin is present in the urine, since it is chemically similar to hemoglobin. This can also occur when the RBCs are lysed and in the presence of hemoglobin occurring in the course of hemolysis.

        <p>
         The specific gravity of a specimen is important to note because of its influence on the stability of white blood cells or RBCs. For example, when the urinary flow rate is high and the urine is very dilute, RBCs are lysed and therefore will not be present on microscopic examination, even in the presence of pathology. (See

         Cystoscopy is the gold standard for the initial diagnosis and staging of bladder cancer. This procedure is done in the office with a flexible cystoscope and only has minimal risks, such as bleeding and infection. Risk of infection is minimal using sterile techniques. In the United States, this is typically done with white light; fluorescence cystoscopy has been available in Europe and was approved in the United States in 2010 for use in the operating room and in 2018 for office cystoscopy. However, the indication for fluorescence cystoscopy has been for cancer surveillance and not for evaluation of hematuria. (See

         Any visible tumor or suspicious lesion seen at the initial (diagnostic) cystoscopy should be either biopsied or resected transurethrally to determine the histology and depth of invasion into the submucosa and muscle layers of the bladder.

         In patients who presented with a positive urine cytology and whose initial cystoscopy showed no visible tumor (or suspicious lesion) within the bladder, biopsy of apparently normal appearing urothelium, prostatic urethra, and selective catheterization of the ureters/renal pelvis with urine specimens for cytology from the upper tract is required.

         The procedure begins with a bimanual examination under anesthesia (EUA) to determine whether or not a palpable mass is present, and if present, whether or not it is mobile. An EUA during cystoscopy is effective for identifying locally advanced disease, which may present as gross extravesical extension, invasion of adjacent organs, or pelvic sidewall involvement. If a mass is felt, the bimanual examination is repeated after the resection to see if it is still present and to differentiate between clinical stage T2 and T3b disease  (

        </p>
        <p>
         The cystoscope is then inserted into the bladder, and urine is obtained for cytology if patients have irritative symptoms. A bladder wash specimen obtained by irrigating the bladder with sterile

          saline
         </a>
         provides the highest sensitivity for detection of cancer. The bladder is inspected visually, and a detailed description of the size, number, appearance, location, and growth pattern (papillary or solid) of all lesions is recorded. This information serves as a reference for subsequent cystoscopic examinations. The status of the uninvolved mucosa is also noted.
        </p>
        <p>
         The size, stalk, and configuration of the cancer can be predictive of muscle invasion [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. In general, low-grade, noninvasive tumors are papillary with a narrow stalk. High-grade, invasive tumors frequently can appear sessile, solid, or nodular. Carcinoma in situ (CIS) is a high-grade, noninvasive tumor, which can appear as a flat velvety lesion and can arise in patches. CIS sometimes involves large parts of the urothelial lining.

         Fluorescence cystoscopy uses an intravesical photoactive protoporphyrin (such as 5-aminolevulinic acid [5-ALA] and hexyl

         ]. The HAL is instilled one hour prior to cystoscopy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Randomized trials have confirmed that fluorescence cystoscopy detects more tumors (both papillary and CIS) than white-light cystoscopy. This improved tumor identification results in better patient management. The safety profile of fluorescence cystoscopy is excellent. The improved early detection and treatment of tumors need to be balanced by a slightly higher false-positive rate (mainly due to inflammation and scarring), the requirement for a special lens system, the need to instill the photosensitizer one hour prior to cystoscopy, as well as the higher cost. The clinical results with fluorescence endoscopy are discussed elsewhere. (See

          —
         </span>
         Cytology is commonly used as an adjunct to cystoscopy to detect CIS and upper-tract malignancies. The underlying concept is that cells in the urinary tract that are proliferating rapidly will be exfoliated. However, urine cytology has a relatively poor sensitivity, particularly for low-grade tumors. This was illustrated by a meta-analysis that included 18 studies with 1255 patients [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. The overall sensitivity was 34 percent, with sensitivities for grade 1, 2, and 3 tumors of 12, 26, and 64 percent, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lower-grade tumors have fewer morphologic alterations that may lead to the loss of intercellular attachments and adhesiveness. Thus, they may not exfoliate as easily as higher-grade tumors. When they are exfoliated, low-grade tumors are shed in large papillary fragments with uniform size, minimal alterations in nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, and small or absent nucleoli. Higher-grade tumor cells tend to be more isolated in loose clusters and elongated with marked pleomorphism, increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, and variable nucleoli size.
        </p>
        <p>
         False-positive results are rare with urine cytology (specificity &gt;98 percent in most studies) [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Thus, any positive cytology should be assumed to represent malignancy. If no disease is evident in the bladder, the upper urinary tracts and prostatic urethra should be thoroughly evaluated. Enhanced cystoscopy with fluorescent cystoscopy or narrow band imaging can be helpful in these cases to improve detection of CIS. If no lesion is discernible, selective ureteral and renal pelvis washings may be performed; however, the diagnostic accuracy of these procedures is debated because of possible contamination from the bladder. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2987.html" rel="external">
          "Malignancies of the renal pelvis and ureter"

        </p>
        <p>
         Urine cytology specimens must be properly collected and stored in order to maintain a high level of diagnostic accuracy. Catheterized specimens can denude normal surface epithelial cells; coalescence in papillary groups may be misinterpreted as low-grade transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). Voided specimens with prolonged exposure to concentrated urine or specimens from females that are contaminated with vaginal, cervical, or endometrial cells can also be misinterpreted. Cytology specimens should be processed promptly, as cells will degrade after 10 to 15 minutes at room temperature. One study showed a lower diagnostic yield with voided urine specimens when compared with bladder washings [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17

         ]. Chronic urinary tract infections, inflammatory conditions, stone disease, recent instrumentation or intravesical therapy, and bowel substitutions for the bladder (eg, ileal conduits or orthotopic neobladders) can create degenerative cellular changes and atypia, which can be misinterpreted.

         Multiple urine-based tumor markers have been developed because of the low sensitivity of cytology and the need for a noninvasive diagnostic tool to supplement cystoscopy. These urine biomarkers are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         Urine-based tumor markers have been developed that are based on differential expression of tumor-related proteins, DNA, RNA, methylation changes, or cellular markers [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19
         </a>
         ]. The pooled sensitivity of urine-based tumor markers ranges from 50 to 80 percent, and specificity ranges from 70 to 90 percent, depending on the analysis [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19
         </a>
         ]. The sensitivity of markers and cytology correlates closely with stage and grade.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most urine-based molecular markers are more sensitive than urine cytology in the detection of urothelial cancer, especially for low-grade tumors, but the specificity of molecular markers is inferior to that of urine cytology. These urinary markers may enhance risk stratification and shared decision-making over only clinical factors [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. However, their routine use is not recommended by the American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines on management of hematuria [

        <p>
         None of these markers has sufficient sensitivity to replace cystoscopy in the assessment of an individual suspected to have bladder cancer, and their clinical use has not been recommended by consensus panels. There is potential benefit for surveillance in patients with a history of urothelial cancer by reducing the frequency of cystoscopy. There is evidence that use of markers such as a fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assay or RNA panels [

         Imaging studies may be used to define the location and extent of tumor as well as to detect sites of multifocal disease. CT scan is replacing IVP as the procedure of choice, but IVP remains an appropriate alternative where CT is not readily available.

         ]. CT scans should include both the abdomen and pelvis, and should include delayed images to identify defects in the collecting system. CT may demonstrate extravesical extension, nodal involvement in the pelvis or retroperitoneum, visceral, pulmonary, or osseous metastasis, and tumor involvement or obstruction of the upper urinary tract.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although CT provides better visualization of tumors than US, it may miss tumors &lt;1 cm in size, particularly those in the bladder trigone or dome, and it cannot differentiate depth of bladder-wall invasion (ie, mucosal versus lamina propria or muscularis propria).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although a thickened bladder wall on CT suggests the presence of muscle invasive disease, tissue is required for diagnosis. In contrast, CT is approximately 80 percent accurate in differentiating locally advanced tumors involving extravesical adipose tissue or surrounding structures from less invasive tumors  (

         An IVP can visualize both the bladder and upper urinary tracts. IVP is an appropriate choice for patients with microscopic or gross hematuria or suspected urothelial cancer [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,29

         ]. IVP is more sensitive for detection of small lesions of the ureter or renal pelvis, while CT scan and renal US are better tests for the evaluation of renal parenchymal disease. Ideally, if IVP is obtained, it should be done prior to TURBT to avoid misinterpretation of postoperative changes. (See

         IVP may not be appropriate in patients with renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, or other conditions due to the risk of acute renal injury. IVP may also not be appropriate in patients with a history of allergies to radiocontrast agents, although prophylactic corticosteroids and antihistamines may be useful. In patients in whom the ureters and renal pelvis are poorly visualized by IVP, retrograde pyelograms may be performed during cystoscopy. (See

         The cystogram phase of the IVP detects 60 to 85 percent of large bladder tumors, but smaller tumors are missed more frequently. Both the cystogram phase and the post-void film should be examined for filling defects  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68718" href="/z/d/graphic/68718.html" rel="external">
          image 2
         </a>
         ), which are usually irregular, frond-like, or nodular, and persistent from film to film. Filling defects may be the result of parietal tumor implantation, the uneven jagged contours of papillary fronds, or obstruction of a ureter with proximal dilation. The classic urographic findings of an upper tract TCC are a meniscus-shaped ureteral filling defect known as the "goblet" or "Bergmann" sign and the "stipple sign," produced by contrast being trapped in the fronds of a papillary tumor.
        </p>
        <p>
         Approximately 50 percent of patients with a filling defect in the renal pelvis or ureter will have associated hydronephrosis, hydroureter, or nonvisualization of the kidney secondary to obstruction [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. Invasive bladder tumors may cause distal ureteral obstruction and secondary hydronephrosis. Although the lack of this finding does not rule out invasive disease, its presence signals an invasive cancer in over 90 percent of cases and extravesical disease in 70 percent [
         <a href="#rid31">

         MRI is as reliable as CT for staging of invasive or locally advanced disease and may be better at evaluating tumors at the base and dome of the bladder.

         Radionuclide bone scans to detect bone metastases are recommended only in patients with invasive or locally advanced tumors and either skeletal symptoms or unexplained elevations in serum alkaline phosphatase. Increased uptake is a nonspecific finding, which may be due to degenerative change, trauma, and previous fracture sites, as well as metastatic disease.

         Stage is the most important independent prognostic variable for progression and overall survival for invasive bladder cancer. The eighth edition (2017) of the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is used to stage bladder cancer.

         Comprehensive pathologic staging requires cystectomy (with lymphadenectomy). However, clinical staging can be applied for those patients who will undergo neoadjuvant therapy. For patients with non-muscle invasive cancer (Ta, T1, Tis), stage is determined by transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) and bladder biopsies.

         Clinical staging is based on information derived from bimanual examination and imaging studies as well as pathology results from the cystoscopic biopsy or TURBT. However, the initial pathology obtained from cystoscopy specimens does not always accurately reflect the pathologic stage based on radical cystectomy.

         The limitations of clinical staging are illustrated by a study of 778 consecutive patients with bladder urothelial carcinoma who were treated with radical cystectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy [

This included patients thought to have non-muscle invasive disease who had muscle invasion in the pathologic specimen and those thought to have organ-confined clinical stage in whom non-organ confined tumor was identified (≥pT3N0, or any pT and N positive  (

         – The TNM system differentiates tumors extending into adjacent organs (T4) from those extending into perivesical fat (T3). Tumor invading the prostate, vagina, uterus, or bowel is classified as T4a, while tumor fixed to the abdominal wall, pelvic wall, or other organs is T4b. Urothelial tumors may grow into the prostate along the prostatic ducts; these are noninvasive lesions with a good prognosis when resected. Alternatively, they may directly invade the prostatic stroma, which indicates a worse prognosis [

         The most important prognostic determinant that is derived from staging is whether the tumor is organ confined (≤T2) or non-organ confined (≥T3). The accuracy of available methods for determining the degree of muscle invasiveness preoperatively is modest. Even in experienced hands, the correlation between depth of invasion, as assessed by cystoscopic evaluation and TURBT, and the pathologic examination of the bladder at the time of cystectomy is only approximately 70 percent. One study highlighted several features associated with a high risk of T3, T4, and/or node-positive disease, including detection of a three dimensional mass on examination under anesthesia (EUA), hydronephrosis, lymphovascular invasion, and aberrant histology (eg, micropapillary, neuroendocrine) [

         The TNM system categorizes nodal disease based on the number and size of the involved nodes. It also accounts for metastases to specific sites.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the 2017 TNM staging system, a single lymph node metastasis in the true pelvis is considered N1 disease, multiple nodes in the true pelvis are classified as N2 disease, and nodal involvement of the common iliac nodes is classified as a secondary lymphatic drainage area (N3) rather than metastatic disease. Lymph node sampling should include excision of an average of &gt;12 lymph nodes [

         Patients with nodal metastases but without disseminated disease may be treated with cystectomy or combined-modality approaches. (See

         The presence of disseminated metastases (eg, lung, liver, bone) portends the need for systemic therapy. Despite significant advances, the long-term prognosis is poor for most patients. (See

          Clinical presentation
         </strong>
         – Patients with urothelial bladder cancer typically present with painless hematuria. The presence of unexplained hematuria in adults requires evaluation that is based on risk of malignancy. This risk is influenced by patient age, sex, presence of gross or microscopic hematuria, and tobacco exposure. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Cystoscopy
         </strong>
         – Cystoscopy is the initial procedure for both the diagnosis and management of urothelial malignancy. Cystoscopy is used to establish the diagnosis, assess whether or not muscle invasion is present  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef133156" href="/z/d/graphic/133156.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Urine cytology
         </strong>
         – Urine cytology is widely used in combination with cystoscopy to assess for the presence of carcinoma in situ and to evaluate for the presence of upper urinary tract lesions. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Urine cytology'

         <strong>
          CT imaging
         </strong>
         – Computed tomography (CT) is the preferred imaging procedure to assess the local extent of disease and to further examine the renal pelvis and ureters. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Urinary tract imaging'

         <strong>
          Staging
         </strong>
         – Stage is the most important independent prognostic variable for assessing the probability of progression and survival. The standard approach is the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system, which requires cystectomy  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110763" href="/z/d/graphic/110763.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). For patients who will undergo neoadjuvant therapy, clinical staging is appropriate. (See
