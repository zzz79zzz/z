In addition to medications, age-appropriate, nonpharmacologic interventions should always be employed to maximize patient comfort [<a href="#rid5">5-8</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Nonpharmacologic interventions'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For the purposes of this topic, we will use the following definitions regarding the depth of sedation (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16900.html" rel="external">"Procedural sedation in children: Preparation", section on 'Definitions'</a>): </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Analgesia</strong> – Relief of pain without intentionally producing a sedated state. Altered mental status may be a secondary effect of medications administered for analgesia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Minimal sedation</strong> – The patient responds normally to verbal commands. Cognitive function and coordination may be impaired, but ventilatory and cardiovascular function is unaffected.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Moderate sedation/analgesia</strong> – The patient has depression of consciousness but can respond purposefully to verbal commands either alone or accompanied by light touch. Maintains airway and adequate ventilation without intervention. Cardiovascular function is maintained. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Deep sedation/analgesia</strong> – The patient cannot be easily aroused but responds purposefully to noxious stimulation. May require assistance to maintain airway and adequate ventilation. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>General anesthesia</strong> – The patient cannot be aroused. Often requires assistance to maintain airway and positive pressure ventilation.

In contrast to other sedatives where deeper sedation can lead to a higher risk of respiratory suppression, ketamine sedation is characterized by a trance-like, cataleptic state in which the patient experiences profound analgesia and amnesia but generally retains airway protective reflexes, spontaneous respirations, and cardiopulmonary stability [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16900.html" rel="external">"Procedural sedation in children: Preparation", section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>"Procedural sedation" has been defined by the International Committee for the Advancement of Procedural Sedation, which includes representatives from anesthesia, emergency medicine, critical care, pediatrics, dentistry, and gastroenterology, as "the administration of one or more pharmacological agents to facilitate a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure while targeting a state during which airway patency, spontaneous respiration, protective airway reflexes, and hemodynamic stability are preserved, while alleviating anxiety and pain" [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The progression from mild sedation to general anesthesia is a continuum, and patients can easily move from one "level" of sedation to another.</p><p>"Conscious sedation" is an outdated term that is sometimes used to refer to minimal or moderate sedation. Because effective sedation usually impairs consciousness, this term is no longer used when referring to sedation states in children.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1683199"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are no absolute indications for the performance of procedural sedation in children. It may be used for any procedure in which a child's pain or anxiety may be excessive and movement may impede safe performance of the procedure or cause significantly negative emotional sequelae. The need for sedation will vary greatly with a child's developmental or behavioral status. Procedural sedation (at deep levels of sedation) can result in profound muscle relaxation, thereby increasing the successful completion of certain procedures such as the closed reduction of a dislocated joint or displaced fracture. </p><p>The targeted depth of sedation and the selection of medications largely depend upon the procedure performed including expected duration of sedation, the anticipated degree of pain, the experience and credentials of the sedation provider, and patient factors [<a href="#rid4">4,12</a>]. It is important to note that the depth of sedation targeted may not be the depth of sedation actually achieved. All sedation providers must be prepared to rescue patients when the actual depth of sedation exceeds the targeted depth of sedation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/85542.html" rel="external">"Procedural sedation in children: Selection of medications"</a>.)</p><p>The properties of the specific agents with respect to pediatric sedation are listed in the tables and discussed in detail separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef83512" href="/d/graphic/83512.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef83889" href="/d/graphic/83889.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/82857.html" rel="external">"Pediatric procedural sedation: Pharmacologic agents"</a>.)</p><p>A wide range of procedures may warrant sedation in children, including nonpainful imaging procedures (that require no movement), mildly painful procedures (eg, laceration repair), and moderately to severely painful procedures (eg, fracture reduction).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1683207"><span class="h1">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are <strong>no</strong> absolute contraindications to procedural sedation outside the operating room in children. </p><p>Precautions should be taken when preparing to provide procedural sedation to those patients with signs of a difficult airway or significant medical comorbidities (American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] classification III or higher). Those patients with ASA classes III, IV, and V  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113973" href="/d/graphic/113973.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), functional needs, or airway abnormalities warrant consultation with a pediatric anesthesiologist or clinician with similar pediatric sedation/anesthesia expertise. A history of severe sleep apnea or airway abnormality warrants special consideration when planning sedation care. Children who readily obstruct their airway when asleep may do so during sedation and are at risk for excessive response to sedative medications. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16900.html" rel="external">"Procedural sedation in children: Preparation", section on 'Risk classification'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16900.html" rel="external">"Procedural sedation in children: Preparation", section on 'Airway assessment'</a>.) </p><p>True allergic reactions to commonly used sedation medications are rare. However, caregivers may report adverse events with specific classes of agents as follows [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Paradoxical reactions (patient becomes more agitated rather than sedated) may occur with benzodiazepines and barbiturates, especially in younger children. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="16024" href="/d/drug information/16024.html" rel="external">Morphine</a> administration is associated with histamine release that may produce hives, especially in regions of the body where it is administered. Nasal pruritus is described with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13298" href="/d/drug information/13298.html" rel="external">fentanyl</a>.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13298" href="/d/drug information/13298.html" rel="external">Fentanyl</a> is rarely associated with chest wall rigidity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Agitation with emergence, diplopia, nausea, and/or vomiting has been described with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13398" href="/d/drug information/13398.html" rel="external">ketamine</a>. </p><p></p><p>Of these, prior paradoxical reactions with benzodiazepines or emergence phenomenon after <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13398" href="/d/drug information/13398.html" rel="external">ketamine</a> may warrant avoidance of these agents for sedation in individual patients.</p><p>Fasting status is not an absolute contraindication to sedation for urgent or emergency procedures such as laceration repair, fracture reduction, or abscess drainage. However, the provider should evaluate the timing and nature of the last oral intake, the urgency of the procedure, and the risk for aspiration based upon procedural and patient factors (eg, children with higher ASA levels or abnormal airways are at greater risk for adverse events). All of these factors should be taken into consideration when determining the depth and length of procedural sedation. The evaluation of fasting status and impact on timing and depth of sedation for urgent or emergency procedures is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16900.html" rel="external">"Procedural sedation in children: Preparation", section on 'Urgent or emergency procedures'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1683215"><span class="h1">PERFORMING PROCEDURAL SEDATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6090197"><span class="h2">Informed consent</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Before performing procedural sedation, the clinician should obtain written informed consent from the caregiver.

Because depression of consciousness is a continuum and responses to medications vary, clinicians must recognize that targeted and achieved depths of sedation may differ and be prepared to manage complications in patients whose level of sedation becomes deeper than intended or who experience an adverse reaction to medication. Competence in definitive emergency airway management is mandatory if deep sedation is intended or possible and is strongly advised for lighter levels. </p><p>Prior to the start of procedural sedation, the clinician should ensure that monitoring devices are present and functioning properly and that oxygen, oxygen delivery devices, suction equipment, pediatric airway equipment, an emergency cart with appropriate medications, and a defibrillator are immediately available. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16900.html" rel="external">"Procedural sedation in children: Preparation", section on 'Equipment'</a>.)</p><p>Administration of sedation requires personnel with appropriate experience and training.

The accuracy of capnography in reflecting the patient's true partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) is variable and depends on positioning of the sensor, the nature of the patient's breathing (mouth versus nose), and the rapidity with which oxygen is being administered. However, capnography provides early warning of respiratory depression and apnea during procedural sedation. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Significant practice variation exists regarding the use of preoxygenation and continuous supplemental oxygenation during procedural sedation. Although it is recommended for moderate sedation by the American Society of Anesthesiology [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>], evidence is limited to show that preoxygenation or continuous administration of supplemental oxygen in children undergoing procedural sedation is associated with improved safety [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. </p><p>The potential benefits of preoxygenation include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Maximizing bloodstream oxygenation during procedural sedation [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Maximizing lung storage of oxygen [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Maintenance of oxygenation during periods of apnea [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]; for example, children who experience hypopnea or apnea during sedation will have a two- to four-minute delay in oxygen desaturation if they have received preoxygenation [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]</p><p></p><p>Potential harms of preoxygenation include: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unless capnography or direct visualization of chest wall movement occurs continuously throughout sedation, continuous supplemental oxygen [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Delays desaturation as measured by pulse oximetry</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Permits patients to maintain acceptable oxygen saturation despite significant hypoventilation</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>May delay recognition of apnea unless capnography or direct visualization of chest wall movement occurs continuously throughout sedation</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For these reasons, when preoxygenation and continuous supplemental oxygen is provided, then the patient also requires monitoring with continuous capnography or direct visualization of chest wall movement throughout sedation. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Administration of supplemental oxygen to infants and young children may also increase anxiety prior to sedation caused by discomfort associated with the mode of delivery (eg, nasal prongs or face mask).

ETCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring is readily available in most settings for nonintubated patients and may be helpful to assess ventilation during sedation and analgesia. Based upon trials in children, increases or decreases in ETCO<sub>2</sub> may be detected in patients with respiratory depression before hypoventilation or hypoxemia is noted, particularly in those who are receiving supplemental oxygen [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]. Although not always reflective of the patient's true PaCO<sub>2</sub>, ETCO<sub>2</sub> permits more rapid detection of hypoventilation and apnea than clinical assessment alone [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>].</p><p></p><p>Vital signs consisting of heart rate, respirations, and blood pressure should be recorded at specific intervals, including [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Before starting the procedure </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>After the administration of the sedative agent(s) </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>At completion of the procedure</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>During early recovery </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>At completion of recovery </p><p></p><p>If deep sedation is targeted or if a patient has significant underlying illness, vital signs should be measured at least every five minutes. </p><p>Complications from sedation such as respiratory depression are most likely to occur within 5 to 10 minutes after administration of intravenous medication and immediately after the procedure when stimuli associated with the procedure are removed [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Thus, attention to the patient's breathing and monitoring should be especially close during these periods.</p><p>Bispectral index (BIS) is a measure of consciousness obtained by continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring of probes placed on the forehead. The EEG signal is processed by a proprietary computer algorithm. BIS was derived in adults and is used in some settings to monitor for awareness to anesthesia. It has a range of 0 (no brain activity) to 100 (alert). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/400.html" rel="external">"Accidental awareness during general anesthesia", section on 'Brain monitoring'</a>.) </p><p>BIS is not routinely recommended for monitoring of pediatric sedations outside of the operating room. </p><p>BIS is of uncertain value in monitoring children during procedural sedation because it varies in its prediction of sedation depth by patient age and sedative agent. As an example, in a combined analysis of four observational studies, BIS was found to differentiate light from moderate or deep sedation in children with reasonable sensitivity (74 to 83 percent) and specificity (78 to 84 percent). However, BIS differentiated moderate from deep sedation with poor sensitivity (58 to 71 percent) and specificity (57 to 66 percent) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].

For children unable to cooperate, our approach is to maximize nonpharmacological measures to comfort children first. As sedative drugs are administered, obtain a complete set of vital signs and monitor the child visually until the sedative drugs have begun to take effect. At this point, we begin monitoring of pulse oximetry, heart rate, and for children undergoing moderate or deep sedation, capnography with administration of nasal cannula oxygen.

Specifically, is the patient awake and crying/moving, or is the patient in a quiet, nonstressed state during the procedure? We suggest the use of the Pediatric Sedation State Scale (PSSS)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113979" href="/d/graphic/113979.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) to provide a simple means of effectively documenting and rapidly communicating the quality of pediatric sedation relative to the goals of sedation [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Derived from expert opinion and validated using a small sample of patients and observers with high inter- and intra-observer agreement, the PSSS takes no more than 10 minutes to teach and consists of six levels of sedation that report on patient behavior, patient interference with the procedure, need for restraint, and physiologic parameters. </p><p>Assignment of scores may occur at regular intervals (eg, every 5 to 10 minutes). If the PSSS is used routinely for specific procedures, it has the potential to confirm that conditions were acceptable for each patient’s sedation strategy. It may also offer a means to objectively compare different sedation techniques, including nonpharmacologic interventions, as part of quality improvement and clinical research efforts.</p><p>By contrast, scales that simply measure the depth of sedation track only one aspect of this practice because a patient does not necessarily need to be sedated deeply or at all to meet the goals of procedural sedation (see <a class="local">'Goals of sedation and analgesia'</a> above). Many of these scales also do not permit the definition of "dangerous" states where patient physiology is <strong>not</strong> under good control such as hypoxia, hypotension, or bradycardia. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1684879"><span class="h2">Nonpharmacologic interventions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Nonpharmacologic interventions include behavioral and cognitive approaches [<a href="#rid6">6,23-25</a>]. For many children, the use of nonpharmacologic interventions, in addition to effective analgesia for painful procedures, may prevent the need for procedural sedation. In situations where the patient is conscious during the sedation, behavioral and cognitive approaches are complementary to pharmacologic interventions and should be used. These techniques also help to reduce preprocedural agitation, which permits an easier transition to sedation, may reduce the amount of medication required for effective sedation, and may decrease the frequency of adverse events, including emergence phenomena. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/85542.html" rel="external">"Procedural sedation in children: Selection of medications", section on 'Nonpharmacologic interventions'</a>.) </p><p>Behavioral treatments include the techniques of desensitization, distraction, reinforcing coping skills, positive reinforcement, and relaxation [<a href="#rid5">5,7</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Desensitization allows for gradual, increasing exposure to the procedure over a period of time.

The frequency of failed sedation varies among studies and depends upon multiple factors. For example, inadequate sedation that prevented completion of the procedure occurred in 1 out of 338 sedations in a registry study of over 30,000 sedations performed in a variety of hospital settings at multiple centers [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. A separate study that used the same registry found that the frequency of failed sedation with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12741" href="/d/drug information/12741.html" rel="external">propofol</a> during almost 50,000 procedures was 0.6 percent. Finally, in a study of almost 6300 pediatric sedations performed in the emergency department, 0.9 percent of procedures failed due to inadequate sedation, and in 4 percent of patients whose procedures were successful, the children actively resisted and were considered sedation failures.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although evidence is limited, several patient factors may be associated with failed sedations, including presence of an upper respiratory tract infection, a history of obstructive sleep apnea or snoring, ASA class III status, older age, and obesity [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. However, selection of medication and provider decisions about administration also are important factors.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Major adverse events</strong> – When procedural sedation is performed by dedicated and experienced providers outside of the operating room, major adverse events such as aspiration, laryngospasm, cardiac arrest, permanent neurologic injury, and death are rare:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Aspiration</strong> – The risk of aspiration is very low (approximately 1 in 10,000 sedations) as described separately.

For example, in a registry study of prospectively collected data from over 275,000 pediatric sedations (almost all elective) occurring outside of the operating room in the United States, the unadjusted prevalence of laryngospasm was 3.3 per 1000 cases [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. On adjusted analysis, intravenous (IV) <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13398" href="/d/drug information/13398.html" rel="external">ketamine</a> alone (predicted probability 1.7 per 1000 cases [95% CI 0.6 to 2.8/1000]) and IV <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12741" href="/d/drug information/12741.html" rel="external">propofol</a> alone (predicted probability 3.0 per 1000 cases [95% CI 2.2 to 3.9/1000]) had similar rates of laryngospasm. An increased probability of laryngospasm occurred in individuals with a concurrent upper respiratory infection (predicted probability 12.2 per 1000 cases [95% CI 6.3 to 18.1/1000]), and those undergoing airway procedures (predicted probability 9.6 per 1000 cases [95% CI 5.2 to 13.9/1000]). Compared with IV propofol alone, propofol combined with ketamine (7.5 per 1000 cases [95% CI 3.1 to 12/1000]) or propofol combined with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13128" href="/d/drug information/13128.html" rel="external">dexmedetomidine</a> (6.3 per 1000 [95% CI 3.7 to 8.9/1000]) were associated with increased risk. For the factors with the highest likelihood of laryngospasm (concurrent upper respiratory infection or airway procedures), the number needed to harm is estimated at &gt;100 sedations to experience one instance of laryngospasm [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. Emergency airway intervention was required in 10 percent of the 913 patients with laryngospasm; 5.3 percent underwent endotracheal intubation, and 2.3 percent of patients required an unplanned admission or an increase in level of care. Thus, although the risk of laryngospasm is low and most patients developing it have good clinical outcomes, these data provide a strong rationale for all pediatric sedation providers to have airway management expertise. Furthermore, sedation providers should be aware of factors associated with laryngospasm present in individual patients when determining their sedation plan. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Cardiac arrest, permanent neurologic injury, and mortality</strong> – When performed by dedicated pediatric sedation services that are operating in institutions with an established record of safe sedation practice, cardiac arrest, permanent neurologic injury, or death during pediatric sedation is much rarer than aspiration, although precise estimates are lacking.
