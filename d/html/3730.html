         Anorectal symptoms in men who have sex with men (MSM) may be caused by conditions related to infections for which they are at increased risk (eg, proctitis, perianal abscess/anal fistula, anal warts/dysplasia, human papillomavirus-associated anal cancer) or conditions seen in the general population (eg, anal fissure, hemorrhoids, pruritus ani) [

         The anal canal, which is surrounded by internal (involuntary) and external (voluntary) sphincter muscles, extends 2.5 to 3.5 cm to the anal verge (visible lower edge of sphincter) inferiorly. In the mid-point of the anal canal is the dentate line, which is the demarcation between columnar epithelium superiorly and squamous epithelium inferiorly (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62539" href="/z/d/graphic/62539.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Along the dentate line lie crypts, which have small glands at their base. The squamous epithelium between the dentate line and anal verge is called “anoderm,” which is similar to normal skin but highly sensitive, and the squamous epithelium outside the anal verge is the perianal skin.

         The cause of anorectal symptoms in men who have sex with men (MSM) is often suggested by history and physical examination findings (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef114654" href="/z/d/graphic/114654.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Patients should be evaluated by obtaining a detailed history, performing an external rectal exam for visible abnormalities (eg, anal warts, hemorrhoids) and performing a digital rectal exam for palpable abnormalities (eg, perianal abscess, rectal mass). In addition, anoscopy is recommended for patients with rectal pain, bleeding, and/or bloody or purulent discharge and in patients with a palpable abnormality on digital rectal exam. (See
         <a class="local">
          'History'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">
          'Physical examination'

         <a class="local">
          'Anoscopy'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         If digital rectal exam reveals a palpable abnormality that cannot be visualized on anoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy may be used initially to evaluate the cause of anorectal lesions. Depending upon the finding, such as a mass lesion or other lesion suspicious for neoplasia, the patient should be referred for transrectal ultrasound or pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (with and without contrast) to determine if the finding represents a cystic or solid lesion. The former would be suggestive of a perianal abscess, while the latter would raise concern for anal cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tests for gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, and syphilis, should be obtained in all patients and an anal Pap test should be obtained in those who have not had it performed within the past 12 months. We check these studies, even if the clinical presentation is not suggestive of proctitis or human papillomavirus (HPV)-related disease, given the high risk of these pathogens in MSM. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Laboratory studies'

         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         If the patient has unexplained hematochezia following the initial evaluation, sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy is recommended; colonoscopy is recommended in patients ≥45 years old, in whom the risk of premalignant polyps and colon cancer is greater. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6861.html" rel="external">

         History should include a description of current symptoms, prior anorectal issues, and predisposing behaviors or medical conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Rectal pain and bleeding are common symptoms with various anorectal conditions (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef114654" href="/z/d/graphic/114654.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Other historical features might help to narrow the potential causes. Purulent discharge with a history of receptive anal intercourse or prior sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is suggestive of proctitis [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,6
         </a>
         ]. Purulent discharge can also be a manifestation of a draining perianal abscess, which may be associated with fever or chills, or an anal fistula. Rectal bleeding and pain that occur with defecation are characteristic of anal fissure or hemorrhoids. Patients with anal fissure may have a history of receptive anal intercourse, chronic constipation, or prior anal fissures. The presence of weight loss may indicate anal cancer, particularly if there is a prior history of anal warts or dysplasia [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-9
         </a>
         ]. Perianal itchiness is suggestive of pruritus ani. There may be similar prior episodes reported.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the patient has diarrhea as a prominent symptom, proctocolitis or enteritis should be considered as possible etiologies. (See

         Physical examination should include careful inspection of the skin and mucous membranes, as well as palpation of the inguinal lymph nodes for enlargement or tenderness. Visual inspection of the anus should precede digital exam. The external rectal exam may be normal in patients with proctitis, perianal abscess/anal fistula, anal cancer, and anal fissure, but drainage may be visible in some patients with proctitis or perianal abscess/anal fistula (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef114654" href="/z/d/graphic/114654.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Skin-colored papular lesions may be seen externally in patients with anal warts, and dilated veins may be identified in patients with hemorrhoids. Inflamed skin is present in patients with pruritus ani.
        </p>
        <p>
         Digital rectal exam should be performed using 5%
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/z/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">
          lidocaine

         ointment if pain is the presenting symptom. The lubricated pad of the examiner digit should be slowly introduced through the anus, and the finger should be inserted fully into the rectum with circumferential palpation for any abnormalities. Digital rectal exam will generally be normal in patients with anal warts/dysplasia and pruritus ani. It often shows tenderness in patients with proctitis, perianal abscess/anal fistula, anal fissure, and hemorrhoids. As noted above, severe pain on examination suggests ulceration in the anal canal. Submucosal fullness is present in patients with perianal abscess/anal fistula and rectal cancer.

         Because MSM are at increased risk for HPV-related disorders (eg, anal warts/dysplasia, anal cancer), we advise anal Pap testing in all MSM with anorectal symptoms who have not had it performed within the past 12 months. Data are limited to support general screening recommendations for anal Pap testing in MSM or other populations [

         The technique consists of inserting a Dacron swab 2 to 4 cm into the anal canal and rotating it 360 degrees while it is removed very slowly. It is fixed in the same manner and interpreted using identical criteria as a cervical Pap smear (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASCUS], low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [SIL], high-grade SIL).
        </p>
        <p>
         Standardized approaches for the management of anal dysplasia have been developed. If abnormal anal cytology is present, high-resolution anoscopy is recommended. It is performed in a similar manner to colposcopy, utilizing a microscope to better visualize the anal canal, in order to identify abnormal areas and obtain biopsy samples. The tissue is evaluated with both acetic acid (abnormal tissue appears white) and Lugol’s iodine (abnormal tissue does not stain). Histopathology of these biopsy sites allows for grading to determine the severity of disease and further management. Such techniques though may not be widely available. Although abnormal anal cytology is highly predictive of anal dysplasia [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11

         Anoscopy is recommended for patients with rectal pain, bleeding, and/or bloody or purulent discharge and in patients with a palpable abnormality on digital rectal exam. It is performed using a small, rigid, tubular instrument called an anoscope. Lubricant is applied, and the instrument is inserted into the anus, after which the obturator (central conical structure) is removed. Each quadrant of the anal canal is examined with the aid of a bright light as the instrument is slowly removed. Lesions of the anal canal, including internal hemorrhoids, fissures, mucosal abnormalities (eg, warts, proctitis), abscesses, and tumors, can be visualized and biopsied as indicated.

         Causes of anorectal symptoms in men who have sex with men (MSM) range from conditions that result from receptive anal intercourse or other sexual behaviors to common conditions seen in the general population. MSM have increased rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) compared with matched controls [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. These STIs include HIV infection, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, syphilis, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Anogenital HPV infection is associated with a range of clinical manifestations, including anal warts, dysplasia, and cancer [

         Acute proctitis, which is inflammation of the rectum, can be infectious in origin or, less commonly, a manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (see

          "Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of ulcerative colitis in adults"

         <a href="#rid10">
          10

         Infectious proctitis presents with the acute onset of rectal pain, bleeding, and/or purulent discharge often associated with urgency. External rectal exam is usually normal but may show discharge, and digital rectal exam is noteworthy for diffuse tenderness.
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of acute proctitis is suspected from history and physical examination, and the etiology is usually established with STI testing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Proctitis should be distinguished from proctocolitis and enteritis, which both present with abdominal cramping and diarrhea (for proctocolitis, these symptoms occur in association with symptoms of proctitis). Enteric pathogens causing proctocolitis, such as
         <em>

         In men with proctitis, anoscopy may show evidence of mucosal inflammation or friability. The presence of ulcerations may suggest LGV, HSV infection, or syphilis as the cause. A Gram stain should be performed on any discharge to confirm the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. A detailed outline of recommended diagnostic tests is discussed above. (See

         Appropriate clinical follow-up should be arranged to confirm resolution of symptoms. For proctitis associated with gonorrhea or chlamydial infection, testing for reinfection with the respective pathogen should be performed three months after treatment.

Perianal abscess presents with pain, bleeding, and/or discharge, especially with defecation, and may be recurrent. Localized or diffuse tenderness and submucosal fullness are present on digital rectal exam. Anal fistula presents as a “non-healing” perianal abscess or with chronic purulent discharge.

External rectal exam is generally normal, and a nontender firm mass is often detectable on digital rectal exam. The diagnosis of anal cancer is suggested by physical examination and confirmed by transrectal ultrasound or pelvic MRI scan (with and without contrast) followed by biopsy. Management, which consists of chemoradiation, is described elsewhere. (See

         Anal fissure is a longitudinal tear in the lining of the anal canal distal to the dentate line (

          picture 3

         ). A fissure can be primary (eg, resulting from local trauma) or, less commonly, secondary to an underlying medical condition (eg, malignancy, infection, Crohn disease). Anal fissure, which may be recurrent, presents with intense pain, which is especially noticeable with defecation, and intermittent bleeding. The blood is bright red and may drip into the toilet with defecation or be noted on the toilet paper. The fissure is often located on the posterior anal midline and may be seen on anoscopy. They occur more frequently in MSM who engage in receptive anal intercourse and are also associated with chronic constipation. The diagnosis of anal fissure is established by physical examination.

         Initial management consists of conservative measures (eg, increased dietary fiber, use of a stool softener, sitz baths) in combination with a topical vasodilator (eg,

         ) are normal vascular structures in the anal canal, arising from a channel of arteriovenous connective tissues that drains into the superior and inferior hemorrhoidal veins. They are located in the submucosal layer in the lower rectum and may be external, internal, or mixed based upon their location with respect to the dentate line. Internal hemorrhoids are graded according to the degree to which they prolapse from the anal canal.

         Symptomatic hemorrhoids, which are frequently recurrent, most often present with bleeding, especially with defecation. The blood is bright red and may drip into the toilet with defecation or be noted on the toilet paper. Thrombosed external hemorrhoids are characterized by pain and tenderness. Hemorrhoids, which appear as dilated blood vessels, may be visible on external rectal exam. Digital rectal exam may reveal tenderness, and internal hemorrhoids may be seen on anoscopy. The diagnosis of hemorrhoids is established by physical examination. (See

        <p>
         Initial management of hemorrhoids consists of conservative measures (eg, increased dietary fiber, use of a stool softener, sitz baths); topical analgesic or antiinflammatory creams may be helpful in some cases. For patients who do not respond to conservative management, office-based procedures, including rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, and infrared coagulation, may be warranted. Larger hemorrhoids and those associated with rectal prolapse may require surgical excision. Acutely thrombosed external hemorrhoids, which usually respond to conservative measures, can be managed with office-based excision if pain control is problematic. (See

         Anorectal symptoms in men who have sex with men (MSM) may be caused by conditions related to infections for which they are at increased risk (eg, proctitis, perianal abscess/anal fistula, anal warts/dysplasia, anal cancer) or conditions seen in the general population (eg, anal fissure, hemorrhoids, pruritus ani) (

         The cause of anorectal symptoms in MSM is often suggested by history and physical examination findings (

         ). Patients should be evaluated by obtaining a detailed history, performing an external rectal exam for visible abnormalities, and performing a digital rectal exam for palpable abnormalities. In addition, anoscopy is recommended for patients with rectal pain, bleeding, and/or bloody or purulent discharge and in patients with a palpable abnormality on digital rectal exam. If digital rectal exam reveals a palpable abnormality that cannot be visualized on anoscopy, the patient should be referred for transrectal ultrasound or pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (with and without contrast) to determine if the finding represents a cystic or solid lesion.

          Proctitis
         </strong>
         − Infectious proctitis presents with the acute onset of rectal pain, bleeding, and/or purulent discharge. External rectal exam is usually normal but may show discharge, and digital rectal exam is noteworthy for diffuse tenderness. Sexually transmitted infection tests should include anal swabs for gonorrhea (nucleic acid amplification test [NAAT] or culture), chlamydia (NAAT), herpes simplex virus (HSV; polymerase chain reaction [PCR] testing of rectal lesions preferred), syphilis (darkfield microscopy of lesion, if available, in addition to blood serology), and mpox. An anal Pap test should be performed as well if it has not been performed within the past 12 months. Antibiotic therapy for infectious proctitis should be given pending diagnostic study results (
