Without a formal checkout procedure, anesthesia providers are not likely to detect all machine problems. A prospective study published in 1984 noted that fewer than 5 percent of a sample of attendees at a professional anesthesia meeting could find all five faults intentionally created in an anesthesia machine (the average number of faults detected was 2.2) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. In a 2007 follow-up study, attendees found an average of 3.1 of five intentionally created faults [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Notably, formal checklists were not used by the participants in these studies.</p><p>A number of national and international organizations have created pre-use checklists for the anesthesia workstation. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Anesthesia Machine Checkout Recommendations are used in the United States  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef101563" href="/d/graphic/101563.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Similar anesthesia workstation checkout recommendations have been published in other countries (eg, the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland [AAGBI] and the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists [ANZCA]) [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. The ASA recommendations are unique since they specify that some checks can be routinely accomplished by support personnel (eg, anesthesia technicians) to ensure compliance and lessen clinician workload.</p><p>Since no single checkout procedure is applicable to all machines, the ASA and other professional society recommendations are meant to serve as general guidelines and should be modified as necessary for the anesthesia delivery system(s) available in a local practice as well as the patient population. For example, when caring for infants under 10 kg, it is especially important to expand the breathing system hoses prior to performing the compliance compensation portion of a self-check [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>With advances in integrated computer technology, many new anesthesia workstations perform an automated pre-use checkout when powered on. Electronic prompts on the workstation screen communicate additional steps that the anesthesia provider must perform to complete the non-automated portions of the checkout procedure. In one prospective study, the proportion of cases with failure to perform all necessary pre-induction steps decreased from 10 to 6.4 percent before and after implementation of a computerized pre-induction anesthesia checklist [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2478254467"><span class="h2">American Society of Anesthesiologists Anesthesia Machine Checkout</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the United States, the ASA Anesthesia Machine Checkout Recommendations are most commonly used  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef101563" href="/d/graphic/101563.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).

(See <a class="local">'American Society of Anesthesiologists Anesthesia Machine Checkout'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Wrong gas administration due to a misconnection of pipeline tubing or a cylinder that was filled with the wrong gas would be difficult to detect. Notably, this situation is very rare, but potentially devastating. This is another reason to calibrate the oxygen analyzer as part of the pre-use checkout of the anesthesia machine, thereby ensuring that the oxygen analyzer reads 21 percent in-room air and &gt;90 percent when the breathing system is flushed with oxygen  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef101563" href="/d/graphic/101563.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The oxygen analyzer is the only device that can definitively tell the anesthesiologist what percent oxygen is being delivered to the patient. (See <a class="local">'Standardized anesthesia machine checkout'</a> above and <a class="local">'Oxygen analyzer'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis </strong>– There is only an alarm for low oxygen supply pressure. If the supply pressure of any gas is low, the flowmeter reading for that gas will be lower than the expected setting, or even zero. Gauges on the anesthesia workstation show the pressures of all compressed gases. Pipelines should nominally supply gases at 45 to 55 psig (310 to 380 kPa). A full oxygen cylinder has a pressure of 2000 psig (13,790 kPa) and contains 625 L of oxygen; however, cylinder gauges show the correct pressure only if the cylinder is open.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">An inspired oxygen alarm (low or high) may indicate wrong gas administration due to misconnection anywhere in the gas supply chain (eg, wrong gas in cylinder, wrong gas in the pipeline, misconnected hose). Wrong gas administration should be suspected whenever steady-state gas concentrations in the breathing circuit are dramatically different than those predicted from compressed gas flowmeter settings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Response </strong>– In the event of low oxygen supply pressure during a case, open the oxygen cylinder, conserve anesthesia machine oxygen supply (turn off auxiliary flowmeter if in use, lower fresh gas oxygen flow, turn off pneumatically driven ventilator), and obtain additional backup cylinders.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the event of a wrong gas coming from the oxygen pipeline, it is critically important to disconnect the anesthesia machine from the oxygen pipeline source and open the backup cylinder. If the backup cylinder is opened while the pipeline source is still connected the problem will persist since gases are preferentially drawn from the pipelines instead of the cylinders (ie, cylinder pressures are reduced to ≤45 psig by a regulator inside the anesthesia machine).

If the tubing compliance changes after the checkout (eg, by stretching out the tubing or adding additional tubing), then the derived tidal volumes will be overestimated [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Very small tidal volumes (eg, those used for neonates) may trigger a false apnea alarm. The clinician must confirm that ventilation is actually appropriate by observing respiration, auscultating the chest, and thoroughly checking all respiratory monitors, including CO<sub>2</sub>, airway pressure, and pulse oximetry readings. However, disabling the apnea-flow alarm may be appropriate in this instance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevention</strong> – Basic function of the airway flowmeter(s) is confirmed when the breathing circuit is tested for gas flow during inspiration and exhalation. The breathing circuit pressure test checks for leaks in the flowmeter housing or connections. To maximize flowmeter accuracy, the user should extend breathing circuit tubing before performing any pre-use automated checkout that includes compliance testing. For some machines, it is necessary to ensure appropriate preset gas compensation settings by entering the anesthetic gas that will be used when performing the pre-use machine checkout.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – Flowmeter accuracy is not routinely checked by the user, and measured tidal volumes may be different from ventilator set tidal volumes. In general, measured tidal volumes are less accurate than set tidal volumes with a piston ventilator (assuming that breathing system compliance and leak volume has not changed since the automated pre-use checkout). Also, in general, measured tidal volumes are more accurate than tidal volumes indicated on a bellows housing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Response</strong> – Since many alarms and ventilator settings are dependent on a functioning airway flowmeter, an anesthetic should not be started if a broken airway flowmeter is suspected. If a hot wire anemometer filament burns out during an anesthetic, the sensor should be replaced immediately after the case ends.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2403854314"><span class="h1">BACKUP EQUIPMENT FOR OXYGENATION AND VENTILATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If malfunction of the anesthesia machine occurs during anesthetic administration and the problem is not resolved immediately, positive pressure ventilation is initiated with a self-inflating manual ventilation device and an auxiliary oxygen cylinder. A total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) technique may be employed until the problem is resolved or a replacement machine is available. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96308.html" rel="external">"Maintenance of general anesthesia: Overview", section on 'Total intravenous anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p>Missing backup equipment for oxygenation and ventilation may result in inability to oxygenate and ventilate a patient if anesthesia machine malfunction occurs. Thus, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Anesthesia Machine Checkout Recommendations stipulate that a full auxiliary backup oxygen "E" cylinder and a self-inflating manual ventilation device should always be available on the anesthesia workstation for emergency use. This is a critical part of the pre-use anesthesia machine checkout procedure (item #1)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef101563" href="/d/graphic/101563.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. If needed, additional oxygen "E" cylinders are typically available in several nearby locations in the operating room suite because they are often used for brief periods during patient transport within the hospital.</p><p>Failure to oxygenate and/or ventilate is a major cause of anesthesia morbidity and mortality [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>]. When a critical anesthesia workstation malfunction results in an inability to ventilate the patient, fixing the root cause may distract the clinician for several minutes. For this reason, the anesthesia provider should rapidly employ backup equipment if the patient cannot be ventilated, while a second anesthesia provider or technician is called to find and fix the cause of the malfunction and/or bring a second anesthesia machine to serve as a replacement.</p><p>The ASA recommendations also specify that airway suction equipment (which is attached to the side of the anesthesia machine in many institutions) should be checked by the anesthesia provider before a procedure begins (item #2)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef101563" href="/d/graphic/101563.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), to ensure that it is sufficient to clear the patient's airway. Missing components of the suction apparatus, system leaks, occluded tubing, insufficient tubing length, and incorrectly set vacuum settings are common causes of suction malfunction.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3729403164"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>General principles </strong>– Anesthetic care is provided using an anesthesia machine and integrated monitors (ie, the anesthesia workstation) that include systems for (see <a class="local">'General principles'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Blending a precision mixture of gases (anesthesia machine, respiratory gases, anesthetic gases and vaporizers)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Dispensing those gases to the patient (anesthesia breathing system)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Delivering positive pressure ventilation (anesthesia ventilator)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Removing waste gases (scavenger system)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Monitoring respiratory and machine function (integrated system monitors)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anesthesia machine checkout </strong>– The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Anesthesia Machine Checkout  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef101563" href="/d/graphic/101563.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), or similar recommendations should be performed daily, and selected items should be checked before administration of each anesthetic to prevent anesthesia workstation misuse or failure.
