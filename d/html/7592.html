         The majority of genital ulcers are caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs), although there are noninfectious etiologies that should be considered once STIs have been ruled out.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the United States, the most common cause of genital ulcer disease (GUD) is herpes simplex virus, followed by syphilis. Outbreaks of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) have also been reported, mainly in populations of men who have sex with men. Other sexually transmitted pathogens causing genital ulcers are less common in the United States but may be more prevalent in other parts of the world. The presence of genital ulcers is a risk factor for the transmission of HIV.
        </p>
        <p>
         The challenge for the clinician is to determine the cause of the genital ulcer in order to institute appropriate therapy and to decrease the risk of transmission to others. However, determining the etiology can be complicated due to limitations of current diagnostic testing modalities and the fact that more than one infection may coexist.
        </p>
        <p>
         The approach to the patient with genital ulcers is discussed below. More detailed information regarding the individual infections can be found in the relevant topic reviews:

         Non-sexually acquired acute genital ulceration (NAGU), also referred to as "Lipschütz ulcer," is a rare vulvar skin condition that is thought to be an immune response to a recent infection (eg, EBV, cytomegalovirus, mycoplasma, and Lyme disease) [

         During the initial assessment of a patient with genital ulcers, individuals should be evaluated for the presence of a sexually transmitted infection (STI). These infections are the most common cause of genital ulcer disease (GUD), and can be transmitted to others. In addition, genital ulcers increase the risk of acquiring HIV.
        </p>
        <p>
         The initial evaluation should include:

         Empiric treatment is often initiated based upon the history and physical examination since results of testing are often not immediately available and/or some assays have low sensitivity  (

         Some patients will have a negative evaluation and/or will not respond to empiric therapy. For such patients, further evaluation for less common sexually transmitted causes of GUD and non-sexually acquired causes of GUD may be needed. (See

         The sexual history can help dictate the type of diagnostic testing that should be performed, as well as the need/choice of agent for empiric therapy. As an example, in the United States, syphilis should be considered in all men who have sex (MSM) who present with a genital ulcer since the majority of new cases occur in this population [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>

         The evaluation of a patient with genital ulcers should include a thorough travel history, including questions about sexual activity with new partners and involvement in sex tourism. Understanding the relative prevalence of various pathogens in a particular geographic area also helps to inform the selection of appropriate diagnostic tests and the choice of empiric therapy.

         In the United States, genital herpes related to herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 or HSV-2) is the most common ulcerative STI followed by syphilis. Outbreaks of LGV have been reported amongst MSM [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18

          Painless versus painful ulcer
         </strong>
         – When formulating a differential diagnosis, it is helpful to know if an ulcer is painless or painful. Ulcers associated with syphilis, LGV, and granuloma inguinale are usually painless, while painful ulcers tend to be more typical of HSV and chancroid. Limited data suggest the lesions associated with monkeypox also appear to be painful [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8

         ]. (See

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         However, a diagnosis made solely on the presence or absence of pain may be misleading and, in the absence of obvious vesicles that strongly suggest genital herpes, is unreliable for making an etiologic diagnosis. (See

         Patients with primary genital HSV can occasionally present as a single ulcer or a fissure in the genital area. In addition, there are a wide range of symptoms. For many patients, initial infection is associated with painful ulcers, dysuria, fever, tender inguinal lymphadenopathy, and/or headache; however, other patients may have only mild symptoms or may be entirely asymptomatic. Herpetic ulcers can also manifest as a sensation of pruritus rather than pain, which, in women, may be misdiagnosed as a vaginal yeast infection. (See

          Herpes simplex virus (HSV)

         – During the workup of a patient with new genital ulcers, we obtain testing for herpes simplex. However, repeat HSV testing is generally not necessary in a patient with prior laboratory-confirmed genital HSV and with clinical manifestations consistent with recurrent disease.

         To test for HSV, the lesion should be swabbed and directly tested for HSV. Nucleic acid amplification methods (NAATs), including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, are now commercially available and are the test of choice, as they have a higher sensitivity than culture or direct immunofluorescent antibody testing [

         Other types of tests are also available, but these are less sensitive and generally not recommended.

          Other STIs

         – Patients with an ulcerative sexually transmitted infection (STI) are at increased risk for coinfection with other STIs. Thus, individuals should also be tested for HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. In certain populations, testing for hepatitis B and hepatitis C may also be considered. STI screening recommendations for select populations are reviewed in detail elsewhere and summarized in the table  (

In the United States, FDA-cleared NAATs for chlamydia trachomatis will detect the LGV serovars but will not distinguish LGV serovars from the more typical D-K serovars.

         In most clinical settings, there are few reliable point-of-care diagnostic tests (eg, rapid serum rapid plasma reagin [RPR] or darkfield microscopy for syphilis). Thus, most results will not be immediately available, and empiric therapy may need to be initiated while awaiting results  (

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, despite testing, approximately 25 percent of all patients with genital ulcers may not have a specific etiologic agent identified [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. Some of the assays have low sensitivity (eg, viral culture for herpes simplex virus [HSV], syphilis IgG during primary syphilis) [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. More sensitive assays, such as real-time HSV polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), are more costly to perform and are often unavailable in emergency rooms, sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics, and resource-limited settings, though this may change in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         Empiric treatment decisions are based primarily upon the clinical evaluation and sexual history. Knowledge of the local epidemiology of the agents that cause genital ulcers in a given geographic area can also be instructive, particularly in the setting of an outbreak. Public health departments can often provide helpful information since syphilis, chancroid, and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) are reportable infections in most jurisdictions. (See

         We also treat patients with genital ulcers suggestive of syphilis if they are unlikely to return for follow-up and/or abstain from sexual contact until the diagnostic workup is completed. Treatment of primary syphilis is important to both prevent transmission and the development of secondary, tertiary, and neurosyphilis. (See

         We do not routinely initiate empiric treatment for LGV; however, it is reasonable to provide empiric therapy in an outbreak setting if the patient has appropriate risk factors (eg, HIV-infected MSM), particularly if the patient has significant inguinal lymphadenopathy. It is also reasonable to initiate empiric therapy in patients with genital ulcers and significant inguinal lymphadenopathy if they engaged in high-risk sexual behaviors in an area where LGV is endemic.

         Repeat testing for syphilis can be performed two to four weeks after the initial test in patients who were not empirically treated if there is a high suspicion of infection. A negative initial treponemal or nontreponemal test for syphilis does not rule out the possibility of infection in a patient with genital ulcers. (See

         We do not empirically treat contacts of patients with genital herpes simplex virus (HSV). However, such patients should be counseled and educated about the symptoms and presentation of HSV.

         Knowledge of prevalence rates of the various etiologies of genital ulcers in a given area can be helpful in making a diagnosis, particularly when the clinical picture is not clear. If surveillance data are inaccurate, certain infections can be under-recognized and undertreated [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,46
         </a>
         ]. However, even with a thorough evaluation, more than 25 percent of patients who have genital ulcers have no laboratory-confirmed diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Accurate diagnoses are also important from a public health standpoint, since treatment of sexual contacts of patients with syphilis, chancroid, and lymphogranuloma venereum is important in curbing the spread of these infections. Diagnosis and treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) decreases viral shedding and, subsequently, the risk of HSV transmission. However, treatment of HSV has not been shown to decrease the risk of HIV transmission from patients who are coinfected with both HSV and HIV. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16254.html" rel="external">

         It is important that patients have a confidential, easily accessible setting where they can go for screening and treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Many STI clinics offer services for no fee as part of their mission to diagnose and control the spread of infection. Introduction of even a modest clinic fee of USD $15 for Denver residents during a budget shortfall led to 3250 fewer STI clinic visits in 2003 (a decline of 29 percent) compared with the previous year [

          Etiologies of genital ulcer disease
         </strong>
         – Genital ulcers can result from infectious as well as noninfectious causes. There are five sexually transmitted pathogens that cause most genital ulcer disease (GUD): herpes simplex virus types I and II (HSV-1, HSV-2);
         <em>
          Treponema pallidum
         </em>
         (the causative agent of syphilis);
         <em>
          Haemophilus ducreyi
         </em>
         (the causative agent of chancroid);
         <em>
          Chlamydia trachomatis
         </em>
         serovars L1-3 (the causative agents of lymphogranuloma venereum [LGV]); and
         <em>
          Klebsiella
         </em>
         (
         <em>
          Calymmatobacterium
         </em>
         )
         <em>
          granulomatis
         </em>
         (the causative agent of granuloma inguinale, also known as "donovanosis"). (See

         <strong>
          Initial evaluation
         </strong>
         – The initial evaluation of a patient with genital ulcers should assess for the presence of a sexually transmitted infection (STI)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81735" href="/z/d/graphic/81735.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ); such infections can be transmitted to others and can increase the risk of acquiring HIV. Evaluation for non-sexually acquired causes of GUD as part of the initial evaluation should be determined on a case by case basis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'General approach'

         When obtaining a history from patients with genital ulcers, it is important to assess their sexual risk behaviors and where they (or their sexual contacts) reside, as well as pertinent clinical signs and symptoms (eg, if the lesions are painful, the presence of constitutional symptoms). (See
         <a class="local">

         On physical examination, the number of lesions, their appearance, and the presence of adenopathy may suggest one diagnosis over another. However, the clinician may be mistaken if the diagnosis is made solely on this basis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Physical examination'

         Most patients with genital ulcers should have a diagnostic evaluation for HSV and syphilis, regardless of their symptoms. They should also be tested for HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, since patients with an ulcerative STI are at increased risk for coinfection with other STIs. Additional testing for chancroid, LGV, or granuloma inguinale will depend upon the patient's risk factors. (See

          Empiric therapy
         </strong>
         – Clinicians are often faced with lack of diagnostic test results at the initial patient encounter and concerns regarding patient follow-up. We initiate empiric therapy for the following patients with genital ulcers, rather than waiting for diagnostic test results: patients with a known exposure to an STI; patients with genital ulcers suggestive of HSV; and patients with an ulcer suggestive of syphilis (eg, painless ulcer) if they are at high risk for syphilis or may not follow up.

          Follow-up
         </strong>
         – A follow-up evaluation is essential for patients to review the results of initial testing and be certain a clinical response has been obtained if empiric therapy was initiated. If the patient continues to have ulcerative lesions or constitutional symptoms develop, further evaluation for less common sexually transmitted causes of GUD and non-sexually acquired causes of GUD may be needed.
