Potential forms of treatment include supplemental oxygen, pharmacologic agents, and nocturnal ventilatory support. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7680.html" rel="external">"Sleep-related breathing disorders in COPD"</a>.)</p><p>The use of nocturnal ventilatory support in the management of patients with stable COPD will be reviewed here. The management of acute exacerbations of COPD and sleep-related breathing disorders in COPD are discussed separately.

Some patients are able to partially compensate by increasing their minute ventilation, but others are not, possibly related to respiratory muscle weakness and other issues listed below. </p><p>Respiratory muscle weakness in patients with COPD probably results from a number of factors including the following [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Change in configuration of the diaphragm caused by hyperinflation, which puts the diaphragm at a mechanical disadvantage</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Compromised nutrition, which is commonly encountered in severe COPD (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1440.html" rel="external">"Malnutrition in advanced lung disease"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Presumed "exhaustion" from the excessive resistive load imposed by the underlying disease</p><p></p><p>The evaluation of respiratory muscle weakness in COPD is described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1452.html" rel="external">"Respiratory muscle training and resting in COPD", section on 'Respiratory muscle resting'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H275376426"><span class="h2">Rationale for respiratory muscle rest</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It has been hypothesized that nocturnal noninvasive ventilation (NIV) can improve both nocturnal and daytime respiratory function in patients with advanced COPD by providing periods of rest for weakened respiratory muscles. The evidence related to this hypothesis is of limited quality and conflicting, as described below [<a href="#rid1">1-7</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pro</strong> – The possibility that respiratory muscle rest might improve respiratory muscle function in patients with severe stable COPD was initially examined by having patients sleep in an iron lung, a form of noninvasive negative pressure ventilation [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. It was noted that the respiratory muscle effort could be markedly reduced over the short term during assisted ventilation, implying respiratory muscle "rest" [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In two case series examining the effects of nocturnal NIV, improvement in daytime gas exchange was noted, and this was sustained over long periods of time, sometimes even years [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. A reduction in daytime arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) appeared to parallel increases in indices of respiratory muscle strength and endurance, supporting the belief that respiratory muscle rest with nocturnal assisted ventilation was responsible for the benefit [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Nocturnal muscle rest may also lead to other improvements in daytime respiratory function, such as a decrease in hyperinflation. This was examined in a series of 46 patients with stable hypercapnic COPD who used nocturnal positive pressure NIV. In addition to a significant reduction in hypercapnia, hyperinflation was reduced based on decreases in the ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity (RV/TLC, a measure of air trapping) at 6 and 12 months. Inspiratory capacity (IC), vital capacity (VC), and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) also improved, consistent with a reduction in hyperinflation and a favorable change in diaphragm configuration [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Con</strong> – An alternative hypothesis is that, in advanced COPD, the diaphragm spontaneously adapts to the increased respiratory load to avoid fatigue, and that resting the diaphragm muscle may have little impact on function. This is supported by the observation that biopsies of the diaphragm in patients with severe COPD and hyperinflation show an increased proportion of type-I, or slow-twitch fibers, and a decreased proportion of type-II, or fast-twitch fibers, relative to normal controls and individuals with mild airways obstruction [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. These histopathologic changes are similar to those seen in the limb muscles of athletes undergoing endurance training and make the diaphragm more resistant to fatigue.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h1">PATIENT SELECTION FOR NOCTURNAL NIV</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H77956021"><span class="h2">Chronic stable hypercapnia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Nocturnal noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is indicated for a small portion of patients with COPD who have chronic hypercapnia [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. While guidelines vary, the most common COPD patients for whom nocturnal NIV is used are those with daytime hypercapnia (eg, arterial carbon dioxide tension [PaCO<sub>2</sub>] ≥52 mmHg), oxygen desaturation during sleep (eg, pulse oxygen saturation [SpO<sub>2</sub>] ≤88 percent for ≥5 minutes of ≥2 hours of nocturnal sleep oximetry) despite the use of supplemental oxygen at ≥2 L/min, which is required for Medicare reimbursement, and those with an acute exacerbation that necessitated use of continuous NIV during the hospitalization [<a href="#rid9">9-11</a>]. The 2020 American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines suggest using a resting PaCO<sub>2</sub> &gt;45 mmHg (not during exacerbation) as a threshold for NIV, but this is not supported by randomized trials and does not permit reimbursement by any payers [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2114010625"><span class="h2">NIV initiated during exacerbation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with severe, hypercapnic COPD who have a favorable experience with NIV during a hospitalization for an acute-on-chronic hypercapnic COPD exacerbation may be candidates for long-term nocturnal NIV after discharge. The ATS guidelines advise deferring the decision until after resolution of the acute event (approximately two to four weeks) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], as approximately 20 percent of patients who required NIV in the hospital were no longer hypercapnic two to four weeks after discharge [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. However, individualized decision-making is reasonable particularly in patients with chronic hypercapnia preceding the hospitalization [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. For these patients, we typically obtain outpatient polysomnography (PSG) after the patient has stabilized to identify any additional sleep-related breathing disorders. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7680.html" rel="external">"Sleep-related breathing disorders in COPD", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>During post-discharge monitored PSG, preferably with transcutaneous capnometry, NIV pressure and oxygen settings can be titrated, as needed. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3160097368"><span class="h2">Evaluation for other causes of chronic respiratory failure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For stable patients who have persistent hypercapnia when awake with or without oxygen desaturation during sleep, we obtain polysomnography and an echocardiogram before initiating nocturnal NIV.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Polysomnography to exclude sleep apnea</strong> – Nocturnal hypoxemia or hypercapnia may be caused by superimposed or predominant obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), or less commonly central sleep apnea (CSA). For patients with hypercapnic COPD, screening for sleep-related breathing disorders is advisable prior to NIV initiation [<a href="#rid8">8,13</a>]. In-laboratory PSG is preferred over home sleep testing. However, PSG is not required and may not be necessary for the more cachectic COPD patient with little or no clinical evidence for OSA. The management of sleep-disordered breathing in patients with COPD is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7680.html" rel="external">"Sleep-related breathing disorders in COPD", section on 'Obstructive sleep apnea'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Echocardiogram</strong> – Heart failure (right and left) and pulmonary hypertension can contribute to nocturnal gas transfer abnormalities and should be evaluated by echocardiogram. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3510.html" rel="external">"Heart failure: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7682.html" rel="external">"Sleep-disordered breathing in heart failure"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h1">PRACTICAL ASPECTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once the decision is made to proceed with nocturnal noninvasive ventilation (NIV) for chronic respiratory failure due to COPD, the following components are then addressed  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64422" href="/d/graphic/64422.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h2">Location of NIV initiation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Initiation of NIV in patients with hypercapnic COPD must be performed carefully, to ensure that it does not cause respiratory decompensation. When initiation of NIV occurs in the context of a hospitalization for an exacerbation of COPD, the patient is monitored closely (ie, symptoms, continuous heart rate and blood pressure monitoring, pulse oxygen saturation) to ensure that positive airway pressure (PAP) provides supported ventilation without increasing air trapping [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Generally, the settings that are effective in the hospital can be used at home after discharge. A detailed discussion of NIV initiation during a COPD exacerbation is provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1636.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications"</a>.) </p><p>For patients who have more gradually progressive symptoms and hypercapnia, nocturnal NIV is typically initiated in a hospital environment or in a sleep laboratory (after excluding other sleep-related breathing disorders), where the patient can be closely monitored for evidence of decompensation [<a href="#rid15">15-18</a>]. Depending on the sleep laboratory, nocturnal NIV may be initiated after several hours of polysomnography (PSG) to exclude obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea (CSA).</p><p>The ATS guidelines offer a controversial opinion suggesting home NIV initiation rather than initial in-laboratory overnight polysomnography (PSG) to titrate NIV settings in patients with chronic stable hypercapnic COPD, but qualify this advice as conditional and of very low certainty [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In contrast, most sleep specialists and this author suggest initiation in a monitored setting such as a sleep laboratory or hospital.</p><p>Preliminary evidence in favor of telemonitored home initiation of NIV comes from a trial in which 67 patients with stable COPD and a mean PaCO<sub>2</sub> 55±6.7 mmHg [7.3 ±0.9 kPa] were randomly assigned to home initiation with telemedicine support or hospital initiation [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. The telemedicine connection enabled remote monitoring with transcutaneous carbon dioxide measurement and adjustment of ventilator parameters. At three and six-month follow-up visits, the two groups had similar decrements in PaCO<sub>2</sub> and improvements in quality of life. Further study of advanced telemonitoring is warranted.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4172187678"><span class="h2">Interface</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Selection of an interface is similar to the selection for OSA or nocturnal NIV for other diseases. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7677.html" rel="external">"Titration of positive airway pressure therapy for adults with obstructive sleep apnea", section on 'Choosing the correct patient-device interface'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5114.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Patient selection and alternative modes of ventilatory support"</a>.)</p><p>Several types of nasal and oronasal masks  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62693" href="/d/graphic/62693.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75445" href="/d/graphic/75445.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) are shown to the patient, and selection is based on fit and comfort. Careful sizing is necessary to ensure absence of leak without creating pressure points on the face. A full face mask is used if the patient is a habitual mouth breather. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h2">PAP selection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients whose hypoventilation is due to severe COPD, bilevel PAP (BPAP) is preferred over continuous PAP (CPAP) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In contrast, for those whose symptoms and hypercapnia are largely due to OSA, CPAP may be sufficient. In both instances, the effect of PAP should be formally assessed. Potential alternatives to BPAP devices for nocturnal NIV are the volume and pressure-targeted ventilators. One of these is occasionally necessary in patients with poor synchrony or inadequate ventilation using the BPAP device. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5114.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Patient selection and alternative modes of ventilatory support"</a>.)</p><p>There are no specific data that support the use of a volume-targeted ventilator over a pressure-targeted one in COPD. However, one study exclusively used a volume-targeted ventilator with good results, although the majority of patients suffered from neuromuscular disease [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h2">Protocol for initiation in stable patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The optimal approach for initiation of BPAP for nocturnal NIV has not been determined. We typically start with an expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) level of 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and an inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) of 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and gradually increase. The final IPAP level is urged to be &gt;15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O guided by patient tolerance (range, 12 to 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) with the EPAP level at least 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O lower than the IPAP pressure [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Data from two separate European groups [<a href="#rid12">12,21</a>], as described in more detail below, have shown reduced readmissions and most importantly, improved survival with a targeted effort at improving minute ventilation and reducing hypercapnia more aggressively. These studies have suggested an advantage of adding a backup rate, which is not easily reimbursable in the United States. </p><p>High intensity NIV aims to decrease arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) to normal or near-normal levels, through increases in breathing frequency and airway pressures [<a href="#rid22">22-24</a>]. In a series of 73 patients with hypercapnic COPD, high-intensity NIV with breathing frequencies of 21±3 breaths/min and mean inspiratory/expiratory positive airway pressures of 28±5/5±1 cm H<sub>2</sub>O were used [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. After one year, PaCO<sub>2</sub> decreased 7 mmHg, on average. The two and five year survival rates were 82 percent and 58 percent, respectively. A preliminary randomized trial of 17 hypercapnic patients compared a "low" IPAP (14 to 16 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) with a "high" IPAP (25 to 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) for six weeks and confirmed that the higher level was better tolerated [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Further study is needed to determine the optimal pressures for BPAP in COPD and to assess outcomes such as compliance and quality of life.</p><p>When NIV is initiated electively, the patient should be familiarized with interface and other equipment during the day. It is often helpful to see how the patient tolerates PAP at the proposed settings several hours before sleep. When ready for sleep, the patient is reattached to the BPAP device and observed by the nursing and respiratory therapy or sleep laboratory staff periodically during the night. Once good synchrony and stable patient-ventilator interaction and tolerance are observed, supplemental oxygen is adjusted, if needed, to achieve a saturation of 90 to 93 percent  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64422" href="/d/graphic/64422.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>Those patients who tolerate at least a short period of assistance are deemed initially successful. A careful review of the necessary documentation for certification is undertaken prior to sending the patient home.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h2">Monitoring</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>During initiation, monitoring should focus on the patient's acceptance of the device, level of dyspnea, oxygenation, and stability of vital signs. For more severely ill patients, continuous cardiac, blood pressure, and oximetry monitoring may be used as well as transcutaneous capnometry (tcCO<sub>2</sub>) but this is more expensive and not readily available for most clinicians. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7696.html" rel="external">"Overview of polysomnography in adults", section on 'Measured variables'</a>.)</p><p>Arterial blood gases (ABG) are generally not useful while titrating the initial settings in the more stable patients. However, an ABG obtained in the morning after patients return to their spontaneous breathing state may be useful to guide further titration, if tcCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring is not available. A reasonable goal is for the PaCO<sub>2</sub> to decrease by approximately 5 to 10 mmHg, although the optimal target is not known. As noted above, "high intensity" pressure support aiming to reduce PaCO<sub>2</sub> or tcCO<sub>2</sub> by &gt;4 mmHg has proven beneficial in two randomized trials from Europe [<a href="#rid12">12,21</a>].</p><p>The patient's subjective report of sleep quality and level of dyspnea is also assessed. Formal electroencephalography (EEG) assessment of sleep in the hospital setting is fraught with difficulty, so that we generally rely upon nurses' and therapists' observations to describe the patient response, including apparent quality of sleep and complications such as mask leakage.</p><p>Ongoing evaluation after discharge includes assessment of hours of use per night, quality of sleep, and daytime dyspnea, and also periodic overnight oximetry and daytime arterial blood gases [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. It has become more common to see the patient within the first month after discharge to avoid the costly penalties of the 30 day readmission. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2385211861"><span class="h2">Treatment failure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In our practice, we determine treatment failure based on the following parameters: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient intolerance, as indicated by patient request to discontinue nocturnal assisted ventilation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Worsening dyspnea, hemodynamic instability, or unresponsive hypoxemia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Signs of respiratory failure.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5123.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Adaptation and follow-up after initiation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h2">Humidification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Nasal <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> and/or heated humidification may enhance comfort by decreasing dryness in the upper airway. However, some patients with COPD are particularly sensitive to changes in humidity of inspired air and may prefer to omit humidification. It is important to avoid excess heating that may lead to water condensation, also called "rainout," in the tubing or mask; reducing the temperature setting of the heated humidifier may help reduce rainout.

A comprehensive education program for the patient and appropriate family members when NIV is initiated may help improve adherence. No clear data help predict compliance with nocturnal NIV among COPD patients, although among patients with OSA, those with the most severe sleep disturbances are the ones most likely to comply with CPAP treatment. Therefore, an empiric trial of nocturnal NIV is often the only alternative.

HFNC provides less direct ventilatory assistance than NIV, but the use of high gas flows likely improves ventilatory efficiency and decreases respiratory muscle fatigue in patients with COPD [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. The predominant mechanism is not certain, but a combination of the following processes contributes to the salutary effects: (1) unloading of autoPEEP by low levels of positive airway pressure, (2) decreased inspiratory resistance and inspiratory effort, (3) improved mucus clearance (via heated humidification), and (4) a reduction in upper-airway dead space.
