         Arthropod-borne encephalitis viruses represent a significant public health problem throughout most of the world. These viruses, which belong to the families

          Flaviviridae

         , and
         <em>
          Reoviridae
         </em>
         , are usually highly adapted to particular reservoir hosts and are spread from animal to animal via the bite of an infected arthropod, usually a specific mosquito or tick species  (

         This topic will review the major characteristics of most of the arthropod-borne viral encephalitides. General issues related to viral encephalitis, including clinical manifestations, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, distinction from postinfectious encephalitis and meningitis, and an approach to the patients with suspected central nervous system (CNS) infection are discussed separately.

         The mosquito or tick becomes infected when feeding on the blood of the viremic animal. The virus then replicates in the mosquito or tick tissues, ultimately infecting the salivary glands. The mosquito or tick transmits the virus to a new host when it injects infective salivary fluid while taking a blood meal.
        </p>
        <p>
         The natural animal hosts of these viruses usually remain unaffected and viral circulation generally remains undetected until one of the following occurs:

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Although infected humans may become ill, they usually do not develop sufficient viremia to infect feeding vectors. As a result, humans do not usually contribute to the transmission cycle.

         Among the mosquito-borne encephalitis viruses, the greatest public health threat in North America are posed by the West Nile, St. Louis encephalitis, and La Crosse encephalitis viruses  (

         Among the tick-borne viruses that cause encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis virus has the greatest public health impact worldwide and is of concern to residents of or visitors to northern parts of Eastern Europe and Asia. Powassan virus is a rare, tick-borne cause of encephalitis in the north central and northeastern parts of the United States, eastern Canada, and Russia.

         The close antigenic relationships among the flaviviruses may cause a problem with diagnosis. Individuals who have been recently vaccinated with a heterologous flavivirus (eg, yellow fever, tick-borne encephalitis virus, or Japanese encephalitis vaccines) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ], or who have been recently infected with a related flavivirus, may have a positive serologic test to one or more flaviviruses not causing the current illness. The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), which is the most specific test for the arthropod-borne flaviviruses, may identify serologic cross-reactions among the flaviviruses. However, some degree of cross-reaction in neutralizing antibody may still cause ambiguous results, particularly in persons with previous exposure to a heterologous flavivirus. Cross reactivities of the bunyaviruses and togaviruses causing encephalitis are not as extensive  (

         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. EEE virus is associated with severe clinical disease, whereas human disease from Madariaga virus is infrequent [

         In North America, wild birds and
         <em>
          Culiseta melanura
         </em>
         , a mosquito that is found in swamp areas that support cedar, red maple, and loblolly bay trees, maintain the EEE virus. However, since

         <em>
          Culex
         </em>
         species that are capable of creating a bridge between infected birds and humans are responsible for transmission to humans. Laboratory-acquired EEE infections and transmission of EEE from an organ donor have also been reported [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6

        <p>
         Although infections can occur throughout the year, peak incidence is in August and September. In the United States, human infections are usually sporadic and small outbreaks occur each summer, mostly along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. From 2010 to 2019, 107 cases of EEE were reported, with the largest number of cases identified in Massachusetts, Michigan, Florida, New York, North Carolina, and Georgia [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>

         </span>
         The incubation period is usually 4 to 10 days after the mosquito bite. The illness often begins with a prodrome lasting several days, with fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting being common. Approximately 2 percent of infected adults and 6 percent of infected children develop encephalitis. Once neurologic symptoms begin, the clinical condition deteriorates rapidly, with approximately 90 percent becoming comatose or stuporous. Seizures, and focal neurologic signs, including cranial nerve palsies, develop in approximately one-half of the patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         Leukocytosis and hyponatremia are common on laboratory testing. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis typically shows pleocytosis, often with a neutrophilic predominance and elevated protein concentration. In one case series of 36 patients with EEE, an elevated white cell count in the initial CSF examination and the severity of hyponatremia correlated with a poor prognosis [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ], although these findings were not observed in a series that evaluated a younger population with EEE [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are often abnormal early in the course, with focal lesions in the basal ganglia, thalami, and brainstem being particularly common. However, MRI is more sensitive than CT and may also reveal a symmetric pattern of T2 hyperintensity in the lentiform nuclei [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11

         Electroencephalography reveals generalized slowing and disorganization of the background, and epileptiform discharges may be seen [

         The diagnosis of EEE can be made by demonstration of immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody by capture immunoassay of CSF, a fourfold rise in serum antibody titers against EEE virus, or isolation of virus from or demonstration of viral antigen or genomic sequences in tissue, blood, or CSF [

         EEE virus is the most severe of the arboviral encephalitides, with a mortality of at least 30 percent [

          9
         </a>
         ]. Death can occur within three to five days of onset and, among survivors, complete recovery is uncommon. Sequelae include convulsions, paralysis, and intellectual disability. Infection with Madariaga virus is less severe.

         No specific treatment for EEE is available. In one series, patients treated with anticonvulsants or corticosteroids had worse outcomes than those not treated, a finding possibly resulting from patient selection [

          9

         ]. Several case reports have suggested a possible benefit of intravenous

         <a href="#rid12">
          12,14-16

         Prevention focuses primarily upon avoiding mosquito bites, which includes mosquito control in suburban areas. Although inactivated vaccines are available for horses, there is no commercially available vaccine for humans. However, an inactivated vaccine has been used in laboratory workers and others at high risk of exposure.

         ) is a complex of closely related viruses found in North and South America. Flooding, which increases breeding of Culex mosquitoes, may precipitate summer outbreaks. Large outbreaks in humans and horses occurred in the western United States in the 1950s and 1960s. However, a declining horse population, equine vaccination, and improved vector control have reduced the incidence of the disease. WEE is a potential agent of bioterrorism through the aerosol route.
        </p>
        <p>
         Fewer than 1 in 1000 infected adults develop encephalitis, but the frequency is greater in children, particularly infants [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Following an incubation period of about seven days, headache, vomiting, stiff neck, and backache are typical; restlessness, irritability, and seizures are common in children. Although rare in adults and older children, neurologic sequelae are relatively common in infants. The case fatality rate is 3 to 7 percent.
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of WEE can be made by demonstration of IgM antibody by capture immunoassay of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a fourfold rise in serum antibody titers against WEE virus, or isolation of virus from or demonstration of viral antigen or genomic sequences in tissue, blood, or CSF [

          18

         The diagnosis of LAC can be made by demonstration of IgM antibody by capture immunoassay of CSF, a fourfold rise in serum antibody titers against LAC virus, or isolation of virus from or demonstration of viral antigen or genomic sequences in tissue, blood, or CSF [
         <a href="#rid13">

         <a href="#rid24">
          24

         <a href="#rid24">
          24,25
         </a>

         <a href="#rid23">
          23,26

        <p>
         The diagnosis of MVE can be made by demonstration of IgM antibody by capture immunoassay of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a fourfold rise in serum antibody titers against MVE virus, or isolation of virus from or demonstration of viral antigen or genomic sequences in tissue, blood, or CSF [

        <p>
         Treatment is supportive. Corticosteroids have been administered to patients with MVE but have not been assessed in controlled trials. Approximately 15 to 30 percent of patients with MVE die and about half the survivors have residual neurologic deficits [

         Enzootic strains (ID, 1E, 1F [Masso das Piedras], II [Everglades], III [Mucambo, Tonate], IV [Pixuna], V [Cabassou], VI [Rio Negro]) do not cause epizootics in horses, but may produce sporadic disease in humans.

         mosquitoes.
        </p>

         VEE has a widespread geographic distribution from Florida to South America, where it is an important veterinary and public health problem. Focal outbreaks occur periodically, but occasionally, large regional epidemics occur, with thousands of equine and human infections. VEE is infectious via aerosols, making it an occupational risk to certain laboratory workers and a potential agent of bioterrorism.
        </p>
        <p>
         After an incubation period of one to six days, there is a brief febrile illness of sudden onset, characterized by malaise, nausea or vomiting, headache, and myalgia. Less than 0.5 percent of adults and less than 4 percent of children develop encephalitis, characterized by nuchal rigidity, seizures, coma, and paralysis. Long-term sequelae and fatalities are uncommon.
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of VEE can be made by demonstration of IgM antibody by capture immunoassay of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a fourfold rise in serum antibody titers against VEE virus, or isolation of virus from or demonstration of viral antigen or genomic sequences in tissue, blood, or CSF [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Viremia is usually not detectable in serum. Serum IgM antibodies alone should be confirmed by demonstration of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies.
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment is supportive. Effective prevention of both human and equine disease can be accomplished by immunizing equines, which serve as the primary amplification hosts for the epizootic VEE viruses and without which there would be little human disease. During epidemics, mosquito vectors can be controlled by insecticides. Live attenuated and inactivated vaccines have been used for laboratory workers; however, human vaccines are not commercially available.

         ticks and squirrels. These ticks rarely bite humans. Lineage 2 Powassan virus, sometimes called deer tick virus, is associated with
         <em>
          Ixodes scapularis
         </em>
         ticks and a variety of hosts, including white-footed mice.

         , and anaplasmosis.

        <p>
         Since its discovery in 1958, Powassan virus has become recognized as an uncommon cause of encephalitis in Russia, eastern Canada, and the north central, northeastern, and upper midwestern United States. However, the incidence of Powassan virus infection appears to be increasing [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45,46
         </a>
         ], and from 2010 through 2019, 166 cases of neuroinvasive disease were reported to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mostly from Minnesota, Wisconsin, New York, and Massachusetts [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. Infection mostly occurs from June to September.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reported incubation periods range from 8 to 34 days [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47,48
         </a>
         ]. However, few patients recall a tick bite, since Ixodid ticks are small and can be easily overlooked.
        </p>
        <p>
         Illness begins with a prodromal phase lasting one to three days, during which symptoms such as fever, chills, malaise, somnolence, and nausea and vomiting are commonly reported. The proportion of those infected who develop central nervous system (CNS) symptoms is unknown. CNS symptoms and signs include altered sensorium ranging from confusion to coma, seizures in children, hemiplegia, paresis, tremors, facial palsies, and pyramidal tract signs [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples can be tested for IgM and neutralizing antibodies. The diagnosis of Powassan virus infection can be made by demonstration of IgM antibody by capture immunoassay of CSF, a fourfold rise in serum antibody titers against the virus, or isolation of virus from or demonstration of viral antigen or genomic sequences in tissue, blood, or CSF [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Serum IgM antibodies alone should be confirmed by demonstration of neutralizing antibodies.
        </p>
        <p>
         The case-fatality rate is approximately 10 percent, with a high incidence of residual neurological dysfunction among survivors, including hemiplegia, headaches, minor memory impairment, and persistent ophthalmoplegia [

        <p>
         There is no specific treatment or vaccine. Prevention of tick bites by using repellents, avoiding or clearing brushy areas, wearing light-colored clothing may be effective. Removing ticks soon after outdoor exposure is advisable. Experimental studies suggest that Powassan virus can be transmitted within 15 minutes of tick attachment [

The affected children all tested negative for eight other potential viral causes including Japanese encephalitis (which is responsible for many encephalitis outbreaks in India), West Nile virus, dengue, and measles virus. Chandipura virus was identified by electron microscopy, complement fixation, and neutralization tests. The observation that IgM titers directed against this virus were more frequently identified after four days of illness compared with baseline values provided further evidence supporting its pathogenetic role.

         The mosquito or tick becomes infected when feeding on the blood of the viremic animal. The virus then replicates in the mosquito or tick, ultimately infecting the salivary glands. The vector then transmits the virus to a new host when it injects infective salivary fluid while taking a blood meal. (See

         Although infected humans may become ill, they usually do not develop sufficient viremia to infect feeding vectors. As a result, humans do not usually contribute to the transmission cycle. (See

         Among the mosquito-borne encephalitis viruses, the greatest public health threat in North America is posed by the West Nile, St. Louis encephalitis, and La Crosse encephalitis viruses. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus is of concern in Central and South America, while Japanese encephalitis virus affects persons living or traveling to parts of Asia. (See

         ) consists of EEE virus (formerly EEE subtype I), found in North America and the Caribbean, and Madariaga virus (formerly EEE subtype II to IV), found in South and Central America and Haiti. EEE virus is the most severe of the arboviral encephalitides, with a mortality of at least 30 percent. By contrast, human disease from Madariaga virus is infrequent. There is no specific therapy for EEE. (See

         Western equine encephalitis (WEE) virus is found in North and South America and is a potential agent of bioterrorism through the aerosol route. The case fatality rate is 3 to 7 percent. Although inactivated vaccine has been used for laboratory staff and others at high risk of exposure, it is not commercially available for use in humans. No specific treatment is available. (See

Human infections occur in the central and eastern United States, mostly in school-aged children from July through September. Most infections are asymptomatic; of those who present with encephalitis, the mortality rates are low. Treatment is supportive, with emphasis on control of cerebral edema and seizures.

         <em>
          Culex annulirostris

         Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) has a widespread geographic distribution from Florida to South America, where it is an important veterinary and public health problem. Focal outbreaks occur periodically, but occasionally, large regional epidemics occur, with thousands of equine and human infections. VEE is infectious via aerosols, making it an occupational risk to certain laboratory workers and a potential agent of bioterrorism. Effective prevention of both human and equine disease can be accomplished by immunizing equines, which serve as the primary amplification hosts for the epizootic VEE viruses. (See

         Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) exists over a wide geographical area, including Russia and Europe. Human exposure occurs through work or recreational activities when the ticks are most active. TBE virus is transmitted from the saliva of an infected tick within minutes of the bite; early removal of the tick may not prevent encephalitis. Case fatality rates range from two to eight percent. Treatment is mainly supportive. Powassan virus is related to the eastern hemisphere's tick-borne encephalitis viruses. (See
