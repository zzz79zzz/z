counting</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>During the first half of the 20th century, the CBC was performed using manual techniques that were laborious and imprecise:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cell counting</strong> – Blood cell counts (red blood cells [RBCs], white blood cells [WBC], platelets) were generated manually by spreading blood from a diluted sample onto a slide and performing a Wright-Giemsa stain, on which cells were counted using a ruled counting chamber (hemocytometer). Reticulocytes can be counted as a percentage of total RBCs when stained with a special stain. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4435.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the peripheral blood smear", section on 'Reticulocytes'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hemoglobin concentration</strong> – Hemoglobin was analyzed colorimetrically by the cyanmethemoglobin method.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hematocrit </strong>– The hematocrit (HCT; also called packed cell volume) was measured by high-speed centrifugation of a column of blood, either in a specially designed tube (the Wintrobe tube)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68024" href="/z/d/graphic/68024.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>), or in a sealed microcapillary tube ("spun" hematocrit, often obtained by fingerstick blood collection)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61513" href="/z/d/graphic/61513.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>WBC differential</strong> – The WBC differential was determined from a stained blood smear by counting 100 to 200 WBCs and enumerating neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and immature cells. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>RBC indices</strong> – In 1932, Wintrobe developed a set of indices that estimated RBC size and hemoglobin content. All were calculated manually from the RBC count, hemoglobin concentration, and HCT; the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef141908" href="/z/d/graphic/141908.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) summarizes the calculations for MCV (mean corpuscular volume), MCH (mean corpuscular hemoglobin), and MCHC (mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration). </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3774036245"><span class="h2">Electrical impedance (Coulter aperture)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Wallace Coulter patented a device in 1953 that used electrical impedance to count RBCs and WBCs as they passed through an aperture [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. </p><p>The method for counting works as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Blood is diluted in a current-conducting solution such as isotonic <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a>.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The cell suspension is drawn by a vacuum through a small aperture positioned between two sensing electrodes connected across a direct current potential. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>As each cell passes through the aperture, the resistance between the electrodes increases. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The cell produces a momentary increase in impedance in electrical conduction (because it is non-conductive), resulting in an electrical pulse.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The number of pulses indicate the cell count.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The amplitude of each pulse is proportional to each cell's volume.</p><p></p><p>A cell count on an appropriately diluted whole blood sample yields the RBC count; the WBCs do not appreciably affect the count because they are three orders of magnitude less abundant than RBCs. RBC lysing reagents are then added to the sample to produce an accurate WBC count.</p><p>Upper and lower pulse height thresholds can be selected such that only particles within a specific volume range are counted. The lower pulse height threshold can be set to eliminate platelets (platelet volume is approximately 9 fL, one-tenth the volume of RBCs). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1681082425"><span class="h2">Multi-channel instruments</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the 1960s, the first multi-channel automated hematology instruments appeared. These instruments revolutionized the CBC as a laboratory test, enabling high throughput, low cost, and fast turnaround time for RBC and WBC parameters. Platelet counts (PLTs) were not a part of the first automated CBC since the aperture resolution on the early instruments could not adequately separate platelets from RBCs.</p><p>Anticoagulated whole blood samples were aspirated into the apparatus and automatically aliquoted and diluted into RBC and WBC counting chambers (baths) for cell counting and sizing with impedance apertures, and into a spectrophotometric cuvette for hemoglobin determination using the cyanmethemoglobin method. Coincidence correction (to correct for two or more cells passing through the aperture that are counted as one cell) and calculations of RBC indices were performed automatically. </p><p>Since these machines measure the RBC count and MCV directly, they can calculate the HCT using the Wintrobe formula, which calculates HCT based on the RBC count and the MCV  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef141908" href="/z/d/graphic/141908.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2045625112"><span class="h2">Light scattering</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Light scattering technology for cell counting was introduced in the 1970s.</p><p>In this technique, cells are hydrodynamically focused in a flow cell and illuminated by a narrow beam of laser light. The light scattered by each cell is captured by a photodetector and converted to an electrical pulse. The total number of pulses is proportional to the cell count; pulse amplitude is proportional to cell volume. The number of pulses within a predetermined size range (30 to 180 fL for RBCs, 0 to 20 or 0 to 30 fL for platelets) yields the corresponding RBC and platelet counts. WBCs are counted in the same way after the RBCs are lysed. </p><p>Analysis of light scatter from multiple angles provides better separation of WBCs from nucleated RBCs and RBCs that fail to lyse (a problem with neonatal samples, which have difficult-to-lyse RBCs). Some instruments determine both optical and impedance WBC counts and compare them as a means of better eliminating interference from nucleated or unlysed RBCs.</p><p>Attempts to automate the WBC differential started with image analysis instruments in the 1970s and progressed to a flow-through automated differential [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>RBC evaluation with light scattering technology requires that the RBCs be put into a hypotonic solution so that liquid enters the cells and they become spherical; then they are fixed. Scattered light is measured at low forward angle (0 to 3 degrees) and high forward angle (5 to 15 degrees), yielding pulses proportional to RBC size and refractive index, respectively. The refractive index is proportional to the hemoglobin content of the cell, allowing hemoglobin content to be directly determined for individual RBCs. This generates an RBC "cytogram" that produces statistics for RBC volume (MCV) and hemoglobin concentration.</p><p>RBC volume and hemoglobin concentration histograms and smoothed curves can be constructed, and the mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficients of variation (CV) electronically calculated, yielding the various RBC indices including the MCV and red cell distribution width (RDW). These are calculated differently on different CBC instruments  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef141565" href="/z/d/graphic/141565.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H336283853"><span class="h2">General features of modern instruments</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Modern analyzers include an automated sampling mode to minimize contact between the operator and the blood. Blood is aspirated from closed tubes with automated bar code readability for positive sample identification. </p><p>A built-in mixing system ensures sampling of a well-mixed specimen, and the instruments usually include a sample aspiration monitor to aid in detecting clots and determining that the correct sample volume has been aspirated. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tests performed on all samples</strong> – Some tests are routinely performed on all samples:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hemoglobin, red blood cell (RBC) count, and RBC indices</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>White blood cell (WBC) count </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Platelet count </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tests that can be requested</strong> – Other tests such as the reticulocyte count and WBC differential are performed only when requested, saving reagent costs. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Ideally, if a reticulocyte count is requested, it should be ordered at the same time as the CBC, but it can be added on later if the sample is not too old (no more than 48 hours after collection). (See <a class="local">'Reticulocytes'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Advances in various methods for the WBC differential allow distinction among different types of WBCs and identification of abnormal WBCs. (See <a class="local">'WBC differential'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Automated slide makers also are available that can create and stain blood films as directed by laboratory-programmed algorithms, which consider both the results of specific parameters as well as the presence of instrument flags. The combination of automated hematology analyzers coupled with automated slide makers and stainers have resulted in automated hematology work cells with high throughput and increased efficiency [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Image analysis has further increased efficiency, with identification of different cell types via machine learning algorithms [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>].</p><p>Modern instruments perform curve fitting, multi-dimensional population cluster discrimination, and moving averages for quality control. Computer memory can be used to store and sort samples and to maintain sample scatterplots in "list" mode for reanalysis. Certain parameters that are similar are named differently depending on each instrument manufacturer. The table summarizes which parameters are available on which instrument  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef141565" href="/z/d/graphic/141565.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p>Because each instrument determines some parameters differently, it is possible to get different results if the same sample is analyzed on different instruments. Some of these differences could potentially be significant, depending on the patient's condition. In healthy patients, there will be no clinically significant differences.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3330544510"><span class="h1">SAMPLE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3681680223"><span class="h2">Collection</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Phlebotomy</strong> – Collection of the blood samples should be performed by a trained phlebotomist or experienced member of the health care team. The table summarizes sources of spurious results on the CBC from phlebotomy-related causes  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef141504" href="/z/d/graphic/141504.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">It is very common to observe hemolyzed blood samples due to small gauge needles or tourniquets that are too tight, leading to shearing of red blood cells (RBCs). Hemolysis during phlebotomy spuriously affects the RBC count and hemoglobin (Hb). Collection of a blood sample proximal to an intravenous line will result in a dilute blood sample with spurious results.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Collection tube</strong> – Samples to be used for a CBC should be collected into a tube with an anticoagulant solution such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or citrate. EDTA may cause platelet clumping or satellitism in some patients, leading to pseudothrombocytopenia [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Platelet aggregates can also falsely increase the white blood cell (WBC) count [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. This can be identified by reviewing the edge of the blood smear and/or repeating the test using a tube with citrate. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6680.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to thrombocytopenia in adults", section on 'Pseudothrombocytopenia'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The ratio of anticoagulant in a tube to blood is carefully calibrated; underfilling and overfilling of the tube should be avoided. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Underfilling of the tube can lead to overexposure to the anticoagulant (eg, EDTA). </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Overfilling of the tube can reduce exposure to the anticoagulant with possible clotting, producing inaccurate results.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1602069244"><span class="h2">Storage</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Storage temperature</strong> – Blood samples should be kept at room temperature if the specimen will be analyzed within 24 hours of collection. Samples should be refrigerated if the analysis is to occur up to 72 hours after collection [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Freezing of blood samples must be avoided; freezing will cause cells to lyse, leading to inaccurate values. Blood samples that are exposed to heat will cause RBCs to fragment, producing significant anisocytosis and bizarre microcytes resembling blood samples seen in burn victims.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Storage duration prior to CBC testing</strong> – We recommend that samples &gt;72 hours old not be used for CBC testing. Samples &gt;72 hours old can show spurious results such as an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and elevated mean platelet volume (MPV) due to prolonged EDTA exposure with swelling of RBCs and platelets  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef141519" href="/z/d/graphic/141519.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Alterations in the percentages of different WBC subsets can also be seen  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef141504" href="/z/d/graphic/141504.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Blood films should be prepared within eight hours of sample collection. With longer storage, cells become pyknotic with altered morphology that can lead to spurious identification dysplasia in WBCs and platelets that is not actually present, as well as overcalling of RBC artifacts due to crenated RBCs.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1470399110"><span class="h2">Quality control</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rule of threes</strong> – In a healthy individual, the rule of threes should be met (three times the RBC count equals the hemoglobin, and three times the hemoglobin equals the hematocrit).
