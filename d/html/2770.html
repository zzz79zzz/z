         Weight loss is a common problem seen by generalists. Patients who are overweight or obese may intentionally lose weight to improve their health. However, progressive unintentional (involuntary) weight loss often indicates a serious medical or psychiatric illness.

          Unintentional weight loss

         ]. This term excludes weight loss as an expected consequence of treatment (eg, weight loss from diuretic therapy in patients with heart failure) or as a result of a known illness. Clinically important weight loss is generally defined as loss of more than 5 percent of usual body weight over 6 to 12 months [

         The majority of people will eventually meet the criteria for significant unintentional weight loss if they live long enough. It is estimated that 15 to 20 percent of adults ≥65 years have unintentional weight loss if followed over 5 to 10 years [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. Up to 8 percent of outpatients will have unintentional weight loss. Many studies, especially of nursing home residents, report a prevalence of weight loss exceeding 50 percent, which is most commonly multifactorial and associated with functional decline [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         There are fewer estimates of the incidence or prevalence of weight loss in the general population. The best evidence comes from survey studies. One survey including a representative sample of over 9000 adults in the United States found that 5 percent of participants reported unintentional
         <strong>
         </strong>
         weight loss of at least 5 percent of their usual body weight during the preceding year [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. There were no important sex differences in weight loss incidence. The strongest independent predictors of unintentional weight loss were age, smoking, and poor self-reported health. In another United States survey including over 5000 participants age ≥50 years, 7 percent of the sample reported unintentional weight loss of 5 percent or more over six months [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Prevalence increased with age and was also higher among those with obesity.

         Unintentional weight loss is associated with increased mortality [

         In a study of over 10,000 adult Israeli men, a 5 kg weight loss over five years without dieting was associated with an 18 percent increase in total mortality over the next 18 years [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. The excess mortality was almost entirely explained by increased cardiovascular deaths, after adjusting for age, baseline cardiovascular risk factors, baseline body mass index (BMI), and other comorbidities. There was no increase in cancer mortality.

         In the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) II Mortality Study, 5000 participants aged ≥50 years were followed for at least 12 years [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Mortality rates may be also increased for other specific populations with weight loss. As an example, weight loss among nursing home residents predicts increased mortality, regardless of underlying diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11-16
         </a>
         ]. Among patients with advanced lung disease and heart failure, those with weight loss also have increased mortality [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. (See

         There are many causes of unintentional weight loss  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106883" href="/z/d/graphic/106883.html" rel="external">
          table 1

          table 2
         </a>
         ). In the absence of fever or other cause for increased energy expenditure (eg, hyperthyroidism), weight loss is predominantly due to decreased food intake.
        </p>
        <p>
         Progressive unintentional weight loss often indicates serious medical or psychiatric illness. Any chronic illness affecting any organ system can cause anorexia and weight loss. In studies that examined the etiologies for unintentional weight loss, malignancy is eventually identified as the primary cause in 15 to 37 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,20-23
         </a>
         ]. Nonmalignant gastrointestinal causes account for 10 to 20 percent [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20,21,24,25
         </a>
         ]. Psychiatric causes occur in 10 to 23 percent of community-dwelling participants [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20,21,23
         </a>
         ]. Up to 25 percent of cases have unknown causes [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         At a diagnostic unit in Spain, 791 older adult patients were evaluated for unintentional weight loss without signs or symptoms specific to a particular etiology or organ system [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. After one-year follow-up, 24 percent were diagnosed with malignancy, 45 percent with nonmalignant organic disease, 29 percent with psychiatric disease, and only 3 percent remained unexplained after one year of evaluation.

         Malignancies (particularly gastrointestinal, pancreatic, lung, lymphoma, renal, and prostate cancers) often cause weight loss [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. There are multiple mechanisms accounting for weight loss in patients with cancer. Anorexia and weight loss are present in 15 to 40 percent of all cancer patients at diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ],
         <strong>
         </strong>
         but the prevalence appears to be highest in those diagnosed
         <strong>
         </strong>
         with lung cancer (60 percent) or upper gastrointestinal cancer (80 percent) [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28-30
         </a>
         ]. Cancer cachexia involves complex metabolic abnormalities that decrease muscle mass. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2817.html" rel="external">
          "Pathogenesis, clinical features, and assessment of cancer cachexia"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Among patients with unintentional weight loss, only a minority are subsequently diagnosed with malignancy. In a prospective cohort study from Spain, 2677 adults were systematically evaluated for unintentional weight loss and 902 (34 percent) were diagnosed with malignancy over the next five and a half years, although the vast majority of those (883) were diagnosed within the first six months of evaluation [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Among patients with unintentional weight loss, malignancy was associated with older age, male sex, active smoking, and greater weight loss. The most common malignancies in these patients were related to the gastrointestinal system (esophagus, stomach, bowel, liver, pancreas, biliary), lung, lymphoma, and urinary tract (kidney, ureter, bladder); cancers of the prostate, breast, and ovary were diagnosed much less frequently.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with malignancy as a cause of unintentional weight loss often have one or more abnormalities (signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities) noted during the initial diagnostic evaluation. For example, patients may have pain, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, early satiety due to hepatosplenic enlargement or malignant obstruction, hypercalcemia, or symptoms of malabsorption. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Evaluation'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In a prospective cohort study of 101 patients, all 22 patients with malignancy had an abnormal laboratory test, with C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, and albumin having the highest sensitivities [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. Abnormal abdominal ultrasound and chest radiograph had lower sensitivities of 45 and 18 percent, respectively.
         <strong>
         </strong>
         However, all of these diagnostic tests were also abnormal, but to a lesser extent, among patients with nonmalignant organic disease. Thus, there is no general diagnostic test or group of tests that appears to be specific for malignancy.

        <p>
         Patients with weight loss from gastrointestinal causes will often have associated gastrointestinal symptoms including: anorexia, abdominal pain, early satiety, dysphagia, odynophagia, diarrhea, steatorrhea, chronic constipation, or evidence of chronic bleeding. They may also have signs and symptoms associated with chronic inflammation, chronic ischemia, obstruction, or fistulas. Patients with IBD may have extraintestinal manifestations  (

         – Some persons have vocations that require them to be very lean (eg, long-distance runners, models, ballet dancers, gymnasts). Some persons who engage in intense training must increase their intake of calories considerably to maintain their weight and muscle mass.

         The electronic health record may be used to automatically identify patients with 5 percent or greater weight loss to trigger the clinician to investigate the cause. Given the broad differential diagnosis of unintentional weight loss  (

         ),
         <strong>
         </strong>
         there is no single diagnostic approach for all patients. The evaluation should begin with verification of the weight loss (patients may complain of weight loss without an objective weight loss), followed by a careful history and physical examination  (

        <p>
         A study in the United Kingdom. using electronic records of five million primary care patients in the National Health Service (2000 to 2012) was performed to identify which diseases warranted a focused evaluation for patients identified with unintentional weight loss, based on patient age and sex [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. The most beneficial evaluation for men and women under age 60-years was for depression, diabetes, and hyperthyroidism. For men age 60- to 80-years-old, the most beneficial evaluation was for malignancy, diabetes, and chronic lung disease; for women age 60- to 80-years-old, thyroid disease, depression, and malignancy; and for patients older than 80 years-old, malignancy, dementia, depression, and heart failure.

        <p>
         In patients with documented weight loss of ≥5 percent of usual body weight and positive findings on history or physical examination, further testing should be focused on confirming the suspected diagnosis.

          Documenting weight loss
         </strong>
         – Qualitative judgments by patients about the magnitude of their weight loss are often unreliable. In a prospective study of unintentional weight loss, only 50 percent of patients reporting weight loss had true weight loss [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, it is important to obtain previous weight records and, if not available, to query family members about the patient's weight history, including usual weight prior to the period of weight loss. Unintentional weight loss exceeding 20 percent of usual weight is often associated with severe protein-energy malnutrition, nutritional deficiencies, and multiorgan dysfunction [

          Pattern of weight loss
         </strong>
         – It is important to determine the duration and pattern of weight loss, including past fluctuations in weight and whether weight loss is progressive or stable. Recent weight loss in a person whose weight has been stable for many years, and weight loss that is progressive, are more worrisome and require more immediate follow-up. For example, an unintentional weight loss of greater than 10 percent of body weight over one year is seen among 11 percent of those newly diagnosed with cancer or liver disease and in 9 percent of those newly diagnosed with cardiovascular or respiratory disease [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>
         ]. Other factors to consider in weight loss pattern include changes in appetite, caloric intake, and physical activity.

          Evaluation for eating disorders and intentional weight loss
         </strong>
         – Clinicians should question patients regarding possible intentional weight loss from dieting. An analysis of the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data identified a recent diagnosis of diabetes as predicting a 12 percent chance of intentionally losing at least 10 percent of body weight over the next year [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>

         The clinical features of anorexia nervosa include restriction of energy intake leading to an abnormal body weight, intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, and distorted perception of body weight and shape. Clinical features of bulimia include binge eating, inappropriate compensatory behavior to prevent weight gain (eg, self-induced vomiting), and excessive concern about body weight and shape. (See

         Despite an appropriate initial evaluation, a clear cause for weight loss may not be found. If no abnormality is identified after initial evaluation, watchful waiting for one to six months is preferable to a battery of testing with low diagnostic yield  (

          algorithm 1

         ). As organic disease is rarely found in patients with a normal physical examination and normal initial diagnostic testing, a waiting period of one to six months is unlikely to result in an adverse outcome [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,24,55
         </a>
         ]. On follow-up, careful attention should be paid to dietary history, possibility of psychosocial causes, surreptitious drug intake, and new manifestations of occult illness. Patients with progressive weight loss that is documented over multiple visits (versus stabilized weight loss) should be seen in a shorter time frame. Further evaluation for malignancy in older patients may be reasonable and is discussed elsewhere. (See

          Causes
         </strong>
         – There are many causes of weight loss  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106883" href="/z/d/graphic/106883.html" rel="external">
          table 1

          History and physical examination
         </strong>
         – Given the broad differential diagnosis of unintentional weight loss  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106883" href="/z/d/graphic/106883.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), there is no single diagnostic approach for all patients. The evaluation should start with verifying the weight loss followed by a careful history and physical examination  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107034" href="/z/d/graphic/107034.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Many patients who complain of weight loss do not have documented weight loss. (See

         The history of a patient with unintentional weight loss includes documenting the weight loss, assessing its pattern, evaluating for eating disorders and possible intentional weight loss, and eliciting other factors that may be related to the weight loss. (See
         <a class="local">
          'History'

         The physical examination focuses on evaluating for signs of the various etiologies of unintentional weight loss, including psychiatric disorders, hyperthyroidism, nutritional deficiencies, and undiagnosed chronic diseases. (See

         <strong>
          Further evaluation
         </strong>
         – The workup of a patient with unintentional weight loss should be individualized based on findings from the patient's history and physical examination  (

         In patients with documented weight loss of ≥5 percent of usual body weight and findings on history or physical examination, further testing should be focused on confirming the suspected diagnosis. Patients with history or physical examination  (

         When the history and physical examination do not indicate a likely diagnosis, a basic diagnostic evaluation should include complete blood count with differential, electrolytes, glucose, hemoglobin A1c, calcium, renal and hepatic function tests, thyroid-stimulating hormone, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP), urinalysis, stool for occult blood, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology, hepatitis C serology in patients with risk factors  (
