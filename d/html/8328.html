There is no known effective treatment for rabies, and virtually all cases are fatal. Survival remains a rare and largely inexplicable phenomenon, which is often associated with severe neurologic sequelae  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113372" href="/d/graphic/113372.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>Although the prognosis is poor in patients who develop rabies, the disease is usually preventable with proper wound care and post-exposure prophylaxis, which was first pioneered by Louis Pasteur in 1885. This topic will discuss when to use rabies prophylaxis. Additional information on rabies biologics (vaccine and immunoglobulin), as well as the epidemiology, clinical features, and treatment of human rabies, are presented elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8303.html" rel="external">"Rabies immune globulin and vaccine"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8322.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rabies"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16595.html" rel="external">"Treatment of rabies"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2536846147"><span class="h1">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The decision to initiate rabies post-exposure prophylaxis after a potential exposure should be made following a thorough risk assessment. Post-exposure prophylaxis includes <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9850" href="/d/drug information/9850.html" rel="external">rabies vaccine</a> with or without <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9848" href="/d/drug information/9848.html" rel="external">rabies immune globulin</a>. The specific regimen depends upon the patient's prior rabies vaccine history and other factors. A detailed discussion of the regimens used for post-exposure prophylaxis is found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8303.html" rel="external">"Rabies immune globulin and vaccine"</a>.)</p><p>To prevent rabies infection, post-exposure prophylaxis should be administered to all patients who have had a known or likely exposure to rabies, including those who received prior pre-exposure prophylaxis.</p><p>In general, we consider an exposure to be:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A bite or saliva-contaminated scratch from an animal with rabies</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An open wound or mucous membrane exposure to saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, or central nervous system (CNS) tissue from an animal with rabies</p><p></p><p>However, it is not always possible to confirm an exposure to rabies, and prophylaxis is often administered empirically based upon the possibility that an exposure occurred.</p><p>Exposure of normal, keratinized skin to potentially infectious material (ie, saliva, neural tissue) or any contact with blood, urine, feces (guano), or skunk spray of a rabid animal does <strong>not</strong> constitute an exposure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2468144693"><span class="h1">RISK ASSESSMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>After a potential exposure to rabies, it is important to decide if rabies post-exposure prophylaxis should be administered. Consultation with the local public health agency can be valuable in assessing the risk of transmission after a potential exposure.</p><p>A prospective study of university-affiliated, urban emergency departments suggested that post-exposure prophylaxis was given inappropriately in approximately 40 percent of cases [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. A more recent study suggests that this is still the case but that health department consultation can reduce inappropriate prophylaxis by 87 percent [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Another report described a school incident in which a parent showed a dead bat to multiple students, some of whom touched the carcass [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The bat was later tested for rabies virus, and it was confirmed to be positive. Public health authorities from the local and state health departments and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided recommendations for post-exposure prophylaxis after interviewing 107 students with potential exposures but only recommended prophylaxis for one person who reported putting her finger in the mouth of the bat.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3619165334"><span class="h2">Initial evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several factors need to be considered when deciding if post-exposure prophylaxis is needed after a potential exposure to rabies. These include [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The epidemiology of animal rabies in the region. (See <a class="local">'Animal exposures in the United States'</a> below and <a class="local">'Animal exposures that occur outside the United States'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The species of the exposing animal. (See <a class="local">'Domestic animals'</a> below and <a class="local">'Wild terrestrial mammals'</a> below and <a class="local">'Livestock'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The type of contact with the animal (exposures of concern can occur through a bite or saliva or neural tissue contamination of a scratch, an open wound, or mucous membrane).</p><p></p><p>Additional considerations include an assessment of factors that could indicate an exposing animal is likely to be rabid (eg, absence of appropriate vaccination, unprovoked attack, recent behavioral changes in the animal, recent bites or wounds on the animal), as well as the availability of the animal for observation/testing. These are discussed in detail below. (See <a class="local">'Additional considerations'</a> below.)</p><p>Almost all cases of rabies are transmitted from rabid animals through a bite. The risk of acquisition increases with multiple bites and with bites in close proximity to the CNS  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50558" href="/d/graphic/50558.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Data from areas with endemic rabies in dogs have found that children are at increased risk of acquiring rabies because they are more likely to be bitten, particularly in the trunk, head, or neck [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>], and to suffer severe injuries.</p><p>Outcomes may also be worse in patients with bites close to the CNS. In a study from Thailand, the risk of dying from rabies in patients who did not receive post-exposure prophylaxis was highest in those who were severely bitten around the face, neck, and arms, compared with those who were bitten around the feet [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>In rare cases, rabies has resulted from a nonbite exposure, such as a scratch or mucous membrane that has been in contact with saliva or neural tissue from an animal with rabies. There have also been cases of rabies that have occurred after corneal transplantation or of an organ from a human donor with unrecognized rabies. (See <a class="local">'Transplant recipients'</a> below.)</p><p>No transmission of rabies has been documented from rabies-infected patients to health care providers or household contacts, although there is limited surveillance in parts of the world with the greatest number of human rabies cases. In addition, rabies is not transmitted via fomites or environmental surfaces [<a href="#rid4">4,11,12</a>]. The rabies virus does not survive well outside of the host and is affected by desiccation, sunlight, pH, and other environmental factors. In general, if the material containing the virus is dry, it can be considered noninfectious.</p><p>Probable aerosol exposure to rabies virus in laboratories resulted in two cases [<a href="#rid13">13-15</a>]. Two other cases in the early 1960s were attributed to possible airborne exposures in a single cave containing millions of free-tailed bats (<em>Tadarida brasiliensis</em>) in the southwestern United States [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. However, it is difficult to rule out inapparent bites as the route of transmission given the conditions in the cave, and no other potential airborne exposures have been identified in that cave or any others.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2875337928"><span class="h2">Additional considerations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When assessing the risk of an exposure, it is important to evaluate factors that may indicate an exposing animal is likely to be rabid. These include absence of an appropriate vaccination history in a domestic animal, a report by the victim of an unprovoked attack, and/or a report that the exposing animal was displaying neurologic signs or had a recent history of bites or wounds.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3559657931"><span class="h3">Provoked versus unprovoked exposure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because rabies virus infection can manifest as an increase in aggressive behavior, an unprovoked attack by an animal could represent the first sign that it is rabid. Determining if an attack is provoked or unprovoked should always be done from the point of view of the animal rather than the human. For example, bites that occur when a person is trying to handle or feed an animal should usually be considered provoked attacks (ie, not evidence of abnormal aggressive behavior) assuming the animal is otherwise acting in a normal manner and not likely to be rabid based on any of the additional considerations mentioned (see <a class="local">'Initial evaluation'</a> above). Local public health authorities can assist in making this determination.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H440113218"><span class="h3">Vaccination status of domestic animals</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Domestic animals should receive rabies vaccination; rabies in vaccinated animals is rare [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. In sub-Saharan African (where most rabies exposures occur through rabid dogs), a cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrated that annual canine rabies vaccination campaigns, compared with no canine vaccination, would be cost effective and lifesaving [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>Although few cases of rabies have been reported in animals that have previously been vaccinated, guidelines continue to recommend observation of vaccinated dogs, cats, and ferrets after an exposure [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Domestic animals'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H802809027"><span class="h3">Animal observation and testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the United States, decisions about prophylaxis can often be delayed if the animal is a healthy dog, cat, or ferret and is able to be confined and observed for 10 days  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71322" href="/d/graphic/71322.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Data from rabies pathogenesis studies in dogs, cats, and ferrets indicate that these animals uniformly begin to sicken and die within 10 days (usually 5 to 7 days) after the rabies has spread from the CNS to the salivary glands [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Observed animals that exhibit any sign of illness during the 10-day observation period should be evaluated by a veterinarian and reported to the local health department. If the animal does develop signs of rabies, it should be euthanized and its head shipped overnight under refrigeration to a laboratory certified to perform rabies testing (most often a public health laboratory).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the animal remains healthy for the full 10 days, then it did not have rabies virus in its saliva at the time of exposure. The shedding period (ie, the time during which virus might be found in the saliva prior to an animal's death) is not fully documented for species other than dogs, cats, or ferrets.</p><p></p><p>Immediate prophylaxis is indicated if the animal develops clinical signs of rabies during the 10-day observation period following the exposures. If post-exposure prophylaxis was initiated and the animal remains well for the full 10 days or is tested for rabies and is found negative, prophylaxis can be discontinued.</p><p>The approach to prophylaxis for bats and wild terrestrial mammals that are available for testing is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Bat exposures'</a> below and <a class="local">'Wild terrestrial mammals'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H563458081"><span class="h1">EVALUATING THE SOURCE OF EXPOSURE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The approach to post-exposure prophylaxis described below is based upon the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for rabies post-exposure  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71322" href="/d/graphic/71322.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4,22</a>]. Other guidelines panels, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), have also made recommendations on the use of post-exposure prophylaxis [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. Compared with United States guidelines, which recommend administration of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> and vaccination following an exposure for anyone who has not previously received pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis, the WHO recommends immune globulin only for select exposure situations  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118695" href="/d/graphic/118695.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The WHO guidelines are discussed in greater detail below. (See <a class="local">'Special considerations in resource-limited settings'</a> below.)</p><p>In many scenarios, the decision to initiate post-exposure can be complex. Clinicians should seek the help of local or state public health authorities for further advice regarding the need for post-exposure prophylaxis. In the United States, contacts can be found on the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Frabies%2Fresources%2Fcontacts.html&amp;token=R4Uiw8%2FbmPVaqNHRDqpXLP34avy7K48jfK0PvxCnCh3r9Biz1uu56%2BYn0IY7HtcwZl6JErfqwi8KMF%2FrvK5VwQ%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=8328" target="_blank">CDC website</a>.

However, rabies-like lyssaviruses have been identified in bats globally, and any interaction with bats should be considered to have the potential for a lyssavirus exposure with the possibility of a fatal outcome [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>]. In the United States, bat rabies has been found in all states except Hawaii. Between 1990 and 2018, 51 (91 percent) of the 56 human cases of rabies acquired in the United States were due to rabies acquired from bats [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>].</p><p>Post-exposure prophylaxis should be considered when there has been a potential contact between a human and a bat. This includes individuals who have been in a room with a bat if they are unable to rule out any physical contact. Our approach to post-exposure prophylaxis is as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the bat is available for testing, prophylaxis can be delayed if the results will be available promptly (eg, several days), since more than 90 percent of bats submitted for testing are negative for rabies. Bats should not be picked up or handled by anyone except trained and vaccinated persons unless the layperson can safely capture and confine the bat. A video demonstration of how to safely capture a bat is available on the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.health.ny.gov%2Fdiseases%2Fcommunicable%2Fzoonoses%2Frabies%2F&amp;token=3i3o1IeeCPsxCOFO9TAjzQnxUNM6RYBc0NspJWS1wnTm0elfeLb50ASVR5bzyCqqir5dooefmK7juYIkAbIPeZHy4Tjh7CDzrGga%2BksVV1s%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=8328" target="_blank">New York State Department of Health website</a>.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If testing is not available or if the bat tests positive for rabies, post-exposure prophylaxis should be administered in the following settings:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>To all individuals who have had a bite, scratch, or mucous membrane exposure from a bat.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>When direct contact with a bat occurred and the individual is unable to rule out a bite or scratch.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If an individual has been in a room with a bat and is unable to rule out any physical contact. Such individuals include a sleeping person who awakens to find a bat in the room, an unattended child, a mentally disabled person, and an intoxicated person. This approach is consistent with the recommendations of the ACIP for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis [<a href="#rid4">4,22</a>]; however, some guideline panels do not advocate this approach [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Post-exposure prophylaxis is <strong>not</strong> necessary if the person was aware of the bat at all times while in an enclosed or open space and is certain that there was no bite, scratch, or mucous membrane exposure. Household members who were not in a room with the bat do not require post-exposure prophylaxis. A clustering of human cases associated with bat exposures has never been reported (eg, within the same household or among campers at an outside camp).</p><p></p><p>The risk for rabies resulting from an encounter with a bat is often difficult to assess because bites by bats may be too small to be routinely detected or may occur at night during sleep  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50558" href="/d/graphic/50558.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. From 1990 to 2007, a total of 34 naturally acquired bat-associated human cases of rabies were reported. In 15 cases, physical contact was reported but no bite was documented, and, in 11 cases, no known bat encounter was reported at all [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. However, by the time rabies is diagnosed, getting an accurate history is usually precluded.</p><p>In a study that evaluated this approach by estimating bedroom exposure to bats in a population survey of 14,453 households, the number of individuals who would need to be treated to prevent a single case of bat rabies related to bedroom exposure without recognized contact ranged from 314,000 to 2.7 million persons, at a cost of USD $228 million to $2 billion [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. In this study, the incidence of rabies was based on reported cases in the United States and Canada over a 17-year period. Given these findings, the recommendations in Canada changed in 2009 so that prophylaxis is only recommended if there is <strong>both</strong> direct contact with a bat and a bite, scratch, or saliva exposure into a wound or mucous membrane cannot be ruled out [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2025358727"><span class="h2">Animal exposures in the United States</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When deciding if a specific animal exposure is likely to transmit rabies, it is important to take into account the type of animal and the location where the exposure occurred. As an example, in developing countries, dogs continue to account for 90 percent or more of reported cases in humans [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. By contrast, bat-variant rabies viruses have emerged as the dominant source associated with indigenously acquired human rabies in the United States; other animal reservoirs include raccoons, skunks, and foxes [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>].</p><p>The approach to rabies post-exposure prophylaxis after a bite or a mucosal exposure to a mammal in the United States is described in the algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71322" href="/d/graphic/71322.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) and is summarized below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3413483604"><span class="h3">Domestic animals</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>After an exposure to a domestic animal (dog, cat, or ferret) in the United States, the decision to initiate post-exposure prophylaxis can typically be delayed if the animal is healthy and can be quarantined for 10 days of observation  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71322" href="/d/graphic/71322.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). This approach should be used even if the animal is vaccinated.

The probability of human exposure to rabies by a domestic animal in the United States is low as the number of rabies cases among domestic animals, such as dogs or cats, has declined markedly in the United States [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. However, rabid dogs and cats are sporadically reported from areas with enzootic wildlife rabies. In addition, domestic animals that are incubating rabies have been imported from regions of the world where canine rabies is still enzootic [<a href="#rid17">17,33</a>].</p><p>More cats than dogs are currently reported rabid in the United States [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].

In such settings, observation without prophylaxis is reasonable if the biting animal is a healthy dog or cat that has previously been vaccinated against rabies, is reliably reported not to have any possible exposures to rabies in the last six months, and is readily accessible for monitoring for the 10-day period. These situations are highly variable, and the risk of rabies from a dog bite varies even within an endemic country. In general, patients should be managed in consultation with the local or state health department.</p><p>Among 43 cases of human rabies diagnosed in the United States between 2003 and 2016, 10 were attributed to exposure to dogs outside the United States [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].

Standard infection control precautions would minimize the risk of any such exposure and should be routinely employed [<a href="#rid41">41-43</a>]. As an example, staff should wear gowns, masks, gloves, and eye/face protection, particularly when there is risk of aerosols and splashes from respiratory secretions, such as those that can occur during intubation and suctioning [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].

Guidelines for corneal transplantation have since been implemented, which reject corneas from those dying of unexplained encephalitis.</p><p>In 2004, rabies transmission was also documented from a solid organ/tissue donor to transplant recipients [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. The organ donor died from a subarachnoid hemorrhage following an illness characterized by severe mental status changes and a low-grade fever. The death was attributed to noninfectious causes, and organs and tissues were recovered and transplanted. Three recipients of organs and one recipient of vascular tissue subsequently died of laboratory-confirmed rabies. A follow-up public health investigation found that the donor had reported being bitten by a bat, and bat strain rabies was identified [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].
