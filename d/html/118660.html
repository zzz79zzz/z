         The clinical presentation of upper extremity ischemia is varied and depends upon the level of the underlying disease, which can be classified as large vessel disease (acute or chronic arterial occlusive disease proximal to the wrist) versus small vessel disease (chronic arterial occlusive disease distal to the wrist). The large number of disease entities affecting the small vessels of the upper extremity (eg, arteritis, vasospasm) makes the clinical evaluation of upper extremity ischemia somewhat more complex compared with ischemia affecting the lower extremity.
        </p>
        <p>
         As with the lower extremity, upper extremity ischemia can be due to a sudden (ie, acute) or gradual (ie, chronic) loss of blood flow. Acute ischemia is defined as having an onset of symptoms of less than two weeks. Acute upper extremity ischemia is typically due to thromboembolic complications from an underlying disease. Chronic upper extremity ischemia is related to progressive arterial narrowing. Acute thrombosis of an already narrowed segment can also occur (ie, acute-on-chronic ischemia).
        </p>
        <p>
         Amputation related to ischemia is far less common in the upper compared with lower extremity. In 2005, among the 1.6 million persons living with a "loss of a limb," an estimated 573,000 had an upper extremity amputation [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Only 8 percent were categorized as a major amputation. Trauma accounted for the majority of major upper extremity amputations, while vascular diseases accounted for only 12 percent. Upper extremity ischemia in the pediatric population is even rarer and is often associated with upper extremity injury [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>

         The clinical features, diagnosis, classification, and approach to treatment of acute upper extremity ischemia are reviewed. Acute lower extremity ischemia is reviewed separately. (See

         The subclavian arteries provide blood flow to the upper extremities. On the left, the subclavian artery originates directly from the aortic arch distal to the left common carotid artery. On the right, blood flows first through the innominate (brachiocephalic) artery, which divides into the right common carotid artery and right subclavian artery  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63286" href="/z/d/graphic/63286.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The anatomy of the aortic arch can vary  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54048" href="/z/d/graphic/54048.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ) and may include an anomalous origin of the subclavian arteries. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5757.html" rel="external">
          "Vascular rings and slings"

        </p>
        <p>
         The subclavian artery passes over the first rib posterior to the anterior scalene muscle  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59433" href="/z/d/graphic/59433.html" rel="external">
          figure 3
         </a>
         ) and becomes the axillary artery at the lateral margin of the first rib. The first part of the axillary artery is close to the chest wall and medial to the pectoralis minor muscle. The second part of the axillary artery is located deep to the pectoralis minor, and the third portion is lateral to the pectoralis minor. The axillary artery becomes the brachial artery  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71903" href="/z/d/graphic/71903.html" rel="external">
          figure 4
         </a>
         ) at the lower margin of the teres major muscle. The brachial artery passes between the biceps and triceps muscles, accompanied by the ulnar and median nerves adjacent to the humerus, and supplies the soft tissues of the arm  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94865" href="/z/d/graphic/94865.html" rel="external">
          figure 5
         </a>
         ). In the antecubital fossa, the brachial artery divides  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82540" href="/z/d/graphic/82540.html" rel="external">
          figure 6
         </a>
         ) into the radial, interosseus, and ulnar arteries to supply the soft tissues of the forearm  (

          figure 7
         </a>
         ). Distally at the wrist, the ulnar artery and radial artery supply the hand  (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The upper extremity veins are divided into the superficial and deep systems. The deep veins of the upper extremity include the paired ulnar, radial, and interosseous veins in the forearm; paired brachial veins of the upper arm leading to the axillary vein. The axillary vein becomes the subclavian vein at the lower border of the teres major muscle  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61941" href="/z/d/graphic/61941.html" rel="external">
          figure 9
         </a>
         ). The main superficial veins of the upper extremity include the cephalic, basilic, median antebrachial, median antecubital, and accessory cephalic veins  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55596" href="/z/d/graphic/55596.html" rel="external">
          figure 10
         </a>
         ). These superficial upper extremity veins serve as the mainstay for arteriovenous access creation in the dialysis-dependent patient.
        </p>
        <p>
         The bones of the upper extremity include the humerus, radius, ulna, wrist bones, and phalanges. The musculature  (

         The brachial plexus is formed by the ventral rami of the lower cervical and upper thoracic nerve roots  (

          figure 5

         ). The cords of the brachial plexus contribute to each of the five major nerves of the upper extremity (axillary, musculocutaneous  (

         The collateral circulation around the shoulder is usually sufficient to compensate for a focal area of chronic stenosis in the subclavian artery. When the proximal subclavian artery is occluded, blood flow is maintained to the arm via connections between the vertebral arteries  (

          figure 21

         ), superior and inferior thyroid arteries; intercostals, superior epigastric, and internal thoracic arteries; profunda cervicis and descending branch of the occipital artery; scapular branches of the thyrocervical trunk and the branches of the axillary artery; and the thoracic branches of the axillary artery with the aortic intercostals  (

        <p>
         Similarly, the collateral circulation around the elbow compensates for reduced flow in the brachial artery with lesions that occur at the level of the elbow. The collateral circulation around the elbow includes contributions from the radial recurrent arteries medially, the anterior and posterior ulnar recurrent arteries and the inferior and superior ulnar collateral arteries medially, and the deep brachial and dorsal interosseous arteries  (

Indirect injury results when the trajectory of a projectile is near an artery. The resulting blast effect can cause various degrees of intimal and medial injury that can also result in thrombosis. Traumatic upper extremity vascular injuries may also be associated with injury to the brachial plexus or individual upper extremity nerves from transection, blunt avulsion injury, or contusion from blast effect.

         Subclavian artery thrombosis or avulsion is often due to severe traction injury on the shoulder that occurs from a direct blow, such as during a motorcycle crash when the victim is ejected and lands on the shoulder. These injuries often result in more devastating clinical consequences due to the associated avulsion of the brachial plexus from the cervical spinal roots or separation of the cords, resulting in an insensate and paralyzed upper extremity.

         Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) using currently approved devices may require coverage of the left subclavian artery in up to 40 percent of the cases. Subclavian artery coverage is generally well-tolerated due to excellent collateral circulation around the shoulder. Among patients who have had TEVAR with subclavian artery coverage without preemptive extra-anatomic revascularization, the risk of developing arm ischemia is overall low at about 6 percent [

Symptomatic upper extremity ischemia related to aTOS is typically due to distal thromboembolism originating from the poststenotic aneurysm, rather than from progressive stenosis or thrombotic occlusion of a stenosis. When arterial occlusion does occur, the severity of limb ischemia is often blunted due to the collateral circulation around the shoulder. (See

         Takayasu arteritis is a "large vessel" vasculitis affecting the aorta and its branches typically affecting young females (&lt;40 years old) and recognition requires a high index of suspicion since the clinical presentation in the early systemic inflammatory phase is often nonspecific. The presenting symptoms of either the acute systemic inflammatory phase or the "burnt out" or "occlusive" phase may overlap, but distinguishing between these phases is important for determining the treatment. The clinical presentation may include diminished pulses, differential blood pressures, and/or symptoms of upper extremity pain with exertion. Advanced symptoms such as ischemic rest pain and tissue loss are rare.

         GCA is also systemic inflammatory disease generally affecting adults over age 50. GCA involves arteries of the head and neck, but it can also affect the aorta and rarely lower extremity vessels. The most common symptoms of GCA are throbbing headaches, scalp and temporal tenderness, jaw claudication, fever, and visual deficits. Early treatment is warranted to prevent serious complications such as blindness or stroke.

         Hemodialysis access-induced distal ischemia (HAIDI), also referred to as access-related hand ischemia (ARHI) or dialysis access–induced ischemic syndrome (DAIIS), presents as forearm or hand ischemia following creation of an arteriovenous (AV) access for hemodialysis.

        </p>

         Ischemic symptoms most commonly occur due vascular steal (ie, dialysis access steal syndrome [DASS]). Extremity symptoms range from mild (coolness, sensory abnormalities) to severe (ischemic rest pain, ulceration, gangrene). A small subset of the patients has only mild symptoms during hemodialysis but are otherwise asymptomatic. Most (up to 87 percent) patients experiencing symptoms of "steal" have an AV access that is brachial artery based [

         More rarely, ischemia related to hemodialysis AV access presents as a variant known as ischemic monomelic neuropathy (IMN) with profound sensory and motor deficits in the hand. The presentation is almost immediate after the creation of the AV access and requires immediate treatment. IMN is more prevalent in the patients with diabetes and PAD. (See

         Acute limb ischemia is defined as a sudden decrease in limb perfusion with the onset of symptoms of less than two weeks duration. The clinical presentation depends on the time course of vessel occlusion, the location of the affected vessels, and the ability to recruit collateral channels to provide flow around the occlusion, and whether there is underlying vascular disease. The classic physical signs of acute limb ischemia in a patient without underlying occlusive vascular disease are the six Ps (pain, pallor, pulselessness, poikilothermia, paresthesia, and paralysis). When collateral circulation cannot compensate, minor sensory deficits develop as a sign of early nerve dysfunction; major sensory or motor loss is indicative of advanced ischemia.

         Acute upper limb ischemia typically presents with sudden onset of a cool, pulseless, and painful upper extremity. In the upper extremity, these findings usually suggest acute embolism from a cardiac source. In a review of patients who underwent embolectomy, all patients presented with unilateral coldness of the upper extremity without radial pulse and with a "water-hammer" pulse at the arterial level where the embolus was lodged [

        </p>
        <p>
         The extent of limb involvement depends on the location of arterial occlusion. As an example, an embolus typically lodges at a proximal branch point where the vessel narrows, such as the take-off of the profunda brachii leading to entire limb ischemia, or the branching of the brachial artery in the antecubital fossa leading to forearm ischemia.

         Chronic ischemia (&gt;2 weeks after onset of symptoms) affecting the upper extremity has a varied presentation depending on the location and underlying etiology.
        </p>
        <p>
         Chronic proximal occlusions can be asymptomatic or present with history of exertional arm symptoms and/or signs and symptoms of "subclavian steal" syndrome. Chronic proximal arterial occlusions are often well-tolerated due to excellent collateral network. This is typically provided via a retrograde flow in the vertebral arteries through the complete circle of Willis. In addition, the basal metabolic needs of the upper extremities are relatively lower compared with the lower extremity. The only clinical indicator of vascular disease in this large number of asymptomatic patients is a difference between the arm blood pressures. It would not be surprising to see a 30 to 40 mmHg difference with proximal subclavian artery occlusion. Therefore, vascular examination is important to measure the blood pressure in both arms. (See

         A more dramatic presentation is the "subclavian steal" syndrome  (

          figure 21
         </a>
         ), which is pathognomonic of the proximal subclavian artery occlusion. Classic symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency may include dizziness and near syncope to complete syncopal attacks associated with use of the ipsilateral upper extremity. The patient may have weakly palpable ipsilateral radial and ulnar pulses, which will obliterate during isometric exercise. (See

         The quality and character of the peripheral pulses in the affected extremity, as well as the contralateral extremity, are evaluated and compared. The vascular examination should include palpation of all pulses, including the subclavian, axillary, brachial, radial, and ulnar arteries, as well as the lower extremity pulses (ie, femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulses). Since the quality of the pulse examination can vary, a handheld Doppler should be used to confirm the presence of distal pulses (eg, radial artery, ulnar artery Doppler signals). The operator should listen for arterial and venous signals  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75112" href="/z/d/graphic/75112.html" rel="external">
          table 2

         ). If Doppler signals are present, the wrist-brachial index (WBI) should be obtained. The manner of obtaining the WBI and interpretation is discussed separately. In general, the absence of any distal Doppler signals (arterial and venous) indicates severe ischemia. For the upper extremity, although the WBI may vary significantly depending upon the location of the thrombus or embolus, a value &lt;0.4 is indicative of severe ischemia. (See

         </span>
         A clinical diagnosis of upper extremity ischemia can be made based solely on history and physical examination in about 90 percent of patients. The patient's presenting clinical features, and importantly history (eg, arrhythmia, valvular heart disease, trauma, prior access, history of radiation, recent dialysis access), often point to a likely etiology for upper extremity ischemia. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Incidence and etiologies'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Asymmetry in the vascular examination is highly suggestive of a surgically correctable etiology. As examples, sudden unilateral limb ischemia with normal pulses in the contralateral extremity suggest the absence of chronic arterial disease and that an embolus is the likely etiology of the acute ischemia. An acute onset left upper extremity ischemia in a patient with chest pain and hypertension suggests aortic dissection. By contrast, symmetrically reduced pulses in both the upper extremity and lower extremities suggests a systemic etiology.

         The type of vascular imaging chosen for acute upper extremity ischemia weighs the availability of a specific imaging modality and the time required to perform and interpret the study against the urgency and possible methods of revascularization (eg, endovascular, open surgery). Patients with an immediately threatened extremity should preferentially undergo further evaluation in association with any planned intervention (endovascular, open surgical).
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with viable or marginally threatened limbs are usually candidates for urgent vascular imaging (typically computed tomographic [CT] angiography, or catheter-based arteriography) to evaluate arterial anatomy and to potentially institute thrombolytic therapy. The limitations of the CT angiography include artifact from heavy arterial calcification or from metallic foreign bodies such as bullet fragments in the case of traumatic injury. Software is available that can help to reduce the artifact from the foreign bodies. While CT and magnetic resonance (MR) angiography can reliably diagnose the location and severity of arterial stenosis or occlusion with high sensitivity and specificity, other modalities are needed for treatment (eg, thrombolysis, angioplasty). Catheter-based arteriography (digital subtraction arteriography) generally provides the most useful information and a treatment option. In addition to demonstrating arterial anatomy, arteriography can usually distinguish between thrombosis and embolism.

         An embolus will often demonstrate a sharp cutoff with a rounded reverse meniscus sign. The embolus may also be visible as an intraluminal filling defect if the vessel is not completely occluded. Other findings that are most consistent with an embolus include the presence of otherwise normal vessels, the absence of collateral circulation, and the presence of multiple filling defects.

         Arterial thrombosis is usually seen as a sharp or tapered, but not rounded, cutoff on arteriography. For patients with thrombosis of an atherosclerotic segment, or occlusion of a prior revascularization, vascular imaging studies should be compared with any previously performed studies (if available).

         These clinical and radiographic features help determine whether surgical revascularization or catheter-directed thrombolysis (with or without endovascular intervention) is the most appropriate initial treatment. When thrombolysis is more suitable, proceeding directly to catheter-based arteriography expedites treatment and minimizes overall intravenous contrast load.

         For chronic ischemia, vascular imaging may include duplex ultrasound, CT or MR angiography, or conventional catheter-based arteriography. The type of vascular imaging selected depends on the likely cause of ischemia. Noninvasive vascular studies (eg, digital plethysmography, formal wrist-brachial indices and pulse volume recordings) are frequently performed initially to confirm the diagnosis and level of disease. Cerebrovascular duplex ultrasonography may show retrograde vertebral arterial Doppler waveforms, which signify proximal subclavian artery occlusion  (

         ) and may demonstrate typical "steal" physiology. Noninvasive vascular studies are also useful for long-term surveillance after revascularization.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with hemodialysis arteriovenous access and symptoms of ischemia, dialysis access steal syndrome can be confirmed with "normalization" of duplex flow or digital plethysmography waveforms with manual occlusion of the AV fistula. Digital subtraction angiography can be used to evaluate the vasculature to rule out preexisting stenotic lesions that limit flow into the forearm and hand. It also helps evaluate the quality of the outflow vessels. (See

         For patients with embolism, further evaluation and treatment focus on preventing recurrent events. Following an embolic event, after managing the acute ischemic insult, the subsequent diagnostic evaluation is focused on identifying the suspected embolic source. Once the source is known, treatment may involve additional intervention to remove or exclude the source from the circulation, or the use of adjunctive medical therapies. (See

         Acute compartment syndrome of the upper extremity is commonly related to traumatic injury. It may be difficult to differentiate hand ischemia that is due to arterial injury from that which is related to increased compartment pressure (arm, forearm, hand). Important clinical findings of compartment syndrome include severe pain disproportionate to the physical findings, passive extension causing pain of the compartment constituent muscles, or tense fascia by palpation. If not recognized, compartment syndrome can progress to an irreversible state (ie, Volkmann contracture). (See

         Complex regional pain syndrome is a disorder that usually affects the distal limbs and is characterized by pain, swelling, limited range of motion, vasomotor instability, skin changes, and patchy bone demineralization. It frequently begins following a fracture, soft tissue injury, or surgery. Symptoms may be confused with chronic distal ischemia; however, the pulses are normal. (See

         Frostbite, which can lead to digital gangrene, is a severe, localized cold-induced injury due to freezing of tissue. History of an antecedent exposure usually makes the diagnosis.

          Upper extremity ischemia
         </strong>
         – Upper extremity ischemia is relatively rare compared with the ischemia affecting the lower extremity. Upper extremity ischemia can be due to a sudden (ie, acute) or gradual (ie, chronic) loss of blood flow. Acute ischemia is defined as having an onset of symptoms of less than two weeks. Acute thrombosis of an already narrowed segment is much less common in the upper extremity, but it can also occur (ie, acute-on-chronic ischemia). (See
         <a class="local">

         </strong>
         – The upper extremity arterial circulation is affected by a wide variety of diseases  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef128128" href="/z/d/graphic/128128.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), which contrasts with the lower extremities, for which atherosclerotic occlusion predominates. The most common cause of acute upper extremity ischemia is embolism from a cardiac source. Acute arterial occlusion can also be due to thrombosis (eg, atherosclerotic stenosis) or related to direct arterial trauma, arterial dissection, or acute thrombosis of a stent or graft. Upper extremity ischemia related to hemodialysis arteriovenous (AV) access can present as dialysis access steal syndrome (DASS) or ischemic monomelic neuropathy (IMN), and when it occurs, it is a major source of upper extremity morbidity.

         <strong>
          Clinical presentations
         </strong>
         – The clinical presentation of acute arterial occlusion depends upon the time course of vessel occlusion, the location of the affected vessels, and the ability to recruit collateral channels to provide flow around the occlusion, and whether there is underlying vascular disease. Given the robust collateral circulation in the upper extremity (around shoulder, around elbow), clinical signs can vary depending on the location of the lesion.

         <strong>
          Acute ischemia
         </strong>
         – The classic physical signs of acute limb ischemia in a patient without underlying occlusive vascular disease are the six Ps (pain, pallor, pulselessness, poikilothermia, paresthesia, and paralysis). In the upper extremity, these findings usually suggest acute embolism from a cardiac source. When collateral circulation cannot compensate, subjective sensory deficits are signs of early nerve dysfunction, and major sensory or motor loss is indicative of advanced ischemia. (See

          Chronic ischemia

         <strong>
          Vascular imaging
         </strong>
         – While the diagnosis of upper extremity ischemia can usually be made based on clinical findings, vascular imaging may be necessary to identify the specific etiology. Patients with an immediately threatened extremity treatment should preferentially undergo further evaluation in association with any planned intervention (endovascular, open surgical). Patients with viable or marginally threatened limbs are usually candidates for urgent vascular imaging (computed tomographic [CT] angiography, catheter-based arteriography) to evaluate arterial anatomy. When thrombolysis is suitable, proceeding directly to catheter-based arteriography expedites treatment and minimizes overall intravenous contrast load. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Vascular imaging'

         <strong>
          Treatment
         </strong>
         – Treatment is based on the etiology, severity, and duration of upper extremity ischemia. Most patients are initially treated with intravenous
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8518" href="/z/d/drug information/8518.html" rel="external">
          unfractionated heparin
         </a>
         as soon as the diagnosis of acute upper extremity ischemia is made to limit propagation of thrombus. Specific treatment depends on the severity and etiology of ischemia and may include watchful waiting, thrombolytic therapy, upper extremity revascularization, and for some etiologies, adjunctive evaluation and treatment to prevent recurrent ischemia.
