         Most patients with lung cancer present for diagnostic evaluation because of suspicious symptoms or an incidental finding on chest imaging. The goal of the initial evaluation is to obtain sufficient clinical and radiologic information to guide diagnostic tissue biopsy, staging, and treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         This review will provide a general overview of the initial evaluation, diagnosis, and staging of patients with suspected lung cancer. Typically, the approach for those with suspected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the same for those with suspected small cell lung cancer, although most of the data are derived from patients with suspected NSCLC. Thus, throughout the text of this topic the term NSCLC is frequently cited. The approach to a patient and modalities used for tissue biopsy and treatment of patients with NSCLC are reviewed elsewhere.

         Local expertise and resources, institution and health system factors, and patient preferences all influence the approach taken. Multidisciplinary teams may help facilitate an investigative plan so that therapy can be implemented in a timely fashion. The selection of a biopsy modality, the role of multidisciplinary teams, and the procedures used to obtain tissue are discussed in detail separately. (See

         When feasible, our goal is to establish diagnosis and staging concurrently by targeting a lesion or site that establishes the most advanced stage (eg, thoracentesis with cytology examination of fluid to establish stage IV disease). However, in practice, patients may require multiple imaging studies and/or invasive tissue sampling for accurate diagnosis and staging.

         <strong>
          Timing
         </strong>
         – Our preference is that the initial evaluation of patients with suspected lung cancer be performed in a timely and efficient manner (eg, within six weeks, although times vary) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. This is particularly true for patients in whom there is a suspicion for small cell carcinoma, (eg, large, central tumors or bulky mediastinal disease). This approach is predicated on the relatively slow growth of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which typically has a doubling time of 90 to 180 days. While some observational series show improved time to therapy with system-driven interventions (eg, multidisciplinary clinic and tumor board, health care- and hospital-associated rapid investigation systems), few studies report improved patient-relevant outcomes due to the intervention [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For patients who have a delay in completion of evaluation by eight weeks or more from the time of initial imaging, we reimage to evaluate a change in stage since some cases are rapidly growing and can progress during the evaluation period. One case series reported disease progression in 13 percent of patients at four weeks, 31 percent at eight weeks, and 46 percent at 16 weeks, respectively, with distant metastasis newly evident in 3, 13, and 13 percent of cases [
         <a href="#rid8">

         A prolonged diagnostic work-up can ultimately delay and complicate definitive cancer therapy [

         with the evaluation of NSCLC. The evaluation of patients with possible paraneoplastic syndromes is discussed in the following sections:

Priority issues for many patients include life expectancy, daily functioning, side effects, uncertainty about longer-term results, and impact on caregivers [

         Lung cancer may be suspected because the patient has either symptoms suggestive of cancer (eg, cough hemoptysis, dyspnea) or an incidental abnormality on imaging (eg, chest computed tomography [CT] obtained in an asymptomatic patient for another reason), or by screening with low-dose CT. Patients can also present with the manifestations of paraneoplastic syndromes. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4641.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         In every patient with suspected lung cancer, we perform a thorough history and physical examination, with particular attention to nonpulmonary symptoms that might suggest metastases. Features that suggest metastases are listed in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef93836" href="/z/d/graphic/93836.html" rel="external">
          table 2

        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with suspected lung cancer, we review all current chest imaging and compare with prior imaging, since the time course of identified lesions is an important determinant of the likelihood that a nodule or mass represents cancer [

         The identification of patients in these categories helps guide the clinician to select a target site for tissue biopsy. As an example, patients in group A generally are not candidates for surgical treatment. The focus of biopsy in this setting is on diagnosis of the tumor by the safest method, and imaging may be used as the staging modality. By contrast, for patients with discrete suspicious lymphadenopathy (group B), invasive sampling of the mediastinum and, in particular, the targeted node, is critical for accurate staging. The selection of modality based upon the radiographic findings described above (A through D) and disease stage is discussed in detail separately. (See

          Limitations

         – The major limitation of CT is its low sensitivity in the identification of lymph node metastases [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,21
         </a>
         ]. A 2013 systematic review of 43 studies reported the value of CT as a mediastinal staging tool in 7368 patients with suspected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]; a positive scan was defined as lymph nodes measuring &gt;1 cm in short-scanning diameter (prevalence of mediastinal metastasis was 30 percent). CT predicted mediastinal lymph node involvement with a sensitivity of 55 percent, specificity of 81 percent, positive predictive value of 58 percent, and negative predictive value of 83 percent.

         The two approaches are largely concordant but are divergent for imaging in patients with small lung cancers for which metastatic likelihood is low; some argue whole-body imaging is not needed in the absence of symptoms and risk factors, whereas others have a low threshold to obtain whole-body FDG PET/CT in this setting. By contrast, when extensive disease is likely, most experts typically obtain whole-body imaging with FDG PET/CT and brain imaging in those with a high likelihood of brain metastases. (See

         )) or in whom a diagnosis of lung cancer has already been made, FDG PET/CT is performed, even if chest CT imaging has already been obtained. When PET or integrated PET/CT is not available, conventional staging with abdominal CT and bone scintigraphy is sufficient, although not as sensitive. The use of PET/CT provides a comprehensive image-based analysis of lymph nodes and is supported by data that suggest that integrated PET/CT is superior to either modality alone at detecting occult disease. These data are discussed below. (See

         Patients with CT stage III or IV disease also typically undergo routine imaging of the brain with gadolinium-enhanced MRI, or contrast-enhanced CT if MRI is not available. This strategy also allows for the early detection and treatment of brain metastases before development of neurologic deficits or seizures. (See

         For patients with suspected localized lung cancer that is amenable to curative resection (eg, stage I/II), the timing of imaging with whole body FDG PET/CT is controversial and is dependent upon several factors including radiographic stage, lesion size, and amenability of resection [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22-25
         </a>
         ]. Many experts obtain PET/CT in this group of patients with the expectation that PET/CT will further reduce the risk of unnecessary surgery and guide the optimal biopsy site. Other experts selectively perform PET/CT first in some patients (eg, patients with evidence of hilar nodes) or perform tissue biopsy first without PET/CT (eg, patients with small lesions that are amenable to curative resection) [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21,26-30
         </a>
         ]. In such cases, and particularly in the absence of lymphadenopathy, it may be reasonable to first estimate the probability of malignancy based on the imaging and patient characteristics. This estimate may be useful in determining the sequence of testing and provides necessary information for patient engagement and decision-making for subsequent steps. This calculation is provided separately. (See

         Both options (ie, using or not using PET/CT) carry risk, specifically the risk of false positives and a small risk from the ionizing radiation exposure (when PET/CT is performed) and the risk of missing occult disease (when PET/CT is not performed). Patient values and preferences may play a key role when making this decision. (See

         The main advantage of this approach is the superior sensitivity of PET/CT for detecting occult disease, but the main disadvantage is relatively high false-positive rate. In addition, patients with equivocal FDG PET/CT findings may need additional imaging. (See

         Whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) can be performed as a stand-alone test or be integrated with computed tomography (CT; ie, integrated PET/CT), although in the United States, the latter has overwhelmingly replaced PET alone  (

         ). Choosing between PET and integrated PET/CT is provider-, institution-, and region-specific. However, because integrated PET/CT is more accurate for lymph node staging than CT or PET alone [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,21,31,32
         </a>

         – With the exception of brain metastases, whole-body PET and to a greater degree, PET/CT scanning is more sensitive than CT alone in detecting tumor invasion, occult disease, lymph node involvement, and intra- and extrathoracic metastases [

          1,21,31-39
         </a>
         ]. Small randomized studies and case series of PET or PET/CT suggest that, when used for lung cancer staging, unsuspected metastases are discovered between 6 and 36 percent of cases [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40-43
         </a>
         ]. Additionally, their discovery can result in stage migration (up-stage or down-stage) and changes in management in 19 to 22 percent of patients [

         above) with information regarding the metabolic activity of the tumor and any local or distant metastases (with the exception of brain metastases). Integrated PET/CT provides information on lymph node size, FDG avidity, shape, proximity to the tumor, location, the presence of other enlarged lymph nodes, and change in lymph node size over serial imaging (if available) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,47,48
         </a>
         ]. For example, if metabolic activity is seen in the region of the mediastinum, its relation to vascular, hilar, or endobronchial structures may be unclear by PET imaging alone but can be better appreciated on CT, thereby demonstrating that the mediastinal activity originates from a specific location [

PET is more accurate in the evaluation of mediastinal disease (N) when compared with contrast-enhanced chest CT, and sometimes detects occult disease (eg, liver and bone) outside the thoracic cavity (M) that is not evident by CT. With respect to mediastinal staging by PET, one systematic review of 45 studies that included 4105 patients reported that PET had a sensitivity of 80 percent, specificity of 88 percent, positive predictive value of 75 percent, and negative predictive value of 91 percent [

          Potential reduction in potentially avoidable thoracotomies

         – Published literature supports the use of PET/CT predominately in the context of avoiding surgery in patients who have disease that does not benefit from surgery. Examples include patients with disease that cannot be fully resected (referred to as "futile thoracotomies" in some papers) or patients with benign disease. However, randomized trials evaluating the association between PET/CT scanning and therapeutic outcome in this population have had conflicting results [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22-25,49,50

         Pleural metastases commonly present as a pleural effusion, multiple pleural nodules, and direct extension of the primary tumor to the pleura or chest wall. Other presentations include pleural thickening and pleural puckering. Pleural effusions with no discernable pleural nodularity or thickening may also indicate pleural metastasis, although the specificity of the finding of fluid only is lower than of nodules or direct invasion. Complete evaluation of pleural disease may require multiple imaging modalities (eg, PET, ultrasound, and/or MRI) as well as invasive testing (thoracentesis, thoracoscopy, or pleural biopsy). While imaging is important in the detection of suspected pleural metastases, it generally does not obviate the need to sample the pleura for histologic confirmation. (See

          Contrast-enhanced chest CT
         </strong>
         – Contrast-enhanced chest CT imaging is particularly important in the evaluation of tumors with extension to the visceral pleura, parietal pleura, or extrapleural fat. Lesions with focal direct invasion through these planes may be operable and need to be distinguished from multifocal or diffuse metastatic disease that has spread throughout the pleural space (M1a), which is inoperable  (

Higher-resolution imaging options that can be considered in targeted situations to better evaluate the pericardium, myocardium, and/or chamber lumens include echocardiography, gated cardiac CT, and cardiac MRI. A complete discussion of the pros and cons of each option is beyond the scope of this summary.

         A diagnosis of lung cancer should not be made without definitive pathology. At a minimum, this involves selecting a biopsy site and obtaining an adequate sample for microscopic examination. Additional consideration needs to be given to obtaining sufficient sample for supplemental immunohistochemical (IHC) and genetic analyses.

         Acquiring tissue for microscopic examination is necessary for the diagnosis and staging of patients with suspected lung cancer. Most data are derived from studies of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although not absolute, minimally invasive modalities (eg, endoscopic procedures) are typically preferred over more invasive modalities (eg, video-assisted thoracic surgery and mediastinoscopy) for the initial biopsy. However, for patients with suspicious but isolated peripheral pulmonary lesions that are suspected to be localized disease, surgical biopsy is sometimes preferred because diagnosis and curative resection may be achieved simultaneously.

         Bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-directed biopsy has emerged as the most common modality used for diagnosis and staging of suspected NSCLC due to its high diagnostic accuracy for accessing central primary tumors and most mediastinal lymph nodes. Percutaneous computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy is also commonly used when lesions are less accessible by bronchoscopy (eg, peripheral lesions). Selection of modality is discussed in detail separately. (See

         If initial tissue sampling provides inconclusive results or is insufficient for essential IHC or molecular characterization, a second biopsy procedure is required.

         The differential diagnosis of NSCLC depends on the presenting symptoms and imaging findings. Biopsy with IHC staining of specimens is required to distinguish NSCLC from other primary thoracic and mediastinal tumors, primary SCLC, metastatic disease arising outside the lung, and other nonmalignant lesions of the lung. Among the malignant etiologies, the major entity that needs to be distinguished from NSCLC is SCLC. This distinction is critical because the prognosis and treatment for NSCLC and SCLC are different.

         Although not always present, there are a number of clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features that can help the clinician make this distinction:

          Rapid presentation
         </strong>
         – Although the common symptoms of lung cancer, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and chest pain, can be encountered in both NSCLC and SCLC, a more rapid presentation over weeks favors SCLC. This may be due to the faster growth rate associated with SCLC. As an example, a rapidly growing lesion on chest imaging (eg, a mass that grows over three to six weeks) is more suggestive of SCLC rather than NSCLC.

          Pancoast syndrome

         – Benign and malignant lesions of the superior sulcus (ie, the thoracic inlet at the apex of the lung) can cause Pancoast syndrome. Pancoast syndrome is a constellation of one or more clinical signs (eg, weakness and atrophy of the muscles of the hand and/or ipsilateral ptosis, anhidrosis, and miosis [Horner syndrome]) that are due to compression or involvement of the brachial plexus (nerves and vessel) and the cervical sympathetic nerves. Unlike superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, Pancoast syndrome is overwhelmingly more common in NSCLC and rarely due to SCLC or a benign lesion. Imaging findings of apical masses that have malignant features should always prompt additional evaluation and biopsy for NSCLC involvement of the thoracic outlet. (See

         – The major histologic feature that distinguishes NSCLC from SCLC is cell size. Typically, the cells in SCLC are roughly twice the size of lymphocytes when subjectively assessed on light microscopy. Additional features that distinguish SCLC from NSCLC are described above (see
         <a class="local">
          'Histopathology, immunohistochemistry, genetic mutations'
         </a>
         above). When classic features of SCLC are present, morphologic criteria alone are often diagnostic and supported by high interobserver reliability [
         <a href="#rid93">
          93
         </a>
         ]. By contrast, the classic features of epithelial differentiation (eg, keratin pearls [squamous], gland formation [adenocarcinoma]) are highly suggestive for NSCLC. (See

         The clinical-diagnostic stage is based upon all investigations (clinical, laboratory, radiologic, and pathologic) that are undertaken prior to surgical resection. It is assigned the prefix c (eg, cT3N2M0). A limitation of clinical-diagnostic staging is that the stage is related to the intensity of the preoperative evaluation. Thus, a less aggressively staged patient may be inaccurately staged.

It provides confirmation of the T descriptor, N descriptor, and histologic type.

          Initial evaluation

         – Lung cancer may be suspected because either the patient has symptoms suggestive of cancer (eg, cough hemoptysis, dyspnea, weight loss) or an abnormality was found incidentally (eg, chest computed tomography [CT] obtained in an asymptomatic patient for another reason) or by lung cancer screening.

         – The approach to imaging for patients with suspected lung cancer varies from center to center. Acceptable approaches should establish the highest radiologic stage and identify the optimal biopsy site. Once imaging is complete, we proceed with choosing an optimal biopsy site or surgical approach, the details of which are discussed separately. (See

When PET or integrated PET/CT is not available, conventional staging with abdominal CT and bone scintigraphy is sufficient, although not as sensitive. This approach provides a comprehensive image-based analysis of lymph nodes and is supported by data which report that integrated PET/CT is superior to either modality alone at detecting occult disease.

         For patients with suspected localized-stage lung cancer (eg, stage I/II), imaging with whole-body FDG PET/CT is controversial and is dependent upon several factors including radiographic stage, lesion size, and amenability of resection. Many experts obtain PET/CT in this group of patients with the expectation that PET/CT will further reduce the risk of unnecessary surgery and guide the optimal biopsy site. Other experts selectively perform PET/CT first in some patients (eg, patients with evidence of hilar nodes) or perform tissue biopsy first without PET/CT (eg, patients with small lesions that are amenable to curative resection)

        </p>

         This approach is supported by the superior ability of PET/CT to detect occult disease compared with either modality alone and conflicting data that suggested a possible reduction in potentially avoidable thoracotomies by the detection of occult stage IV disease. Limitations of PET or PET/CT are the relatively high-false positive rate, lack of standardized criteria regarding what constitutes a positive result, poor sensitivity for the detection of brain metastases, need for confirmation on tissue sampling, and issues related to cost from third-party payers.

          Clinical-directed approach

         – This approach involves using the chest CT and clinical evaluation to determine whether additional imaging needs to be performed to determine potential sites of metastases. (See

         The initial contrast-enhanced chest CT is evaluated to assess the extent of the primary tumor and potential spread to the mediastinum, liver, thoracic skeleton, and adrenal glands. (See

         A diagnosis of lung cancer is made based upon the pathologic evaluation of cytologic (eg, pleural fluid) or histopathologic (eg, tissue biopsy) specimens. Consideration should be given to obtaining a large enough sample to allow supplemental immunohistochemical (IHC) and genetic analysis. (See

         Adenocarcinoma, squamous carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma are the four major histologic subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The main entity on the differential diagnosis of NSCLC is small cell lung cancer (SCLC). While clinical and imaging features can help the clinician distinguish NSCLC from SCLC, histopathologic features and IHC markers are required to make this distinction. (See
