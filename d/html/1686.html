         Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. The course of MS is variable. For some, MS is a disease with one or two acute neurologic episodes and no further evidence of disease activity. In others, it is a chronic relapsing or progressive disease, with an unpredictable clinical course that may span 10 to 20 years, during which time neurologic disability accumulates. Most experts view MS as occurring on a spectrum, in which episodic, immune-mediated events (relapses and the accumulation of new lesions on magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) occur more typical at younger ages and wane in frequency as a person with MS ages; at the same time, accumulating neurodegeneration gives rise in many patients to gradually worsening disability, known as progressive disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will discuss treatment of secondary progressive MS. The treatment of primary progressive MS and relapsing-remitting MS is discussed separately. (See

         MS is categorized into several clinical subtypes, including relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), as reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/96029.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical presentation, course, and prognosis of multiple sclerosis in adults", section on 'Disease onset and pattern'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Relapses are characterized by clearly defined acute to subacute attacks (also known as flares or exacerbations) with full or incomplete recovery in the absence of fever. In MS clinical trials, these symptoms are required to last at least 24 hours. Progressive disease is characterized by the slow, chronic accumulation of disability, which may be accompanied by occasional plateaus, temporary minor improvements, and/or superimposed acute relapses.
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         RRMS is characterized by clearly defined relapses with either full recovery, or with sequelae and residual deficit upon recovery. There is no or minimal disease progression during the periods between disease relapses, though individual relapses themselves may occasionally result in severe residual disability.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         SPMS evolves from relapsing-remitting disease, hence the designation of "secondary," as over time the disease enters a stage of steady deterioration in function, with or without superimposed attacks. When the secondary progressive stage is reached, the relapse rate is typically reduced. This may be a phenomenon of immunosenescence, as relapses and new MS lesions are less common as people age, while progressive MS is more likely as age increases. SPMS, which ultimately develops in up to 90 percent of patients with RRMS after 25 years, causes the greatest amount of neurologic disability attributable to MS.

         PPMS represents approximately 10 percent of MS cases and is characterized by disease progression from onset, although occasional plateaus, temporary minor improvements, and acute relapses may occur.

         A diagnosis of SPMS is made only by taking a careful history, as there are no physical exam findings, laboratory markers, or radiographic features that separate it from RRMS. The change from RRMS to SPMS is a gradual process rather than an abrupt transition [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Often, the diagnosis is made retrospectively. Although a clear consensus is lacking, one definition of SPMS requires that a patient with MS and a history of at least one clinical relapse (ie, RRMS) has a period of continuous disability progression of at least 6 to 12 months that is independent of clinical relapses [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. (See

         The MS subtypes (RRMS, SPMS, and PPMS) are further modified by assessments of disease activity and disease progression. Disease activity is determined by clinical relapses or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of contrast-enhancing lesions and/or new or unequivocally enlarging T2 lesions. Disease progression is a measure of disability, and it is independently quantified from relapses, even for RRMS; it is characteristic of PPMS and SPMS. Thus, the phenotype of progressive disease (PPMS and SPMS) can be characterized as one of the following [

          Approach to choosing disease-modifying therapy

         </span>
         For most patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) with who reach the stage of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) and have active disease with ongoing clinical relapses and/or new MS lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we suggest using a MS disease-modifying therapy (DMT). The choice of DMT should be individualized based upon disease activity and progression, adverse effect profile, and patient preference. Potential therapeutic options for patients with active SPMS, at least in the United States, include all DMTs approved for relapsing forms of MS.
        </p>
        <p>
         While there is evidence from a placebo-controlled randomized trial that oral
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="120818" href="/z/d/drug information/120818.html" rel="external">
          siponimod
         </a>
         was effective for reducing disability progression at three and six months for patients with SPMS, there is not a strong rationale for its exclusive use in this MS subtype, particularly when other DMTs may suppress relapses or lesions just as well (see
         <a class="local">
          'DMTs used for active SPMS'
         </a>
         below). Observational data from a MS registry also suggest DMTs are associated with a reduced rate of disability progression in patients with active SPMS [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Some of our expert contributors treat active SPMS with an approach similar to how they treat RRMS, believing that none of the approved DMTs really prevents neurodegeneration. In their view, the treatment target is still inflammatory activity (ie, relapses and new MS lesions), and continuing or switching DMT is unlikely to alter the course of disease progression.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, for patients who reach the stage of SPMS and have a relatively low level of active disease while on a DMT, it is reasonable to continue the same DMT used during the relapsing-remitting phase of MS. For patients with a higher level of active disease, it may also be reasonable to switch to another DMT that is selected based upon the individual risk/benefit profile, but no randomized clinical trials have addressed this issue. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Suboptimal response to DMT'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although definitive data are lacking, subgroups of patients with progressive MS characterized by younger age, recent relapses, recent MRI disease activity, or recent disability progression may be more likely to benefit from DMT in comparison with patients lacking these characteristics [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Those who are older or more disabled may also be at greater risk of infectious adverse events related to DMT.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with inactive SPMS (ie, no ongoing relapses or gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI of the brain and spinal cord) who have been nonambulatory for at least two years, it is reasonable to discuss stopping DMT. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Inactive SPMS'
         </a>
         below.)

          siponimod
         </a>
         has shown efficacy for reducing the risk of disability progression in a large randomized trial of patients with SPMS. However, there have not been large randomized trials evaluating other DMTs approved for relapsing forms of MS in patients with SPMS, and differences in the included patient populations may account for some of the discrepancies in outcomes among the smaller trials that have been conducted.

         is a recombinant chimeric monoclonal antibody that also targets CD20 and is thought to act primarily by depleting CD20-positive B cells. Rituximab has been widely used off-label to treat patients with active forms of MS. A retrospective cohort study of patients with SPMS, using propensity-matched scoring and with varying doses of rituximab, found that patients treated with rituximab had lower Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores during a mean follow-up of 3.5 years and delayed time to confirmed disability progression compared with control patients never treated with rituximab (hazard ratio 0.49, 95% CI 0.26-0.93) [

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         For patients with active SPMS who have a suboptimal response to DMT, as determined by evidence of ongoing disease activity with attacks (relapses) and/or the development of new MS lesions (see
         <a class="local">
          'Monitoring'
         </a>
         below), switching to a different DMT is a reasonable option. Continued progression independent of relapses generally is not a reason to change DMT. Ultimately, the decision is based upon clinical experience and individual patient characteristics, as no randomized clinical trials have addressed this issue. Careful discussion surrounding such decisions is important, particularly considering the potential for overlapping immune suppression surrounding treatment switches.
        </p>
        <p>
         The frequency and severity of clinical relapses and MRI lesion activity on therapy are the crucial factors in determining a suboptimal response to DMT. Fewer data are available, however, to determine the appropriate threshold for recommending a treatment switch after breakthrough disease in patients with SPMS, and it is less clear than in RRMS whether breakthrough disease has as great an association with long-term disability as it does when it occurs early in the RRMS period. Thus, a single relapse of mild severity or a single new MRI lesion within six months of starting DMT is usually insufficient to demand a change in therapy. However, any serious relapse, multiple relapses regardless of severity, or a pronounced increase in MRI activity with multiple contrast-enhancing lesions, particularly after more than a few months on therapy, should prompt a review of treatment options with a predisposition to change the DMT.
        </p>
        <p>
         In discussing with a given patient, it is important to review that, with the possible exception of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="120818" href="/z/d/drug information/120818.html" rel="external">
          siponimod
         </a>
         , none of the currently available DMTs are definitively proven to reduce disability progression for patients who appear to have SPMS (although our expert contributors generally think it is unlikely that siponimod has unique disability prevention capacity). This factor must be considered when deciding whether to switch to another DMT and, in general, to establish the overall goals of DMT for a given patient. These goals include the need to balance the risks posed by the medications with the risks posed by the disease, though prognosticating long-term outcomes in MS is difficult. The contribution of medication adherence and other factors to inadequate treatment response is also important.

While there does not appear to be any long-term effect in the degree of functional recovery from an attack following the use of glucocorticoids, it is possible that regular pulse glucocorticoids may be useful in the long-term management of patients with SPMS, particularly those who continue to have acute attacks in addition to progression between relapses. In a trial of bimonthly IV methylprednisolone in SPMS, 108 patients were randomly assigned to receive either high-dose (500 mg) or low-dose (10 mg) methylprednisolone once daily for three consecutive days every eight weeks for two years [
         <a href="#rid27">

Although there was no difference in the proportions of patients in each treatment group who experienced sustained progression of disability, the time to onset of sustained treatment failure was delayed in the high-dose group.

However, lower extremity function, as measured by ambulation and disability scales, was not affected. There was no clinically significant toxicity. The relatively low dose of oral methotrexate (7.5 mg weekly) studied in this trial is a potential explanation for the lack of clear benefit. Whether higher doses given intravenously or intrathecally would be more effective in MS is unclear. The safety of methotrexate has been established in patients receiving 20 mg subcutaneously weekly [

A systematic review of five randomized, controlled trials of azathioprine versus placebo for MS (including patients with relapsing-remitting and progressive types of MS) found that azathioprine treatment significantly reduced the number of patients who had relapses; data from three trials with a total of 87 patients suggested that azathioprine also reduced disability progression during the first two to three years of treatment [

The most common side effect of azathioprine is an idiosyncratic flu-like illness with fever, nausea, vomiting, and malaise, which affects approximately 10 percent of treated patients and typically develops in the first few weeks of treatment. Less common, but serious, potential adverse effects include hepatotoxicity, suppression of the white blood count, and pancreatitis. In addition, the risk of malignancy may be increased with long-term use of azathioprine.

         For patients who transition from RRMS to SPMS while on DMT and enter a stage of inactive disease (ie, no ongoing relapses or gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI of the brain and spinal cord) and who have been nonambulatory for at least two years, it is reasonable to discuss discontinuing DMT [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. Many patients with progressive MS are older and less likely to have active disease, and therefore less likely to respond to DMT. Furthermore, since progressive MS is an illness of decades, a patient with inactive but progressing MS may be more likely to develop infectious and other complications of immunosuppressive therapy due to long exposure and older age. However, clinical experience suggests that severe rebound of MS activity may sometimes occur after stopping some DMTs, even in patients with progressive MS, though this is not common. These are highly individualized decisions without clear data to drive them. The evidence for patients with MS who stop DMTs is inconsistent. One study identified 426 patients (median age 45 years) with stable MS (ie, no relapses for five or more years) who stopped DMT; relapses during follow-up were reported by 36 percent of patients and DMT was restarted by 46 percent [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. By contrast, another study tracked 178 patients age 60 and older who stopped their DMT; only one patient experienced a relapse, and only 11 percent restarted DMT [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. The DISCOMS trial should help determine whether it is safe to stop DMT in older, stable patients [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43,44
         </a>

        <p>
         DMT is generally continued indefinitely for patients with previously active MS who transition to inactive SPMS while still ambulatory, with the rationale that the preserved ability to walk has been safeguarded by DMT. There is no clear indication for starting DMT or other immune-modulating therapy anew for patients with SPMS in the absence of active disease [

          2

          Evaluation for progression

         <a href="#rid3">
          3,46
         </a>
         ]. Progression can be determined from patient history and/or objective measures, such as a worsening of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ) that persists for a number of months. Ambulatory disability progression is particularly important, and the 25-foot timed walk, used by most centers, is a good yet simple measure for determining ambulatory changes. However, given fluctuations in the examination of individual patients and variation between examiners, it can be difficult to be certain of progression or stability, especially in the short-term. Therefore, progression or regression of activities of daily living (ADL) competence as obtained from the patient is also important to evaluate, particularly in non-ambulatory patients (eg, ability to transfer, self-care, etc). Note that the EDSS and assessments for progression are best administered by MS experts or other clinicians with experience in these measures.

          Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS

         ) – This subtype of multiple sclerosis (MS) evolves from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) as the disease over time enters a stage of steady deterioration in function, unrelated to acute attacks. The change from RRMS to SPMS is a gradual process rather than an abrupt transition. Although a clear consensus is lacking, one definition of SPMS requires that a patient with multiple sclerosis and a history of at least one clinical relapse (ie, RRMS) has a period of continuous disability progression of at least 6 to 12 months that is independent of clinical relapses.

          Disease activity and progression
         </strong>
         – The subtypes of MS are further modified by assessments of disease activity and disease progression. Disease activity is determined by clinical relapses or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of contrast-enhancing lesions and/or new or unequivocally enlarging T2 lesions. Disease progression is a measure of disability, and it is independently quantified from relapses; it is characteristic of both primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) and SPMS. (See

          'Disease activity and progression'

          Who should be treated with DMT?
         </strong>
         – For most patients who reach the stage of SPMS and have active disease, as determined by ongoing clinical relapses and/or new MS lesions on MRI, we suggest starting or continuing MS disease-modifying therapy (DMT) (

         <strong>
          Choosing DMT
         </strong>
         – Therapeutic options for patients with active SPMS, at least in the United States, include all DMTs approved for relapsing forms of MS. Despite evidence that
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="120818" href="/z/d/drug information/120818.html" rel="external">
          siponimod
         </a>
         was modestly effective for reducing disability progression at six months in patients with SPMS, there is not a strong rationale for its exclusive use in SPMS, particularly when other DMTs may suppress relapses or lesions just as well. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Approach to choosing disease-modifying therapy'
         </a>
         above.)

         </span>
         Some of our expert contributors treat active SPMS with an approach similar to that for RRMS. For patients with a relatively low level of active disease, continuing the same DMT used during the relapsing-remitting phase of MS is often the best option.

          Suboptimal response to treatment
         </strong>
         – For patients with active SPMS who have a suboptimal response to DMT, as determined by evidence of ongoing disease activity with attacks (relapses) and/or the development of new MS lesions, switching to a different DMT is a reasonable option. However, the decision is based upon clinical experience and individual patient characteristics, as no randomized clinical trials have addressed this issue. (See

          Inactive disease and stopping DMT
         </strong>
         – For patients with inactive disease (ie, no ongoing relapses or gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI of the brain and spinal cord) who have been nonambulatory for at least two years, it is reasonable to discuss stopping DMT. (See

          Symptom management

         – Multidisciplinary management for the common complications and symptoms of MS is critical. These complications include bladder and bowel dysfunction, cognitive impairment, depression, fatigue, gait impairment, heat intolerance, pain, sexual dysfunction, sleep disorders, spasticity, speech and swallowing dysfunction, tremor, vertigo, and visual disturbances, as reviewed separately.
