In addition, multiple studies suggest that the diagnosis is missed in at least 50 percent of depressed primary care patients [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. However, these findings should be interpreted with recognition of the primary care approach to diagnosis over several office visits, the complexity of diagnosing depression in the context of chronic general medical illnesses, and that depressed patients who present to primary care practices may be less severely ill than patients who present to psychiatric practices.</p><p>This topic reviews the assessment and diagnosis of depression in adults.

Depressed (dysphoric) mood may be a normal and, at times, adaptive response to loss, disappointment, or perceived failure. In addition, depressed mood may be a symptom of a psychopathological syndrome or another medical disorder  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef122105" href="/d/graphic/122105.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Syndrome, which is a constellation of symptoms and signs that may include depressed mood.

As an example, the syndrome of major depression can occur in several disorders, such as unipolar major depression (also called “major depressive disorder”), bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, substance/medication-induced depressive disorder, and depressive disorder due to another (general) medical condition.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H105621449"><span class="h1">ASSESSMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Unipolar depressive disorders are defined by syndromic criteria, so diagnosis depends upon the clinical history and examination. Most symptom severity scales used in depression screening do not provide a diagnosis, and regardless, a clinical interview is necessary to clarify which depressive disorder is present and to address the differential diagnosis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H105621472"><span class="h2">History of present illness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>History is the most important component of the evaluation. The history should be obtained from the patient and may often involve others such as family members or other clinicians [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

In older adults, and in younger persons at risk for major or mild neurocognitive disorder or delirium because of general medical/neurologic illness, it is important to ask about neurocognitive symptoms (eg, attention, concentration, and memory).

Bipolar disorder often presents initially with depression rather than mania or hypomania, and multiple episodes of bipolar depression may occur prior to the first lifetime episode of mania/hypomania. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/86602.html" rel="external">"Bipolar disorder in adults: Assessment and diagnosis", section on 'Unipolar major depression'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>It is useful to distinguish unipolar major depression that has lasted less than two years from depressive syndromes (including major depression) that have lasted two or more years (ie, persistent depressive disorder [dysthymia]). Clinicians can ask, “During the last two years, have you had a period of two or more consecutive months when you had none of the problems you just described?” Recall of such a period can be followed by questions about specific symptoms, because these follow-up questions often reveal that the symptom-free interval was less than two months. Two months with no symptoms or the near absence of symptoms is generally regarded as defining remission from the depressive episode. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14674.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Continuation and maintenance treatment", section on 'Continuation and maintenance treatment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H611891"><span class="h3">Suicide risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All depressed patients must be queried specifically about suicidal ideation and behavior.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1708.html" rel="external">"Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H611997"><span class="h3">General medical illness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Given the potential for general medical conditions (spanning all organ systems) and drugs to cause or contribute to depressive episodes, the assessment should address all current and significant past general medical illnesses [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Medication use and a review of systems are also part of an assessment of potential contributors to the depressive condition.</p><p>In some studies, the evaluation of patients with general medical disorders for major depression has focused upon the five mood and cognitive symptoms of depression. (See <a class="local">'Unipolar major depression'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H105621622"><span class="h2">Family history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A family history may confer increased risk for particular disorders or suicide; thus, the patient should be asked about a family history of depression, suicide, psychosis (eg, delusions and hallucinations), and bipolar disorder. A family history of bipolar disorder suggests the possibility that the patient’s current depressive episode may represent bipolar depression. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/86602.html" rel="external">"Bipolar disorder in adults: Assessment and diagnosis", section on 'Unipolar major depression'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H105621628"><span class="h2">Social history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The evaluation includes interpersonal, occupational, or financial stressors and the context for the clinical presentation (which may impact treatment); in addition, the social history may identify possible sources of support that may be enlisted for treatment. Assessment of family functioning is often useful in understanding the context of the presenting disorder and possible need for family therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1710.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Family and couples therapy", section on 'Assessment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H105621634"><span class="h2">Mental status examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The mental status examination supplements the history by observing the presence of depressive signs, including alterations in mood and affect, cognition (eg, attention, concentration, and memory), psychomotor activity, ruminative thought processes, speech, and suicidal thoughts. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14067.html" rel="external">"The mental status examination in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H105621640"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although the benefit of screening physical examinations in depression has not been demonstrated, we suggest a physical examination for new onset depression (especially if the psychosocial context or precipitant is not clear), severe depression (particularly patients with melancholic or psychotic features), or treatment-resistant depression, as well as patients who have or at risk for chronic medical conditions. More detailed physical examination should be pursued as guided by the history and review of systems.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H105621646"><span class="h2">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with depressive symptoms in the absence of general medical symptoms or findings on examination, the utility of screening laboratory tests has not been demonstrated. Nevertheless, we suggest focused tests for new onset depression (especially if the psychosocial context or precipitant is not clear), severe depression (particularly patients with melancholic or psychotic features), or treatment-resistant depression [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Commonly performed screening laboratory tests include complete blood count, serum chemistry panels, urinalysis, thyroid stimulating hormone, rapid plasma reagin, human chorionic gonadotropin (pregnancy), and urine toxicology screen for drugs of abuse.</p><p>Additional laboratory evaluations should be pursued as guided by the medical history, review of systems, and physical examination. More extensive testing (eg, vitamin B12, folate, and electrocardiogram) is often indicated for patients who have chronic medical conditions, or are at increased risk for medical illnesses, including older adult or institutionalized patients, and patients with self-neglect or substance use disorders.</p><p>Neuroimaging studies are typically reserved for patients whose evaluation suggests an increased likelihood of structural brain disease [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. These include focal neurologic signs on physical examination or persistent cognitive impairment. However, it is reasonable to obtain neuroimaging in older depressed patients, especially patients with new onset depression in later life.</p><p>Preliminary studies have examined the utility of diagnosing unipolar major depression on the basis of biomarkers [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], but use of these tests is not standard practice, because little evidence supports their use in lieu of history and interview-derived data. As an example:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One study reported that a highly sensitive and specific panel of blood tests can differentiate patients with major depression from individuals without major depression [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]; however, the study methods were problematic [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. At the beginning of the study, patients with major depression were already diagnosed as such with clinical interviews, so it is not clear that the tests provided any benefit. In addition, the study excluded many types of patients who present with depression, including patients with substance use disorders, other medical problems (eg, rheumatoid arthritis), or a history of bipolar disorder, as well as patients taking commonly used drugs (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or antidepressants).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A review of 14 studies found that biomarkers (eg, markers of inflammation) may perhaps be greater in patients with melancholic depression than nonmelancholic depression [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. However, the studies often evaluated different markers, study samples were relatively small, and most of the positive results have not been replicated.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H86498830"><span class="h2">Screening for depression</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Screening for depression is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83887.html" rel="external">"Screening for depression in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H71005967"><span class="h2">Diagnostic instruments</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Structured and semi-structured, interviewer-administered, diagnostic instruments, such as the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 [<a href="#rid16">16</a>], are available for diagnosing unipolar depressive disorders but are rarely used in routine clinical practice. A structured instrument enables the interviewer to clarify ambiguous or contradictory responses, and may help differentiate the diagnosis of unipolar major depression (major depressive disorder) from bipolar depression. However, structured instruments are labor intensive and generally reserved for specialized evaluation, treatment, or research settings.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H105621652"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND CLASSIFICATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2167900447"><span class="h2">Nosology of depressive disorders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multiple taxonomies are available for diagnosing depressive disorders. We recommend diagnosing unipolar depressive disorders according to the criteria in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In DSM-5, the depressive disorders that can be diagnosed include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unipolar major depression (major depressive disorder)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994" href="/d/graphic/89994.html" rel="external">table 3</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91114" href="/d/graphic/91114.html" rel="external">table 4</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Premenstrual dysphoric disorder</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Substance/medication induced depressive disorder</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Depressive disorder due to another medical condition</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other specified depressive disorder (eg, minor depression)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unspecified depressive disorder</p><p></p><p>Each of the disorders is characterized by dysphoria (sad or irritable mood) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef122105" href="/d/graphic/122105.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>As with other psychiatric disorders defined by syndromes, each depressive disorder likely represents an etiologically heterogeneous group of conditions, with similar clinical manifestations, that are not currently distinguishable and that do not yet have differentially targeted treatments.</p><p>A reasonable alternative to DSM-5 for diagnosing depressive disorders is the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases-10<sup>th</sup> Revision (ICD-10) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. For major depression, the two sets of criteria are largely the same, whereas for other disorders such as dysthymia, the criteria differ substantially. ICD-10 mentions premenstrual tension syndrome (called premenstrual dysphoric disorder in DSM-5) as a diagnosis but provides no diagnostic criteria.

Thus, a physical examination and laboratory tests are often indicated for patients presenting with depressive symptoms to rule out another medical illness. (See <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above and <a class="local">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients with a general medical illness may present with a persistently depressed or irritable mood, or diminished interest or pleasure in most activities, which results in significant distress or impairs psychosocial functioning. The diagnosis in these cases is depressive disorder due to another medical condition. (See <a class="local">'Depressive disorder due to another medical condition'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients using medications prescribed for another medical illness may also present with a persistently depressed or irritable mood, or diminished interest or pleasure in most activities, which results in significant distress or impairs psychosocial functioning.

As an example, the diagnosis of unipolar major depression  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994" href="/d/graphic/89994.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) requires not only that the dysphoria occurs for most of the day for nearly every day for at least two weeks, but that the dysphoria is accompanied by at least four other depressive symptoms as well as significant distress or psychosocial impairment. Sadness and irritability are generally a normal, adaptive part of the human condition, particularly in response to loss, disappointment, or perceived failure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3329928558"><span class="h2">Burnout</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Burnout is a work-related condition that is characterized by emotional exhaustion, dissatisfaction with one’s accomplishments, and depersonalization (detachment from one’s job) [<a href="#rid45">45,46</a>]. The condition can occur in the context of chronic job-related stress, including medical practice.</p><p>Physician burnout appears to undermine career engagement and patient care [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. As an example, a meta-analysis included 170 observational studies (n &gt;230,000 physicians) and found that physicians with burnout were more than three times as likely to be dissatisfied with their career (odds ratio 3.8, 95% CI 3.2-4.4), regret their career choice (odds ratio 3.5, 95% CI 2.4-5.0), and to have thoughts or intentions to leave their job (odds ratio 3.1, 95% CI 2.3-4.2) [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. In addition, physicians with burnout were twice as likely to be involved in patient safety incidents (odds ratio 2.0, 95% CI 1.7-2.5), have low professionalism (odds ratio 2.3, 95% CI 2.0-2.7), and to receive low patient satisfaction ratings (odds ratio 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.6). However, heterogeneity across studies was substantial.</p><p>Job-stress can also lead to unipolar major depression, and symptoms that may be observed in both burnout and unipolar major depression include dysphoria, fatigue, and suicidal ideation. Distinguishing burnout from unipolar major depression is based primarily upon determining whether the individual meets diagnostic criteria for unipolar major depression  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994" href="/d/graphic/89994.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), because burnout is not a single standardized syndrome and is often poorly defined [<a href="#rid49">49</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H702280864"><span class="h2">Adjustment disorder with depressed mood</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Adjustment disorder with depressed mood and depressive disorders such as unipolar major depression can both present with dysphoria that occurs in the context of psychosocial stressors.
