It is also possible for two surgical routes to be combined in one operation, such as a laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy or a laparoscopic hysterectomy with a minilaparotomy to remove the uterus. When selecting a route for hysterectomy, the surgeon balances the medical indication, patient profile, risks and benefits, safety, and cost-effectiveness of each surgical approach. As vaginal hysterectomy is among the safest and most cost-effective routes for hysterectomy, it is the first-line approach whenever possible.</p><p>This topic will review the preoperative considerations, procedure, nuances, and complications of vaginal hysterectomy. Review of related topics can be found separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3272.html" rel="external">"Hysterectomy (benign indications): Selection of surgical route"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3311.html" rel="external">"Hysterectomy: Abdominal (open) route"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3286.html" rel="external">"Hysterectomy: Laparoscopic"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3297.html" rel="external">"Robot-assisted laparoscopy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16554.html" rel="external">"Prophylactic vaginal apex suspension at the time of hysterectomy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the terms "woman/en" or "patient(s)" as they are used in the studies presented. We encourage readers to consider the specific counseling and treatment needs of transmasculine and gender-expansive individuals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H71195079"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Vaginal hysterectomy is the preferred route for hysterectomy when possible [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. While high safety and low cost make vaginal hysterectomy the preferred route, a meta-analysis of seven trials reported similar rates of visceral injury and long-term complications among vaginal and laparoscopic procedures [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Thus, if vaginal hysterectomy is not feasible, laparoscopic hysterectomy is typically the next alternative. A minimally invasive approach is associated with faster recovery compared with laparotomy; some patients may benefit from a robotic-assisted surgical approach [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Minimally invasive routes should be prioritized; surgeon preference for other operative routes is no longer considered an appropriate reason to avoid the vaginal approach if the appropriate skill set is present [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3272.html" rel="external">"Hysterectomy (benign indications): Selection of surgical route", section on 'Comparison of routes of hysterectomy'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Relative contraindications</strong> – There are no absolute contraindications to vaginal hysterectomy [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Relative anatomic contraindications include malignancy, extremely enlarged uterine size, and significant pelvic adhesions. Patient characteristics that can make a vaginal approach to hysterectomy more challenging include nulliparity, increased body mass index, history of pelvic radiation, and lack of uterine descent [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Predictive factors for successful surgery</strong> – There is no specific combination of patient size, uterine size, parity, and prolapse that predicts a successful vaginal hysterectomy, although normal body mass index, smaller uterine size, multiparity, and some degree of uterine laxity are characteristics that generally increase the success of the procedure. However, vaginal hysterectomy can be safely performed in women without these characteristics [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In our practice, ease of access to the uterine vessels is most predictive of a successful vaginal surgery. Thus, vaginal hysterectomy can be very challenging, or require abdominal conversion, in a woman with a narrow pelvis and a wide, bulky uterus or a woman with fibroids that block or limit access to the uterine vessels (eg, broad ligament or cervical fibroids). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3272.html" rel="external">"Hysterectomy (benign indications): Selection of surgical route", section on 'Factors that influence surgical route'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Declining frequency of vaginal surgery</strong> – Despite vaginal hysterectomy being the preferred route for hysterectomy [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], there are fewer vaginal hysterectomies performed compared with other routes. Obstacles to performing vaginal hysterectomy include limited training, fewer numbers of hysterectomies being performed by individual surgeons, and greater diversity of operative approaches, which further decreases the number of vaginal surgeries performed in training and in practice. Obesity and prior pelvic surgeries, including Cesarean deliveries, can increase surgical difficulty [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Both experience during training and maintenance of proficiency after training is completed are paramount to maintaining surgeon confidence in this approach. We would encourage mentoring, operating with another surgeon to assist with difficult cases (as opposed to a surgical technician or trainee), and pursuing vaginal hysterectomy whenever clinically appropriate as methods to increase utilization of this route.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H341328608"><span class="h1">SURGICAL PLANNING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multiple adjunct issues are addressed by the surgeon when planning a vaginal hysterectomy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17405296"><span class="h2">Adhesions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients at high risk for significant pelvic adhesions (eg, women with prior pelvic surgery; history of inflammatory process such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease; or pelvic radiation), laparoscopy is often performed as a first step to visualize pelvic anatomy and lyse adhesions. The hysterectomy can also be started via the laparoscopic approach; the amount of surgery performed vaginally versus laparoscopically is influenced by the findings at the time of laparoscopy. Alternately, the surgeon can begin operating via the vaginal route and add laparoscopic visualization of the abdominal cavity only if there is difficulty entering the anterior or posterior peritoneum. The latter approach would likely reduce the number of laparoscopies performed as well as the operative time. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3286.html" rel="external">"Hysterectomy: Laparoscopic", section on 'Procedure'</a>.)</p><p>When unanticipated adhesions are discovered after the start of vaginal surgery, the surgeon can still perform laparoscopy to dissect adhesions. If the peritoneum has been opened, a surgical glove, bulb syringe, or vaginal pneumo-occluder balloon is placed in the vagina to seal the peritoneum and allow insufflation of the abdomen for laparoscopy. Prior surgery of the upper abdomen may result in abdominal adhesions but not pelvic adhesions. Thus, a total vaginal approach may be easier without the laparoscopic component in these patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H71195415"><span class="h2">Leiomyomata (fibroids)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Leiomyomata (fibroids) can increase the complexity of hysterectomy by blocking surgical access to the uterine vessels, particularly when located in the lower uterine segment, cervix, or broad ligament.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preoperative imaging</strong> – Preoperative imaging can help delineate the anatomic relationship of the fibroids, uterine fundus, cervix, and broad ligament. If we suspect an anatomic abnormality such as fibroids on examination, our first choice for imaging is transvaginal ultrasound. If the ultrasound study does not adequately delineate the anatomy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide additional detail. However, we do not routinely obtain MRI prior to performing vaginal hysterectomy and only perform ultrasound if there is a clinical indication based on history and/or examination.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preoperative fibroid treatment</strong> – Preoperative treatment options for enlarged fibroids include gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy or uterine artery embolization. Preoperative GnRH agonist therapy reduces fibroid size and can facilitate vaginal hysterectomy. Typical treatment is three to six months prior to the surgery, which will reduce uterine size by 35 to 60 percent [<a href="#rid8">8-10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intraoperative removal</strong> – Intraoperatively, fibroids can be removed with the uterus, excised intact from the uterus, or hand-cut into multiple pieces for removal  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79676" href="/d/graphic/79676.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70385" href="/d/graphic/70385.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56759" href="/d/graphic/56759.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). We prefer to leave fibroids intact rather than morcellate, if possible, because myomectomy can increase bleeding, particularly prior to the ligation of the uterine vessels. Once the uterine vessels have been ligated, the fibroid can be shelled out of the uterus, if needed, to provide for better visualization of the broad ligament and upper pedicles. If there is a concern for malignant uterine pathology, the uterus should be removed intact or in a specimen bag [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15780.html" rel="external">"Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas): Laparoscopic myomectomy and other laparoscopic treatments", section on 'Removal and morcellation of myomas'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14203.html" rel="external">"Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas): Differentiating fibroids from uterine sarcomas"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11536886"><span class="h2">Enlarged uterine size</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although the upper limit of uterine size for vaginal hysterectomy has not been established, many surgeons regard 16-week size as a reasonable and practical upper limit [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Surgeons skilled in intramyometrial coring  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56250" href="/d/graphic/56250.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>), bivalving techniques  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79676" href="/d/graphic/79676.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56759" href="/d/graphic/56759.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>), or vaginal myomectomy  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70385" href="/d/graphic/70385.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) can remove even larger uteri vaginally [<a href="#rid4">4,13,14</a>]. The benefits of avoiding morcellation should be weighed against the benefits of a minimally invasive approach as there is increased morbidity with open procedures [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11537010"><span class="h2">Pelvic organ prolapse</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mild to moderate uterine prolapse can make vaginal hysterectomy easier because some descent of the uterus improves access to the uterine vessels. However, severe uterine prolapse (Stage III or IV) can make vaginal hysterectomy more challenging because of significant anatomic distortion, particularly at the level of the bladder and ureters. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8072.html" rel="external">"Pelvic organ prolapse in females: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and management"</a>.)</p><p>For women with severe prolapse, a Döderlein-Krönig vaginal hysterectomy can be helpful. In this technique, the anterior peritoneum is entered and the uterine fundus is delivered through the incision [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. The hysterectomy is then performed in a manner similar to an open abdominal hysterectomy; the surgery starts with ligation of the round ligaments and progresses to the uterosacral ligaments. The posterior cul-de-sac is opened last. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3311.html" rel="external">"Hysterectomy: Abdominal (open) route", section on 'Operative technique'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H63190029"><span class="h2">Removal of adnexa</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Salpingectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy can be performed at the time of vaginal hysterectomy to remove pathology or to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. We counsel women regarding elective salpingectomy and oophorectomy and create a surgical plan as part of preoperative counseling. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91886.html" rel="external">"Opportunistic salpingectomy for ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal carcinoma risk reduction"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Success rates</strong> – Successful vaginal bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy without laparoscopic assistance has been reported in 65 to 98 percent of women [<a href="#rid18">18-20</a>], and successful salpingectomy has been reported in 74 to 88 percent of women [<a href="#rid21">21-23</a>]. Therefore, the need for concomitant adnexal surgery is not a reason for choosing an alternate surgical route. The authors have found that using a bipolar vessel sealing device can increase likelihood of successful removal of adnexa. Surgeons may find transvaginal use of laparoscopic instruments helpful for removal of adnexa because their thin diameter and longer length provide adequate visualization without the instrument itself obstructing the view. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk factors for unsuccessful removal</strong> – Reported risk factors for unsuccessful planned salpingectomy include prior adnexal surgery, uterine fibroids, older age, postmenopausal status, and elevated body mass index [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. Additional reasons for not completing planned salpingectomy include adnexal anatomy (high in the pelvis), bowel or sidewall adhesions, absent tubes, and ovarian adhesions [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. One study reported an average 11 minute increase in surgical time with salpingectomy, with no clinically significant increased blood loss [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. If the surgeon is unsuccessful with vaginal removal of the adnexa, a laparoscopic removal can be performed after cuff closure.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H147010067"><span class="h2">Prophylactic suspension</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We typically perform a vaginal suspension at the time of vaginal hysterectomy to reduce risk of future prolapse. The choice of support procedure varies based on the presence of prolapse or symptoms. However, the optimal approach for asymptomatic women with normal pelvic support is not known. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16554.html" rel="external">"Prophylactic vaginal apex suspension at the time of hysterectomy"</a>.)</p><p>Disruption of apical support occurs when the uterosacral and cardinal ligament complexes are divided. This is thought to be one of the major contributors to the subsequent development of the posthysterectomy apical (or vault) prolapse  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61643" href="/d/graphic/61643.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>) [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. While there is debate over the true risk of prolapse from hysterectomy, the surgical route of hysterectomy does not appear to impact prolapse risk [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16554.html" rel="external">"Prophylactic vaginal apex suspension at the time of hysterectomy", section on 'Impact of hysterectomy on future prolapse risk'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H57622704"><span class="h2">Cystourethroscopy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We perform cystourethroscopy when a suspension or anti-incontinence procedure is performed or any time there is a concern for injury. There is no standard regarding the use of cystourethroscopy at the time of vaginal hysterectomy [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3288.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic cystourethroscopy (cystoscopy) for gynecologic conditions", section on 'Examining the lower urinary tract'</a>.)</p><p>The advantages of universal cystourethroscopy are early identification of perforation or foreign body (eg, suture) and confirmation of ureteral patency. However, thermal injuries that may result in delayed perforation are not typically evident intraoperatively. Disadvantages include additional operating time, risk of injury from the procedure itself, and identification of nonsignificant findings.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3999202469"><span class="h2">Exclusion of malignancy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Malignancy should be reasonably excluded prior to hysterectomy because presence of cancer would likely change the surgical treatment. Preoperative evaluation to identify malignancy may include appropriate use of imaging, cervical cancer screening, and endometrial tissue sampling (for patients with abnormal uterine bleeding) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. In addition, clinicians should inform patients of possible risk of disseminating occult malignancy or benign uterine tissue with the various surgical approaches. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H56216077"><span class="h2">Use of robot-assisted surgical device</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Use of a robot-assisted system for vaginal surgery (commercial name Hominis), particularly for hysterectomy for benign indications, has been explored [<a href="#rid28">28-31</a>]. Specific patient groups who may benefit from addition of robot-assisted vaginal hysterectomy compared with traditional vaginal surgery are not yet defined. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3285136059"><span class="h2">Use of vaginal laparoscopy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Vaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES) uses a specialized retractor similar to that used for single-site laparoscopic surgery. The retractor is placed vaginally, after colpotomy, to complete the hysterectomy through a vaginal route without any abdominal incisions. The first feasibility study was published in 2012 for cases completed in 2010 [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3272.html" rel="external">"Hysterectomy (benign indications): Selection of surgical route", section on 'Vaginal hysterectomy'</a>.)</p><p>Availability of the platform and surgeon training are still limitations for use, but it is increasingly an available option in the United States. There are some data that suggest benefits of vNOTES over traditional laparoscopy, including less postoperative pain, shorter hospital time, and faster recovery time [<a href="#rid33">33,34</a>]. A systematic review of six studies reported similar outcomes between vNOTES and laparoscopic hysterectomy for complications, readmission, and pain, but it did have lower surgery time, length of stay, and blood loss [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Purported benefits of vNOTES include improved visualization, ability to perform hysterectomy on larger uteri, and ability to address adhesions not otherwise amenable to traditional transvaginal approach.

In the absence of compelling data to guide timing, the decision is the surgeon's preference. Immediate insertion of the bladder catheter decompresses the bladder and limits the bladder's protrusion into the operative field.

While this is not an essential step, it may preserve vaginal length at the time of closure. Once the incision is made with a scalpel or electrocautery, the surgeon then sharply dissects or bluntly pushes the overlying vaginal epithelium off the underlying cervical stroma with the aid of a surgical sponge  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64997" href="/d/graphic/64997.html" rel="external">figure 12</a>). Alternately, some surgeons omit the cervical incision and begin the surgery by cutting directly through the posterior vaginal epithelium into the posterior peritoneum. (See <a class="local">'Posterior cul-de-sac entry'</a> below.)</p><p>Prior to incision, we inject a vasoconstrictor circumferentially around the cervix for hemostasis and hydrodissection. Some surgeons also inject 10 mL of vasoconstrictor into the uterosacral and cardinal ligaments. We identify the vesicocervical fold prior to injection because the infiltrate can distort the anatomy.

If the bowel protrudes into the lower pelvis and posterior cul-de-sac after peritoneal entry, we place the patient in Trendelenburg position to reduce the bowel into the upper abdomen and thus decrease the need for bowel packing. If this maneuver is not adequate to move the bowel out of the operative field, then we pack the bowel into the lateral para-colic gutters with moist radio-opaque sponges, which are included in the operative count. In women with an enlarged uterus, the bowel is often blocked by the uterus and bowel packing is not necessary.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23165591"><span class="h3">Posterior cul-de-sac entry</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Initial posterior entry may be particularly helpful for women with potential scarring of the anterior cul-de-sac, such as after cesarean delivery.</p><p>We place upward traction on the cervix to expose the posterior cul-de-sac. After the vaginal epithelium is incised, the peritoneum bulges toward the surgeon. Prior to incising the peritoneum, the tissue is palpated for bowel. Once the cul-de-sac is clear, the posterior peritoneum is grasped with a toothed forceps and incised horizontally with Mayo scissors to expose the peritoneal cavity  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66673" href="/d/graphic/66673.html" rel="external">figure 14</a>). The peritoneal incision is extended by spreading the Mayo scissors and the short-weighted speculum is replaced with a Steinert speculum. We confirm the Steinert speculum is in the posterior cul-de-sac, over the posterior peritoneum, rather than retroperitoneal. Prior to placing the weighted speculum, some surgeons stitch the peritoneum to the posterior vaginal epithelium with a figure-of-eight suture or a running stitch. This optional suture can provide hemostasis and can be helpful at the time of vaginal cuff closure.</p><p>If difficulty is encountered isolating the posterior peritoneum with the above approach, a midline vertical incision is made to the point at which the posterior cul-de-sac becomes more apparent. The incision now has a "T"-shaped appearance. Once the peritoneal window is visible, then the above steps are followed.</p><p>In trying to identify the retroperitoneal window, the surgeon can erroneously dissect into the cervical stroma and create bleeding. In this situation, the surgeon can either begin the hysterectomy in a retroperitoneal fashion or open the anterior peritoneum. After the anterior peritoneum is opened, the posterior peritoneum is identified by placing a finger or instrument behind the uterus.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23165597"><span class="h3">Anterior cul-de-sac entry</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We identify the anterior peritoneal reflection by sharply dissecting toward the anterior cervix with Metzenbaum or curved Mayo scissors at a 45-degree angle. Downward traction on the cervix facilitates dissection. The dissection advances until the anterior peritoneal reflection is seen as a white crescent  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51826" href="/d/graphic/51826.html" rel="external">figure 15</a>). In a study of 22 surgical patients, the median distance from the cervicovaginal incision to the anterior peritoneal reflection was 3.4 cm [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. Palpation of this tissue is commonly described as feeling like "silk sliding on silk." Once visualized, the peritoneal reflection is grasped with a toothed forceps and incised to enter the anterior cul-de-sac  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81305" href="/d/graphic/81305.html" rel="external">figure 16</a>). A Heaney or Deaver retractor is placed into this space to elevate and protect the bladder and allow visualization of the abdominal anatomy.</p><p>If the dissection goes too deeply into the cervix, bleeding will occur. A new dissection is begun just cephalad to the erroneous deeper plane by placing the Metzenbaum scissors, closed, at a 90-degree angle and then spreading the tips perpendicular to the cervical stroma. Additionally, a bent uterine sound can be placed through the posterior incision and over the fundus to assist with identification of the anterior peritoneum.</p><p>If the anterior peritoneal reflection cannot be identified, we continue the hysterectomy by placing a retractor in the midline anterior space and elevating the bladder, thus moving the ureters superiorly and laterally. Serial clamping and dissection of the uterosacral and cardinal ligaments can then be performed until the peritoneal reflection is visualized. The clamps are placed on the inferior surface of the ligaments, rather than laterally, to minimize the risk of ureter injury. Prior to placing each clamp, the bladder is bluntly or sharply dissected off the underling cervical stroma until the vesicovaginal space is entered. Once the anterior cul-de-sac is opened, the bladder is elevated with a retractor and the ligament clamping proceeds as usual.</p><p>If the anterior cul-de-sac is scarred, such as from prior cesarean delivery, identification of the vesicouterine fold can be challenging. One solution is for the surgeon to pass a finger or instrument through the posterior incision, around the fundus, and into the anterior space to identify the vesicouterine fold. To facilitate this maneuver, the posterior cervix and uterus can be bivalved to the level of the fundus after the uterine vessels have been ligated. Bivalving the uterus allows the fundus to descend further into the vaginal canal and makes the vesicouterine fold easier to identify and incise.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11536535"><span class="h2">Hysterectomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A common approach to hysterectomy is the Heaney technique, in which the surgery starts with the uterosacral ligaments and proceeds to the utero-ovarian ligaments. This order is the opposite of abdominal or Döderlein-Krönig vaginal hysterectomy. (See <a class="local">'Pelvic organ prolapse'</a> above.)</p><p>After each clamp placement, we cut the pedicle to leave approximately 0.5 cm of tissue distal to the clamp. A transfixion suture is then placed at the tip of the clamp. We use Heaney transfixion sutures on all the pedicles, but this is surgeon preference. Use of an advanced bipolar vessel-sealing device, either laparoscopic or handheld, can also be used to seal and ligate each pedicle. The cutting blade of the device is positioned in the same manner as described for traditional clamps. While we typically use the traditional technique of clamp and suture-ligation at our institution, both techniques are acceptable as the outcomes are similar. (See <a class="local">'Instrument selection'</a> above.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Uterosacral ligaments</strong> – To clamp the uterosacral ligaments, we place the lateral blade of the clamp into the posterior recto-cervical fold and the medial blade on the inner edge of the ligament  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72050" href="/d/graphic/72050.html" rel="external">figure 17</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The ligament is clamped on the inferior surface, and not lateral, to minimize the risk of ureteral injury. We double ligate each pedicle and clamp the suture tail laterally to the drape for later use. Gentle traction on this suture will help to identify the most distal pedicle when assessing for hemostasis or when performing a suspension procedure. If a high apical suspension is to be performed and vessel-sealing technology is used, we find it beneficial to take this pedicle with a clamp and suture-ligate. This enables it to be easily identified and incorporated into the apical suspension later in the case.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cardinal ligaments</strong> – The cardinal ligaments are identified, clamped, cut, and suture ligated in a manner similar to that used for the uterosacral ligaments.

We start by placing the clamp parallel to the cervix, then grasp both peritoneal surfaces and the vessels, and lastly move the clamp handle laterally as the clamp is closed. When complete, the clamp tip is adjacent and perpendicular to the cervix  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55832" href="/d/graphic/55832.html" rel="external">figure 20</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].

Each clamp is placed medial to the prior pedicle and no unclamped gaps of tissue are allowed because they can bleed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Utero-ovarian pedicles</strong> – We ligate the utero-ovarian ligament-fallopian tube complex twice, first with a suture tie followed by a suture ligature medial to the first tie  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67218" href="/d/graphic/67218.html" rel="external">figure 22</a>). A hemostat is placed on the second suture to aid in pedicle identification (should bleeding occur) and to assist with adnexa removal if indicated. A hemostat is not placed on the first tie, as traction on a suture tie risks loosening the tie and causing bleeding. Alternately, a double-clamp technique has been described, but is not necessary and can obstruct the surgeon's view.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For women with a small uterus, the surgeon can first deliver the uterine fundus through either peritoneal incision to better expose the utero-ovarian ligaments and facilitate clamp placement  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71757" href="/d/graphic/71757.html" rel="external">figure 23</a>).

Myomectomy can also be performed to decompress the uterus  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70385" href="/d/graphic/70385.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). If there is any concern for malignancy, uterine morcellation is either not done, is performed in a containment bag to prevent potential tissue seeding of the abdominal cavity, or is done in such a way as to keep the endometrial cavity intact [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].

Use of an initial suture with flashing of the clamp and then a repeat transfixation suture is recommended. Hemostasis is confirmed prior to cutting the transfixion suture because the tissue may retract into the abdomen once off tension. This is then repeated on the contralateral side.</p><p></p><p>If the adnexa are not easy to remove in this manner, we often use laparoscopic and handheld electrosurgical vessel-sealing devices transvaginally to complete the surgery [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2890.html" rel="external">"Overview of electrosurgery", section on 'Advanced electrosurgical devices'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4874.html" rel="external">"Instruments and devices used in laparoscopic surgery", section on 'Electrosurgery'</a>.)</p><p>For women whose adnexa cannot be safely removed vaginally, a laparoscopic resection can be performed after closure of the vaginal cuff, if desired. If the adnexa appear enlarged and are likely to be difficult to remove through the laparoscopic port sites, the open cuff can be packed with a glove or bulb syringe to provide an air-tight seal. Laparoscopic resection is then performed in the usual fashion, but the adnexa are placed in the posterior cul-de-sac rather than removed through the abdominal port sites. Once completed, the vaginal glove or bulb syringe is removed from the vagina, and the adnexa are extracted from the posterior cul-de-sac prior to vaginal cuff closure.

Because blood drains into the upper abdomen when the patient is in Trendelenburg position, we level the operating table prior to final assessment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Electrosurgical hemostasis can be safely used on the peritoneal and vaginal edges; vaginal edges are the most common site of bleeding [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. We rarely use electrosurgical devices to achieve hemostasis of the pedicles themselves as thermal injury may loosen the stitch or spread to adjacent tissues such as the ureter. If cautery is unsuccessful or inappropriate, we place a running or interrupted suture, depending on the source of bleeding. When placing additional sutures on vascular pedicles, we stitch medially or adjacent to the prior suture to avoid injury to the ureter, which is lateral to the pedicle.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cuff closure</strong> – We close the vaginal cuff with an absorbable suture such as 1-0 or 0 polyglactin braided suture. Closure can be done in an interrupted, running, or running locking fashion and is the surgeon's choice. A running locking stitch may provide more hemostasis for bleeding vaginal edges. Closure can be performed either vertically or horizontally. If there is a concern about vaginal length, vertical closure has been shown to preserve vaginal length more than horizontal closure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66835" href="/d/graphic/66835.html" rel="external">figure 25</a>) [<a href="#rid48">48</a>] and thus may decrease risk of subsequent dyspareunia [<a href="#rid49">49</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Vaginal packing is optional [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. We do not place packing in the vagina following routine hysterectomy as it does not appear to decrease postoperative bleeding after hysterectomy. Additionally, many women find packing uncomfortable, and it may inhibit the ability to void postoperatively. As many women are discharged on the day of surgery, avoidance of packing ensures the patient will not be inadvertently discharged with packing in place. If additional anterior and/or posterior repairs have been performed, packing may be placed at surgeon preference to provide pressure for up to several hours postoperatively. If packing is placed, the bladder catheter should remain in place until the packing is removed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91017.html" rel="external">"Urogynecologic surgery: Perioperative care issues", section on 'Vaginal packing'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bladder catheter removal</strong> – We prefer to leave the catheter in place until the patient is ambulatory and then perform a retrograde voiding trial at the time of catheter removal. As many patients go home on the day of the procedure, the backfill voiding trial can be done at any time after the patient is ambulatory. If the patient is staying overnight, removal can be delayed until the following morning. Alternately, the catheter can be removed in the operating room, and a voiding trial is performed in the recovery area.

General strategies to control hemorrhage are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3302.html" rel="external">"Management of hemorrhage in gynecologic surgery", section on 'Management of intraoperative bleeding'</a>.)</p><p>To regain control of a bleeding pedicle, we pack the bowel out of the operative field and use Breisky-Navratil retractors to gain exposure. Next, we place gentle traction on the distal (uterosacral) and proximal (utero-ovarian) sutures to bring all the vascular pedicles into view. A forceps or Babcock can also be used to gently bring the tissue into the operative field. Once the bleeding area is identified, it can be clamped and ligated. We find a right-angle clamp is helpful. Another option is to use a handheld or laparoscopic vessel-sealing device to achieve hemostasis.</p><p>Pedicles that loosen from the suture or retract into the abdominal cavity can cause intraabdominal or retroperitoneal bleeding. If the pedicle cannot be reclamped vaginally, laparoscopy can be performed to locate and control the pedicle. If there is brisk bleeding, conversion to laparotomy may be necessary, particularly if there is not enough time to close the vaginal cuff and set up laparoscopic equipment. If the only obstacle to laparoscopy is cuff closure, laparoscopy can be performed with an open cuff and sealed vagina. A bulb syringe or surgical glove stuffed with a surgical sponge can be inserted into the vagina to create a seal for gas insufflation of the abdomen. Laparoscopy can then proceed as usual.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H71196154"><span class="h2">Bladder injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bladder injuries occur in up to 2 percent of vaginal hysterectomies; concomitant pelvic floor repair does not appear to increase the risk [<a href="#rid46">46,50-53</a>]. Bladder perforation typically occurs during entry into the anterior cul-de-sac. While there is no consensus regarding the role of routine cystourethroscopy to identify bladder injury during simple hysterectomy [<a href="#rid27">27</a>], we typically perform apical support procedures and therefore perform cystourethroscopy.

If bowel injury occurs, an atraumatic instrument (bowel grasper, Babcock clamp) is placed next to the injury to mark the location and hold the bowel so it does not slip back into the peritoneal cavity. In our practice, we consult the general surgery service to assist with the repair when a bowel injury occurs. Information on repair of bowel injuries is presented separately.

This pack is placed while the remainder of the surgical team is converting the procedure to the abdominal route. Laparoscopic abdominal exploration can be considered if the bleeding is lighter or successfully tamponaded. In situations requiring rapid abdominal access, laparotomy is typically faster.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Significant intraabdominal adhesions</strong> – When significant intraabdominal adhesions are encountered during vaginal surgery, concomitant laparoscopic visualization of the abdominal cavity allows the surgeon to see and then lyse the adhesions. Laparotomy is less commonly used, but can be necessary in some cases. However, in the setting of dense adhesions, entry into the abdomen can also be more challenging with either laparoscopy or laparotomy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Abnormal or unusual uterine anatomy</strong> – Atypical uterine anatomy can result from adhesions, fibroids, prior surgical interventions, or congenital malformations.
