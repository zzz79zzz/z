         Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) is characterized by neurologic symptoms such as weakness, abnormal movements, or nonepileptic seizures, which involve abnormal nervous system functioning rather than structural disease [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In addition, clinical findings on examination provide evidence of incompatibility between the symptoms and recognized neurologic disease. Nevertheless, the symptoms are genuine, cause distress and disability, and are associated with high health care expenditures [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. Although the disorder is common in clinical settings, the diagnosis is frequently missed or delayed, which in part explains the generally poor prognosis [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-8
         </a>
         ].

         This topic reviews the terminology, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of functional neurological symptom disorder. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, prognosis, clinical features, assessment, and treatment are discussed separately, as are specific subtypes of functional neurological symptom disorder (eg, psychogenic nonepileptic seizures and functional movement disorders):

         “Functional neurological symptom disorder,” meaning that the symptoms arise from abnormal nervous system functioning in the absence of structural pathology (eg, functional limb weakness). This term is consistent with the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. However, it may seem vague and does not indicate that psychosocial factors may be important. The shortened term, functional neurological disorder, is commonly used by clinicians and researchers, as well as patient-led organizations and advocates (eg,

         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]), “somatization,” “somatoform,” or “psychogenic,” meaning that the symptoms are psychological and possibly caused by a remote or recent stressor. These terms suggest that patients should be referred for psychiatric services, but they introduce etiologic assumptions that often cannot often be proven. As an example, the term conversion disorder is based upon the unproven psychoanalytic hypothesis that overwhelming affect, psychological conflict, or stress are unconsciously converted into neurologic symptoms such as paralysis or seizures [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. In addition, terms such as psychogenic may also connote “faking” or “crazy” behavior and thus alienate patients [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. In DSM-5-TR, the term conversion disorder is now a secondary option, appearing in parentheses after functional neurological symptom disorder as the primary name: functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder).

         “Dissociative neurological symptom disorder,” meaning sensation or control of movement is separated from awareness. This term is consistent with the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases, 11

         Revision (ICD-11) [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. The term is particularly useful to describe the trance-like state seen in nonepileptic seizures, but also implies that patients have persistent depersonalization or derealization (which is frequently not the case independent of a seizure episode). The shortened term, dissociative (specific subtype) disorder is commonly used by clinicians and researchers, as an example, dissociative motor disorder or dissociative seizure disorder.

         “Medically unexplained,” meaning that the etiology is unknown. The term is neutral, but suggests that the clinician does not know what is wrong and is incapable of rendering a diagnosis and treatment [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12

         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         have rather than what is present and ignore the central nervous system underpinning of psychiatric phenomena and functional somatic symptoms.

More recent definitions include emotional excess, overwhelming fear, and psychiatric symptoms involving disturbances of mental, sensory, vasomotor, and visceral functions. This term is generally considered a historic artifact.

         </span>
         In patients with neurologic symptoms (eg, abnormal movements or nonepileptic seizures) that are not caused by recognized neurologic disease, the diagnosis of functional neurologic symptom disorder (conversion disorder) should be made after the physician has identified the typical, positive clinical findings that establish the diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,8,17,18
         </a>
         ]. These findings, such as a tubular visual field defect or Hoover’s sign of functional leg weakness, either [
         <a href="#rid8">

         Provide evidence of incompatibility between the patient’s symptoms and recognized disease.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Functional neurologic symptom disorder is not a diagnosis of exclusion [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to 2013, functional neurological symptom disorder, then called conversion disorder, could be diagnosed according to the criteria in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ], or the International Classification of Diseases, 10
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         Revision (ICD-10) [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. However, neither nosologic system was widely used in its entirety because many patients did not fulfill all the criteria [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. In particular, both nosologies stipulated that functional neurological symptom disorder was associated with or caused by psychologic factors. However, psychologic factors are often not identifiable [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. In a systematic review that identified 13 retrospective studies of functional neurological symptom disorder, 14 to 70 percent of patients had no history of either stressful life events or any type of maltreatment (eg, sexual or physical abuse) [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Even when psychologic factors are identified, it is not always clear that they are etiologically relevant [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In DSM-5-TR, as well as the ICD-11, clinicians can make the diagnosis of functional neurological symptom disorder without identifying psychological factors associated with the neurologic symptoms [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3,8,16,18
         </a>
         ]. Nevertheless, clinicians should continue to look for psychological factors that are relevant to understanding etiology and guiding treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, clinicians no longer need to determine that the symptom is not feigned, a criterion that is nearly impossible to establish [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3,8,16
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, the diagnosis of functional neurological symptom disorder according to DSM-5-TR and ICD-11 does not depend upon excluding other recognized disorders.
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnostic criteria for functional neurological symptom disorder do not specify a time frame for symptoms [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,16
         </a>
         ]. In most cases, clinicians will assess and follow patients for weeks to months before rendering the diagnosis; however, it is feasible to make the diagnosis at the initial assessment, provided patients fulfill the requisite criteria, which are described in the sections below [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ].

         The diagnosis rests upon positive clinical findings that indicate the symptom is inconsistent at different times (eg, a “paralyzed” limb will move inadvertently when the patient is distracted by performing movements in their unaffected limb) or is incongruent with anatomy, physiology, or known diseases [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. However, normal findings on physical examination (eg, reflexes) or normal laboratory tests do not provide positive evidence of functional neurological symptom disorder.

         Seizures or attacks – These events are also called functional seizures, dissociative seizures, psychogenic nonepileptic seizures, psychogenic seizures, and nonepileptic seizures. Functional seizures are marked by apparent impaired or loss of consciousness resembling epileptic attacks (for example with generalized limb shaking) or fainting (syncope). (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Functional neurological symptom disorder should not be diagnosed primarily because the patient has a history of other psychiatric disorders (eg, major depression or a personality disorder) or because the neurologic examination and laboratory tests are normal [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,10
         </a>
         ]. In addition, clinicians must ensure that the symptoms are not better explained by a neurologic or other general medical illness, and should bear in mind that our knowledge of neurologic disease, anatomy, and physiology is incomplete. Neurologic and general medical disorders that are included in the differential diagnosis are discussed separately. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Neurologic disorders'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Functional neurological symptom disorder can be diagnosed in patients who have comorbid, recognized neurologic diseases, provided there is evidence that the diseases do not better explain the functional neurologic symptoms. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/85765.html" rel="external">
          "Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) in adults: Clinical features, assessment, and comorbidity", section on 'Neurologic and general medical disorders'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In diagnosing functional neurological symptom disorder, it is not necessary to identify conflicts or other stressors associated with functional neurologic symptoms (although identifying stressors may help patient management) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,11,25,26
         </a>
         ]. Although psychological factors such as stress, conflicts, and trauma are frequently observed in patients with functional neurological symptom disorder, this is not always the case. In addition, when psychological factors are present, it can be difficult to establish an etiologic relationship between these factors and functional neurological symptom disorder [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,11,27
         </a>
         ]. Psychologic factors may have a specific etiologic relationship with functional neurological symptom disorder, a nonspecific relationship (ie, psychologic factors may contribute to onset of psychiatric disorders in general), or the presence of psychologic factors may be coincidental. Additional information about premorbid clinical factors and the etiology of functional neurological symptom disorder is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/85764.html" rel="external">
          "Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and prognosis", section on 'Predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors'

        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of functional neurological symptom disorder does not require clinicians to establish that the symptom is not intentionally produced [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3,26
         </a>
         ]. Evidence that suggests functional neurological symptom disorder does not involve feigning includes the consistency among different patients in how they report their symptoms, the common pattern of comorbidity and physical evidence (eg, abnormal shoe wear, disuse atrophy, and contractures) across patients, evidence from neurobiological research [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28,29
         </a>
         ], differential response to treatment in randomized clinical trials [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ], and the distress and disability that is observed in follow-up studies [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. However, if the history or examination demonstrate that the symptoms are feigned, the diagnosis of functional neurological symptom disorder should not be made. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Feigned symptoms'

         Exposure to a common precipitant may lead to shared functional neurologic symptoms in a group of people (“mass psychogenic illness”) [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30-32
         </a>
         ]. Functional neurological symptom disorder is diagnosed only in those individuals manifesting voluntary motor or sensory symptoms (eg, paralysis, sensory disturbance, or nonepileptic seizure symptoms) meeting diagnostic criteria for the disorder.

         ICD-11 went into effect January 2022 [

         ].

        <p>
         In ICD-11, functional neurological symptom disorder is called “dissociative neurological symptom disorder” [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. ICD-11 categorizes the disorder among the “dissociative disorders,” which are marked by symptoms that disrupt identity, perceptions, thoughts, memories, feelings, control of body movements, or behavior, and cause significant psychosocial impairment. Dissociative disorders are a subset of “mental, behavioral, or neurodevelopmental disorders.” Given that dissociative neurological symptom disorder stands at the interface between psychiatry and neurology, and is often diagnosed by neurologists [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,33
         </a>
         ], ICD-11 also classifies the disorder within the category ”diseases of the nervous system.”

         An ICD-11 diagnosis of dissociative neurological symptom disorder requires each of the following criteria [

        <p>
         As stated above (see
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis'
         </a>

Clinicians faced with symptoms that are difficult to interpret should exercise caution in diagnosing functional neurological symptom disorder, no matter how much the psychiatric history suggests it. Patients may notice symptoms of an occult disease during its early stage when signs on physical examination or laboratory test abnormalities are not readily apparent [

          3,34
         </a>
         ]. In addition, more unusual neurologic diseases such as stiff person syndrome, autoimmune limbic encephalitis, and frontal lobe epilepsy may present with unusual features such as symptom variability, bizarre behavior (eg, cycling leg movements or pelvic thrusting), or other symptoms (eg, emotional lability) that might lead the unwary to diagnose functional neurological symptom disorder, even though these unusual features are not typical for functional neurological symptom disorder [

        </p>
        <p>
         Another factor that may lead clinicians to wrongly diagnose functional neurological symptom disorder in patients with a recognized neurologic disorder includes placing undue emphasis upon psychiatric comorbidity [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Psychiatric disorders are common in functional neurological symptom disorder and are important to diagnose for formulation and treatment, but are also present in a range of neurologic conditions such as stroke and epilepsy; thus, psychiatric comorbidity alone should not be used to make the diagnosis of functional neurological symptom disorder. Similarly, life stress is common and a common clinical error is to conclude that because neurologic symptoms follow stress, they may be due to functional neurological symptoms disorder [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, clinicians should usually not rely upon a single sign to diagnose functional neurological symptom disorder; rather, the diagnosis is based upon multiple features that constitute the syndrome [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, the effects of a recognized neurologic disease can be frightening, which may lead patients to exaggerate their symptoms to convince a doctor about their problem [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ]. The probability that apparent functional neurological symptom disorder is actually the harbinger of an alternative (recognized) neurologic condition may be greater in patients with gait disorders [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, a balance must be struck between not missing neurologic/general medical disorders and failing to positively diagnose functional neurological symptom disorder. The frequency of erroneously diagnosing functional neurological symptom disorder in patients who are subsequently found to have a recognized neurologic illness (which with hindsight explained the initial symptoms) is generally regarded as low [
         <a href="#rid25">

         A systematic review of 27 studies (mostly retrospective; median duration of follow-up was five years) found that among 1466 patients initially diagnosed with functional symptoms, the frequency of misdiagnosis was approximately 4 percent [
         <a href="#rid37">

         A subsequent study prospectively followed a group of 209 patients initially diagnosed with functional neurological symptom disorder, who were part of 1030 neurology outpatients with symptoms that were considered “somewhat” or “not at all explained” by a recognizable neurologic disease [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Conversely, the frequency of incorrectly diagnosing other neurologic disorders (eg, epilepsy or multiple sclerosis) in patients who ultimately are found to have functional neurological symptom disorder is approximately 6 to 11 percent [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38,39
         </a>

         <a href="#rid3">
          3

         In DSM-5-TR, somatic symptom disorder and functional neurological symptom disorder are both categorized among the “somatic symptom and related disorders,” which are characterized by prominent somatic symptoms that cause significant distress and psychosocial impairment [

        </p>
        <p>
         In somatic symptom disorder, patients react excessively to somatic symptoms, but these symptoms are not defined by loss of function that is clearly incompatible with anatomy, physiology, and recognized neurologic or general medical illnesses. Thus, somatic symptom disorder can occur in patients whose symptoms are explained by recognized diseases. By contrast, functional neurological symptom disorder is characterized by clinical findings that are inconsistent with anatomy, physiology, and recognized disease. In addition, the excessive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that occur in somatic symptom disorder may not be present in functional neurological symptom disorder.
        </p>

         Functional neurological symptom disorder can be diagnosed alongside somatic symptom disorder if criteria for both disorders are met. (See

Minor discrepancies in symptoms or disability are in keeping with the variable nature of functional neurologic symptoms, which tend to worsen when attention is paid to them [

          Diagnostic criteria
         </strong>
         – In the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR), functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) is classified among the somatic symptom and related disorders, which are marked by prominent somatic symptoms that cause distress and psychosocial impairment. The DSM-5-TR diagnostic criteria for functional neurological symptom disorder are listed in the table (
