This topic reviews both recurrent and de novo MN in the transplanted kidney.</p><p>The causes, diagnosis, and treatment of MN in the native kidney are discussed elsewhere:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3050.html" rel="external">"Membranous nephropathy: Pathogenesis and etiology"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/117886.html" rel="external">"Membranous nephropathy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3051.html" rel="external">"Membranous nephropathy: Treatment and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H561602811"><span class="h1">PRETRANSPLANT CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2633441002"><span class="h2">Evaluation of PLA2R status</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) due to MN who are being evaluated for kidney transplantation, every effort should be made to establish the type of MN that was present in the native kidney, if not already known. It is especially important to determine whether the patient's MN was related to autoantibodies to the phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R), which is the most important target antigen in patients with primary MN (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3050.html" rel="external">"Membranous nephropathy: Pathogenesis and etiology", section on 'Phospholipase A2 receptor'</a>). This can be achieved by retrieving the patient's native kidney biopsy (when available) and immunostaining for the presence of PLA2R within immune deposits, or by determining if anti-PLA2R antibodies have ever been detected in the patient's serum. If the patient has never been tested for serum anti-PLA2R antibodies, testing should be performed. The detection of PLA2R antigen in the native kidney biopsy or presence of anti-PLA2R antibodies in the serum confirms a diagnosis of PLA2R-associated MN.</p><p>In patients known or found by these methods to have had PLA2R-associated MN in the native kidneys, testing for the presence of circulating anti-PLA2R antibodies should be performed as part of the initial pretransplant evaluation to assess the risk for recurrence. Further management is determined based upon the results of testing: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If serum anti-PLA2R antibodies are undetectable, no further testing is required. Such patients are considered to be at low risk of recurrent MN. Some experts would repeat testing for anti-PLA2R antibodies at the time of transplantation as certain stimuli (such as vaccinations and infections) may be able to trigger re-emergence of anti-PLA2R antibodies. However, there are no data to support this approach. (See <a class="local">'Pathogenesis and risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If serum anti-PLA2R antibodies are detected, monitoring of anti-PLA2R antibody levels should be performed at least annually up until the time of transplantation. Such patients are considered to be at higher risk of recurrent MN. (See <a class="local">'Pathogenesis and risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients who have high anti-PLA2R titers (eg, &gt;150 RU/mL by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]), we and others feel that the risk of recurrence is high enough to justify consideration of preemptive treatment [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. If the patient is undergoing a living-donor kidney transplant or is otherwise expected to receive a transplant in the near future (within four to six months), we make every effort to lower the anti-PLA2R antibody titers by at least 50 percent (and preferably to less than 150 RU/mL) before transplantation, although this threshold is arbitrary and there is no evidence to support our approach. Treatment may involve <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> (1 g followed 14 days later by another 1 g dose) and possibly plasmapheresis (if transplant is imminent) prior to transplantation, with documentation of a decrease in anti-PLA2R antibody levels prior to proceeding with the surgery. However, the added risk of this additive immunosuppression (ie, B cell depletion) at the time of transplant must be weighed against the potential benefit of decreasing or eliminating anti-PLA2R antibodies to reduce the risk of recurrent disease. If rituximab is given, the patient should ideally be fully vaccinated and boosted against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection prior to receiving rituximab since rituximab may impair vaccine response. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129849.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Vaccines", section on 'Immunocompromised individuals'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In patients who have non-PLA2R-associated MN, additional serologic testing for anti-PLA2R antibodies is not needed. However, if the patient is known to have primary MN associated with an antigen other than PLA2R (such as thrombospondin-1 domain-containing 7A [THSD7A]) and a clinical test is available, we would screen for relevant autoantibodies prior to transplantation.</p><p>For those patients who receive a kidney allograft in the presence of circulating anti-PLA2R antibodies, posttransplant surveillance of anti-PLA2R is recommended [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Posttransplant surveillance'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2587482959"><span class="h2">Choice of donor type</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most kidney transplant candidates, including those with MN as the cause of ESKD in the native kidneys, living-donor kidney transplantation is preferred over deceased-donor transplantation given the higher long-term graft survival associated with living-donor kidneys (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7302.html" rel="external">"Kidney transplantation in adults: Risk factors for graft failure", section on 'Type of kidney donor'</a>). Although some studies have suggested a higher risk of recurrent MN among recipients of a living, related kidney, we believe that a living-donor kidney, even if from a related donor, should be preferred over a deceased-donor kidney given the much-abbreviated wait time and the likely low absolute increased risk of developing recurrent MN. (See <a class="local">'Pathogenesis and risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H691260314"><span class="h1">RECURRENT MEMBRANOUS NEPHROPATHY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H189353372"><span class="h2">Epidemiology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The reported incidence of recurrent MN in kidney transplant recipients with a history of MN in the native kidneys ranges between 10 and 45 percent [<a href="#rid3">3-13</a>]. The reason for the wide variability is that the diagnosis is made only by biopsy, and the indications for biopsy vary between transplant centers [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Centers that perform protocol biopsies in the absence of symptoms generally report a higher incidence. As an example, in a study of 19 patients with MN who underwent surveillance biopsies after transplantation, recurrent MN was detected in eight (42 percent) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1259951003"><span class="h2">Pathogenesis and risk factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pathogenesis of MN in the native kidneys is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3050.html" rel="external">"Membranous nephropathy: Pathogenesis and etiology", section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anti-phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) antibodies </strong>– The occasionally rapid recurrence of MN following transplantation has suggested the potential presence of a circulating factor at the time of transplantation [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. This factor is likely a circulating autoantibody such as the autoantibody to the M-type PLA2R, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of MN in the native kidneys [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Autoantibodies against PLA2R have been reported in patients with recurrent MN [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>]. In one such patient, who developed recurrent disease 13 days after transplantation, PLA2R and monotypic immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3) were colocalized in glomerular deposits [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. This patient was also shown to have circulating anti-PLA2R antibodies of the same IgG3 kappa subclass that was present in glomerular deposits of both the native kidney and the allograft, strongly suggesting that this antibody caused the glomerular disease [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Several studies have identified circulating anti-PLA2R antibodies at or after the time of kidney transplantation as a risk factor for the development of recurrent MN. A positive test and high titers of anti-PLA2R antibodies at the time of transplantation are associated with an increased risk of recurrent MN, with a positive predictive value greater than 80 percent [<a href="#rid21">21-24</a>]. The disappearance of anti-PLA2R antibodies with maintenance transplant immunosuppression or after specific treatment of recurrent MN results in clinical improvement with resolution of proteinuria [<a href="#rid23">23,25</a>]. The persistence or reappearance of anti-PLA2R after kidney transplantation predicts a worsening clinical course of recurrent MN with increasing proteinuria [<a href="#rid23">23,25</a>]. Thus, testing for anti-PLA2R antibodies at the time of kidney transplantation and serial monitoring of the antibody levels after transplantation might help the clinician to identify patients who need further intervention with either increasing maintenance immunosuppression or other drugs (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1,26</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation of PLA2R status'</a> above and <a class="local">'Posttransplant surveillance'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other autoantibodies </strong>– Other autoantibodies implicated in primary MN have been identified in patients with recurrent MN [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. In one case report, circulating antibodies to thrombospondin type-1 domain-containing 7A (THSD7A) were present pretransplant and associated with the development of recurrent MN in which THSD7A antigen could be detected within immune deposits in the kidney allograft [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. In another case report, anti-semaphorin 3B antibodies, which had caused MN in an infant and led to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) by age seven, were present at the time of transplantation and led to early recurrence of semaphorin 3B-associated MN in the allograft [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3050.html" rel="external">"Membranous nephropathy: Pathogenesis and etiology", section on 'Other antigens'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Genetic factors </strong>– Genetic polymorphisms in both <em>PLA2R1</em> (the gene for PLA2R) and within human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci are associated with risk of recurrence. One study demonstrated a 2.5-fold increased risk for recurrence when the recipient carried the HLA-A3 antigen [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Another study reported the unexpected finding that polymorphisms in donor <em>PLA2R1</em> and <em>HLA-D</em> were associated with increased risk of recurrent MN, leading the authors to speculate that modulation of antigen presentation by the allograft might play a role in disease recurrence [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Living, related donor transplantation </strong>– Although initial reports suggested that the risk of recurrent MN was higher among recipients of living, related transplants than among recipients of deceased-donor grafts [<a href="#rid4">4,31</a>], this has not been confirmed by larger studies [<a href="#rid10">10-12,32</a>]. In one study of 35 patients with MN who received a kidney allograft between 1975 and 2008, 12 patients (34 percent) developed recurrent MN [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Although the rate of recurrence was modestly higher among patients who had a living, related transplant compared with those who received a deceased-donor allograft (4 of 8, or 50 percent, versus 8 of 27, or 30 percent, respectively), the difference was not statistically significant. Two other series that included a total of 53 patients were also unable to confirm a higher risk associated with living, related transplantation [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. However, despite these observational findings, there is a theoretical increased genetic risk of recurrent MN due to shared inheritance of <em>PLA2R1</em> and <em>HLA-D </em>alleles since these two loci are known to be associated with MN in the native kidney and may be associated with increased risk of recurrence when carried by the donor kidney [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1025756287"><span class="h2">Clinical presentation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinical manifestations of recurrent MN are typically observed 13 to 15 months after transplantation although they may be observed much earlier (within weeks to months) [<a href="#rid10">10,11,14</a>]. The most common clinical manifestation is proteinuria, the degree of which may vary on presentation. In one study of 15 patients with recurrent MN, 12 (80 percent) had protein excretion greater than 150 mg/24 hours (or a protein-to-creatinine ratio greater than 200 mg/g), with eight having nephrotic-range proteinuria (ie, greater than 3.5 g/day) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>Protein excretion may be lower among those with recurrent MN detected by protocol biopsy and without overt signs or symptoms of disease [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. In one study of eight patients with recurrent MN diagnosed by surveillance biopsies, three had normal protein excretion, and five had protein excretion greater than 150 mg/day but less than 3 g/day at the time of biopsy [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>Progression of proteinuria is common even among patients with mild or no proteinuria on presentation. As an example, in the study cited above, of seven patients who did not receive additional immunosuppression for recurrent MN, five had significant increases in protein excretion, and three developed nephrotic-range proteinuria [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In another study, among 29 patients, the median proteinuria increased from 331 mg/day at diagnosis to 1409 mg/day during a mean of 19 months of follow-up [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p>The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is often normal or only mildly decreased on initial presentation. In the study cited above of 15 patients with recurrent MN, there was no significant difference in serum creatinine at the time of diagnosis compared with patients who did not have recurrent MN [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. However, the GFR often falls with progression of disease. (See <a class="local">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3220608043"><span class="h2">Surveillance and diagnosis</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3728632313"><span class="h3">Posttransplant surveillance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Kidney transplant recipients with MN as the cause of ESKD in the native kidney should be monitored after transplantation for signs of recurrent disease:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In all patients, we measure the serum creatinine level and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) monthly for at least 6 to 12 months after transplantation and every three to six months thereafter.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients with PLA2R-associated MN, we regularly measure serum anti-PLA2R antibody levels every one to three months for the first 6 to 12 months after transplantation depending upon the patient's pretransplant antibody status. More frequent measurements (ie, once per month) may be indicated in patients who had elevated anti-PLA2R antibody titers at the time of transplant (see <a class="local">'Evaluation of PLA2R status'</a> above). Persistently high or increasing titers of anti-PLA2R antibodies may anticipate the onset of disease recurrence and should prompt consideration of an allograft biopsy. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>We do not routinely perform surveillance/protocol biopsies to monitor for recurrent MN.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H783926997"><span class="h3">Diagnostic evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Recurrent MN should be suspected in any transplant patient with a history of MN in the native kidneys who develops new and progressive proteinuria with or without an elevated serum creatinine level. Among patients with a prior history of PLA2R-associated MN, persistently high or increasing titers of anti-PLA2R antibodies after transplant are also suggestive of disease recurrence. (See <a class="local">'Posttransplant surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p>The diagnosis of recurrent MN is established by kidney allograft biopsy. Indications for biopsy vary among transplant centers. We generally perform a biopsy in all transplant recipients with a history of MN who develop any persistent increase in protein excretion above baseline. The characteristic pathologic findings of MN on kidney biopsy are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/117886.html" rel="external">"Membranous nephropathy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Pathology'</a>.)</p><p>The association of the PLA2R antigen/autoantibody system in the majority of primary MN cases also holds true in recurrent MN. In one study, 50 percent (5 of 10) of recurrent MN cases were seropositive for anti-PLA2R, and all five stained positively for the PLA2R antigen within immune deposits on biopsy of the allograft [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. In another study, PLA2R staining within deposits had a sensitivity of 83 percent and a specificity of 92 percent for recurrent MN [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Similar to findings in primary MN of the native kidney, immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) is the dominant or codominant immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass in recurrent MN [<a href="#rid35">35,36</a>]. These associations may be helpful in distinguishing recurrent MN from de novo MN. (See <a class="local">'De novo membranous nephropathy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H490832503"><span class="h2">Treatment</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H984734525"><span class="h3">Initial therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Initial treatment for recurrent MN includes nonimmunosuppressive and/or immunosuppressive therapies. Our approach varies based upon disease severity, as determined by the degree of proteinuria and/or kidney dysfunction.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3601746580"><span class="h4">Mild disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with recurrent MN who have mild disease (characterized by proteinuria &lt;1 g/day, stable kidney function, and only histologic evidence of recurrent MN, as detected, for example, by protocol biopsy) typically do not require immunosuppressive therapy and can be initially managed with supportive measures alone. Such measures include renin-angiotensin system inhibition, rigorous blood pressure control, and treatment of hyperlipidemia [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. We do not augment maintenance immunosuppressive therapy in patients with mild disease, given the excellent prognosis in those in whom disease manifestations do not progress.

The approach to immunosuppressive treatment of recurrent MN in the transplanted patient is different from that of nontransplanted patients who develop MN. As an example, nontransplanted patients who develop MN and who have only mild or moderate proteinuria are often not given immunosuppressive therapies, because the rate of spontaneous remission is high. However, patients with recurrent MN are more likely to have aggressive disease since they have a history of end-stage kidney disease due to MN and since MN recurs despite immunosuppressive therapy to prevent rejection. Thus, patients with recurrent MN are generally treated more aggressively than those who present with MN for the first time.

In comparison, de novo MN was rare when the second transplant was performed in patients who did not have de novo MN in the first graft, in this study.</p><p>Exogenous agents such as medications and supplements, which may lead to MN in the native kidney, may also cause de novo MN in the allograft in individuals not previously known to have had MN. As an example, the use of alpha lipoic acid and dimercaptopropane sulfonate in a 56-year-old male kidney transplant recipient also suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis seems to have been the trigger for the development of de novo MN associated with antibodies to neural epidermal growth factor-like 1 (NELL1) [<a href="#rid55">55</a>].

In one study, none of the nine subjects with de novo MN had circulating anti-PLA2R or biopsy staining for PLA2R [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. In another study, only 1 of 11 cases of de novo MN exhibited positive PLA2R staining of the allograft biopsy [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. In contrast to recurrent MN, in which IgG4 is the dominant or codominant IgG subtype within immune deposits, immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) tends to predominate in de novo MN [<a href="#rid34">34,35</a>]. Confirming these findings, another study showed that only 1 of 18 (6 percent) de novo MN cases was suggestive of primary MN due to the presence of PLA2R or predominance of IgG4 in the deposits whereas 20 of 33 (61 percent) cases of recurrent MN exhibited these features of primary disease [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p>The kidney biopsy in de novo MN often shows findings of both MN and rejection, as well as the presence of DSAs, which are characteristic of antibody-mediated rejection [<a href="#rid29">29,51,53,54</a>].
