         Children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) often have associated hypertension and dyslipidemia, which contribute to chronic cardiovascular complications. They are also at risk for developing microvascular complications (nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy), which are caused by chronic hyperglycemia [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. Further, they often have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which may progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Surveillance for and intensive treatment of each of these complications are important components of disease management, in addition to optimizing glycemic control.
        </p>
        <p>
         Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state are acute complications that occasionally develop in adolescent patients with T2DM [

        <p>
         When a decision is made to initiate pharmacologic therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are generally recommended for initial treatment because they reduce the risk of progressive renal disease. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) may be used if the patient cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors or if targeted BP goals are not reached [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,15
         </a>
         ]. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are teratogenic; female patients should receive appropriate reproductive counseling. These drugs should be avoided in those who are not using reliable contraception and should be discontinued immediately if a pregnancy occurs. Alternative agents should be considered for females at risk for an unplanned pregnancy. Pregnancy prevention is especially important because females with T2DM who have menstrual abnormalities may have improved fertility after beginning

        </p>
        <p>
         Therapy is initiated at the lowest recommended dose and increased until the BP goal (&lt;130/80 mmHg for children ≥13 years and &lt;90

          th
         </sup>

        </p>
        <p>
         If ACE inhibitors or ARBs are contraindicated (eg, pregnancy) or not well tolerated, therapeutic alternatives include thiazide diuretics, calcium-channel inhibitors, and/or a beta blocker. Beta blockers can impair hypoglycemia awareness and may not be the best choice in patients who are at risk for hypoglycemia (ie, patients receiving exogenous insulin or oral insulin secretagogues).

         Dyslipidemia is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease in patients with T2DM as well as in the general population. In adults with T2DM, clinical trials of statin therapy, which lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration, reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Similar data demonstrating the beneficial effect of statin therapy in childhood T2DM are lacking. However, because dyslipidemia is associated with pediatric T2DM, it is generally accepted that children and adolescents with T2DM are at increased risk for progressive atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.

         Patients with T2DM often have increased serum triglycerides (TG), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and, occasionally, high LDL-C. These lipid abnormalities are correlated with insulin resistance and obesity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although dyslipidemia is not as common in pediatric patients as in adult patients with T2DM, a substantial proportion of young patients with T2DM have abnormal serum lipids. In the TODAY study, at baseline, 4.5 percent of participants had elevated LDL-C levels ≥130 mg/dL or were receiving lipid-lowering therapy; after 36 months of follow-up, the prevalence of elevated LDL-C or lipid-lowering therapy rose to 10.7 percent [

The dietary change typically includes limiting total fat to 25 to 30 percent of calories, saturated fat &lt;7 percent of total calories and dietary cholesterol intake &lt;200 mg/day and avoiding trans fats. Patients with elevated TG should also attempt to decrease simple sugar intake and increase dietary omega-3 fatty acid intake.

         Diabetes-associated nephropathy is a progressive disorder of the microvasculature of the kidney. The earliest sign of diabetic nephropathy is moderately increased albuminuria (formerly known as microalbuminuria). In youth with diabetes, moderately increased albuminuria predicts progression to overt proteinuria, which can be accompanied by systemic hypertension and impaired glomerular filtration [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25

         ]. Some patients with overt proteinuria will progress to end-stage kidney disease. Hypertension, chronic hyperglycemia, and smoking are important risk factors for diabetes-associated nephropathy. As a result, intensive monitoring and management for each of these risk factors are essential to reduce the risk for nephropathy. Screening for and treatment of diabetes-associated nephropathy are modeled on the strategies used for adults with T2DM. (See

Initial testing should be performed at diagnosis of diabetes, ideally after initial attempts to optimize glycemic control and blood pressure (BP), and repeated at least annually. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) should also be calculated annually, based on serum creatinine, age, and height (

         Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are usually the first-line choice.

Because ACE inhibitors and ARBs are teratogenic, female patients should be counseled to avoid pregnancy and these drugs should be discontinued immediately if a pregnancy is discovered. The above thresholds for initiating pharmacotherapy are based on expert opinion, as reflected in guidelines [

         Diabetes-associated retinopathy is a progressive disorder that affects the microvasculature of the retina. Most patients develop the mildest form of retinopathy (nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy [NPDR]) as duration of diabetes increases. NPDR can progress to an intermediate stage (pre-proliferative) and to proliferative retinopathy, which carries a high risk of visual loss when untreated. In the absence of adequate data in children with T2DM, pending the results of the follow-up retinopathy outcomes in the TODAY study, screening for and treatment of diabetic retinopathy are modeled on the strategies used in adults with T2DM.

         Obesity and T2DM are associated with a clinical spectrum of liver abnormalities collectively known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is the most common liver disease in children and is particularly common in children with T2DM and/or obesity. NAFLD describes a spectrum of liver abnormalities, ranging from hepatic steatosis (increased liver fat without inflammation) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH; increased liver fat with inflammation), which may progress to fibrosis or cirrhosis. For patients with simple steatosis or mild steatohepatitis, the likelihood and risk factors for progression to more severe liver disease are unknown.

         The only established treatment for NAFLD is weight reduction. Since virtually all adolescents with T2DM have obesity, the initial intervention for those with any ALT elevation should be intensive efforts to support weight control and optimize glycemic control. Patients should be advised to avoid or limit alcohol consumption since this may exacerbate NAFLD. Bariatric surgery may cause further elevations in serum ALT during the early phase of rapid weight loss. These abnormalities are typically transient, and NAFLD usually improves by the time that weight loss plateaus [

Similarly, if ALT rises above this threshold during metformin therapy, we hold metformin for at least two weeks and repeat measurement of ALT to determine if this might be an adverse drug effect.

         In addition to PCOS, youth with T2DM are at risk for other comorbidities of obesity including obstructive sleep apnea and orthopedic complications. The clinician should be vigilant for suggestive symptoms and signs of each of these disorders and evaluate more specifically as needed. (See

         Young women with T2DM experience a high rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes. In the TODAY study, adolescents who became pregnant had high rates of premature birth (15 percent) and major congenital malformations (21 percent) [

          Overview
         </strong>
         – Chronic complications are common among youth with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and tend to progress more rapidly than in adults, with documented cumulative incidence over 15 years of more than 50 percent for diabetic kidney disease, retinopathy, hypertension, and dyslipidemia and 30 percent for neuropathy. Surveillance and management for complications are outlined in the table  (

          Hypertension
         </strong>
         – Primary hypertension (formerly called "essential" hypertension) is present in 17 to 32 percent of adolescent patients with T2DM at presentation. Both T2DM and hypertension increase the risk for macro- and microvascular disease. (See
         <a class="local">

         Blood pressure (BP) should be measured at all routine health care visits for pediatric patients with T2DM. The results are categorized as follows, based on BP measurements taken on three separate occasions  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef114574" href="/z/d/graphic/114574.html" rel="external">
          table 2

         </span>
         For adolescents ≥13 years, elevated BP (prehypertension) is defined as systolic BP 120 to 129 mmHg, with diastolic BP &lt;80 mmHg. Hypertension is defined as systolic or diastolic BP ≥130/80.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p class="bulletIndent3">
         <span class="glyph">
          -
         </span>
         For children &lt;13 years, elevated BP and hypertension are based on BP percentiles, as outlined in the table  (

         </span>
         If elevated BP is present, nonpharmacologic therapy (salt restriction, healthful diet, exercise, and weight reduction) should be used initially. If BP remains in this elevated range for six months, it is reasonable to initiate pharmacologic therapy; the decision is based on patient characteristics, including the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors. (See

         If hypertension is diagnosed in a patient with diabetes, we suggest initiating pharmacologic therapy (

          Grade 2C

         ). The preferred antihypertensive agent is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) if the ACE inhibitor is not tolerated. These drugs are teratogenic, should be avoided in females of childbearing age who are not using reliable contraception, and should be discontinued immediately if a pregnancy occurs. (See

          Dyslipidemia
         </strong>
         – Patients with T2DM are at increased risk for dyslipidemia, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In our practice, we use the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines for screening and treatment of dyslipidemia in pediatric patients with T2DM  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90954" href="/z/d/graphic/90954.html" rel="external">
          table 5

         In all pediatric patients with T2DM, a lipid profile should be obtained at diagnosis (after blood glucose control has been well established) and repeated annually.

         Nonpharmacologic therapy (diet, exercise, improved glycemic control, and weight reduction) should be used for initial management of dyslipidemia. We suggest pharmacologic therapy for children over 10 years of age who fail nonpharmacologic therapy and have elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; ≥130 mg/dL [≥3.36 mmol/L]) (

          Microvascular complications
         </strong>
         – In both adults and children with T2DM, the risk of microvascular complications increases with poor glycemic control and duration of the disease. Early detection allows for intervention that may reverse vascular disease or delay further progression. (See
