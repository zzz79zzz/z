         Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an inherited neurocutaneous disorder that is characterized by pleomorphic features involving many organ systems, including multiple benign hamartomas of the brain, eyes, heart, lung, liver, kidney, and skin. The expression of the disease varies substantially. The diagnosis of TSC can be made clinically or through genetic testing.
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical evaluation and diagnosis of TSC will be reviewed here. Other aspects of TSC are discussed elsewhere:

         The classic TSC diagnostic triad of seizures, intellectual disability, and facial angiofibromas (Vogt triad) occurs in less than one-third of patients with TSC [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Thus, clinicians must be familiar with the full spectrum of TSC-associated diagnostic features. Furthermore, there is a range of phenotypes between and within families that includes patients with normal to severely impaired neurologic function [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. In particular, a parent who has somatic mosaicism for a pathogenic variant may have mild features. However, an offspring who inherits this pathogenic variant will not be mosaic and may have much earlier onset of symptoms and more severe symptoms than the parent.
        </p>
        <p>
         All of the clinical features of TSC may not be apparent in the first year of life. Thus, a child is often diagnosed initially with possible or probable TSC and later diagnosed with definite TSC after additional features are identified. Rather than waiting for more features to emerge, the diagnosis of definite TSC can be confirmed in this setting by molecular genetic testing, which reveals a disease-causing
         <em>
          TSC1
         </em>
         or
         <em>
          TSC2
         </em>
         pathogenic variant in 85 to 90 percent of individuals who eventually meet clinical diagnostic criteria for TSC. (See

         The initial screening evaluation should confirm the diagnosis by identifying clinical features of TSC. The history should focus on symptoms associated with the disorder. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6175.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         The parents and caregivers should be questioned specifically about the presence or absence of seizures or developmental delay, which are often associated with TSC but are not diagnostic criteria for the disorder. A detailed family history also should be obtained to detect possible symptoms of TSC. International TSC guidelines recommend obtaining a three-generation family history to assess for additional family members at risk for TSC [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. When possible, parents and siblings should be examined for characteristic signs.

         The skin should be thoroughly examined for the characteristic dermatologic features of TSC, including hypomelanotic macules, fibroadenomas, shagreen patches, and the distinctive brown fibrous plaque often present on the forehead. The skin manifestations are most apparent on the face. Use of a Wood's lamp (ultraviolet [UV] light) may facilitate the identification of hypomelanotic macules. The presence or absence of each of the major dermatologic features should be specifically recorded in the medical record. Parents of a child suspected of having TSC should undergo a similar examination. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6175.html" rel="external">

         We offer genetic testing at the initial visit. Genetic testing is particularly important for patients with possible TSC who do not meet the criteria for definite TSC (see
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical criteria'

          Negative test
         </strong>
         – A negative genetic test does not exclude the diagnosis of TSC in an apparently affected individual, since 10 to 15 percent of individuals with TSC have no pathogenic variant identified by standard genetic testing [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, a positive test does not predict either the severity or nature of the disease complications.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         One cause of a negative genetic test is the presence of somatic mosaicism, which is estimated to occur in 2 to 10 percent of de novo cases of TSC [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. In somatic mosaicism, the pathogenic variant in the
         <em>
          TSC1
         </em>
         or
         <em>
          TSC2
         </em>
         gene is not present in all cells. This occurs when the pathogenic variant is present in the developing embryo and results in a variable mixture of normal and affected cells in different tissues. In individuals with mosaicism, genetic testing performed on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from blood leukocytes may be normal, depending upon the degree of mosaicism in the blood [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8

         Other causes of a negative genetic test may include splice-region variants or other variants that may not be tested for in routine sequencing analyses.

         – The differential diagnosis of seizures and epilepsy is broad. Infantile spasms are the most common type of seizures in children less than one year of age with TSC; focal seizures are the most common type in older children. In addition to TSC, causes of infantile spasms include congenital infections, perinatal and postnatal brain insults, brain malformations, Aicardi syndrome, other genetic disorders, inborn errors of metabolism, and other neurocutaneous disorders (eg, linear nevus sebaceous syndrome, incontinentia pigmenti, pigmentary mosaicism of Ito, Sturge-Weber syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 1).

         Although TSC is an autosomal dominant condition, only a minority of patients have a known family history of TSC. The remaining cases represent new pathogenic variants or mosaicism in the affected parent. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/142618.html" rel="external">
          "Tuberous sclerosis complex: Genetics and pathogenesis", section on 'Genetics'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Parents who are negative on genetic testing for the TSC pathogenic variant found in their affected child may still carry this variant as either a low-level somatic or germline mosaic. Thus, they may be at risk for having future children affected with TSC. It is very important to make this point clear to parents.
        </p>
        <p>
         Normal intelligence and the absence of a history of seizures in the parents do not exclude the diagnosis of TSC.
        </p>
        <p>
         The importance of determining whether a parent is affected lies in providing appropriate follow-up for the parent (eg, screening for kidney disease) and in providing an appropriate risk estimate of having a subsequent child with TSC. Because TSC is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, the risk of this disorder in each offspring of an affected parent is 50 percent. However, if neither parent meets the clinical criteria for TSC, the risk of the parents having another child with TSC is approximately 2 percent [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. This risk is due to gonadal mosaicism, which occurs when either parent carries the pathogenic variant in more than one egg or sperm cell [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,13
         </a>
         ]. An adult who is mosaic for a severe pathogenic variant (eg, a truncating variant in
         <em>
          TSC2
         </em>
         ) may be mildly affected but has a 2 to 50 percent chance of transmitting the variant to their child (it is not clinically possible to assess the degree of mosaicism in a gonad). However, any offspring who inherit this variant will
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be mosaic; they will carry the pathogenic variant in every cell of the body and may be severely affected. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/142618.html" rel="external">
          "Tuberous sclerosis complex: Genetics and pathogenesis", section on 'De novo versus familial TSC'

         Reproductive decisions by couples are facilitated by appropriate genetic counseling. Prospective parents should be aware that TSC exhibits wide clinical variability within families and that establishing the diagnosis prenatally cannot predict the severity or outcome. The couple should also understand that their risk of having an affected child could be substantially lowered by use of reproductive technologies, including preimplantation genetic diagnosis, if the pathogenic variant is known, or sperm or oocyte donation, depending upon which parent is affected.
        </p>
        <p>
         For families where a specific TSC pathogenic variant is identified, preimplantation genetic diagnosis involves single cell analysis after biopsy of an embryo obtained through in vitro fertilization and subsequent implantation of embryos at low risk of carrying the pathogenic variant [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14

         ]. Prenatal testing for
         <em>

         or
         <em>
          TSC2
         </em>
         pathogenic variants of specimens obtained during pregnancy through either chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis is also available; it should be offered to parents where a pathogenic variant has been identified in their child, even those with apparently "de novo" pathogenic variants, in view of the high rate of gonadal mosaicism in this condition.

          Suspicion for TSC
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) may be suspected in certain clinical scenarios, including prenatal detection of cardiac rhabdomyomas, the presence of hypomelanotic skin macules, the onset of seizures (particularly infantile spasms), and suspicion for autism. (See

         – Cranial MRI is optimal to detect cortical glioneuronal hamartomas, subependymal nodules, subependymal giant cell tumors, or cerebral white matter abnormalities. MRI of the abdomen or kidney ultrasound is indicated to evaluate for the presence of renal angiomyolipomas or renal cysts. (See

         For individuals with suspected TSC and a family history of TSC in a first-degree relative, genetic testing can be focused on testing for the familial variant.

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Genetic testing is useful for confirming the diagnosis in individuals with possible TSC, for reproductive planning, and for identifying at-risk family members. However, a negative genetic test does not exclude the diagnosis of TSC in an apparently affected child, particularly due to the possibility of mosaicism. (See

          Diagnostic criteria

         or
         <em>
          TSC2

         is sufficient to make a definite diagnosis of TSC. (See

         <strong>
          Counseling
         </strong>
         – Counseling should be provided for patients with TSC and their families and caregivers. It should include information on the inheritance of the disorder, genetic testing results, prognosis, and psychosocial adjustment. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Parental evaluation
         </strong>
         – When the diagnosis is made in a child with no family history of the disorder, both parents should be carefully evaluated for features of TSC and offered genetic testing if a causative variant has been identified. (See
         <a class="local">
