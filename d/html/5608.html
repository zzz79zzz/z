The prototype of this disorder was described by Charcot in relation to tabes dorsalis. Similar changes are seen with other neurologic disorders, such as idiopathic neuropathy and syringomyelia, although diabetes is the most common cause of neuropathic (Charcot) arthropathy in the western world. Other names for diabetic neuroarthropathy include Charcot arthropathy and diabetic osteoarthropathy.</p><p>Diabetic neuroarthropathy will be reviewed here. A variety of other musculoskeletal conditions have also been associated with diabetes mellitus, including specific arthropathies of the hand and shoulder, limited joint mobility, and spontaneous infarction of skeletal muscle. These conditions are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5126.html" rel="external">"Overview of the musculoskeletal complications of diabetes mellitus"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5135.html" rel="external">"Diabetic muscle infarction"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1802.html" rel="external">"Limited joint mobility in diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pathogenesis of this condition is likely multifactorial, due to a combination of mechanical and vascular factors resulting from diabetic peripheral and autonomic neuropathy and metabolic abnormalities of bone  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef74711" href="/z/d/graphic/74711.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>].</p><p>The neuropathic joint likely develops in two phases: an initial resorptive phase followed by a hypertrophic repair phase [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The initial resorptive phase is induced by proinflammatory cytokines, which are produced in response to joint damage.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Resorptive phase</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Diabetic peripheral neuropathy predisposes to joint damage</strong> – Peripheral neuropathy is associated with loss of proprioception and autonomic neuropathy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Loss of proprioception</strong> – Loss of proprioception may lead to minor trauma that damages the joint. This joint damage increases the range of joint movement, leading to joint instability and ligament laxity. The resulting changes to joint architecture also changes the mechanical axis of the foot, which makes the patient susceptible to further joint damage.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Autonomic neuropathy</strong> – Autonomic neuropathy may result in vasomotor changes and the formation of arteriovenous shunts. These, in turn, reduce skin and bone blood flow, despite normal foot pulses in these patients. The reduction in blood flow impedes the ability to repair the damaged joints.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Joint damage induces pro-inflammatory cytokines</strong> – Trauma to the neuropathic foot may trigger an exaggerated local inflammatory response, mediated by proinflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor [TNF], interleukin 1 [IL-1] beta, and IL-6), resulting in the osteoarthropathy [<a href="#rid4">4,6</a>]. These cytokines may induce enhanced osteoclastic activity, which has been seen in surgical specimens from patients with neuroarthropathy [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Other laboratory studies suggest that both receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF) kappa B ligand (RANKL)-dependent and -independent pathways may be involved in the increased bone resorption seen in this condition [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypertrophic repair phase</strong> – During the hypertrophic repair phase, the damaged joint is replaced with abnormal bone and cartilage, which often results in ankylosis. The altered anatomy of the joint places stress on the plantar fascia and surrounding tendons, predisposing the joint to additional damage [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H280806035"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevalence</strong> – Diabetic neuroarthropathy is uncommon among the general diabetic population. The prevalence of diabetic neuroarthropathy in a study of 205,033 patients with diabetes was 0.04 percent [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Incidence</strong> – The annual incidence of diabetic neuroarthropathy ranges from 0.12 to 0.3 percent [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. However, the incidence of diabetic neuroarthropathy is difficult to determine accurately, as reports are often from specialty centers that treat more severe cases of diabetes, and diagnostic criteria for diabetic neuroarthropathy vary between series [<a href="#rid11">11-14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk factors</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Pancreas/kidney transplant</strong> – A high prevalence of diabetic neuroarthropathy (12 percent) has been reported in patients following simultaneous pancreatic and kidney transplantation, a group characterized by severe and longstanding diabetes [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">A retrospective study of 487 patients with diabetes who underwent solid organ transplant found a greater incidence of diabetic neuroarthropathy in patients who had undergone kidney-pancreas transplant compared with those who had kidney transplantation alone (18 versus 11 percent); the mean times to develop the arthropathy were 6.4±4.8 and 7.1±5.2 years, respectively [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Obesity</strong> – Obesity was found to be a risk factor for diabetic neuroarthropathy in a population of veterans with diabetes [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Type 1 diabetes</strong> – Patients with type 1 diabetes may present with diabetic neuroarthropathy at a younger age than patients with type 2 diabetes. In a series of 85 patients presenting to a diabetic foot clinic with acute diabetic neuroarthropathy, type 1 diabetics presented more frequently in their fifth decade, with an average duration of diabetes of 24 ± 8.4 years, while patients with type 2 diabetes tended to present in their sixth decade, with a mean duration of diabetes of 13 ± 8.1 years [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3289301111"><span class="h2">Time course</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Diabetic neuroarthropathy generally presents acutely. However, some patients present over months or years, with a slowly progressing arthropathy associated with insidious swelling. Other patients may not be diagnosed until they have developed radiographic damage characteristic of chronic disease. (See <a class="local">'Plain radiographs and classification'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H280806159"><span class="h2">History and physical findings</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H620433494"><span class="h3">Acute attack</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An acute attack of diabetic neuroarthropathy may present as a red, hot, swollen foot, possibly following minor trauma. However, acute attacks may also be more subtle and may be associated with minimal symptoms.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Common symptoms and signs</strong> – The clinical manifestations are variable, but patients classically present with unilateral warmth, redness, and edema over the foot or ankle [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The affected foot may be several degrees warmer than the contralateral foot. The erythema may resolve with elevation of the affected extremity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Pain is variable but typically not prominent. Although pain is present in 76 percent of patients, it is generally less than might be expected from the clinical and radiologic appearance of the affected joint [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Some patients present with minimal pain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Diabetic neuroarthropathy often presents without a wound or ulceration.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Joint distribution</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Foot and ankle is most common</strong> – The most frequently involved joints in the patients with diabetes are the tarsometatarsal joints, followed by the hindfoot joints, metatarsophalangeal joints, and the ankle [<a href="#rid3">3,18</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Involvement of other joints is uncommon</strong> – Although unusual, involvement of upper-limb joints can also occur [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. In one report, upper-extremity involvement occurred in the hand and wrist in three patients with diabetes who had received or were receiving treatment for diabetic neuroarthropathy [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]; the hand abnormalities were bilateral in two patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Rarely, diabetic neuroarthropathy can also affect the knee; in one report of three patients with knee involvement, all had been treated for diabetic neuroarthropathy of the foot [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Recurrence</strong> – Recurrent attacks are uncommon. In one series, only 10 percent of patients experienced recurrent attacks in the same foot, and in approximately 20 percent of patients attacks of diabetic neuroarthropathy occurred in the contralateral foot. Simultaneous bilateral attacks were rare [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. In this series, there was a median of two years between attacks in the contralateral foot.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1833567273"><span class="h3">Chronic arthropathy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients who present later in their disease course, following resolution of acute changes, joint damage and disorganization can be severe and irreversible. Deformities are common and can result in transfer of weightbearing to areas that tolerate it poorly and/or that may lack sensation. Ulceration and infection commonly ensue.</p><p>Chronic untreated diabetic neuroarthropathy is characterized by deformity and collapse of the affected joints. Common deformities seen are the “rocker bottom foot” caused by collapse of the arch of the midfoot, with resulting prominence of bones on the plantar aspect potentially leading to pressure ulceration  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67753" href="/z/d/graphic/67753.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>), medial convexity deformity caused by medial displacement of the talonavicular joint, and tarsometatarsal dislocation [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H280806152"><span class="h2">Laboratory findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with diabetic neuroarthropathy uncomplicated by infection, the white blood cell count and acute phase reactants may be normal or mildly elevated.</p><p>In a study of 36 patients who presented with acute diabetic neuroarthropathy, the median erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 21 mm/h and the median C-reactive protein (CRP) was 5.8 mg/L [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Excluding alternate diagnoses'</a> below.)</p><p>Synovial fluid is not typically obtained. However, if available, it should be sterile, with few white blood cells, no crystals or organisms on microscopy, and no growth on culture.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H280805752"><span class="h1">IMAGING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Radiographic finding are variable, depending upon the stage and site of the arthropathy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2404245218"><span class="h2">Plain radiographs and classification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We obtain a weightbearing radiograph when evaluating for diabetic neuroarthropathy, although initial radiographs may be normal. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Radiograph findings can vary by stage of disease, as classified by the modified Eichenholtz system for diabetic neuroarthropathy [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. The stages are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Stage 0: Early or inflammatory</strong> – In early acute disease, plain radiographs may be normal or nonspecific, showing only soft tissue swelling, loss of joint space, or osteopenia [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. These findings are often best appreciated on a weightbearing plain radiograph, but a normal plain radiograph does not exclude early acute diabetic neuroarthropathy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Clinically, this stage is characterized by localized swelling, erythema, and warmth.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Stage 1: Development</strong> – Plain radiographs show bony changes such as fracture, subluxation/dislocation, and bony debris.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Clinically, this stage is characterized by increasing swelling, erythema, and warmth.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Stage 2: Coalescence</strong> – Plain radiographs show osseous fragmentation, sclerosis, new bone formation, subluxation, and dislocation, most commonly seen in the midfoot and hindfoot  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64186 graphicRef76978 graphicRef57519" href="/z/d/graphic/64186.html" rel="external">image 1A-C</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1,19</a>]. In the forefoot, bone resorption can result in osteolysis of phalanges and a variety of further changes, including partial or complete disappearance of the metatarsal heads or “pencil-pointing” of phalangeal and metatarsal shafts.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Clinically, this stage is characterized by a reduction in inflammatory signs.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Stage 3: Remodeling</strong> – Plain radiographs may show mature fracture callus and decreased sclerosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Clinically, this stage is characterized by resolution of the redness, warmth, and swelling, and the presence of bony deformities of the affected joints.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H786243760"><span class="h2">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is generally used to evaluate for potential complications or alternative diagnoses. However, certain MRI findings are suggestive of the diabetic neuroarthropathy and may be useful if the diagnosis cannot be confirmed with plain radiographs alone. The use of contrast is not always necessary but may help to distinguish diabetic neuroarthropathy from osteomyelitis.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Non-contrast MRI</strong> – We suggest a prompt non-contrast MRI to confirm an early diagnosis of diabetic neuroarthropathy when the clinician cannot confidently differentiate diabetic neuroarthropathy from cellulitis or inflammatory arthritis based on history and physical examination. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A non-contrast MRI in stage 0 diabetic neuroarthropathy (ie, early disease, plain radiographs are normal or show nonspecific changes) typically demonstrates subchondral bone marrow edema with or without microfracture [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. A normal MRI in this situation makes a diagnosis of acute diabetic neuroarthropathy unlikely. A non-contrast MRI may also identify mimics of diabetic neuroarthropathy (eg, stress fracture, torn ligaments, intraarticular fragmentation).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A non-contrast MRI in stage 1, 2, or 3 diabetic neuropathy reflects the findings demonstrated on plain radiographs. (See <a class="local">'Plain radiographs and classification'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Contrast MRI</strong> – We suggest a contrast MRI when the clinician is trying to distinguish diabetic neuroarthropathy from osteomyelitis. These diagnoses may be indistinguishable on non-contrast MRI [<a href="#rid5">5,25</a>]. However, because of the risk of developing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, use of gadolinium-containing contrast agents should be avoided in patients with diminished kidney function. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1955.html" rel="external">"Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis/nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy in advanced kidney disease", section on 'Assessment of kidney function prior to gadolinium exposure'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In a retrospective study of 128 neuropathic joints (42 with concomitant osteomyelitis), the presence of one or more of the following features on contrast-enhanced MRI favored a diagnosis of osteomyelitis [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A sinus tract</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Replacement of soft tissue fat</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A fluid collection</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Extensive marrow abnormality</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The absence of infection was associated with a thin rim of enhancement rather than diffuse signal throughout an effusion and with the presence of subchondral cysts or intraarticular bodies [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The diagnostic evaluation of possible osteomyelitis is presented in detail separately.

We prefer the use of a total-contact cast because it affords full-time stabilization. Limited observational data suggest that total-contact casting may protect the foot more completely. As an example, in a retrospective study, total-contact casting and protected weightbearing was associated with a lower rate of foot ulceration than among patients who had refused casting and were treated with orthopedic footwear and unprotected weightbearing [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. Additionally, some experts are concerned that prolonged three-point weightbearing, using crutches and the unaffected (but also neuropathic) foot, can lead to falls, new ulcerations, or overuse injuries to the contralateral foot and can also be difficult for the overweight patient.</p><p>Nevertheless, one international consensus document supports non-weightbearing using either crutches or a wheelchair [<a href="#rid29">29</a>], although this practice is falling out of favor.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3207747757"><span class="h4">Duration and management of casting</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The cast must initially be changed every one to two weeks due to a decrease in edema over time.</p><p>Casting should be continued until redness and swelling have resolved, the difference in skin temperature has decreased to within 1 to 2 degrees of that of the unaffected foot, and radiographic signs (eg, resolving resorptive changes, resorption of osseous debris, and evidence of repair), if initially present, have improved. The time necessary to achieve this result varies. In one web-based observational study, the duration for needing non-removable casts ranged from 3 to 25 months (median 9 months), and that for removable casts ranged from 3 to 36 months (median 12 months) [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p>Short duration of casting with early weightbearing (ie, total contact cast for approximately two weeks followed by a Charcot restraint orthotic walker [CROW]) was associated with a poor outcome (65 percent with ulceration and 26 percent undergoing amputation) in one long-term retrospective study [<a href="#rid41">41</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2854374431"><span class="h4">Transition from casting</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For a successful transition from casting to weightbearing, coordination of care with a podiatrist or a foot and ankle orthopedist experienced in the care of such patients and the use of well-fitting shoes are essential.

Good candidates for amputation include patients with severe involvement, poor healing potential, and difficulty maintaining prolonged protected weightbearing as well as those who require a faster return to activity.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2101906681"><span class="h1">MONITORING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once a patient with diabetic neuroarthropathy demonstrates evidence of sclerosis, new bone formation, subluxation, or dislocation (ie, stage 2 or stage 3), the deformity is typically stable. Monitoring past that point must be tailored to the individual patient and the presence or absence of complications (eg, ulceration). In general, the patient may resume routine footcare, with a low threshold to return for reevaluation if the patient develops erythema, ulceration, or other findings concerning for relapse.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1384363364"><span class="h1">PROGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prognosis depends upon the rapidity of recognition and treatment of the diabetic neuroarthropathy [<a href="#rid29">29,37</a>]. Early presentation and confirmation of the diagnosis, with rapid offloading of the foot, are the most important factors in ensuring a good outcome. In patients who present later in the course of disease, joint destruction and disorganization is often severe and irreversible. This may result in foot ulceration, with secondary infection, increasing the risk of amputation.</p><p>Diabetic neuroarthropathy can have a significant negative impact on self-reported quality of life in patients with diabetes [<a href="#rid54">54</a>], and, in people of working age, job loss is common [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].</p><p>Diabetic neuroarthropathy affecting the ankle and hindfoot is often more unstable and may require a longer period of immobilization than midfoot diabetic neuroarthropathy. Ankle/hindfoot diabetic neuroarthropathy is associated with a poor prognosis and is often difficult to treat nonsurgically.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H502485002"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/z/d/html/104442.html" rel="external">"Society guideline links: Diabetes mellitus in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H24803269"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevalence and risk factors</strong> – Diabetic neuroarthropathy is uncommon and has been reported in approximately 0.04 percent of patients with diabetes. Risk factors for diabetic neuroarthropathy include simultaneous pancreatic and kidney transplantation, obesity, and type 1 diabetes. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical features</strong> – Patients may present with the recent onset of unilateral warmth, redness, and edema over a foot or ankle, often following minor trauma. Most patients experience some pain, but typically of lesser severity than that which might be expected from the findings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients eventually develop a chronic arthropathy, associated with collapse of the arch of the midfoot. This collapse creates bony prominences on the plantar aspect of the foot, which can lead to pressure ulcers  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67753" href="/z/d/graphic/67753.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation of acute diabetic neuropathy</strong> – Acute diabetic neuroarthropathy is a clinical diagnosis. We diagnose acute diabetic neuroarthropathy in a patient with diabetic neuropathy who presents with a unilateral warm, swollen, erythematous foot that lacks an alternate explanation. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The diagnostic evaluation is aimed at confirming the diagnosis by identifying characteristic clinical findings and excluding other conditions, including infection, which could be confused with diabetic neuroarthropathy. (See <a class="local">'Excluding alternate diagnoses'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In patients with a joint effusion, the joint should be aspirated and synovial fluid should be analyzed and cultured to exclude other conditions, including septic or crystalline arthropathy. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A normal radiograph does not exclude a diagnosis of acute diabetic neuroarthropathy. However, MRI may be helpful to exclude other diagnoses that are difficult to confirm clinically and thus confirm the diagnosis clinically. (See <a class="local">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation of chronic diabetic neuroarthropathy</strong> – Chronic diabetic neuroarthropathy is diagnosed in a patient with a prior history of acute diabetic neuroarthropathy who exhibits radiographic evidence of joint damage consistent with this diagnosis (eg, subluxation, bony debris, osteolysis, osseous fragmentation, sclerosis, new bone formation). The diagnosis is established based on history and the presence of typical changes on plain radiographs. (See <a class="local">'Chronic diabetic neuroarthropathy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential Diagnosis</strong> – Important considerations in the differential diagnosis of diabetic neuroarthropathy include septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, cellulitis, gout, pseudogout, osteoarthritis, inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteomyelitis, complex regional pain syndrome, and stress fracture. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment of acute and chronic diabetic neuroarthropathy</strong> – Treatment should be individualized and carried out by a multidisciplinary team with experience in this condition, including medical experts in joint disease and diabetes and specialists in podiatry and foot and ankle surgery. Physical therapy expertise is also helpful with mobility and walking aids. (See <a class="local">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Patients presenting with joint inflammation</strong> – For patients with diabetic neuroarthropathy who present with joint edema, swelling, or warmth (ie, stages 0 to 2), we suggest a non-removable, total-contact cast to offload the involved foot (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). We also educate patients on the importance of offloading, and we monitor the contralateral foot for evidence of diabetic neuroarthropathy. (See <a class="local">'Initial casting to achieve stability'</a> above and <a class="local">'Care of the contralateral foot'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">We continue casting until edema, erythema, and temperature of the affected foot have lessened. Patients may then progress to protected weightbearing with use of orthotics and other assistive devices. (See <a class="local">'Duration and management of casting'</a> above and <a class="local">'Transition from casting'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Patients presenting following resolution of joint inflammation</strong> – For patients with diabetic neuroarthropathy who present following resolution of joint edema, swelling, or warmth (ie, stage 3), we suggest using an offloading device (eg, total-contact prosthetic walker, removable cast walker) instead of a total-contact cast.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">For patients with diabetic neuroarthropathy who have a cool, non-inflamed foot and stable radiologic damage, we suggest treatment with bracing or orthotic support if the foot is plantigrade. If well-fitting footwear is not available, the patient may benefit from custom bracing or surgical treatment. (See <a class="local">'Offloading the affected foot'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Inhibitors of bone turnover</strong> – We suggest not routinely using inhibitors of bone turnover (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>) given the lack of supportive data, but these may be reasonable to consider as an adjunctive therapy for patients with severe pain despite offloading. (See <a class="local">'Limited role for adjunctive inhibitors of bone turnover'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Surgical options for treatment failure</strong> – Surgical correction is best avoided in most patients but may be undertaken in selected patients with instability, bony prominence or a non-plantigrade foot. Possible interventions include removal of exostoses, arthrodesis, Achilles tendon or gastrocnemius muscle lengthening, and amputation. (See <a class="local">'Surgery for treatment failure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prognosis</strong> – The prognosis depends upon the rapidity of recognition and treatment. Early presentation and confirmation of the diagnosis of diabetic neuroarthropathy, with rapid offloading of the foot, are the most important factors to ensure a good outcome. Disease involving the hindfoot and ankle appears to have a worse prognosis than disease involving the midfoot. In patients who present late in the disease course, joint disorganization is often severe and irreversible. (See <a class="local">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Giurini JM, Chrzan JS, Gibbons GW, Habershaw GM.
