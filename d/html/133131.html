The transplanted hematopoietic cells may recognize the recipient's cells as "foreign" and cause graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality associated with allogeneic HCT. However, the allogeneic cells also establish a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, which contributes importantly to eradication of the malignant cells. Limiting the toxicity of GVHD, while enabling the benefit of GVL, is key to successful outcomes with allogeneic HCT.</p><p>Autologous transplantation is not used to treat AML or MDS in children.</p><p>For children with AML or MDS, it is especially important to exclude an underlying inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (IBMFS). Children with an IBMFS require special considerations for donor selection (to avoid reconstituting the bone marrow with the same condition) and choice of conditioning regimen, they may have non-hematologic manifestations of the syndrome that can affect transplantation, and they have increased risk for TRM, as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/132753.html" rel="external">"Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS)"</a>.)</p><p>This topic discusses allogeneic HCT in children with AML or MDS who do not have an IBMFS.</p><p>Management of AML and MDS are discussed separately.

Nevertheless, the<strong> </strong>potential for HCT to cure myeloid malignancies must be balanced against available alternative treatments and the short-term and long-term consequences of transplantation.</p><p>The decision to pursue transplantation must be individualized, with consideration of the child's age, current clinical status, alternative treatment options, transplant-related risks and complications, and the patient's/family's wishes. Alternative treatments for AML and MDS and indications for allogeneic HCT are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13935.html" rel="external">"Acute myeloid leukemia in children and adolescents"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16121.html" rel="external">"Treatment of high or very high risk myelodysplastic syndromes"</a>.)</p><p>It is important to consider whether AML or MDS in a child is related to an underlying inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (IBMFS).

The conditioning regimen and other aspects of transplantation can impair growth and development, while graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and other transplant-related adverse effects can be devastating in children. In addition to monitoring for disease relapse, post-transplant surveillance must focus on short- and long-term complications, as some consequences of transplantation in children may not emerge for decades. (See <a class="local">'Post-transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p>Transplantation must also consider the age of the child. Outcomes and toxicity with HCT differ for infants (&lt;2 years), young children (≥2 to &lt;12 years), and adolescents (≥12 to 18 years); note that these age categories are differences of degree, rather than distinct age thresholds. Outcomes according to the age at transplantation are discussed below.

HCT in a child with an underlying IBMFS is associated with increased risk for transplant-related toxicity and late effects, including a higher incidence of second cancers. Graft selection must carefully exclude as potential donors those relatives whose hematopoietic grafts might reconstitute the syndrome in the transplanted recipient. Selection of conditioning regimens and other treatments must be tailored for the underlying IBMFS. Special considerations for HCT in patients with an underlying IBMFS are discussed separately.

These immunologic differences can cause GVL (which contributes importantly to the eradication of malignant cells), but they also cause GVHD (a major cause of transplant-related morbidity and mortality).
