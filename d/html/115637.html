         Anemia in pregnancy is a global health problem. While some degree of dilutional anemia is part of normal pregnancy physiology, anemia can have serious adverse health consequences for the mother and child. Thus, it is critical to distinguish iron deficiency anemia from physiologic anemia, as well as to identify other less common causes of anemia that may require treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic discusses an approach to evaluating and treating anemia during pregnancy. The general approach to anemia in adults and children and the diagnosis of iron deficiency in other populations are discussed in separate topic reviews:

         Definitions of anemia are different during pregnancy compared with nonpregnant individuals, and the lower limit of normal for the hemoglobin concentration may vary in different populations. However, it is helpful to have a threshold for determining the presence and severity of anemia. We do not use different thresholds for different racial or ethnic groups, as discussed separately. (See

         Anemia in pregnancy can be defined as follows, based mostly on data in nonpregnant individuals [

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The definition of postpartum anemia as hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL is based on a guideline from the United Kingdom, as proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and is largely consistent with other guidelines [

         Some individuals may have a significant decrease from baseline without crossing these thresholds, and clinical judgment is required to determine the reason(s) for the decrease and the need for (and aggressiveness of) further evaluation. As examples:

         The overwhelming majority of anemia in reproductive-age females is due to low or absent iron stores, making iron deficiency anemia the world's most common anemia. The incidence of iron deficiency anemia in the United States, Western Europe, and other high-resource regions of the world, while substantial, is lower than in low-resource regions. Iron deficiency anemia remains a formidable problem worldwide. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7150.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to iron deficiency anemia, a large number of gravidas have iron deficiency without anemia (low iron stores that have not yet caused anemia). (See

         Racial disparities in the prevalence of anemia are largely due to higher rates of iron deficiency in Black individuals with less access to healthy foods, education, and safe environments; increased exposure to infectious diseases, poverty, and stress; and reduced health care access, especially screening for heavy menstrual bleeding [

         A 2023 cohort study of nearly 4 million births in the state of California during the period from 2011 through 2020 documented that antepartum anemia was most common in Black individuals (22 percent), followed by Pacific Islanders (18 percent), Native American and Alaska Native peoples (14 percent), multiracial individuals (14 percent), Hispanic individuals (13 percent), Asian individuals (11 percent) and White individuals (10 percent) [

Antepartum anemia was associated with an approximately threefold increase in the risk of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) across all groups and contributed to approximately 20 percent of SMM in Black individuals.

         Physiologic anemia of pregnancy and iron deficiency are the two most common causes of anemia during pregnancy; these two conditions account for the vast majority of low hemoglobin concentrations during pregnancy. However, other potential causes of anemia should not be overlooked [

         Physiologic changes during pregnancy result in dilutional anemia despite an overall increase in red blood cell (RBC) mass. Plasma volume increases by 10 to 15 percent at 6 to 12 weeks of gestation, expands rapidly until 30 to 34 weeks, and then plateaus or decreases slightly to term. The total gain at term averages 1100 to 1600 mL and results in a total plasma volume of 4700 to 5200 mL, which is 40 to 50 percent above that prior to pregnancy [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The RBC mass also increases, but to a lesser extent (approximately 15 to 25 percent). Typically, these changes result in mild anemia (hemoglobin 10 to 11 g/dL), but there is no specific hemoglobin value that can be used to distinguish physiologic dilutional anemia from other causes of anemia. Additional details of the mechanisms and timing of physiologic anemia of pregnancy are discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/429.html" rel="external">

         Iron deficiency is very common in reproductive-age females, even if never pregnant. Results of case series in a number of countries dating back several decades continue to show that iron deficiency is a widespread phenomenon. As examples:

         Blood loss from previous pregnancies and/or menstruation, as well as a short interpartum interval, may lead to iron deficiency or borderline iron stores.

         Available guidelines are mixed in their recommendations for routine screening for iron deficiency in non-anemic pregnant individuals at average risk of iron deficiency. However, there is a concern that limiting testing to those with anemia has the potential to miss a substantial percentage of iron-deficient gravidas and deprive them of a straightforward therapy (iron replacement) that is potentially beneficial to both the mother and the child and is not harmful [

          Risk of iron deficiency
         </strong>
         – Data from studies using iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation [TSAT], or both) suggest that approximately 50 percent of pregnant individuals have iron deficiency.

         In a 2021 retrospective study of 44,552 pregnant individuals who underwent prenatal testing over a five-year period, ferritin was checked in 59 percent, most during the first trimester [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. Ferritin was low (&lt;30 ng/mL) in approximately 53 percent, borderline (30 to 44 ng/mL) in approximately 25 percent, normal in approximately 45 percent, and above the reference range in approximately 4 percent. Severe iron deficiency (ferritin &lt;15 ng/mL) was seen in 24 percent. A baseline CBC was only done in three-fourths of the patients. Of those who had hemoglobin tested, 8 percent had anemia (defined as hemoglobin &lt;10.5 g/dL), and only one-fourth of those with anemia had a ferritin test. Individuals of lower household income were less likely to be screened for iron deficiency than those with higher household income, suggesting disparities in health care delivery.

         Individuals with iron deficiency may be at risk for progressing to iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy, when the demand for iron increases. Treatment of iron deficiency that is initiated after diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia may be too late to prevent some adverse outcomes. Correction of iron deficiency before the third trimester is ideal, as iron-dependent neurogenesis is maximal during the third trimester and early neonatal life, and iron deficiency during this period has been associated with deficits in neurocognitive development [

         A ferritin level is generally sufficient for screening for iron deficiency. However, some individuals with iron deficiency may have a serum ferritin in the normal range and may require testing of the transferrin saturation (TSAT) to diagnose iron deficiency. Based on data from a study in which healthy females in the general population were screened, it may be prudent to add a TSAT to the serum ferritin test [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33

         Anemic individuals also experienced additional complications (postpartum hemorrhage, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, infections). Neonates born to anemic mothers had higher rates of fetal distress and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. Rates of preterm delivery and birth weight &lt;2500 grams and small-for-gestational-age infants were not increased. It could not be determined whether antepartum anemia was the major contributor to SMM or whether these patients had additional unidentified risk factors leading to SMM.

         A cohort study from Sweden involving &gt;500,000 children born between 2010 and 2016 found that maternal anemia was associated with increased risks of autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability in pregnancies when the anemia was identified in the first 30 weeks of pregnancy as compared with maternal anemia identified after 30 weeks or no maternal anemia (odds ratios [ORs], 1.4 to 2.2) [

Iron deficiency is often seen in those with other nutrient deficiencies and/or with socioeconomic disadvantages, making it difficult to sort out what cognitive deficits are attributable to iron deficiency. Whether developmental deficits in children are independently related to ferritin levels at birth and whether they would persist if iron deficiency is corrected in infancy have not been definitively established.

         Gravidas with anemia are tested for likely causes. The details of the evaluation will depend on the clinical history, red blood cell (RBC) indices, and other findings on the complete blood count (CBC). Physiologic anemia of pregnancy is a diagnosis of exclusion; thus, other causes of anemia must be eliminated before anemia is attributed to normal pregnancy physiology. (See

         All gravidas with anemia or symptoms of anemia (restless legs syndrome, pica) should have prompt testing for iron deficiency because iron deficiency can progress to anemia; iron deficiency is the most common pathologic cause of anemia in pregnancy. Microcytosis may be present, but microcytosis is a late finding of iron deficiency  (

          table 2
         </a>
         ) and may also be caused by thalassemia; the absence of microcytosis does not eliminate the possibility of iron deficiency and the presence of microcytosis does not confirm it. (See

         When testing for iron deficiency, most gravidas without comorbidities can be tested with a serum ferritin alone [

         A 2019 United Kingdom guideline suggests immediate treatment and assessment of response in two to three weeks (a therapeutic trial), which has the potential advantage of avoiding the costs of other testing and additional visits [

         Borderline serum ferritin (30 to 40 ng/mL) can occur with active inflammation from chronic illnesses such as diabetes, or up to 100 ng/mL with chronic kidney disease or from collagen vascular diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. This occurs because ferritin is an acute phase reactant. Some pregnancies have evidence of an acute phase response even in the absence of one of these chronic illnesses [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67,68
         </a>
         ]. Thus, borderline ferritin levels should prompt testing of a full set of iron studies including ferritin, serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and calculation of transferrin saturation (TSAT). We consider a TSAT below 20 percent to be evidence of iron deficiency whether the ferritin level is low or normal; this practice is consistent with other sources, which cite values below 16 percent without inflammation and below 20 percent with inflammation [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65,69,70
         </a>
         ]. The rationale is that a normal ferritin level may represent elevation due to inflammation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Iron supplements can falsely elevate the TSAT (appearing to be normal when it is actually low) by raising the serum iron level, an effect that peaks at approximately four hours after an oral dose. To avoid this test interference, iron parameters should be drawn after an overnight fast, or the woman should simply be advised to avoid iron-containing foods or supplements to mitigate otherwise falsely elevated TSAT values. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7150.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) noted that serum ferritin may have limited use during late pregnancy because its concentration often decreases with advancing gestational age as maternal iron stores are used to supply iron to the placental and fetal circulations  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116876" href="/z/d/graphic/116876.html" rel="external">
          figure 1

         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>

         We provide supplemental oral iron 27 to 30 mg daily throughout pregnancy to all pregnant individuals to compensate for the increased iron demands during pregnancy; this is considered "low dose" supplementation and corresponds to the amount of iron in most iron-containing prenatal vitamins. This practice is in agreement with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,19

         For those who are intolerant of the iron in prenatal vitamins, it may be possible to take prenatal vitamins without iron and to supplement with oral iron supplements on an every-other-day basis (typical dose, 60 mg once every other day or 60 mg once daily on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). The rationale for alternate-day dosing (improved absorption due to effects on hepcidin and reduced gastrointestinal adverse effects) is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7148.html" rel="external">

         A 55 kg female requires approximately one gram of additional iron from conception to delivery  (

          figure 1
         </a>
         ), which includes 300 to 350 mg for the fetus and placenta, 500 mg for the expansion of the maternal red blood cell (RBC) mass, and 250 mg associated with blood loss during labor and delivery [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65
         </a>
         ]. Supplementation exceeds this one gram requirement because only a small portion of ingested iron is absorbed, and the increase in the portion absorbed does not match the increase in iron requirements [

         Despite the increase in iron requirements during pregnancy, high-quality evidence that routine iron supplementation improves health outcomes and quality of life has been challenging to obtain. The 2015 review of evidence dating back to 1996 from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded that "there is insufficient evidence that routine prenatal supplementation for iron deficiency anemia improves maternal or infant clinical health outcomes, but supplementation may improve maternal hematologic indices" [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. A 2015 Cochrane review came to similar conclusions, stating that "supplementation reduces the risk of maternal anaemia and iron deficiency in pregnancy, but the positive effect on other maternal and infant outcomes is less clear" [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71

         The standard treatment for uncomplicated iron deficiency (regardless of hemoglobin level) is administration of iron at doses higher than found in prenatal vitamins. The choice between oral and intravenous iron depends on a number of factors, as discussed below. (See

         Antenatal maternal treatment with iron results in an increase in the hemoglobin level in approximately two weeks (the time it takes to create new RBCs in the bone marrow). (See

         For gravidas with severe anemia for whom this two-week delay would be expected to result in significant morbidity, transfusion and/or referral to a specialist (eg, hematologist) may be appropriate [

We give intravenous iron to gravidas beyond the first trimester who cannot tolerate oral iron; those who have severe anemia, especially later in the pregnancy; and those for whom oral iron does not effectively increase the hemoglobin and/or ferritin levels.

         <a href="#rid72">
          72-74
         </a>
         ]. These analyses found that iron supplementation by either route (oral or intravenous) increased the hemoglobin and ferritin levels; compared with oral iron, intravenous iron was associated with a higher hemoglobin level following therapy (at four weeks, upon admission to the labor and delivery service, or at the six-week postpartum check). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Postpartum'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In one of the meta-analyses, the magnitude of the antepartum hemoglobin increase was modest (weighted mean difference [WMD] at admission to labor and delivery, 0.66 g/dL, 95% CI 0.31-1.02) [
         <a href="#rid73">
          73
         </a>
         ]. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were not significantly different (rates of maternal blood transfusion or cesarean delivery), but intravenous iron was associated with higher neonatal birth weight (WMD 69 grams, 95% CI 12-127 grams) and higher neonatal ferritin levels (WMD, 21 ng/mL, 95% CI 6-37 ng/mL) [
         <a href="#rid73">
          73
         </a>
         ]. All of the analyses found that adverse effects were less frequent with intravenous iron.

         In a 2023 open-label randomized trial including 862 pregnant individuals in Malawi with hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL, intravenous iron (single dose

         , 20 mg/kg up to 1000 mg) at a median gestational age of 22 weeks modestly reduced the prevalence of anemia at four weeks post-treatment (77 versus 84 percent), 36 weeks of gestation (52 versus 57 percent), at delivery (27 versus 31 percent), and at four weeks postpartum (46 versus 54 percent) compared with standard care with oral iron (

         , 60 mg twice daily for 90 days), although the differences in prevalence were not statistically significant at all time points [
         <a href="#rid75">
          75
         </a>
         ]. Rates of iron deficiency based on serum ferritin were substantially lower in the intravenous iron group at all time points (at four weeks after treatment, &lt;1 percent versus 26 percent; at 36 weeks, 18 versus 42 percent; at four weeks postpartum, 12 versus 29 percent). Infant weights and rates of premature birth and pregnancy loss were not different between groups. Many participants did not have iron deficiency at baseline and many remained anemic after treatment, highlighting the multifactorial causes of anemia in pregnancy. (See
         <a class="local">

        <p>
         A protocol for screening and management may help in the decision to start with oral or intravenous iron. One such protocol screened for iron deficiency in the second and third trimesters and treated with oral iron for hemoglobin 9.5 to 11 g/dL or intravenous iron for hemoglobin &lt;9.5 g/dL [
         <a href="#rid76">
          76
         </a>
         ]. Use of the protocol resulted in higher hemoglobin at delivery but did not produce a statistically significant reduction blood product use.

         For most individuals with iron deficiency, especially those diagnosed in the first trimester, we treat with oral iron. Oral iron is safe, inexpensive, readily available, and, when tolerated, effective.

         (FS) is the most commonly prescribed oral formulation. Up to 70 percent of those to whom it is prescribed report significant gastrointestinal perturbation, and two meta-analyses of oral iron therapy in pregnancy report that the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects is unacceptably high [

          77-79

          Dosing
         </strong>
         – Recommended doses of oral iron range from 40 to 200 mg elemental iron per day [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,80
         </a>
         ]. There has been a trend towards using doses on the lower end of this range as well as alternate day dosing due to recognition that higher and more frequent doses may increase adverse effects without improving iron uptake [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. We agree with this dose range and often administer 60 mg of elemental iron. Standard oral iron formulations and their elemental iron content are listed in the table  (

          table 4
         </a>
         ). However, we provide the dose every other day (or, on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) rather than daily, based on evidence that alternate-day dosing results in improved absorption of oral iron as well as improved tolerability. Compared with more frequent dosing (such as once daily or three times per day), alternate-day dosing improves iron absorption and reduces gastrointestinal adverse effects in nonpregnant individuals [

          Adverse effects
         </strong>
         – While oral iron is inexpensive, available, and easy to use when tolerated, it may be associated with gastrointestinal side effects including metallic taste, gastric irritation, nausea, diarrhea, and/or constipation; the latter is exacerbated by high progesterone levels, which slow bowel transit, and the enlarging gravid uterus pressing posteriorly on the rectum. A meta-analysis of 43 randomized trials comparing oral iron with intravenous iron or placebo in adults reported that as many as 70 percent of those to whom oral iron was prescribed experienced significant gastrointestinal perturbation with resultant decreased adherence to therapy [
         <a href="#rid77">
          77
         </a>
         ]. A subgroup analysis of seven trials in pregnant individuals showed a statistically significant increase in gastrointestinal side effects with oral iron (odds ratio [OR] 3.3, 95% CI 1.2-9.2). Two additional studies of adherence and side effects with oral iron concluded the incidence of adverse events was unacceptably high [
         <a href="#rid78">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Options to improve tolerability include extending the interval between doses, switching to a liquid that can be more easily titrated, or switching to intravenous iron (if in the second or third trimester) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2

         We do not use enteric-coated or timed-release formulations (Ferro-Sequels, Slow-Fe). While some of these formulations may be better tolerated, modifications to the iron or coatings intended to result in timed release or protect against gastric irritation have the potential to reduce absorption in the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum, impairing treatment benefit. As a result, these formulations should be avoided [

         Oral iron is likely to be ineffective in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis) due to worsening of gastrointestinal symptoms, reduced absorption, and a possible effect on bowel flora. For those who have undergone bariatric surgery (with either Roux-en-Y bypass or biliopancreatic procedures), oral iron cannot be exposed to gastric acid from the stomach, which is required to protect it from alkaline pancreatic secretions; as a result, the iron will be converted to ferric hydroxide (rust), which cannot be absorbed (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7148.html" rel="external">
          "Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults", section on 'Following gastrointestinal/bariatric surgery'
         </a>
         ). Thus, we use intravenous iron in these populations. Some patients, especially those having undergone minimally invasive procedures such as gastric banding, may tolerate oral iron. However, multiple gastrointestinal perturbations are often present in this population, and intravenous iron may simplify care. (See

         We use intravenous iron if there is intolerance of oral iron; severe anemia, especially later in the pregnancy; and if oral iron is not effective in raising the hemoglobin and/or ferritin level [

         Intravenous iron is not used during the first trimester, as there are no safety data for first-trimester use. However, we consider it to be safe and effective during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, with a much lower frequency of adverse effects than oral iron and a negligibly low frequency of serious adverse effects (SAEs). As described above, meta-analyses report better efficacy and fewer adverse effects with intravenous compared with oral iron. (See

          Indications
         </strong>
         – For individuals with iron deficiency and/or iron deficiency anemia (especially if severe or symptomatic) who do not tolerate oral iron (or those who do not have the expected increase in hemoglobin level with oral iron, which suggests impaired absorption and/or impaired adherence with therapy), intravenous iron is the optimal route of administration, as it can fully correct the deficiency in a single administration  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106130" href="/z/d/graphic/106130.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Intravenous iron is not given during the first trimester but can be started after 13 to 14 weeks [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65
         </a>
         ]. For those for whom intravenous iron is not available, additional strategies for improving absorption and tolerability are discussed separately. (See

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Intravenous iron may also be appropriate for individuals in the second or third trimester for whom there would be insufficient time to replete iron orally (after week 30), as well as those with anatomic abnormalities such as history of bariatric surgery or other conditions that interfere with oral iron absorption (eg, IBD) [
         <a href="#rid82">
          82
         </a>
         ]. Gastric surgeries most likely to impair iron absorption include gastric resection, Roux-en-Y, biliopancreatic diversion, or similar procedures. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Intravenous iron is likely to be superior to oral iron in promoting rapid correction of anemia and iron deficiency, which may become more important as the pregnancy progresses, and to ensure iron sufficiency in the developing fetus. In a study of gravidas treated with intravenous iron, none of the newborns were diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia [

          66
         </a>
         ]. We believe the reluctance of many clinicians to use intravenous iron is based on fears of serious hypersensitivity reactions leading to anaphylaxis that were reported with formulations that are no longer clinically available, as well as a lack of clear guidance across different countries; the concerns about anaphylaxis are not supported by evidence that reflects use of intravenous iron after HMWID was removed from markets.

          Safety and efficacy

         – As noted above, we believe the reluctance of many clinicians to use intravenous iron is based on experience with a product (HMWID) that is no longer available. Evidence for products that are currently available includes the following:

         A 2022 trial that randomly assigned 278 pregnant individuals to receive FCM at a dose of 500 mg or 1000 mg found that the 500 mg dose led to greater likelihood of needing a repeat infusion (36 percent, versus 8 percent in the 1000 mg group at four weeks) due to inadequate increase in iron stores [

         A 2018 open-label trial randomly assigned 246 pregnant individuals with iron deficiency anemia, mostly in the third trimester of pregnancy, to be treated with intravenous iron (FCM or iron polymaltose [IPM], given as a single-dose infusion) or oral iron (

The mean increase in hemoglobin level was greater in both intravenous iron groups than the oral iron group at four weeks (approximately 0.9 g/dL for intravenous iron versus approximately 0.5 g/dL for oral iron) and at predelivery (1.5 g/dL for intravenous iron versus 1 g/dL for oral iron). There were no serious adverse events. No transfusions were used in the intravenous iron groups; two participants in the oral iron group received transfusions (not statistically significant). One-half of the oral iron recipients reported gastrointestinal side effects, and one-third did not adhere to oral iron therapy. Including all costs, intravenous iron was reported to be less expensive than oral iron. As noted above, FCM has been reported to cause hypophosphatemia in nonpregnant individuals; phosphate levels were not measured in the trial.

         In a 2017 trial, 252 pregnant individuals with iron deficiency anemia in gestational weeks 16 to 33 were randomly assigned to receive intravenous iron or oral iron (FCM, 1000 to 1500 mg intravenously in one or two doses, or FS, 100 mg orally twice daily for 12 weeks) [
         <a href="#rid88">
          88
         </a>
         ]. Those in the FCM group were more likely to have correction of anemia (84 versus 70 percent; OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.07-3.97) and to have a faster correction of anemia (median 3.4 versus 4.3 weeks). Most adverse events were mild. One serious treatment-associated adverse event (bronchospasm) occurred in the FCM group, which resolved without sequelae. Oral iron was discontinued in seven of the participants in the FS arm. All newborns were healthy (Apgar score of 10 by 10 minutes). Other randomized trials comparing intravenous and oral iron, trials comparing different intravenous iron products, or studies reporting on administration of other intravenous iron products, have reported similar findings, leading us to conclude that intravenous iron is effective and safe during pregnancy, with virtually no serious adverse events [

         Data from a 2015 meta-analysis that included over 10,000 patients (not restricted to pregnancy) also suggested that intravenous iron is safe (relative risk [RR] of SAEs versus other comparators [placebo, oral iron, intramuscular iron [which should be avoided], or no iron] 1.04, 95% CI 0.93-1.17) [

         A 2023 observational study erroneously concluded that intravenous iron was associated with worse outcomes; however, as suggested by the authors, use of intravenous iron was likely a marker for greater baseline risk rather than a causative relationship [

          109
         </a>
         ]. Many of the patients receiving intravenous iron did not receive the prescribed dose; when stratified by adequate treatment, there was no adverse impact on outcomes. Such observational results demonstrate the pitfalls of using retrospective, inadequately stratified data.

         The expected response to iron repletion is improvement in RBC production, which typically begins with reticulocytosis after approximately one week, an increase in the hemoglobin level of at least 1 g/dL within two to three weeks, and an increase in serum ferritin into the normal range, typically within three weeks [
         <a href="#rid90">
          90,105
         </a>
         ]. The response is similar with oral or intravenous administration and mostly depends on the time it takes to incorporate iron into RBC precursors and their maturation to mature, circulating RBCs. Potential reasons for a lack of response include non-adherence, reduced absorption, ongoing bleeding, or a cause of anemia other than iron deficiency [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7148.html" rel="external">
          "Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults", section on 'Approaches to lack of response'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For antepartum patients receiving oral iron, we typically check the hemoglobin level and reticulocyte count two to three weeks after starting therapy and review tolerability of the oral iron. If the expected response has occurred and the oral iron is well tolerated, it is continued throughout the pregnancy and into the postpartum period (see
         <a class="local">
          'Postpartum'
         </a>
         below). If the oral iron is not well tolerated and/or the expected increase in hemoglobin level has not occurred, options include making changes to improve tolerability (appropriate if anemia is mild) or changing to intravenous iron beginning in the second trimester. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Intravenous iron'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         For antepartum patients receiving intravenous iron, we generally obtain repeat iron parameters four to eight weeks after the iron has been administered. We wait a minimum of four weeks because intravenous iron interferes with most assays of iron status [
         <a href="#rid110">
          110
         </a>
         ]. As noted in the 2019 United Kingdom Guideline, it may be reasonable to monitor an increase in hemoglobin level without rechecking iron parameters [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>

         Patients also undergo repeat complete blood count (CBC) testing at 24 to 28 weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once the hemoglobin has reached the normal range, oral iron replacement should continue for three months and until at least six weeks postpartum [

         Postpartum management is largely based on expert opinion and clinical experience; there are few major randomized trials to guide screening for anemia or iron deficiency after delivery. It is not routine practice to obtain a complete blood count (CBC) or ferritin level at a four- to six-week postpartum visit, but there may be circumstances in which one or both of these tests are appropriate.

         Iron repletion is effective by either the oral or the intravenous route, with intravenous iron (administered as a total dose infusion in one hour) producing higher hemoglobin concentration postpartum compared with oral iron. In a small randomized trial (40 patients), intravenous and oral iron both increased the hemoglobin and ferritin postpartum; the improvement at six weeks was greater in the intravenous arm [
         <a href="#rid111">
          111
         </a>
         ]. Intravenous iron has also been used following postpartum hemorrhage. (See

          'Oral versus IV iron'

         Studies evaluating the prevalence of postpartum anemia have found it to be common (range, 22 to 29 percent; as high as 35 to 60 percent in some populations, such as those with instrumental delivery, manual removal of the placenta, or third- or fourth-degree vaginal tear) [
         <a href="#rid112">
          112,113
         </a>
         ]. These patient and delivery characteristics do not have a high predictive value for anemia; however, they may be useful if present. If anemia is caused by hemodilution due to pregnancy physiology or by blood loss without iron deficiency, it is likely to resolve within a few weeks.

         We advise most individuals to continue their prenatal vitamin and/or supplemental iron for six to eight weeks following delivery, to increase iron stores following blood loss after delivery.

         Routine testing for anemia after delivery has been suggested because anemia is prevalent and iron deficiency (the most common cause) is readily treatable [
         <a href="#rid113">
          113
         </a>
         ]. It seems reasonable that a person should be iron replete following pregnancy so that they do not develop iron deficiency anemia in the future; however, high-quality data or guidelines on this subject are lacking. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Screening for anemia and iron deficiency'

         Following postpartum discharge from the hospital, anemia may be suspected based on symptoms such as fatigue, depressed mood, or exercise intolerance, although these symptoms may have other causes associated with delivery and/or caring for a newborn. Anemia also may be suspected because of uncorrected anemia during the antenatal period, significant blood loss during delivery (eg, &gt;500 mL), pallor, or ongoing lochia (vaginal bleeding after the birth). Laboratory testing such as a CBC to evaluate for anemia is pursued on a case-by-case basis. Anemia, if present, should be further evaluated with testing for iron deficiency and/or other causes, depending on the patient history, red blood cell (RBC) indices, and other findings on the CBC.

         Those with iron deficiency anemia postpartum are treated with iron; choice of iron product, route of administration, and dosing are the same as in the antepartum period. (See

         For individuals who begin iron therapy before hospital discharge because of postpartum anemia, it is reasonable to check the ferritin level and percent transferrin saturation (TSAT) after two to three weeks to confirm that treatment has been successful and that iron stores have been repleted [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,66,114
         </a>
         ]. This may be done at the postpartum visit or primary care visit. With intravenous iron, the serum ferritin will be abnormal for approximately four weeks, and ferritin testing should be delayed for four weeks. If the ferritin level remains low following treatment, the potential causes must be evaluated. These may include nonadherence, reduced absorption, or ongoing blood loss. The approach to correcting the persistent deficiency depends on the cause. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7148.html" rel="external">

         Individuals with persistent, unexplained anemia should be reevaluated for iron deficiency and/or other causes of anemia. The evaluation is determined by the characteristics of the anemia (eg, RBC indices, reticulocyte count) and the patient's clinical status (eg, blood loss, dietary practices, presence of other chronic conditions).

          Definition
         </strong>
         – The World Health Organization (WHO) defines anemia as a hemoglobin level &lt;11 g/dL (approximately equivalent to a hematocrit &lt;33 percent) in the first trimester, &lt;10.5 g/dL in the second trimester, &lt;10.5 to 11 g/dL in the third trimester, or &lt;10 g/dL postpartum. (See

          Prevalence
         </strong>
         – Anemia affects approximately 30 percent of reproductive-age females and 40 percent of pregnant individuals, mostly due to iron deficiency. A large number of individuals have iron deficiency without anemia that may progress during pregnancy. Anemia and iron deficiency are more common in Black individuals and contribute substantially to severe maternal morbidity. (See

          Causes

         – Physiologic anemia of pregnancy and iron deficiency are the two most common causes of anemia in pregnancy. Other causes of anemia should not be overlooked. (See

         We evaluate all anemic individuals for iron deficiency, consistent with several guidelines. Evaluation for other causes of anemia may also be appropriate for those with an atypical clinical picture and other abnormal CBC findings (eg, signs of hemolysis, abnormal white blood cell [WBC] or platelet count).

         We screen all pregnant individuals for iron deficiency, especially those with symptoms of iron deficiency (restless legs syndrome, pica) and those at high risk for iron deficiency. (See

         Our approach is based on evidence that approximately 50 percent of pregnant individuals have iron deficiency. While guidelines remain mixed, a newer statement from the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and evidence of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes associated with anemia support this approach.

         Iron deficiency can usually be assessed with a ferritin level; selected individuals may require transferrin saturation (TSAT) or other testing. Ferritin &lt;30 ng/mL (&lt;30 mcg/L) or TSAT &lt;20 percent is sufficient to diagnose iron deficiency. Ferritin ≥30 ng/mL is sufficient to exclude iron deficiency if there are no comorbidities. (See
