The role of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI; also known as transcatheter AVR or TAVR) as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is evolving. Through both rapidly increasing clinical experience and progressive improvement in TAVI devices (eg, lower profile systems to reduce vascular complications), TAVI outcomes have improved. Ongoing studies continue to scrutinize the risks of TAVI complications and continuing efforts seek to minimize these risks.</p><p>Complications of TAVI will be considered in this topic commencing with immediate or periprocedural complications, which are usually apparent during or shortly after the procedure and moving to longer-term considerations. This topic will deal with periprocedural complications related to vascular access (including injury at the arterial access site, arterial tree trauma, and problems with vascular closure), valve deployment (including improper positioning, coronary compromise and annular rupture), valve function (including paravalvular leak), organ injury (including stroke, myocardial ischemia/injury, and acute kidney injury), and arrhythmic complications (including high degree heart block and atrial fibrillation) and late complications including aortic regurgitation and prosthetic valve thrombosis.</p><p>Indications, clinical outcomes, and procedural management for TAVI are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83110.html" rel="external">"Choice of intervention for severe calcific aortic stenosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/108265.html" rel="external">"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Periprocedural and postprocedural management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2248760276"><span class="h1">PERIPROCEDURAL COMPLICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Procedural complications include vascular issues (access-related iliofemoral and aortic complications), ventricular wall perforation (free wall or septal), valvular complications (annular rupture, valve malpositioning, mitral dysfunction, and paravalvular aortic regurgitation), arrhythmias (eg, conduction abnormalities and atrial fibrillation), coronary artery occlusion, myocardial infarction (MI), cerebrovascular accident, and death.</p><p>Complications that may occur or be detected after the procedure include acute kidney injury, high degree atrioventricular block requiring pacemaker implantation, myocardial injury, vascular (access-site or aortic) complications that went unrecognized during the procedure, tamponade after removal of temporary wire, valve migration or embolization, mitral valve dysfunction, and death.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1965846411"><span class="h2">Mortality</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Various registries using different transcatheter heart valves (THV) have reported periprocedural mortality for TAVI ranging from 1.1 to 4.2 percent. In the PARTNER 1 trial [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], 30-day mortality was reported at 3.4 percent, whereas a similar figure (3.9 percent) was seen in patients at intermediate risk from the PARTNER IIA trial [<a href="#rid2">2</a>] and 2.2 percent in the SURTAVI trial [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In the large SAPIEN 3 registry, 30-day mortality was only 1.1 percent. The LOTUS cohort reported slightly higher periprocedural mortality at 4.2 percent, whereas the ACURATE neo reported a 3.3 percent mortality in 30 days [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In the STS-ACC-TVT registry, 30-day all-cause mortality during 2019 (72,991 TAVI procedures) was 2.9 percent [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>Comparisons of mortality rates with TAVI for patients with bicuspid aortic stenosis (AS) and tricuspid AS are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129707.html" rel="external">"Bicuspid aortic valve: Intervention for valve disease or aortopathy in adults", section on 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation'</a>.)</p><p>Even though conversion to open heart surgery due to TAVI complications is rare (1.4 percent) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], it should be noted that overall mortality for cases that undergo emergency surgery due to cardiovascular complications carry a very poor prognosis: 45.8 percent mortality at 30 days [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Reduction of the mortality risk of TAVI requires a multifactorial and multidisciplinary approach by an effective heart valve team for appropriate case selection, careful procedural planning including choice of suitable access route, technique and appropriate TAVI valve type and size, effective operator training and experience, meticulous attention to vascular closure, and judicious aftercare including appropriate rehabilitative measures and drug therapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1037080415"><span class="h2">Access/vascular complications</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H982205698"><span class="h3">Bleeding and access-related complications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Early and late (30 or more days post-procedure) bleeding complications are not infrequent after TAVI [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Much of the bleeding risk is access related.</p><p>Bleeding and other access-related complications may be detected during or following the procedure. The vast majority of TAVI procedures are performed via the transfemoral route [<a href="#rid9">9</a>], and most of the data on complications is for transfemoral access.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H985584969"><span class="h4">Risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Reported major bleeding rates at 30 days after TAVI have ranged from 17 to 24 percent in extreme-risk cohorts to 11 percent for high-risk cohorts to 7 to 10 percent in international registries [<a href="#rid10">10-12</a>]. In the TVT registry [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], major bleeding rates were on a decline from 5.5 percent in 2012/2013 to 4.2 percent in 2014 and 2.93 percent in 2019 [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. A similar pattern was seen with regard to life-threatening bleeding, which reduced from 6.3 percent before 2013 to 1.79 percent in 2019 [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. In the large SAPIEN 3 registry, 30-day life-threatening or disabling bleeding was reported at 4.6 percent [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Bleeding early after TAVI is a risk factor for mortality at 30 days and at one to two years [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>In a multicenter transfemoral TAVI registry from 2012, percutaneous access and closure was performed in 803 patients (81 percent) and a surgical strategy in 183 (19 percent) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Incidence of major vascular complications, life-threatening/disabling bleeding, and major bleeding was 14.2, 11, and 17.8 percent, respectively. In the patient cohort with a completely percutaneous access strategy, major vascular complications and life-threatening/disabling bleedings were related to closure device failure in 64 and 29 percent, respectively.</p><p>Results from 1078 intermediate-risk patients enrolled in the SAPIEN 3 observational study show a significant reduction in the incidence of major vascular complications (6.1 percent) and life-threatening or disabling bleeding (4.6 percent), which is partially due to the decreasing size of the delivery system sheaths and accumulating operator experience. In the TVT registry [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>], the rate of any vascular complications decreased from 5.6 percent in 2012/2013 to 4.2 percent in 2014 and 1.55 percent in 2019.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1179383309"><span class="h4">Risk factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Risk factors for access-related or vascular complications include sheath-to-artery ratio, presence of circumferential calcification, severe tortuosity, and percutaneous preclosure device failure. In the multicenter registry study cited above, female sex, use of &gt;19F system, peripheral arterial disease, and early stages of the learning curve were independent predictors for major or life-threatening/disabling bleeding [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Mechanical factors that may contribute to the risk of bleeding include the use of large delivery catheters with associated high risk of major vascular complications, which may cause bleeding [<a href="#rid12">12</a>], and the transapical approach with associated risk of myocardial tears [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. While the first systems required 24 to 26F inner diameter sheaths, new generation TAVI devices with 14F inner diameter are now available. These technological advances, alongside accumulating operator experience, explain the dramatic reduction in major vascular complications from 11 to 14 percent in early studies [<a href="#rid1">1,13</a>] to 4 to 6 percent in large registries [<a href="#rid6">6,14</a>].</p><p>However, some patients receiving post-procedural blood transfusions have bleeding from sites not related to the procedure or no apparent source of bleeding.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4180678007"><span class="h4">Prevention and management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The optimal choice of percutaneous closure device is controversial and new devices are under development. Many devices can achieve adequate hemostasis; however, appropriate device selection is important according to the access site anatomy, device caliber, and individual operator experience. At the end of the procedure, contralateral control peripheral angiography to confirm hemostasis is recommended, allowing early intervention for complications.</p><p>The majority of bleeding/vascular access complications can be managed percutaneously. For this purpose, it is important to ensure continuous access to the punctured artery. This can be provided either by retrograde access from the contralateral side (often called cross-over) or by maintaining antegrade access with a wire following sheath removal. These options allow for placement of an occlusion balloon or a covered stent (self-expanding nitinol stent graft) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>A large propensity-matched study compared the incidence of major vascular complications in 944 TAVI patients (472 matched pairs) whose access was sealed percutaneously using Prostar-XL or Perclose ProGlide, the two most frequently used closure devices. Prostar was associated with higher rates of Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC) major vascular complications (7.4 versus 1.9 percent) and higher rates of major bleeding (16.7 versus 3.2 percent) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The SAFE MANTA IDE clinical trial, the first pivotal trial for a dedicated large-bore closure device using a novel collagen-based technology, reported VARC-2 major bleeding in 4.2 percent of patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3791756062"><span class="h3">Transapical tear/rupture</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Severe access complications during transapical procedures are rare albeit challenging to manage surgically. The large SOURCE registry [<a href="#rid17">17</a>] summarizing 1394 transapical cases reported only five (0.4 percent) cases, whereas a similar rate (0.8 percent) was reported in the Italian transapical registry [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2493897261"><span class="h3">Aortic dissection/perforation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Aortic dissection/perforation occurs infrequently (0.2 percent) during the TAVI procedure [<a href="#rid9">9</a>] and can be caused by guidewire/delivery system manipulations, valve repositioning, retrieval, or retraction, frequently in the setting of suboptimal aortic measurements/visualization. Aortic dissection accounts for 8.9 percent of cases converting to open heart surgery [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. The diagnosis and treatment of aortic dissection is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8190.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8188.html" rel="external">"Management of acute type B aortic dissection"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8178.html" rel="external">"Overview of acute aortic dissection and other acute aortic syndromes"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1132295077"><span class="h2">Ventricular perforation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, ventricular perforation occurs in 1 percent of TAVI cases [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Right ventricular perforation is not an infrequent occurrence when a non-soft-tip active fixation temporary pacing wire is used and left in situ for 48 hours. In an early series, this complication accounted for 52.9 percent of cardiac tamponade cases post-TAVI [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>Left ventricular rupture occurs rarely (eg, 0.27 percent of TAVI cases) and accounts for 18.9 percent of cases requiring emergency open-heart surgery [<a href="#rid6">6</a>] and 23.5 percent of post-TAVI tamponade cases [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. This complication can be reduced by use of pre-shaped TAVI specific guidewires. Ventricular septal defects have also been reported post-TAVI, particularly with balloon expandable valves [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Their location is most often at the membranous or perimembranous part of the septum (79 percent) adjacent to the valve landing zone. When causing symptoms or significant RV overload, these should be treated percutaneously where possible.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H374201084"><span class="h2">Valve-related complications</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1206440559"><span class="h3">Annular rupture</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Aortic annular rupture is a rare (eg, 0.4 percent) life-threatening complication of TAVI [<a href="#rid9">9,21-24</a>]. It involves injury of the aortic root or left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) may occur during balloon dilation of the native aortic valve, prosthetic valve deployment, or valve postdilatation for paravalvular regurgitation. Four types of annular rupture have been identified, including intra-annular, subannular, supra-annular, and combined. Risk factors include smaller annular size or sinotubular junction, bulky calcification of either valve leaflets or annulus, calcium in the LVOT or sinotubular junction, heavily calcified bicuspid valve, severe asymmetric subaortic LV hypertrophy, implantation of a balloon-expandable device, and aggressive balloon pre- or post-dilation [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. It should be noted that annular rupture could also cause root hematoma and compress a coronary artery [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Management options range from emergent conversion to an open procedure with aortic root and valve replacement (accounting for 12.3 percent of all complications requiring conversion to open heart surgery [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]) to pericardial drainage and autotransfusion of small leaks to comfort care [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Annular rupture has not been reported with valve-in-valve procedures.</p><p>Meticulous valve sizing, scrutiny of calcium burden and location, and in particular avoiding oversized post-dilatation balloons can reduce the risk of this rare, yet potentially catastrophic complication.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2978950666"><span class="h3">Transcatheter heart valve malpositioning</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>THV malpositioning can often occur in the setting of inadequate ventricular pacing (eg, interrupted stimulation due to pacing lead dislocation) or inadequate visualization of destination morphology (eg, noncoaxial orientation of the prosthesis towards annulus-parallax).<strong> </strong>In the large TVT registry (n = 26,414) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], THV migration occurred in 0.3 percent, THV embolized in the left ventricle in 0.3 percent, embolized in the aorta in 0.3 percent, and was retrieved in 0.4 percent of cases. Overall, valve migration accounted for 25.2 percent of cases requiring emergency open-heart surgery. New generation recapturable and repositionable valves (eg, Evolut R/PRO, Portico) have reduced the incidence of these catastrophic complications, which would often end up requiring urgent surgical intervention or complex percutaneous maneuvers.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H908964498"><span class="h3">Aortic regurgitation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Post-TAVI aortic regurgitation includes paravalvular and central (valvular) jets. These conditions are discussed below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1387069568"><span class="h3">Mitral valve disruption</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the majority of patients, no significant changes occur in the degree of mitral regurgitation (MR) after TAVI [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. However, operators should be mindful not to disrupt the papillary muscles by ensuring optimal wire placement in the left ventricle. If a self-expanding valve is positioned low in the LVOT, a worsening in MR can be observed [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. The potential for worsening mitral stenosis after a deeply implanted TAVI valve should be sought in patients with heavy calcifications of the anterior mitral leaflet (eg, rheumatic valve).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H228193520"><span class="h2">Organ injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Complications of TAVI include brain injury, kidney injury and myocardial injury.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3105206299"><span class="h3">Stroke and subclinical brain injury</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1866335037"><span class="h4">Rates</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The reported 30-day risk of stroke following TAVI in observational studies and clinical trials is 2 to 5 percent [<a href="#rid21">21,27,28</a>]. In a registry study of 176,316 patients undergoing TAVI during 2011 to 2019, the overall in-hospital stroke rate decreased slightly from 2.1 percent in the early part of the study period to 1.6 percent in 2019 [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Symptoms and signs of stroke are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1126.html" rel="external">"Initial assessment and management of acute stroke"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1123.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of transient ischemic attack and minor ischemic stroke"</a>.)</p><p>Comparisons of stroke rates with TAVI for patients with bicuspid aortic stenosis (AS) and tricuspid AS are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129707.html" rel="external">"Bicuspid aortic valve: Intervention for valve disease or aortopathy in adults", section on 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation'</a>.)</p><p>In a meta-analysis of 25 multicenter registries and 33 single-center studies [<a href="#rid29">29</a>], the pooled 30-day post-TAVI stroke rates between the transfemoral and transaortic approach were similar, estimated at 2.8 percent in multicentre studies. There was no difference in pooled 30-day stroke post-TAVI between the CoreValve and Edwards Valve in multicenter (2.4 [95% CI 1.9-3.2] versus 3 percent [95% CI 2.4-3.7]) and single-center studies (3.8 [95% CI 2.8-4.9] versus 3.2 percent [95% CI 2.4-4.3]). There was a decline in stroke risk with experience and technological advancement.</p><p>Data from the randomized cohort A of the PARTNER balloon-expandable TAVI trial in high risk patients showed that rates of strokes or transient ischemic attack were significantly higher after TAVI than after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) at 30 days (5.5 versus 2.4 percent) and at one year (8.7 versus 4.3 percent), and there was a borderline significant trend at two years (11.2 versus 6.5 percent, p = 0.05) [<a href="#rid1">1,30</a>].

This valve leaflet thickening and reduced leaflet motion, with reference to their CT appearance, have been referred to as hypoattenuating leaflet thickening (HALT) and the more severe hypoattenuation affecting motion (HAM), respectively.

The mean transprosthetic gradient in patients with VHD increased from 9.5±5 mmHg at hospital discharge to 26.1±11 mmHg at follow-up. Independent predictors of transcatheter valve VHD at follow-up included absence of anticoagulation at discharge, Valve-in-valve procedure, ≤23 mm THV size and increased body mass index. Marked increases in gradients on transthoracic echocardiography post-TAVI invariably imply the possibility of valve thrombosis necessitating empirical oral anticoagulation, which is often effective at reducing transprosthetic gradients [<a href="#rid72">72</a>].

Independent predictors of severe PPM included small (≤23 mm diameter) valve prosthesis, valve-in-valve procedure, larger body surface area, female sex, younger age, lower ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation, severe mitral or tricuspid regurgitation, and being from a non-White/Hispanic population. At one year, rates of mortality as well as HF rehospitalization were significantly higher in patients with severe PPM. Mortality at one year was 17.2, 15.6 and 15.9 percent of patients with severe, moderate, and no PPM, respectively.

Reported rates of early PVE have ranged from 0.3 to 3.4 percent per patient-year [<a href="#rid81">81-84</a>].

HF is common (occurring in one-third of patients in one multicenter series [<a href="#rid81">81</a>]). Concomitant mitral valve involvement is common (in 14 and 24 percent of cases in two series [<a href="#rid81">81,82</a>]), perhaps at least partly related to contact between a low-seated TAVI and the mitral apparatus. In a multicenter registry [<a href="#rid84">84</a>] of 7944 TAVI patients, 53 suffered PVE following their procedure (0.5 percent at first year). Of those, only 11 percent underwent intervention, either surgical excision or percutaneous valve in valve implantation. In-hospital mortality rate for patients with PVE was 47.2 percent.
