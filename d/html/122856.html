This observation has led to the introduction of the term "asthma-COPD overlap" (ACO), which is a description of a collection of clinical features rather than a definition of a single entity [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. While ACO is likely not a single disease, nor even a syndrome from a clinical or mechanistic perspective, recognition of patients with features of both diseases is important to guide clinical care.</p><p>The clinical features, evaluation, and management of patients with asthma and COPD will be reviewed here. The diagnosis and management of asthma and COPD are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/543.html" rel="external">"Asthma in adolescents and adults: Evaluation and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1455.html" rel="external">"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Diagnosis and staging"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/547.html" rel="external">"An overview of asthma management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/120326.html" rel="external">"Stable COPD: Overview of management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2025286149"><span class="h1">DEFINITION AND BACKGROUND</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The term asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) has been used to identify patients with airway disease who have features of both asthma and COPD. However, the topic remains controversial and no single, universally accepted definition of ACO has emerged. Central to most of the proposed definitions are age &gt;40 years, persistent airflow obstruction, and a history of asthma or evidence of partial bronchodilator reversibility  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126333" href="/z/d/graphic/126333.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The term ACO has been preferred to asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS), as there is no single disease or “syndrome.”</p><p>In 2015, the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) and the Global Initiative for COPD (GOLD) released a joint statement describing what was then called ACOS, as "persistent airflow limitation with several features usually associated with asthma and several features usually associated with COPD" [<a href="#rid4">4</a>], identifiable in clinical practice by the features shared with both asthma and COPD.</p><p>In 2017, the American Thoracic Society and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute published a joint workshop report on ACO. A major conclusion of the workshop is that ACO, like asthma and COPD, does not represent a single discrete disease entity [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. It was suggested that ACO be used to describe patients, for instance, who have a long-standing history of asthma, in addition to having a modest smoking history and fixed airflow obstruction. At the same time, patients with COPD who have features of asthma, such as bronchodilator responsiveness and peripheral eosinophilia, could also be described as having ACO. While clinically, and likely pathologically, these patients remain distinct, both fall under the ACO umbrella.</p><p>Other groups have suggested additional major and minor criteria that may help to identify ACO patients and are further outlined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126333" href="/z/d/graphic/126333.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4-11</a>]. In contrast, the 2020 GOLD Strategy update abandoned use of the term "asthma COPD overlap" arguing that asthma and COPD are different disorders that may share common features such as eosinophilia or some degree of reversibility [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. GOLD emphasizes that asthma and COPD may coexist in an individual patient and that, if concurrent diagnoses are suspected, pharmacotherapy should primarily follow asthma guidelines although COPD specific therapy approaches may also be needed in some patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2423438710"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is difficult to establish an exact disease burden for ACO when no single definition has emerged. Estimates based on self-reported physician diagnosis or a combination of spirometry and symptom reporting suggest the prevalence of ACO in the general population is between 2 to 3 percent, with estimates for asthma and COPD in these same populations being roughly 5 to 17 percent for asthma and 2 to 12 percent for COPD [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. However, when examining COPD patients specifically, the prevalence of ACO may be 25 percent [<a href="#rid13">13</a>], whereas when examining asthma patients, prevalence estimates for ACO range from 10 to 31 percent [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Despite significant heterogeneity within this patient population, studies suggest that ACO patients tend to be female and have a higher body mass index (BMI), lower socioeconomic status, and lower education level than patients with COPD [<a href="#rid13">13-18</a>]. Data regarding outcomes in patients with ACO compared with those with asthma or COPD without overlap are mixed, likely due to the significant heterogeneity of patients encompassed by this umbrella term. For example, in one population-based cohort followed for a median of nine years, patients with ACO and patients with COPD had similarly elevated risks of exacerbations and all-cause mortality compared with symptomatic smokers without COPD [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. By contrast, other studies suggest ACO patients may have poorer disease control with respect to lung function, exacerbation rates, and respiratory symptoms than those with asthma or COPD without overlap [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]. The risk of lung cancer among patients with ACO appears similar to those with COPD and higher than other groups of smokers [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3459043749"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A common question when considering the pathogenesis of ACO is whether it is the result of a unique pathogenic process, or the result of additive pathologic processes of asthma and COPD coexisting in the same patient. Of course, even the pathogenesis of COPD itself is hotly debated. Similarly, the pathologic mechanisms underlying asthma are heterogeneous.</p><p>The Dutch hypothesis suggests both asthma and COPD stem from a single disease entity, but factors such as genetics and environmental exposures influence the clinical phenotype [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. The British hypothesis contends separate origins for asthma and COPD, each with their own characteristic inflammatory drivers, including allergic inflammation in the former and factors such as chronic bacterial infection in the latter [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. In the Dutch hypothesis worldview, ACO would lie in between asthma and COPD on the same continuous spectrum. Under the British hypothesis, unique factors would drive a specific type of inflammation that would make ACO distinct from asthma and COPD.</p><p>Conceptually, it is easy to conceive that tobacco smoking in an asthmatic patient might trigger increased neutrophilic inflammation, fixed airflow obstruction, and eventually COPD [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Conversely, it is also possible that an atopic patient without asthma begins primarily with COPD, but later develops an airway hyperresponsiveness and type 2-mediated airway inflammation. Allergen sensitization has been reported in older COPD patients [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Given that the clinical features of ACO patients significantly differ from patient to patient, it is likely that the predominant inflammatory mechanism differs from patient to patient.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H518505168"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinical features that have been described for ACO include age 40 years or older, respiratory symptoms including exertional dyspnea, persistent partially reversible airflow obstruction (without normalization of obstruction), and history of atopy and/or allergies [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. Other clinical features may include ≥10 pack-years tobacco smoking and documented history of asthma before the age of 40 years  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126333" href="/z/d/graphic/126333.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). However, it is important to note that severe asthma often does not fully reverse to “normal.” (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>While cigarette and/or other air pollution exposures are not central to every definition, the absence of a history of exposure to noxious particles or gases (eg, tobacco smoking, indoor biomass fuel use) is uncommon.</p><p>As with both asthma and COPD, periodic exacerbations of these symptoms have been described in ACO. Patients with adult-onset asthma often have nonallergic asthma, so lack of an atopic history does not exclude asthma. On the other hand, the presence of nasal polyposis with or without other features of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) may provide a sufficient explanation for recurrent exacerbations and persistent airflow limitation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/520.html" rel="external">"Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H369969662"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) suggests that the evaluation of possible ACO closely matches the evaluation of asthma and COPD. A few steps that are more particular to patients with concomitant asthma and COPD are reviewed here. The evaluation and diagnosis of asthma and COPD are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/543.html" rel="external">"Asthma in adolescents and adults: Evaluation and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1455.html" rel="external">"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Diagnosis and staging"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3576607516"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition to determining the severity, frequency, and duration of respiratory symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cough, sputum) and exercise limitation, patients should be asked about any prior diagnosis or symptoms of asthma or allergic rhinitis.</p><p>A detailed history should be obtained regarding potential occupational, avocational, or domestic exposures to fumes or dusts, particularly tobacco smoke.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3715912561"><span class="h2">Laboratory</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While these tests are not routinely obtained, when there is diagnostic uncertainty, an elevated total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE; &gt;100 international units/mL), elevated peripheral blood eosinophil count (&gt;300 cells/microL), and evidence of allergic disease (eg, skin testing or immunoassays for perennial allergen sensitivity) may point a clinician to asthma or ACO. Elevated sputum eosinophil counts, if available, are more common in asthma or ACO than COPD.</p><p>Testing for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is advised for all patients with fixed airflow limitation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1464.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency", section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1785300231"><span class="h2">Pulmonary function tests</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Measurement of spirometry pre- and postbronchodilator is an essential component of the evaluation of airway disease. These tests are used to confirm airflow limitation (obstruction) and assess its reversibility  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96311" href="/z/d/graphic/96311.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>While airflow limitation is necessary for the diagnosis of ACO, it does not help differentiate among ACO, asthma, and COPD.

Similarly, postbronchodilator FEV1 and FEV1/FVC generally remain abnormally low in patients with ACO. Postbronchodilator values in the normal range are more suggestive of asthma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/569.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary function testing in asthma", section on 'Bronchodilator responses'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Compared with patients who have COPD, patients with ACO tend to have greater increases in pulmonary function after extended treatment with inhaled glucocorticoids.</p><p></p><p>Reduced diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is more commonly a feature of COPD than asthma, but specific thresholds to help define ACO have not been determined  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96311" href="/z/d/graphic/96311.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3385045966"><span class="h2">Imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A chest radiograph is frequently obtained as part of the evaluation of persistent symptoms or an exacerbation.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1455.html" rel="external">"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Diagnosis and staging", section on 'Additional testing'</a>.). </p><p>High-resolution computed tomography may help if there is diagnostic uncertainty. Small airway disease in the absence of emphysema could still be consistent with ACO, although asthma (without COPD) and other diagnoses such as bronchiolitis obliterans should be considered (see <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). While some emphysema may be present in ACO, severe emphysema is more consistent with COPD [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1378274883"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical label ACO has been used for patients with clinical features of both asthma and COPD (see <a class="local">'Clinical features'</a> above), although a specific distribution of features that secures a "diagnosis" of ACO has not been agreed upon [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

Bronchiectasis is suspected on the basis of prominent symptoms of a cough that is productive of mucopurulent sputum, recurrent chest infections, and sometimes hemoptysis. The diagnosis is usually established radiographically based on characteristic findings of bronchial wall thickening and luminal dilatation seen on CT scans.

Symptoms include progressive onset of cough and dyspnea associated with hypoxemia at rest or with exercise. Findings on computed tomography (CT) scans often include centrilobular bronchial wall thickening, bronchiolar dilation, tree-in-bud nodularity, and a mosaic pattern of attenuation of lung tissue density.

The term asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) has been used to identify patients with airway disease who have features of both asthma and COPD, but there is no single, universally accepted definition of ACO  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126333" href="/z/d/graphic/126333.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Further, ACO is likely not a single disease, nor even a syndrome from a clinical or mechanistic perspective. However, recognition of patients with both diseases are important in order to guide clinical care. (See <a class="local">'Definition and background'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The prevalence of ACO in the general population has been estimated to be between 2 and 3 percent, with estimates for asthma and COPD being roughly 5 to 17 percent and 2 to 12 percent, respectively. However, it is difficult to establish an exact disease burden for ACO in the absence of consensus regarding the exact definition. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>As with asthma and COPD, significant heterogeneity of patients exists within the ACO umbrella and likely represents a range of underlying disease mechanisms as opposed to a single disease entity.

Historical information about potential atopy is important to differentiating asthma, COPD, and ACO; a chest radiograph is helpful to exclude other causes of dyspnea. While not routinely obtained, a total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), peripheral blood eosinophil count, and skin testing or immunoassays for perennial allergen sensitivity and/or high-resolution computed tomography can help if there is diagnostic uncertainty. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A diagnosis of ACO is based on a combination of clinical features, although not all are required: age ≥40 years; airflow limitation that is not fully reversible; improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) by 10 percent of predicted value after bronchodilator administration; a history of asthma diagnosed by a doctor; a history of atopy or allergies; and exposure to noxious agents such as cigarette smoke (eg, ≥10 pack years). A peripheral blood eosinophil count ≥300 cells/microL is supportive of a diagnosis of ACO or asthma. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>General nonpharmacologic measures for patients with ACO are based on interventions that are useful in managing asthma and/or COPD and include smoking cessation, annual vaccination against influenza and age-appropriate vaccination against pneumococcus, education about the correct technique for all inhalers prescribed, allergen avoidance for those with known allergic sensitization, and pulmonary rehabilitation.
