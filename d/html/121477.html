         Adolescent relationship abuse (ARA) is a major public health problem, associated with unintended pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, physical injury, and mental health and educational consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
         The epidemiology, health and social consequences, trauma-sensitive approach to, and prevention of ARA will be discussed here. Date rape, evaluation and management of adolescent sexual assault, and human trafficking are discussed separately.

         ARA includes physical, sexual, or psychological/emotional abuse of a romantic, sexual, or intimate partner that occurs in person, through texting, online, or through someone else (eg, a peer who delivers a threat or message) [

         Other terms that are used interchangeably with ARA include "teen dating violence" and "adolescent dating violence." We prefer "ARA" as the umbrella term because [

          Adolescent dating violence

         – In a 2021 national cross-sectional survey of high school students in the United States, 8 percent of respondents indicated that they had been hurt on purpose (eg, hit, injured with a weapon or object) by someone they were dating or going out with in the past year [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14

In the same survey, 10 percent of students reported being forced to do "sexual things" (eg, kissing, touching, having sexual intercourse) by someone they were dating or going out with in the past year. Sexual dating violence was more common among female than male students (15 versus 4 percent). In this survey, physical and sexual dating violence is reported more than twice as often among female than male students (19 versus 8 percent) [

         – Intimate partner violence (IPV) often begins in adolescence or young adulthood. In the 2015 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, 26 percent of female victims and 15 percent of male victims of IPV (defined as contact sexual violence [ie, rape, being made to penetrate someone else, sexual coercion, and/or unwanted sexual contact], physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner) first experienced IPV before age 18 years; 71 percent of female victims and 56 percent of male victims first experienced IPV before age 25 years [

        <p>
         Although the rates of violence perpetration against intimate partners are similar among females and males, females experience more severe consequences from victimization because they are more often victims of severe physical violence (eg, being hit with a fist or something hard, kicked, choked, suffocated, burned on purpose, injured with a knife or gun) [

          24,50

         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>

         <a href="#rid48">
          48,53-56

          57-59

Younger victims of ARA may be at particularly elevated risk for HIV and STI because they experience greater levels of sexual violence (which increases the risk of tissue trauma and subsequent infection), inability to refuse sex, difficulty negotiating condom use, and inadequate access to health care [

         of our adolescent patients with education and anticipatory guidance about healthy/unhealthy relationships and information about resources that are available to adolescents who experience violence. It is not necessary to know whether the patient has experienced ARA to achieve these goals. In addition to providing education about healthy relationships, this approach reduces the stigma associated with ARA and lets patients know that they can talk with us if they have concerns about ARA and that we can help them access supports and services.

         Victims of ARA may not disclose ARA for a variety of reasons. Experiences of trauma (eg, exposure to violence, being in an abusive relationship) affect help- and care-seeking behaviors [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71,72

         <a href="#rid73">
          73
         </a>
         ]. Victims of ARA may feel ashamed, may be afraid of consequences related to disclosure (eg, damage to relationship, further violence), may not recognize the experience as abuse, may feel loyalty toward their partner, may have been instructed to lie to providers, may not know that services are available to help them, or may perceive that the services are only available in a crisis [

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Practice personnel (eg, front-desk staff, medical assistants, nurses, health educators) should be trained about the impact of trauma so they can avoid revictimization and can provide empathic attention in all patient interactions. Clinics should develop policies and protocols related to ARA, including confidentiality and how mandatory reporting requirements are handled. All staff should be trained on why these protocols exist as well as how to implement them. (See

         Breaches of confidentiality, judgmental comments, and probing unnecessarily or without sensitivity for details about ARA can exacerbate mistrust and fear of the health care system. By contrast, a nonjudgmental, comforting approach to potential victims helps to reinforce that no one deserves to be hurt and that everyone deserves to be treated with respect.

         Given the fear and stigma associated with being in an abusive relationship, privacy and confidentiality are especially important to youth experiencing ARA. The health care provider must balance creating a practice environment in which the patient may be willing to discuss ARA with the safety of the patient and mandatory reporting requirements, which vary from state to state.

         – Having a clinic policy that clearly states that all adolescent patients are seen in private at some point during the visit is helpful in establishing a safe space in which to discuss ARA.

         In a patient-centered evaluation, all stages of the clinical encounter focus on the patient. Patients should feel that their voice is being heard and valued. They should be offered choices whenever possible. This is particularly important for victims of abuse; being the victim of unpredictable abusive behaviors creates a chronic lack of control. Encouraging the patient's participation in decision making throughout the clinical encounter helps to prevent inadvertent retraumatization of patients who have been victimized. Certain aspects of the examination (eg, particular body positions or types of touch, being in a confined space) may remind the patient of their trauma [

         Providers must look for signs of medical conditions that were not discussed in the medical history. Patients who have experienced abuse or exploitation may not always share all of their complaints or respond to questions honestly due to fear, mistrust, or shame.

         <strong>
          Predictability
         </strong>
         – The clinical encounter should be as predictable as possible. Providers should review the steps of the physical examination before the patient is asked to change into a gown. It may be helpful to let patients know that the examination may remind patients who have experienced abuse of their previous victimization.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Clear communication regarding what will happen during the examination before it happens is critical to keep the patient informed and empowered. Each step of the examination should be explained throughout the evaluation, and the patient should understand that they may refuse any portion of the examination at any time.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Use of verbal, written, and visual tools can help to communicate and improve informed consent, particularly for patients with low literacy. Explanations about medical problems and procedures should be basic, with opportunities for the adolescent to "teach back" what they heard. Many adolescents have limited knowledge about human anatomy and physiology. For example, they may not know how antibiotics or contraception work, how much damage a sexually transmitted infection (STI) can do to their bodies, or that some STIs are incurable. The examination can provide an opportunity to educate youth about their bodies and how they work, and empower them to take an active role in their own care.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Providers should emphasize the voluntary nature of the clinical history, examination, and services, and offer multiple opportunities for patients to ask questions and/or opt not to continue. Checking with the patient throughout the evaluation can allay fears and provide a sense of control. The physical examination, particularly the pelvic examination, can be difficult and retraumatizing for patients who have experienced violence. The right to refuse should be repeated at regular and appropriate stages during complicated, lengthy, or stressful procedures. In some patients, the examination may trigger flashbacks, during which the patient may "zone out," appear to be in a different place, stop responding to questions, hyperventilate, or have near-syncope.

          How to introduce the discussion
         </strong>
         – Given that adolescents may disclose ARA to a friend before (or instead of) a parent, caregiver or other adult, health care providers can introduce the topic of ARA as something that may affect their peer group as a whole, without singling out the individual patient [
         <a href="#rid2">

         We ask all adolescent patients about ARA. The approach varies with the clinical situation and provider preference.

Other providers ask about ARA in the context of provision of education and anticipatory guidance. For example [

         When providing information to patients who have not disclosed ARA, we provide an opening for future disclosure and try to reduce the stigma associated with ARA by saying something like:

          I am glad you are in a healthy relationship now, but relationships can change. If you ever are in an unhealthy or unsafe relationship, I would like you to know what kind of help is available. If you are comfortable taking this information, it may be good to have on hand. If you are interested, please take this with you. You can take two or three – maybe you have a friend who could use it.

          We provide this information to all of our patients because unhealthy relationships can have such negative effects on health, and because you may know someone who could use the information. We want to make sure you know that this is a safe place to talk about whatever concerns you.

         This trauma-sensitive approach can help to build trust. Over time, patients who have experienced abuse may become more open to sharing their stories, discussing the impact on their health, and/or asking for help [

         The resources that are provided vary depending upon the availability of resources in particular communities. Many communities have resources specifically for adolescent victims of ARA or sexual exploitation. If adolescent-specific services are available locally, it is helpful to establish formal agreements and connections with them to make it easier for adolescent patients to access services when necessary.

          Strategies for at-risk individuals
         </strong>
         – Prevention strategies for adolescents with a history of exposure to violence, which is a risk factor for ARA, have focused on building skills to prevent violence through cognitive behavioral therapy and other interventions.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In 10-year follow-up of a randomized trial that compared a parent/caregiver support intervention with no treatment for preschoolers at risk for conduct problems, female adolescents whose caregiver received the intervention had a lower risk of exposure to ARA in their peer group than female adolescents in the control group [

         </a>
         ]. In another randomized trial of adolescent females with a history of dating violence and involvement in family court, the Date SMART prevention program (a cognitive-behavioral skill building group intervention) was associated with reductions in physical, sexual, and cyber dating violence, as well as reduced sexual behavior [

         ]. In a longitudinal study, an increased number of Expect Respect Support Group (a school-based violence prevention program) sessions attended was associated with decreased aggression in males and females and decreased adolescent dating violence perpetration and victimization in males (but not females) compared with "treatment as usual" controls [

          Terminology
         </strong>
         – Adolescent relationship abuse (ARA) includes physical, sexual, or psychological/emotional abuse of a romantic, sexual, or intimate partner that occurs in person, through texting, online, or through someone else. Other interchangeable terms for ARA include "teen dating violence" and "adolescent dating violence." In addition to physical, sexual, and psychological/emotional abuse, ARA includes reproductive coercion and cyber dating abuse. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Epidemiology
         </strong>
         – Approximately 7 to 10 percent of high school students in the United States report physical or sexual dating violence. The prevalence of ARA increases throughout adolescence and peaks in young adulthood. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Epidemiology'

         <strong>
          Risk and protective factors
         </strong>
         – Factors associated with ARA victimization include physical or sexual abuse in childhood, early onset puberty or sexual activity, substance use and/or misuse of prescription drugs, being pregnant or postpartum, sexual or gender minority status, socioeconomic disadvantage, involvement with child protection or juvenile justice services, placement in foster care, and youth homelessness. Protective factors include participation in prevention programs, knowledge of effective sexual consent, positive parenting practices, and prosocial peers. (See

         <strong>
          Impact on health
         </strong>
         – ARA victimization is associated with adverse effects on sexual, mental, and general physical health (eg, sexually transmitted infections, unintended pregnancy, depression, substance use, physical injury). Although the rates of violence perpetration against intimate partners are similar among males and females, females experience more severe consequences, including death. (See

          Possible warning signs
         </strong>
         – Although no single symptom or sign is predictive of ARA, certain findings are associated with ARA, particularly if they occur together  (

         adolescents−not just those who have been identified as victims of violence. Adolescent victims of ARA may not be identified as victims of ARA or may not be ready to disclose ARA.

         We provide education about healthy relationships and brief counseling about ARA to all adolescents – not just those who disclose. We routinely ask about ARA, although the approach varies with the clinical situation (eg, warning signs  (
