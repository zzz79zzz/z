         Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a biologically based neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities.
        </p>
        <p>
         The evaluation and diagnosis of ASD will be reviewed here. Surveillance and screening for ASD and the terminology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and management of ASD are discussed separately.

         ASD should be suspected in children with abnormalities in social interaction that are not better explained by impaired cognitive skills. The abnormal social interactions are due to limited social communication skills (eg, difficulty with social attention and dyadic conversation with a limited ability to understand another's perspective) as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. (See

         <strong>
          Refer for comprehensive evaluation
         </strong>
         – Children who are identified as being at risk for ASD should be referred to a specialist (eg, developmental-behavioral pediatrician, child psychiatrist, child neurologist, (neuro)psychologist with expertise in ASD) for a comprehensive evaluation to establish the diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. Accurate and appropriate diagnosis usually requires a clinician who is experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of ASD, ideally with input from multiple disciplines to assess core symptoms, functional impairment, severity, and comorbid conditions [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,4-9
         </a>
         ]. (See

         <strong>
          Make the initial diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Although most children will need to see a specialist (eg, developmental-behavioral pediatrician, child psychiatrist, child neurologist, [neuro]psychologist), for a diagnostic evaluation, general pediatricians and child psychologists comfortable with application of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition Text Revision criteria for ASD can make an initial clinical diagnosis. Having a clinical diagnosis may facilitate initiation of services [

         The primary care provider can make a diagnosis of ASD using first- and second-tier screening instruments, which are discussed separately, if they have adequate clinical experience and confidence in the veracity of the evaluation they can perform. It is important to check local educational system and insurance requirements for the given diagnosis to qualify the youth for treatment. (See

          Refer for intervention pending diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Primary care providers who suspect that a child has ASD should refer the child for developmental-behavioral services pending the comprehensive evaluation. In the United States, services are provided through Early Intervention (for children &lt;36 months of age) or the public school system (for children ≥36 months of age). State-specific contact information for Early Intervention is available through the

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The primary care provider also can refer the child for other interventions that the family can provide while awaiting the comprehensive evaluation. The type of intervention varies depending on the caregivers' concerns [

          11,12

         The reference standard for evaluating a child for ASD consists of a comprehensive assessment. A comprehensive assessment includes a multidisciplinary team with a lead clinician who has expertise in the diagnosis and management of ASD (eg, a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, child psychiatrist, child neurologist, or [neuro]psychologist), a speech and language pathologist, and an educator [

         Review of the developmental history, with particular attention to early social-emotional and language milestones, play skills and behaviors, behavior, and loss of skills; it is particularly useful to ask about the child's interest in playing with other children, their ability to copy what other children do, and whether or not their play behaviors mimic social events or social situations. All of these behaviors are typically absent or limited in children with ASD  (

         Specific examples of early social and communication behaviors include responsiveness when called by name, shared enjoyment with caregiver, use of eye contact during communication, and use of pointing as a means of communication. All of these behaviors are typically missing in the child with ASD. Older children with ASD commonly struggle with taking turns in a play interaction or conversation, fail to regulate their social interactions using eye contact, and show limited nonverbal communication skills such as changes in facial expressions, gestures, and intonation.

         Diagnostic tools are used to gather behavioral data in a structured and consistent manner, either through an interview with the caregivers or (more commonly) by making direct observations of the child. Diagnostic tools are used in conjunction with clinical judgment to make a diagnosis of ASD; they should not be used in isolation [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,4
         </a>
         ]. Diagnostic tools for ASD generally are administered by a specialist; most require intensive training for administration. In the United States, use of a diagnostic tool may be required for access to intensive behavioral interventions (eg, Applied Behavior Analysis) from the child's insurance plan.

         In a systematic review of observational studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy in children &lt;6 years of age who underwent multidisciplinary evaluation for ASD (the reference standard), no studies evaluating GARS, 3di, or DISCO met inclusion criteria [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Among studies of ADI-R, CARS, and ADOS, there was substantial variation in sensitivity and specificity, likely related to differences in study populations and methodology. There were too few studies to permit meaningful direct comparison. However, when the summary statistics were compared, ADOS was most sensitive (94 percent compared with 80 percent for CARS and 52 percent for ADI-R). The three tools had similar specificity (ranging from 80 to 88 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         Diagnostic tools for ASD must be used in conjunction with clinical judgment for a number of reasons. The administration protocols that are used in research studies may not be achievable in clinical practice. In the studies included in the systematic review, ASD was diagnosed according to criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Fourth edition or earlier classifications that do not directly correlate with DSM, Fifth Edition Text Revision criteria [
         <a href="#rid17">

There are two major sets of diagnostic criteria, both of which center on atypical social communication and interaction and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, activities, and interests: the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the International Disease Classification (ICD).

         </span>
         In conjunction with an adaptive scale (eg, Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, Adaptive Behavior Assessment System), we use the DSM-5-TR classification to specify the severity level of ASD, recognizing that severity may vary with context and over time [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. Severity should be assessed separately for each domain, as indicated below. Co-occurring intellectual impairment often accounts for the differences in levels of severity.

          DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The differential diagnosis of ASD includes a number of conditions that impair social communication or social interaction and/or are associated with stereotypic movements  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119225" href="/z/d/graphic/119225.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). In some cases, these conditions are the cause of the ASD-like symptoms and the child does not have ASD; in other cases, the conditions co-occur with ASD [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30,33-35
         </a>
         ]. In co-occurring cases, the co-occurring condition should not better explain the symptoms. An important function of the comprehensive multidisciplinary evaluation is to determine whether the child has ASD, another condition, or ASD and another condition. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Goals'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         It may be particularly difficult to distinguish co-occurring conditions from ASD in young children. Young children may need to be followed over time before a definitive diagnosis can be made. Similarly, it can be difficult to distinguish co-occurring conditions from ASD in older children who have a dual diagnosis such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety, ADHD and a language impairment, or social anxiety disorder, particularly in children with normal or superior intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
         A history of reduced or inconsistent social reciprocity generally distinguishes ASD from the conditions in the differential diagnosis. The impairment in social reciprocity has to be best explained by ASD and not by the co-occurring condition.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pending definitive diagnosis, primary care providers who suspect that a child has ASD should refer the child for developmental-behavioral services. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Role of primary care provider'

          Global delay/intellectual disability
         </strong>
         – Global developmental delay or intellectual disability may be difficult to distinguish from ASD, particularly in young children and in those with profound cognitive impairment. Cognitive deficits are difficult to assess in the young, nonverbal child, and severe deficits may be associated with repetitive behaviors and mixed expressive/receptive language delay [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36

         – Intellectual giftedness can mimic ASD, particularly if the child with intellectual giftedness has comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disability, or anxiety. In contrast to children with ASD, children with social awkwardness related to intellectual giftedness typically enjoy social interaction, have normal pragmatic language skills, and can explain their intense interests, which are functional and varied.

         </strong>
         – In contrast to children with ASD, children with language-based learning disorders have normal reciprocal social interactions, normal desire and intent to communicate, and appropriate imaginative play. Children with language-based learning disorder have difficulty or delay in processing content, but their pragmatics (ie, ability to initiate and sustain a conversation) are more typical than those of children with ASD. In addition, the intent to communicate in children with language-based learning disorder is present, even though the competency may be lacking. (See

         – Children with nonverbal learning disorder may have impaired social reasoning, strong rote skills, and well-developed basic language skills, similar to some children with ASD without intellectual or language impairment. However, children with nonverbal learning disorder lack restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities and usually have milder impairments in social skills and pragmatic language than those with ASD.

          Landau-Kleffner syndrome

         – Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS, also called acquired epileptic aphasia) is characterized by the loss of previously established language milestones, inability to comprehend the spoken word, and seizures or an epileptiform electroencephalogram. Children with LKS usually develop normally until approximately three to six years of age (in contrast to ASD, in which symptoms usually are present in the early developmental period but may not manifest until social demands exceed capacities). LKS typically begins with the children behaving as if they were deaf (auditory verbal agnosia). Difficulties with expressive language also occur with time, but cognitive function usually remains normal. (See

         – Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that occurs almost exclusively in females. Affected patients initially develop normally, then gradually lose speech and purposeful hand use sometime after 18 months of age. Most cases of Rett syndrome result from mutations in the
         <em>
          MECP2

          Anxiety disorder
         </strong>
         – Anxiety disorder (includes social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and selective mutism) has behavioral features that overlap with ASD, particularly when it occurs in combination with ADHD or language impairment. To the extent that it can be determined, individuals with anxiety disorder find their symptoms distressing, whereas individuals with ASD typically do not. However, children with ASD frequently experience anxiety symptoms that they find distressing. In contrast to children with ASD, children with primary anxiety disorders usually have normal nonverbal social behavior and imaginary play [

          Initial genetic tests
         </strong>
         – Consultation with or referral to a clinical geneticist is suggested to determine an individualized testing strategy that optimizes identification and exclusion of genetic conditions with medical consequences while considering out-of-pocket costs to the patient's family. The most appropriate tests for a particular child with ASD may vary with clinical features (eg, dysmorphic features, extended family history). If genetics consultation is not available, standard testing may include chromosomal microarray (CMA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis for fragile X, whether or not the child has dysmorphic features. Karyotype is warranted if a balanced translocation is suspected (eg, history of ≥2 miscarriages) because CMA does not detect balanced translocations [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49
         </a>
         ]. However, truly balanced de novo translocations are rare [
         <a href="#rid50">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Identification of a genetic diagnosis may prevent associated medical complications for the child, provide specific information about recurrence risk for family members, and prevent further search for complementary and alternative diagnoses and treatments, which are often nonevidence based and expensive. It also may provide emotional relief for the caregivers and can be crucial to the therapeutic alliance. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of genetic testing on such outcomes and it is unclear whether or not genetic testing affects health outcomes [
         <a href="#rid51">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Consultation with a clinical geneticist also may be necessary for interpretation of CMA results. Interpretation of microarray data is complicated by the identification of novel and/or recurrent copy-number variants of unknown significance. Nonetheless, CMA has the highest detection rate among clinically available genetic tests for patients with ASD (excluding whole-exome sequencing, which may be costly and not covered by all insurance carriers) [

         A recognizable disorder is found in a minority of cases, usually in patients with comorbid global developmental delay or intellectual disability. In a cohort of 933 patients who underwent genetic testing for a diagnosis of ASD, karyotype was abnormal in 2 percent, fragile X testing was abnormal in 0.5 percent, and array comparative genomic hybridization identified abnormal deletions or duplications in 7 percent [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52

          54
         </a>
         ]. Among the 95 children who underwent both CMA and whole-exome sequencing, the yield of whole-exome sequencing was similar to that of CMA (8.4 percent) and the combined yield of CMA and whole-exome sequencing was 15.8 percent. Molecular diagnosis was achieved more often in children with more severe dysmorphology, suggesting that it may be possible to identify children with the greatest likelihood of genetic diagnosis [

         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Although it is not necessary to repeat the entire diagnostic evaluation, reassessment of developmental skills may be helpful because relatively small changes can affect the impact of ASD in young children. Reassessment of developmental skills, particularly social skills, provides an important measure of responsiveness to therapies and diagnostic stability. Reassessment visits should also be used to check on the emotional and practical response of the family to the diagnosis and their ability to meet the needs of their child as successfully as possible.

         In addition, the primary care clinician should continue to see the patient every 6 to 12 months. Long-term support is critical for children with ASD and their families [

          Role of the primary care provider
         </strong>
         – In the evaluation and diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), primary care providers generally identify children at risk and refer them for comprehensive evaluation and intervention pending diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis of ASD is usually made by a specialist (eg, developmental-behavioral pediatrician, child psychiatrist, child neurologist, (neuro)psychologist with expertise in ASD) in the context of a comprehensive evaluation. (See

          Diagnosis

         – The diagnosis of ASD is made clinically in children who meet established diagnostic criteria for ASD based on history and observation of behavior. There are two major sets of diagnostic criteria, both of which center on atypical social communication and interaction and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, activities, and interests:

          Additional evaluation

         – Additional evaluation may be necessary to identify comorbid conditions that have implications for treatment or genetic counseling. Additional evaluation usually includes genetic testing; other tests are individualized according to the history and clinical presentation. The yield of additional testing in the absence of clinical indications is low. (See
