Progression from the mild to the severe features of the disease spectrum (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76975" href="/d/graphic/76975.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) may be gradual or rapid.</p><p>A key focus of routine prenatal care is monitoring patients for signs and symptoms of preeclampsia. If the diagnosis is made antepartum, delivery is the only intervention that will lead to disease resolution, although end-organ dysfunction may worsen in the first one to three days postpartum. Timing of delivery is based on a combination of factors, including disease severity, maternal and fetal condition, and gestational age. </p><p>Low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> can reduce the occurrence of preeclampsia in patients at high risk for the disease.

Delivery minimizes the risk of serious maternal complications (eg, cerebral hemorrhage [stroke], hepatic rupture, kidney failure, pulmonary edema, seizure, bleeding related to thrombocytopenia, myocardial infarction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, retinal injury, or abruption), which cannot be accurately predicted and which can occur suddenly [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>]. Delivery also minimizes the risk of fetal complications (eg, growth restriction, demise) and although it may result in a late preterm birth, neonates ≥34 weeks generally have a good prognosis.

Intervention had favorable effects on maternal outcome, without incurring an increase in cesarean birth or neonatal morbidity. Specifically:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Induction resulted in a 30 percent reduction in a composite of serious maternal outcomes (31 versus 44 percent, relative risk [RR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.86), which was primarily driven by a reduction in patients who developed severe hypertension.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The composite included (1) maternal mortality, (2) maternal morbidity (eclampsia, HELLP syndrome [hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets], pulmonary edema, thromboembolic disease, abruption), (3) progression to severe disease (systolic blood pressure ≥170 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥110 mmHg, proteinuria ≥5 g per 24 h), and (4) major postpartum hemorrhage.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Induction resulted in a lower rate of cesarean birth (14 versus 19 percent; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.55-1.04)).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>However, induction did not result in statistically significant differences between groups in any neonatal outcome measure, even though the induced group gave birth, on average, 1.2 weeks earlier than the expectantly managed group. The possibility of true small differences in newborn outcomes could not be definitively excluded because of the small number of adverse outcomes.</p><p></p><p>Follow-up analyses have shown that an unfavorable cervix is not a reason to avoid induction [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. In a secondary analysis of data from this trial and DIGITAT (pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction), induction of labor at term in patients with a median Bishop score of 3 (range 1 to 6) was not associated with a higher risk of cesarean birth than expectant management, and approximately 85 percent of patients in both groups achieved a vaginal birth [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Prostaglandins or a balloon catheter were used for cervical ripening.</p><p>In addition, a 2010 economic analysis of the HYPITAT trial conducted in the Netherlands concluded that induction was 11 percent less costly overall than expectant management with monitoring [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>Management of delivery is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/139247.html" rel="external">"Preeclampsia: Intrapartum and postpartum management and long-term prognosis", section on 'Intrapartum management'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H84745305"><span class="h3">Preterm pregnancies: Expectant management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>At preterm gestational ages, the risks for serious sequelae from disease progression need to be balanced with the newborn risks resulting from preterm birth. This balance depends on the specific gestational age.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3245658909"><span class="h4">Before 34 weeks</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Before 34+0 weeks, if the mother and fetus are stable and have no findings of serious end-organ dysfunction, then an expectant approach with close monitoring for evidence of progression to the severe end of the disease spectrum is reasonable to achieve further fetal growth and maturity. However, if severe hypertension, serious maternal end-organ dysfunction (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76975" href="/d/graphic/76975.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), or nonreassuring tests of fetal well-being develop, then prompt delivery is generally indicated.</p><p>Guidelines from major medical organizations generally recommend this approach given the high risk of neonatal morbidity from preterm birth [<a href="#rid1">1,4,5</a>]. We agree with the guidelines, which are based on expert opinion and indirect results from trials among patients with preeclampsia with severe features [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].  </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1783838804"><span class="h4">34+0 to 36+6 weeks</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>At 34+0 to 36+6 weeks, the optimum management of preeclampsia without features of severe disease and with a stable mother and fetus is controversial. Although expectant management can be associated with serious maternal risks, we believe it is reasonable until 37+0 weeks in fully informed patients because the absolute maternal risk of a serious adverse outcome is low and birth at 37+0 weeks rather than earlier has modest neonatal benefits. After a discussion of the risks and benefits of planned late preterm birth (34+0 to 36+6 weeks) versus planned early term birth (at or shortly after 37+0 weeks), the timing of birth should ultimately be a shared decision.</p><p>The PHOENIX trial provides quantitative data for patient counseling [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>PHOENIX trial</strong> – This multicenter randomized trial compared planned early birth within 48 hours versus expectant management (usual care) in 901 singleton or dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies at 34+0 to 36+6 weeks with preeclampsia [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Compared with expectant management, planned early birth:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Reduced the adverse maternal composite outcome (maternal morbidity or systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg: 289 out of 448 [65 percent] versus 338 out of 451 [75 percent]; adjusted RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79-0.94). Severe systolic hypertension accounted for at least 60 percent of the composite outcome in both groups.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Increased the adverse perinatal composite outcome (perinatal death or neonatal intensive care unit [NICU] admission: 196 out of 471 [42 percent] versus 159 out of 475 [34 percent], RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.08-1.47). Neither group had a stillbirth or neonatal death, thus this difference was entirely due to a higher NICU admission rate in the planned early delivery group. Most of these NICU admissions were because of preterm gestational age alone; respiratory morbidity was not increased compared with expectant management.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The overall number of serious adverse events was similar in both groups. Both groups included four patients with abruption. Although PHOENIX is the largest randomized trial to address this issue, the number of adverse events was still relatively small, and thus, the trial was underpowered to find statistical differences in individual outcomes of clinical importance in shared decision making. For example, expectant management had statistically significant favorable perinatal effects at 34 and 35 weeks of gestation, which were attenuated by including pregnancies at 36 weeks.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the expectantly managed group, the median additional prolongation of pregnancy was five days (three days after adjustment of confounders), more than one-half of the patients in this group had an indicated delivery before 37 weeks, and 74 percent progressed to preeclampsia with severe features (versus 64 percent in the planned delivery group). The only maternal death occurred in the expectantly managed group in a patient with underlying medical comorbidities who died unexpectedly five days postpartum; this death was not thought to be related to expectant management.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A follow-up of this trial comparing the cardiovascular effects of planned early birth versus expectant management reported that the prevalence of hypertension at six months postpartum was 71 percent, and 10 percent of the patients had left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;55 percent, with no significant differences between the two approaches [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. This suggests that expectant management does not further worsen maternal cardiovascular health. Infant follow-up at two years showed that average neurodevelopmental assessment was within the normal range in both groups, but follow-up was lower than anticipated [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Therefore, the increased frequency of adverse perinatal composite outcome in the planned early delivery group is probably not associated with a high risk of serious long-term consequences for the child and thus may be an acceptable trade-off for the reduction in adverse maternal composite outcome with early delivery. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The PHOENIX trial was conducted in England and Wales, which are high-income countries. A similar trial (CRADLE-4) of planned early delivery versus expectant management of preeclampsia at 34+0 to 36+6 weeks was conducted in India and Zambia, which are classified as a lower-middle-income (LMIC) and a low-income (LIC) country, respectively [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Planned early delivery in this setting did not significantly reduce the composite maternal adverse outcome (maternal multi-organ preeclampsia-associated morbidity, severe hypertension, or death: 22 versus 24 percent, RR 0.92 95% CI 0.68-1.25), and did not significantly increase the composite neonatal adverse outcome (neonatal death, antenatal or intrapartum stillbirth, or neonatal unit admission &gt;48 hours: 19 versus 22 percent; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.64-1.21). The mean difference in time from randomization to initiation of delivery between groups was 3.18 days. These findings support the safety of planned delivery for late preterm preeclampsia in LMICs and LICs. Furthermore, additional findings showed two important benefits: statistically significant reductions in both severe maternal hypertension (44 versus 52 percent) and stillbirth (1 versus 4 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Data from meta-analysis</strong> – A strength of the data from the PHOENIX trial is that the trial was restricted to patients with preeclampsia at 34+0 to 36+6 weeks. By comparison, a 2022 individual participant data meta-analysis of six randomized trials of planned early delivery versus expectant management primarily included patients with preeclampsia, but also some with gestational hypertension and/or fetal growth restriction, and the patients presented over a wider gestational age range (mostly 34+0 to 36+6 weeks, but one trial included pregnancies as early as 24 weeks and two trials included pregnancies up to 41+0 weeks) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. All of the trials were from high-income countries.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Similar to findings from PHOENIX, the analysis found that early delivery reduced the risk of composite maternal morbidity (2.6 versus 4.4 percent; adjusted RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36-0.98) and an increased the risk of composite perinatal morbidity/mortality (20.9 versus 17.1 percent; adjusted RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.47), driven by short-term neonatal respiratory morbidity. In addition, newborns in the expectant management group were more likely to be small for gestational age (7.8 versus 10.6 percent; RR 0.74, 95%CI 0.55-0.99). </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H703219"><span class="h2">Components of expectant management</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Inpatient versus outpatient care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Close maternal monitoring upon diagnosis of preeclampsia is important to establish disease severity and rate of progression.
