         <em>
          Chlamydia trachomatis
         </em>
         is a sexually transmitted gram-negative bacterium that causes infection worldwide. In the United States, it is the most commonly reported bacterial infection and a common cause of urethritis in males and cervicitis in females [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The largely asymptomatic reservoir of infections provides an ongoing source for efficient disease transmission and also allows for silent disease.
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         infection can result in scarring of the Fallopian tubes, ovaries, endometrial lining, and occasionally, the adjacent perineum, which increases the risk of future ectopic pregnancy and tubal infertility [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. These consequences are the main reason that
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         is estimated to be the most costly nonviral sexually transmitted infection [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. With this in mind, screening programs aimed at preventing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in females began in the late 1980s in the US, and were formally endorsed by the US Preventive Screening Task Force (USPSTF) and other major organization in the mid-1990s [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Other countries also have national chlamydia screening programs [

         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         is a small gram-negative bacterium that is an obligate intracellular parasite. It has a distinct life-cycle consisting of two major phases:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The small elementary bodies attach and penetrate into cells, changing into the metabolically active form, called the reticulate body, within six to eight hours. These forms create large inclusions within cells.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The reticulate bodies then reorganize into small elementary bodies, and within two to three days the cell ruptures, releasing newly formed elementary bodies. Release of the elementary bodies initiates the replicative process, since this is the form that can infect new epithelial cells. The long growth cycle explains why treatment with agents with long half-lives or a prolonged course of antibiotics is necessary to eradicate infection. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7579.html" rel="external">
          "Treatment of
          <i>

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Chlamydia cannot be cultured on artificial media; tissue culture is required to grow the organism. Culture methods are now limited to research and reference laboratories in favor of more sensitive and practical diagnostic methods. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83019.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         One critical feature of chlamydial organisms is that immunity to infection is not long-lived. As a result, reinfection or persistent infection is common.

         In most countries,
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         infections among adults and adolescents are virtually all sexually transmitted. The risk of transmitting
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         from an infected individual to an uninfected one has been difficult to establish.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a study that included 290 heterosexual couples using a strand displacement assay to detect chlamydia infection, 76 percent of male partners of female cases and 77 percent of female partners of male cases also tested positive [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. In a study of male-male couples, among the 30 males who had urethral chlamydia, 14 (47 percent) had a partner with rectal chlamydia, and among the 46 males with rectal chlamydia, 14 (30 percent) had a partner with urethral chlamydia [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ] These findings suggest that transmission of chlamydia between the urethra and the rectum is less efficient than transmission between the urethra and cervix in heterosexual couples, and transmission from urethra to rectum is more efficient than vice versa.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unfortunately, data on the likelihood of infection after a known exposure or rates of transmission from symptomatic versus asymptomatic persons are not available.

         <em>
          C. trachomatis

         is the most commonly reported bacterial infection in the United States. In 2021, 1,644,416 chlamydial infections were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), reflecting an incidence rate of 495.5 cases per 100,000 people [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ], which represented an increase over the prior year. The rate of infection among females has remained much higher than that among males (629 versus 357 cases per 100,000 persons), probably because females are considerably more likely to be screened than males (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94517" href="/z/d/graphic/94517.html" rel="external">
          figure 1

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Race, ethnicity, economic disadvantage, and geographic region also modify the likelihood of infection being detected [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,8,9
         </a>
         ]. As an example, the reported incidence among Black individuals in 2021 was five and seven times that among White individuals, for females and males, respectively [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In a separate analysis from 2015, American Indian or Alaska Native persons were estimated to have an incidence of chlamydia 3.8 times higher than the rate among White individuals in the United States [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the majority of urogenital
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         infections are asymptomatic, these rates undoubtedly underestimate the true burden of disease. Moreover, there has been considerable debate as to how much of the apparent increase in disease burden is related to enhanced screening efforts and whether there is a true increase in the incidence of infection.

         </span>
         Some features of chlamydia epidemiology have remained constant since surveillance was initiated in the US. Prevalence is consistently highest among young females and males (14 to 24 years of age) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In one prospective study of 14,322 individuals between the ages of 18 and 26 years, the prevalence of chlamydia was 4.2 percent and, overall, was higher among females than males [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. The highest prevalence rates were in African American females (14 percent). In a study of a sample of households in the US conducted from 2007 to 2012 as a part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the prevalence of chlamydia was 1.7 percent among participants ranging in age from 14 to 39 years; this corresponded to 1.8 million prevalent infections [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. The overall prevalence in this study was slightly higher among females than males (2 versus 1.4 percent). Among sexually active females, the prevalence increased with decreasing age.
        </p>
        <p>
         As with incidence, prevalence varies by race, ethnicity, economic disadvantage, and geographic region. Prevalence is also higher among incarcerated populations, military recruits, and patients receiving care at public sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics [

         Chlamydia is a common infection worldwide. In general, the age-specific prevalence described in the US, with younger individuals bearing the brunt of the disease, also appears evident in other countries, although systematically collected, nationally representative data are limited in lower resource countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated the global prevalence of several STIs among individuals aged 15 to 49 years based on data from regions that have good case-based surveillance systems as well as data from population-based studies [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. In 2016, chlamydia prevalence was estimated to be 3.8 percent, and an estimated 127.2 million incident cases of chlamydia occurred worldwide. The degree to which improved diagnostics and increased availability of chlamydia diagnostics in resource-limited settings have influenced this reported increase is unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, in support of the general increasing global trend in genital chlamydia, population-based studies in certain regions also demonstrate a surprisingly high prevalence of
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         . In an observational study of almost 3500 individuals in China randomly selected by region to provide a nationally representative sampling, the estimated prevalence of
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         infection was 2.1 percent [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. In a population-based screening study in the Netherlands, in which 21,000 males and females ages 15 to 29 years underwent home based urine testing, the prevalence of chlamydia was 2.6 percent in females and 2.0 percent in males [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         One interesting feature of
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         global
         <em>
         </em>
         epidemiology is the so-called Swedish new variant, first reported in 2006 in Sweden [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. This variant contained a mutation so that nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) used at the time of its emergence did not detect the microorganism. This diagnostic test failure allowed infections caused by this strain to go undiagnosed, leading to a nationwide network of related infections. Subsequent modification of testing protocols has resulted in a relatively lower proportion of chlamydial infections due to this strain, and it remains rarely reported beyond the Nordic countries.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsequently, newer mutations have allowed
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         specimens to be falsely negative in certain NAAT platforms in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and England, raising the concern that mutations escaping detection are more common than previously realized [

        <p>
         As an example, in a study of Kansas City, Missouri STI clinic attendees who reported exposure at extragenital sites, the prevalence of rectally detected
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         was 11.8 percent, and the prevalence of orally detected
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         was 2 percent amongst women who had sex with men; between 23 and 33 percent of chlamydia infections in women would have been missed if extragenital testing were not performed [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24

         Young age – Individuals less than 25 years of age tend to have the highest prevalence of chlamydia. Some experts believe that a decline in prevalence with age may be related to development of partial immunity through periodic repeated exposures, in addition to changes in behavior [

         History of a different sexually transmitted infection (STI), including HIV, is also associated with a higher risk of chlamydia. (See

         Socioeconomic and racial disparities also exist with chlamydia prevalence, with higher prevalences noted among certain ethnic populations, certain clinical settings, and among socioeconomically disadvantaged youth. (See

         In general, less is known about the risk factors for chlamydia in males than in females. There is a high prevalence of both genital and extragenital chlamydia among men who have sex with men (MSM) (see
         <a class="local">
          'Risk in men who have sex with men'
         </a>
         below). Other risk factors may be similar to those in females. In a population-based study from the Netherlands, infection in males was associated with young age, multiple sex partners, low/intermediate education status, and infrequent condom use [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>

          35
         </a>
         ]. In a systematic review of eight studies, the median proportion of males reinfected with chlamydia was 11.3 percent [

         In one rigorous study, participants with

         </em>
         infection underwent a test-of-cure approximately 30 days after antibiotic treatment in order to document successful therapy before returning at three months for repeat screening. In this way, repeat infection could be distinguished from treatment failure. In a study of 272 males aged 15 to 35 years, diagnosed with chlamydia, and subsequently followed for four months in three urban sites in the US (Baltimore, Denver, and San Francisco), repeat infection occurred in 13 percent (an estimated incidence of 45 infections per 100 person-years) [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32

         <em>

         infection at school-based health centers, 236 (26 percent) had one or more subsequent positive tests over the next year [

         There is a high incidence and prevalence of STIs, including
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         , among men who have sex with men (MSM). As an example, in 2021, approximately 17 percent of MSM evaluated at select STI clinics in the United States tested positive for

         [
         <a href="#rid1">

         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         infections (urogenital, rectal, and pharyngeal) was 45 cases per 100 person-years [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. These figures reflect sampling of high-risk MSM populations. Furthermore, among such high-risk populations, there may be subgroups at especially high risk who account for much of the disease burden. In the Australian study, 25 percent of the study population accounted for 75 percent of all STIs diagnosed [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Some prevalence estimates underestimate the total burden of infection because they do not take into account rectal
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         infections, which are common among MSM, asymptomatic, and not frequently sought using recommended diagnostic tests [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38,39
         </a>
         ]. In one study of nearly 22,000 MSM included in a United States national STI clinic surveillance network, only 46 percent were tested for rectal chlamydia infection, but 14 percent of those tested were positive [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, in another study of MSM screened for chlamydia at urethral, rectal, and pharyngeal sites, rectal infections accounted for 53 percent of chlamydial infections, and 86 percent of them were asymptomatic [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. In both studies, the majority of males with rectal infections did not have concurrent urethral infection and thus would have been missed had urethral testing only been performed. In the first community-based (non-clinic-based) study of site-specific chlamydia prevalence in the United States, in which over 2000 MSM in five cities provided self-collected specimens for screening, rectal
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         infection was identified in 7 percent; oral
         <em>
          C. trachomatis

         prevalence was 1.4 percent [

         serovars D-K, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), caused by serovars L1, L2, and L3, can cause symptomatic proctitis in men who engage in receptive anal intercourse with other men. LGV-causing strains of

         According to data reported by the 2017-2019 National Survey of Family Growth, 20.8 percent of women aged 18 to 49 years reported same sex behavior in their lifetime [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. Few data inform the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in women who have sex with women (WSW). Transmission risk probably varies by the specific STI and sexual practice (eg, oral-genital sex; vaginal or anal sex using hands, fingers, or penetrative sex items; and oral-anal sex) [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45,46

         <em>
          C. trachomatis

         infection among WSW can occur [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47-50

         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         between women is unknown, infection also might be acquired from past or current male partners, as many WSW have previously had and continue to have sex with men [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. Additionally, in some studies, a higher proportion of women who have sex with both women and men report high-risk sexual behavior, such as multiple lifetime and recent sexual partners and sex with injection drug users, compared with women who have sex with only men. Nevertheless, even women who have sex exclusively with women remain at risk for STIs, including
         <em>
          C. trachomatis

         .

         In a study of women aged 15 to 24 years attending family planning clinics in the US Pacific Northwest during 1997 through 2005, the rate of
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         infection was unexpectedly higher among those who reported same sex behavior compared with those who reported exclusively heterosexual behavior (7.1 versus 5.3 percent) [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. Over the study period, women who have sex exclusively with women and reported risky sexual behavioral (new, multiple, or symptomatic sexual partners) had higher chlamydia rates than women who reported similar behavioral risks but have sex with only men or with both men and women. Possible explanations for these observations relate to differences in use of reproductive health care services (including chlamydia screening) by WSW, altered biological susceptibility to lower genital tract infection, infrequent use of barrier methods to prevent STI transmission with female partners, trends towards higher risk behaviors in WSW, and particular characteristics of their respective sexual networks.

         Of note, there were also high chlamydia rates among American Indian and Native Alaskan WSW relative to other races, a finding that is consistent with racial/ethnic disparities among women in general. (See

          Incidence and prevalence

         – Infection with
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         is common worldwide; in the US, it is the most frequently reported bacterial infection. Prevalence is consistently highest among young individuals (15 to 24 years of age) (

         <strong>
          Risk factors
         </strong>
         – Other important risk factors include sexual behavior (eg, a new sex partner or more than one sex partner in the prior three months), history of
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         infection or other sexually transmitted infection (STI), and inconsistent condom use. The risk of subsequent
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         infection is particularly high in the few months following a diagnosis of chlamydia or other STI. (See

          Men who have sex with men
         </strong>
         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         There is a high prevalence and incidence of chlamydia among men who have sex with men (MSM), including both urogenital and rectal infections. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Risk in men who have sex with men'

         <strong>
          Women who have sex with women
         </strong>
         – Women who have sex with exclusively women also remain at risk for chlamydia, particularly in the setting of a new, multiple, or symptomatic partners. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Risk in women who have sex with women'

          Importance of screening
         </strong>
         – Because only the minority of
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         infections present as syndromes, screening of asymptomatic persons plays a critical role in detecting the majority of infections. (See
