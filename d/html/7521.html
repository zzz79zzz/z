         Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common and chronic systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology that primarily involves joints. Extraarticular manifestations are also observed, including ophthalmic involvement. Several forms of eye disease can occur in patients with RA, and the clinical course of the ocular disease may be quite variable.
        </p>
        <p>
         The importance of the early diagnosis of ophthalmic disease in the patient with RA cannot be overemphasized, since it permits the timely management of potentially serious sight-threatening complications. The presence of ocular disease may also be an indication of ongoing systemic disease activity [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. However, ocular involvement, in particular severe dry eye, may exist independently from severe articular disease and should be evaluated in all patients with RA regardless of extra-ophthalmic manifestations [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Issues relating to the ocular manifestations of RA are discussed in this review. The anatomy of the relevant structures is depicted in the figure (

         Urgent referral to an ophthalmologist with expertise in the management of ocular inflammation or cornea-external diseases of the eye should be carried out in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who present with any of the following:

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, severe eye disease can occur in patients with RA even without substantial (and sometimes just minimal) ophthalmic symptoms. The two most dreaded ophthalmic complications in patients with RA are necrotizing scleritis (see
         <a class="local">
          'Scleritis'
         </a>
         below) and corneal melting (see
         <a class="local">
          'Corneal inflammation and melting'
         </a>
         below), although the incidence of each appears to have decreased considerably with the adoption of more effective systemic therapeutic agents; use of these therapies has led to reduced rates of nonarticular complications, including in the eye. However, patients with severe RA and those at particularly high risk of mucosal desiccation (eg, those with secondary Sjögren's disease [SjD] and older adults) are still prone to develop severe corneal melts from ocular surface dryness and inflammation.

         </span>
         Corneal involvement in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a significant complication in those with Sjögren's disease (SjD) and sicca syndrome. Corneal inflammation unrelated to dry eye and involving corneal melting may also infrequently occur.
        </p>

         </span>
         The characteristic features of SjD are defined by the presence of dry eyes and dry mouth and are termed keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) and xerostomia, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
         SjD may be either primary or secondary, with RA being the most common underlying condition in secondary disease. While serologic abnormalities such as anti-Ro/SSA antibodies may be present in the setting of secondary SjD, they are not required for diagnosis. Labial salivary gland biopsy is mostly utilized for the diagnosis of primary SjD. The presence of dry eye should be excluded in all patients with RA. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5603.html" rel="external">
          "Diagnosis and classification of Sjögren’s disease"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         KCS, as a manifestation of lacrimal gland pathology, is the most common ophthalmic manifestation of RA; estimates of its frequency range widely given the lack of high-quality studies and depending upon the definition of dry eye, occurring in as many as approximately 15 to 40 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. Symptomatic and objective signs of KCS are central to the diagnosis of SjD, and whenever in doubt, an ophthalmologist should be consulted.
        </p>
        <p>
         Severe dry eye may exist independently from severe articular disease and is not always due to SjD. Dry eye should be evaluated in all patients with RA regardless of extra-ophthalmic manifestations [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].

         </span>
         Patients with SjD often complain of dryness, foreign body sensation, burning, or photophobia. Since ocular surface lubrication is maintained by a balance between fluid secretion and loss (largely by evaporation), patients with KCS have an aggravation of symptoms with exposure to dry or windy environments (which increase evaporative loss of the tear film). There are no features of SjD that are specific or characteristic of RA.
        </p>
        <p>
         Slit lamp examination of patients with KCS reveals conjunctival injection, decreased tear meniscus, and devitalized surface epithelial cells that stain with Lissamine green or

         ). Filamentary keratitis, a condition in which epithelial debris and strands with adherent mucus attach to the corneal surface, is a particularly painful and bothersome consequence of KCS (

          picture 2

         In addition to KCS, corneal involvement in RA may involve significant inflammation, frequently in association with anterior scleritis but sometimes without scleritis (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50444" href="/z/d/graphic/50444.html" rel="external">
          picture 3
         </a>
         ). Symptoms vary and may range from substantial to minimal discomfort, despite the presence of severe disease. Such corneal involvement is rare in RA, occurring in less than 1 percent of patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         One study, for example, found that 43 percent of patients with scleritis had associated corneal involvement [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. A corneal "melt" refers to the clinical characterization of collagen breakdown initiated by significant inflammation in the corneal extracellular matrix.
        </p>
        <p>
         The incidence of corneal melting appears to have decreased considerably with the adoption of more effective systemic therapeutic agents, particularly the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors and other biologics; use of these therapies has led to reduced rates of extraarticular manifestations of RA, including in the eye. However, patients with severe RA, and those at particularly high risk of mucosal desiccation (eg, those with secondary SjD and older adults) are still prone to develop severe corneal melts from ocular surface dryness and inflammation.
        </p>
        <p>
         The severity of the corneal inflammation often parallels the severity of the scleritis but can occur in eyes with little scleral inflammation. However, these entities probably represent different manifestations of similar pathologic processes whose common denominator is collagenolysis. This process may be due in part to the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines; these molecules subsequently trigger corneal cells to produce a number of proteolytic enzymes that can effectively degrade the extracellular matrix [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         There are a number of descriptive terms that depict various stages and extent of corneal inflammation in RA. These include stromal keratitis, sclerosing keratitis, keratolysis, marginal furrowing or guttering, and peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The most common form of corneal melt in RA is PUK. This disorder is not exclusive to RA and may be observed in those with a variety of other systemic immune-mediated conditions, including the vasculitides (eg, granulomatosis with polyangiitis). In PUK, adjacent conjunctival and episcleral tissues reveal an abundance of lymphocytes and macrophages [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. These cells, particularly macrophages, may release significant quantities of inflammatory cytokines and proteases that can exacerbate the stromal breakdown.
        </p>
        <p>
         Management of corneal melt by the ophthalmologist may involve both medical and surgical interventions, and patients should be treated by an expert in the management of ocular inflammation or cornea-external diseases of the eye. Removal of the inciting inflammatory cells may explain the beneficial effect of conjunctival resection [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Ongoing rheumatoid keratitis, as well as corneal scarring from antecedent corneal disease, may require transplantation; however, the visual and survival prognoses of these grafts tend to be relatively poor [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ].

         Corneas compromised by an inadequate tear film are also susceptible to infection. Patients with poor corneal surface, as occurs in RA, are at increased risk of corneal infection. Cases of corneal melting that are progressive and difficult to control should, therefore, be cultured (and recultured if necessary) to exclude microbial disease. Most cases of bacterial corneal ulcers in patients with RA and SjD are associated with Gram-positive organisms, particularly

         Episcleritis may be a manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), occurring in less than 1 percent of ambulatory patients in one series [

          1

         Episcleritis is typically acute in onset, with patients describing discomfort rather than pain (

         The reported incidence of scleritis in patients with RA has ranged from 0.7 to 6.3 percent, although as many as 33 percent of all patients presenting to an ophthalmologist with scleritis may have associated RA [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The true frequency is unknown but likely lower; most of the estimates rely upon data from selected referral populations in specialty clinics.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with scleritis associated with RA are older and tend to have bilateral disease more often than those with scleritis due to nonrheumatoid conditions [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Diffuse anterior scleritis is the most common and least severe form of scleritis (with or without RA) and usually responds well to systemic immunosuppressive therapy (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57004" href="/z/d/graphic/57004.html" rel="external">

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Scleritis is usually characterized by severe, constant, boring pain that worsens at night or in the early morning hours and radiates to the face and periorbital region. The extraocular muscles insert into the sclera, thus ocular movements exacerbate the pain associated with scleral inflammation. The pain generally limits activity and often prevents sleep. Additionally, patients may report headache; watering of the eye; ocular redness, particularly in patients with non-necrotizing anterior scleritis; and photophobia, which is variably present. Symptoms may vary depending upon the severity of scleritis that is present and whether there is tissue necrosis. When there is tissue necrosis in severe disease, there is loss of peripheral innervation, which leads to "paradoxic" lessening of symptoms. (See

         Necrotizing scleritis remains a dreaded ophthalmic complication of RA, although the incidence of necrotizing scleritis has decreased considerably with the adoption of better systemic agents in the long-term management of RA patients.

        <p>
         Severe scleritis can present with advanced necrotizing disease (scleromalacia perforans), in which there may be minimal to no symptoms since the nerves have also degenerated. Histopathology of the affected area is consistent with a rheumatoid nodule, with granulomatous changes and fibrinoid necrosis [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16
         </a>
         ]. Necrotizing scleritis without inflammation (scleromalacia perforans) is characterized by severe thinning of the sclera in an otherwise clinically uninflamed and painless "white" eye. Since such patients do not typically complain of ocular discomfort, it is essential for clinicians taking care of patients with longstanding RA to examine behind the eyelids to fully examine the eyes to identify the asymptomatic thinning of the sclera that often appears bluish (from the subjacent choroid) (

         Patients suspected of scleritis should be referred to an ophthalmologist with expertise in the evaluation and management of ocular inflammation or cornea-external diseases for collaborative treatment of this condition together with the patient's rheumatologist or another expert comfortable in the management and monitoring of patients on immunomodulatory treatments. Collaborative management is important due to the myriad of complications that may ensue from systemic immune suppression, as well as from the underlying disease; this arrangement will hopefully ensure that the regimen can be tailored to the patient's response and that iatrogenic complications can be handled expeditiously.

         acetate 1%), may provide some symptomatic relief, systemic therapy is required to treat and reverse the course of scleritis or corneal ulcerative disease in patients with RA. The therapy needs to be individualized according to the severity of the patient's condition and comorbidities, response to therapy, and side effects. Therapeutic failure is defined as persistent inflammation after two to three weeks of therapy or progression of the scleritis to a more severe variant.

         In non-necrotizing disease, such as diffuse or nodular scleritis, induction of remission is usually first attempted with systemic glucocorticoids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), depending upon the severity of the scleritis [

         The early diagnosis of ophthalmic disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is of high importance because of the need for timely management of potentially serious and sight-threatening complications. In some patients, it may be an indication of ongoing systemic disease activity, although there is not necessarily a direct correlation between the eye and systemic disease. The clinical course of ocular disease in RA is quite variable. (See

         Patients with significant change in visual acuity over a period of several days or weeks, moderate to severe ocular pain, or new-onset redness that is progressive should be referred for urgent evaluation to an ophthalmologist with expertise in the management of ocular inflammation or cornea-external diseases.

         Corneal involvement is common in RA, primarily from Sjögren's disease (SjD), but corneal inflammation unrelated to dry eye, and involving corneal melting, may also infrequently occur. There is some evidence suggesting that patients with poor corneal surface, as occurs in RA, have increased risk of corneal infection, most often with Gram-positive organisms such as
         <em>
          Staphylococcus
         </em>
         or
         <em>

         Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) due to SjD is the most common ophthalmic manifestation of RA, occurring in as many as 15 to 25 percent of patients. Symptomatic and objective signs of KCS are central to the diagnosis of SS, and whenever in doubt, an ophthalmologist should be consulted. Patients with SjD often complain of dryness, foreign body sensation, burning, or photophobia. A number of interventions can be of benefit in SjD. (See

         Corneal disease in RA may involve significant inflammation, either with or without concurrent scleritis. The severity of the inflammation often parallels the severity of the scleritis but can occur in eyes with little scleral involvement. Peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK) is the most common form of corneal melt, the clinical characterization of collagen breakdown initiated by significant inflammation in the corneal extracellular matrix in RA, and may also be seen in other systemic immune-mediated conditions. Treatment may require conjunctival resection, and some severely affected patients eventually require corneal transplantation. (See
         <a class="local">

         Episcleritis may be a manifestation of RA, occurring in less than 1 percent of ambulatory patients. It is typically described as discomfort, rather than pain, which is acute in onset and is usually benign and self-limiting. (See

         Scleritis is associated with a more ominous prognosis than episcleritis, with respect to ocular morbidity and associated extraarticular manifestations. Diffuse anterior scleritis is the most common and least severe form of scleritis (with or without RA). (See

         Necrotizing scleritis "without inflammation" (scleromalacia perforans) is characterized by severe thinning of the sclera in an otherwise clinically uninflamed and painless "white" eye. Since such patients do not typically complain of ocular discomfort, the examination of patients with longstanding RA involves examining behind the eyelids to examine the eyes fully to identify any asymptomatic thinning of the sclera, which often appears bluish (from the subjacent choroid).

         Individualized systemic therapy is required to treat and reverse the course of scleritis or corneal ulcerative disease in patients with RA, although topical medications may provide symptomatic relief. Treatment should be a collaborative effort involving the patient's ophthalmologist and rheumatologist. Surgery is usually not necessary, but the late diagnosis of necrotizing disease with severe scleral thinning or impending globe perforation often requires urgent surgical management. (See

         Anterior uveitis, in the absence of scleritis, is not significantly more common in RA than in the general population, but anterior or posterior uveitis can be found contiguous to anterior or posterior scleritis, respectively. Glaucoma can be seen as a consequence of scleritis. Disorders resulting from therapy that may occur in patients with RA include glaucoma or cataracts due to glucocorticoids, as well as retinal toxicity from antimalarials. (See
