When difficult interactions with patients and/or their family members occur, optimal care delivery can be compromised. All clinicians have patients they find particularly challenging. Most commonly, providers identify patients and families as “difficult” when the clinician is frustrated in the relationship or with how the patient seeks health care [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>This topic review will provide a practical and safety-oriented approach to challenging interactions in palliative care settings, which manifest most commonly as behavioral problems or communication difficulties between patients or their family members and clinicians.</p><p>Issues related to the care of adults who are deemed incompetent, intimate partner violence, and child or elder abuse are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2207.html" rel="external">"Legal aspects in palliative and end-of-life care in the United States"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98592.html" rel="external">"Assessment of decision-making capacity in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15306.html" rel="external">"Intimate partner violence: Intervention and patient management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6600.html" rel="external">"Physical child abuse: Diagnostic evaluation and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3007.html" rel="external">"Elder abuse, self-neglect, and related phenomena"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3238645859"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In this topic, “challenging” or “difficult” refers to specific interactions between health care providers and patients or family members that can range from awkward or uncomfortable conversations to life-threatening behaviors on the part of the patient or family members. There is substantial subjectivity regarding what constitutes a “difficult” interaction; a health care encounter experienced as difficult by one clinician may be welcomed by another as an opportunity to refine clinical skills.</p><p>There is neither a standard of care nor a definitive evidence base to guide the management of challenging interactions in palliative care settings. Most knowledge about this topic is derived from clinical experience, narrative reports, and extrapolation from small studies from other fields (eg, oncology; primary care). Nonetheless, psychological distress and conflictual interactions are common in seriously ill patients, and two related developments in palliative care (the provision of services earlier in the disease course and, increasingly, in ambulatory settings) highlight the relevance of this topic for clinicians.</p><p>There are few data on the frequency of challenging patient and/or family encounters in palliative care, but they seem to be as common as in the rest of health care [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], especially in the setting of intensive care decision-making [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In the United States, the complexity of modern health care contributes to the risk of medical errors and miscommunication [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Such “system issues” add to the stress levels of patients, families, and providers and increase the likelihood of difficult encounters. Despite the common occurrence of challenging interactions, most clinicians do not receive formal training in how to approach these situations.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H101839901"><span class="h1">CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO CHALLENGING INTERACTIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Challenging interactions in the medical setting can be understood as interpersonal exchanges involving strong emotions such as anger, frustration, fear, despair, or humiliation. Associated behaviors include verbal outbursts, threats, destruction of property, or physical altercations. Extrapolations from general medical, oncology and primary care studies suggest that such interactions between patients and clinicians are both common (15 to 30 percent) and consequential [<a href="#rid5">5-9</a>].</p><p>Early reports focused almost exclusively on the characteristics of “difficult” or even “hateful” patients, who were described with labels such as obnoxious, demanding, clingy, entitled, angry, or disruptive [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. More recent research suggests that difficult encounters are due to a complex set of factors that may additionally or alternatively reflect clinician factors or health care system failures [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Three main domains contribute to clinical encounters judged by both patients and clinicians as problematic: patient characteristics, clinician characteristics, and health care system issues<strong> </strong> (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117471" href="/z/d/graphic/117471.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)<em> </em>[<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1578548955"><span class="h1">GENERAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Recommendations for optimal patient interactions include [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1281684962"><span class="h2">Communication</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Demonstrate basic professional manners, eg, try to be on time or come to the patient’s room when you said you would, knock on the patient’s door before entering, sit down whenever possible, ask permission to discuss sensitive subjects, and solicit questions after sharing information and recommendations (“What questions do you have for me?” rather than “Do you have any questions?”).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Be direct, clear, honest, and as specific as possible.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acknowledge limitations in a clinician’s ability to predict treatment responses or outcomes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Provide consistent messaging about the plan of care and behavioral expectations of the patient (employ interdisciplinary team meetings, rounding as teams, and debriefing after behavioral incidents so as to promote consistent care plans).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Minimize fragmented communication by designating a team member as a liaison, and try to limit changes in provider coverage and system complexity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Respond to challenging interactions in a matter-of-fact fashion (avoid pejorative language and name calling in the examination room, with colleagues, and in the medical record).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Be explicit with patients about rules and behavioral expectations.

Further discussions regarding clinician communication are found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83706.html" rel="external">"Communication of prognosis in palliative care"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95284.html" rel="external">"Discussing serious news"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86305.html" rel="external">"Cultural aspects of palliative care"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4280801923"><span class="h1">SPECIFIC CHALLENGING CLINICAL SCENARIOS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3311817549"><span class="h2">Personality disorders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although there is virtually no research evidence about the most effective strategies for addressing patients with personality disorders in the medical setting, this is one of the most challenging clinical scenarios in palliative care. Individuals who struggle with trust, the need for control, or impulsivity are typically the most difficult patients for health care providers to care for. In this section, we specifically focus on patients with well-documented, longstanding, and clinically problematic personality disorders. We stress that all personality traits exist along a continuum and are not necessarily pathological. Nonetheless, stressful situations, such as life-limiting illnesses, promote vulnerability or intensification of maladaptive personality characteristics that may not be clinically apparent when the patient or family member is healthy [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4190542385"><span class="h3">Definition of personality disorders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Personality disorders are defined in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as enduring, stable, and severe patterns of inner experience and behavior that markedly deviate from the expectations of the individual’s culture [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. These characteristics are typically present from adolescence or young adulthood but become particularly problematic during periods of heightened stress, such as serious medical illness. Detailed descriptions for specific personality disorders are also listed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6617.html" rel="external">"Overview of personality disorders"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2541313623"><span class="h3">Recognizing personality disorders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Recognizing potentially challenging behaviors and personality disorders is important for several reasons: to initiate a plan for effective communication and treatment, to limit the risk of providing substandard care to the patient, and to establish realistic expectations for the health care provider.</p><p>Personality disorders can manifest in a variety of problematic behaviors, such as the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Frequent demands for immediate care or specific treatment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nonadherence with treatment or follow-up care</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rejection or refusal of recommended treatments</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Polarization of opinions about providers as either “good” or “bad” (ie, “splitting”)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hostility or aggression, including threats of assault or litigation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intimidation or devaluation of care providers</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unmerited or inappropriate expectations about treatment or care</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Frequent requests for reassurance or demands for unnecessary medical interventions</p><p></p><p>We encourage clinicians to utilize a technique frequently employed by mental health providers: recognizing and describing the emotional reaction that the patient elicits in oneself. Patients who consistently engender strong negative emotional reactions in multiple providers may have personality traits that benefit from the management strategies listed in this section. This alone is inadequate to establish a diagnosis of a personality disorder but should rather serve as a prompt for the clinician to assess their interactions with the patient and modify their approach. Close attention to the patient’s psychosocial history can additionally provide clues about underlying maladaptive personality traits. An absence of substantive social ties or estrangement from most family and friends [<a href="#rid21">21</a>], a history of trauma or abuse [<a href="#rid22">22</a>], and/or multiple episodes of incarceration [<a href="#rid23">23</a>] suggest that the patient may have or be at increased risk for having a personality disorder.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2107077792"><span class="h3">Management approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition to the guidelines outlined above (see <a class="local">'General management strategies'</a> above), we endorse the following approach to the management of patients with known or suspected personality disorders [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Aim for clarity and consistency within the team regarding expectations and consequences. Regularly scheduled team meetings can facilitate this approach. In inpatient settings, it may be necessary for multiple providers to see the patient jointly. Proactive and frequent communication among treating team members (eg, the primary medical and nursing team members, as well as involved consultants, social workers, case managers, etc) can reduce miscommunication and frustration for all involved.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adjust expectations; patients with personality disorders will typically require additional time and resources. For example, clinicians should allot extra time (again, with clear limits) when caring for these patients in both inpatient and outpatient settings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Elicit feedback from colleagues on your communication skills.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Help diffuse tense interactions by demonstrating to the patient that you recognize their distress. However, clinicians should understand that empathic statements (eg, in response to the question “Isn’t there anything more you can do?”) might make matters worse (eg, with patients with borderline personality disorder who cannot control their emotions) [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ask patients to prioritize their agendas and focus on their most important concerns during meetings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identify strategies to increase empathy for the patient. Prior to or after frustrating clinical encounters with the patient, we encourage providers to concentrate on specific aspects of the patient’s history or presentation that elicit compassion or at least sympathy. For example, a patient who is particularly anxious and demanding of certain accommodations may have experienced physical or sexual trauma. Patients with personality disorders can be extraordinarily frustrating, but their suffering is no less deserving of empathy than that of other patients. It may help to remind oneself not to take provocative remarks personally, but to try to understand them as a sign of the patient's distress.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Consider involvement of the hospital ethics committee when the patient’s behavior or the providers’ responses lead to significant deviations in care or an inability to adhere to agreed-upon limitations.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Familiarization with the basic principles of dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) may also help clinicians more effectively approach and respond to patients with behaviors suggestive of borderline and narcissistic personality disorders. While a review of DBT is beyond the scope of this chapter, further information on psychotherapeutic techniques for borderline personality disorder can be found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6618.html" rel="external">"Borderline personality disorder: Psychotherapy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3661249436"><span class="h2">Substance use disorders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinical interactions with patients who have substance use disorders (SUDs) and substance-induced disorders (eg, intoxication, withdrawal) are increasingly common in palliative care, particularly as palliative care is introduced earlier in the illness trajectory and expands into ambulatory care settings. Nearly 20 percent of United States individuals aged 12 or older reported use of an illicit drug in the past year [<a href="#rid26">26</a>], and poisoning remains the leading cause of unintentional injury deaths [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p>SUDs represent a range of conditions resulting from the problematic use of 10 separate classes of substances (eg, alcohol, cannabinoids, opioids, benzodiazepines). SUDs may be classified as mild, moderate or severe; addiction, which is not a specific diagnosis in the DSM-5, is usually used to describe severe and compulsive drug seeking despite negative consequences [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. SUDs are associated with a wide variety of problematic behaviors in the health care setting, which can range from inappropriate use of prescribed medications and demands for controlled substances to dangerous and criminal behavior  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117472" href="/z/d/graphic/117472.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Left untreated, SUDs worsen prognosis and adherence to care [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>]. In addition to complicating pain and symptom management, SUDs perpetuate patients’ suffering and can create conflict with family supports and health care providers. Optimal care of patients who struggle with addiction requires a multidisciplinary approach with behavioral and psychopharmacologic expertise. General management of SUDs are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83726.html" rel="external">"Management of acute pain in the patient chronically using opioids for non-cancer pain"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16754.html" rel="external">"Continuing care for addiction: Components and efficacy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H372431038"><span class="h3">Barriers to optimal care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Despite the prevalence of SUDs, surveys of palliative care providers indicate that there is a need for better training in identifying and managing patients with addiction [<a href="#rid27">27,31</a>]. Unfortunately, many hospitals and outpatient clinics do not have dedicated SUD clinical programs. However, evidence suggests that palliative care providers’ comfort with managing co-occurring SUDs may be improving. A review of the United States Medical Licensing Step Examination revealed the inclusion of multiple pain and symptom management question items assessing knowledge concerning SUDs [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. A 2018 survey of North American palliative care providers reported evidence of improving confidence among palliative care clinicians in managing several aspects of chronic pain in cancer survivors [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p>There is no existing standard of care for screening and management of SUDs in palliative care. In ambulatory palliative care clinics, routine screening for SUDs among patients and family members is variable, with most providers reporting that screening occurs when the provider feels it is appropriate [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. A survey of United States Medicare-certified hospices revealed that 68 percent included substance use in their psychosocial assessments, but these screening questions lacked standardization or detail [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Existing data suggest that many palliative care and hospice programs are inadequately prepared or resourced to assess or manage patients with aberrant behaviors or evidence of drug abuse [<a href="#rid35">35,36</a>]. Most opioid risk screening instruments, such as the Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain (SOAPP; SOAPP-Revised [SOAPP-R] or SOAPP-Short Form [SOAPP-SF]) or the Opioid Risk Tool (ORT), have not been validated for the palliative care population [<a href="#rid37">37,38</a>].

These expectations often occur without adequate training or preparation and pose significant financial, mental, and physical health burdens [<a href="#rid63">63-65</a>]. In modern health care, the proliferation of treatment options also means that families are asked to participate in complex medical decision-making at the end of life. It is unsurprising that serious illness and death can create a high-stress environment for most family members and highlight or renew difficult family dynamics. In particular, transitions of care when there is an acute decline in the patient’s functioning can precipitate greater family distress [<a href="#rid66">66</a>]. In a United States qualitative study of 37 families of patients with advanced lung cancer, 65 percent of families reported conflict about the patient’s care [<a href="#rid67">67</a>]. The psychological consequences of caregiver responsibilities and substitute decision-making are substantial; in a 2001 study of 920 family caregivers of patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit, the prevalence of clinically significant anxiety and depression symptoms was 69 and 35 percent [<a href="#rid68">68</a>].</p><p>Family conflict at the end of life can interfere with the provision of optimal patient care, a source of frustration for providers and caregivers alike.

Not surprisingly, the best approach for reducing family conflict at the end of life is to improve family communication and functioning prior to an acute conflict or crisis. Providers must be sensitive to the diverse experiences and backgrounds of patients and their families. Clear communication about end-of-life goals and preferences between the patient and family can reduce the likelihood of confusion or conflict. However, by the time palliative care specialists have been consulted, the optimal moment for this approach may have passed.</p><p>We also recommend initiating early and frequent family meetings. When possible, the initial family meeting should focus on understanding the family system and individual members, rather than pressing to make specific decisions.
