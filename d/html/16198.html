         Reactions to mosquito bites are caused by an immunologic response to proteins in mosquito saliva. Many people who are bitten by mosquitoes develop an immune response to these proteins. However, only a small proportion of them develop clinically relevant allergic reactions (most commonly large local reactions).
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic briefly reviews the types of reactions that may result from mosquito bites [

         A local cutaneous reaction to a mosquito bite typically consists of an immediate wheal (swelling) with surrounding flare (redness) that peaks at approximately 20 minutes, followed by a delayed, itchy indurated (firm) papule that peaks at 24 to 36 hours and resolves over the next 7 to 10 days [

         The typical clinical course of sensitization and natural desensitization to mosquito salivary allergens was described initially in the 1940s. Five stages are identified, which evolve over months or years in an individual  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63430" href="/z/d/graphic/63430.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. People who have never been exposed to a particular species of mosquito do not develop reactions to the initial bites from such mosquitoes. Subsequent bites result in the appearance of delayed local skin reactions. After repeated bites, immediate wheals develop. With further exposure, the delayed local reactions wane and eventually disappear, although the immediate reactions persist. People who are repeatedly exposed to bites from the same species of mosquito eventually also lose their immediate reactions. The duration of each of these five different stages differs, depending on the intensity and timing of mosquito exposure [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. Not all patients progress through these stages even with repeated bites [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. These typical reactions are annoying but not dangerous. The immunologic basis of sensitization and natural desensitization to mosquito bites was described in the 1990s [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Both immunoglobulin E (IgE) and immunoglobulin G (IgG), as well as lymphocytes, appear to be involved in the development of local reactions. Serum mosquito salivary gland-specific IgE and IgG levels correlated significantly with the size of the immediate skin reaction to mosquito bites, while lymphocyte proliferation to mosquito antigens correlated with the delayed reaction.

         Large local reactions are by far the most common type of allergic reactions to mosquito bites:

         Large local reactions (sometimes referred to as "Skeeter syndrome") typically consist of an itchy or even painful area of redness, warmth, swelling, and/or induration that ranges from 2 to more than 10 cm in diameter. Large local reactions develop within hours of the bite, progress over 8 to 12 hours or more, and resolve within 3 to 10 days [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9

         </span>
         Depending on the location of the bite, large local reactions can involve the entire periorbital region and much of the face or an entire extremity, especially in an infant or child. They can interfere with seeing, eating, drinking, or normal use of an extremity. Severe large local reactions can be accompanied by low-grade fever and malaise [

         By inspection and palpation, it can be difficult to differentiate between allergic inflammation caused by mosquito bites and inflammation caused by secondary bacterial infection (cellulitis) after scratching the bites. It is important to obtain a history of the time of onset of the red, warm swollen area at the site of a witnessed or likely mosquito bite in relationship to the time of the bite. Large local reactions typically begin within hours. Secondary bacterial infections typically begin within days.

         The pathogenesis of large local reactions to mosquito bites was investigated in a study of five otherwise healthy young children ages two to four years who developed large local reactions within hours of witnessed mosquito bites and five age-matched control children who developed smaller typical reactions within hours of mosquito bites [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. All of the children with the large local reactions had been diagnosed initially with bacterial cellulitis and received systemic antibiotic treatment. In two of the children, radiographs were obtained to rule out osteomyelitis underlying the extensive soft tissue swelling.
        </p>
        <p>
         An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure IgE and immunoglobulin G 1-4 subclasses (IgG1-4), recognizing salivary gland allergens of the predominant indigenous mosquito,
         <em>
          Aedes vexans
         </em>
         . In the children with large local reactions, serum levels of IgE, IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 to
         <em>
          A. vexans
         </em>
         salivary gland allergens were significantly elevated as compared with the levels in control children. Specific IgE and IgG concentrations were significantly higher at the end of summer as compared with levels at the end of the following winter after no exposure to mosquitoes had occurred for six months. Thus, it appears that large local reactions involve the same mechanisms (IgE and IgG antibody production) as smaller, typical reactions. Those with large local reactions mount a more robust immune response yet still eventually undergo the same natural desensitization.

         The prognosis of large local reactions to mosquito bites appears to be favorable. Children often continue to develop recurrent large local reactions to mosquito bites for several summers, after which the reactions cease to occur. However, the time to resolution varies [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,11
         </a>
         ], depending on the frequency and intensity of the patient's exposure to mosquitoes, which may be reduced by efforts to avoid mosquitoes and prevent mosquito bites.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a study of sera from 402 children living in the region of Canada where large local reactions to mosquito bites were originally described, levels of mosquito saliva-specific IgE and IgG correlated inversely with age, peaked at one to six months of age, and decreased after five years of age [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. In this geographic region, only 18 percent of 1059 adult blood donors had demonstrable antibodies to mosquito salivary allergens, suggesting that, in most adults, sensitization had been lost and natural desensitization had occurred.

         Skin testing or serum-specific IgE antibody testing for the presence of antibodies to mosquito saliva is not practical, because the only commercially available mosquito reagents are unstandardized whole-body extracts that contain minimal mosquito salivary allergens yet may contain irritant proteins. Obtaining pure mosquito salivary allergen for use in skin tests and in vitro tests by dissection of mosquito salivary glands or by direct collection from living mosquitoes is labor intensive and time consuming. Such allergens are not commercially available. Mosquito bite challenge tests are contraindicated because of the risk of disease transmission through a "wild" mosquito bite and the risk of causing another severe large local reaction in a susceptible patient [

          1,13,14

         The key information needed to distinguish a large local reaction to a mosquito bite from cellulitis is the time elapsed between a witnessed mosquito bite (or exposure to mosquitoes and a likely mosquito bite) and the appearance of an itchy, red, swollen area at the bite site. This interval is typically hours with large local reactions and days with cellulitis. (See

         Different insect repellents are available in a variety of formulations and concentrations. The most effective repellents are DEET (N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) and picaridin [

         Humans attract mosquitoes by their body odor, skin temperature, and exhaled carbon dioxide. DEET-containing products provide excellent protection against bites. The higher the DEET concentration, the longer lasting the protection. DEET in a concentration of 10% can be applied safely to the skin of children over two months of age. DEET is potentially neurotoxic if applied in high concentrations to abraded or sunburned skin or if unintentionally ingested or inhaled. DEET is also a plasticizer, and, as such, it can dissolve mosquito nets, spandex, rayon, and leather, as well as plastic eyeglass frames and watches. (See

         Picaridin blocks insects' ability to locate human skin by forming a barrier on the skin. It is odorless, leaves no residue, and has long-lasting efficacy (between 8 to 10 hours). Overall, in comparison with DEET, it is more effective against mosquitoes and less potentially toxic to humans. Picaridin can be applied safely to the skin of children over two months of age. (See

         Other agents, such as citronella and lemon eucalyptus oil, are less effective and relatively short acting. For example, citronella may be effective for only 20 minutes, and eucalyptus oil may be effective for only two hours.

         A normal cutaneous reaction to a mosquito bite consists of an immediate localized swelling with surrounding redness that peaks at approximately 20 minutes, followed by a delayed, itchy indurated papule that peaks in 2 to 3 days and resolves over the next 7 to 10 days. Many people who are bitten by mosquitoes become sensitized to mosquito salivary allergens, but few develop mosquito allergy. (See

         Large local reactions to mosquito bites are itchy, red, warm swellings that develop within hours of bites and resolve with or without treatment over 3 to 10 days. Large local reactions to mosquito bites are most common in young children and typically cease to occur within a few years. (See

         </strong>
         The diagnosis of large local reactions to mosquito bites is made clinically. The key information needed is the time elapsed, measured in hours (not days) between a witnessed mosquito bite or exposure to mosquitoes and a likely mosquito bite and the appearance of an itchy, red, warm, swollen area at the bite site. Prompt recognition and appropriate treatment helps avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures and unnecessary antibiotic treatment. (See
