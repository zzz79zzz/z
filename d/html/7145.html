         Sickle cell trait is a benign carrier condition, usually with none of the symptoms of sickle cell anemia or other sickle cell diseases. However, knowledge of sickle cell trait is important in many settings, such as preconception counseling and evaluation of rare complications.

         The screening, diagnosis, potential complications, and routine management of sickle cell trait are discussed here.

         Sickle cell trait is a generally asymptomatic carrier condition in which one allele of the beta globin gene (
         <em>
          HBB)
         </em>
         carries the sickle hemoglobin mutation and the other allele is normal, producing hemoglobin AS (Hb AS). If the other beta globin allele carries the sickle mutation or another pathogenic variant in
         <em>
          HBB
         </em>
         such as Hb C or a beta thalassemia variant), the individual will have a sickle cell disease (sickle cell anemia, sickle-beta thalassemia).

         Sickle cell trait is a benign carrier condition. Clinical experience suggests that under most conditions, blood from individuals with sickle cell trait functions normally. As an example, studies investigating intense exercise in individuals with sickle cell trait found in general that intense exertion does not cause pathologic rheologic changes or increase biomarkers of organ damage. (See
         <a class="local">
          'General health'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, sickle cell trait is associated with certain specific medical complications, suggesting that individuals with sickle cell trait may have pathophysiological changes in their red blood cells (RBCs) under abnormal environmental conditions. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical findings'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Sensitive studies of hemolysis markers or microvascular flow in single cell chambers suggest that when the RBCs are exposed to anoxic conditions (which could not occur in vivo), hemoglobin polymerization can occur, there may be impaired microvascular vascular flow at lower oxygen tension, and the plasma metabolome may be altered [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>
         ]. The clinical significance of these biologic changes is not yet known. Further research may help identity high-risk subpopulations of people with sickle cell trait.

         The gene for the sickle hemoglobin mutation is distributed throughout the world, with especially high frequency in sub-Saharan Africa, Mediterranean countries (especially Greece), the Middle East, and parts of India. This high prevalence in certain regions of the world appears to reflect the protective effect of the variant against severe falciparum malaria. (See

         In the United States, results of comprehensive newborn screening have demonstrated an incidence of sickle cell trait of 1.6 percent overall; ethnicity and race information is available in a subset of 13 states, which found incidence rates of 7.3 percent in Black people and 0.7 percent in Hispanic peoples [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. The incidence varied among states, from 0.08 percent in Montana to 3.4 percent in Mississippi. The incidence of sickle cell trait in White people was as high as 0.4 percent in some states. A study in blood donors found similar prevalences (7 percent in Black Americans and 1.7 percent in the blood donor population as a whole) [

         In many parts of the world, newborns are screened routinely for sickle hemoglobin using isoelectric focusing (IEF), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), or hemoglobin electrophoresis, performed on a blood sample obtained during the birth hospitalization. This testing will detect sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait. All states in the United States have been mandated to offer testing since 2006, and the proportion of parents opting out of screening is extremely low [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7113.html" rel="external">
          "Diagnosis of sickle cell disorders", section on 'Newborn screening'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite widespread testing, the reporting of the results to families and pediatricians is highly variable. In the United States, there are no national standards for sickle trait notification or counseling. Each state has its own policy, and if the family is counseled, the information transmitted may be inadequate. Given the variability of counseling by pediatricians, some states offer telephone counseling, but this approach is not optimal [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23-25
         </a>
         ]. Many parents of children with sickle cell trait are unaware of their newborn screening results [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. As examples:

         In a series of 100 mothers who were contacted regarding a positive result for sickle cell trait from newborn screening, fewer than one-half knew their sickle cell status prior to conception; only 34 of 60 (57 percent) with sickle cell disease or sickle cell trait had received professional hemoglobinopathy counseling; and only 23 of 100 (23 percent) reported prenatal discussions about newborn screening [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. Most strikingly, 41 parents of a child with sickle cell trait (41 percent) first learned this result from the study recruiter rather than their pediatrician, birth hospital, or state Department of Public Health.

         In a survey of 15 primary care pediatrics practices in the United States, 28 percent did not actively seek the results of newborn screening, even though the information was generally accessible [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30,31
         </a>
         ]. Subsequent surveys suggest families would like more detailed information concerning sickle cell-related complications following newborn screening, with additional counseling as the child ages [

        <p>
         Even if people are informed of their child's result, they may be unaware of the implications. In one study, 27.5 percent of families undergoing follow-up interviews believed their baby with sickle cell trait might develop sickle cell symptoms, indicating the ongoing misconceptions that persist in families given limited counseling [

         Communication of a screening result consistent with sickle cell trait should always be accompanied by appropriate counseling about the implications for the individual and family members. (See

         Despite routine newborn screening, some individuals may not be screened at birth (eg, immigrants from countries without routine screening), and many others may be unsure of their screening results due to variability in reporting.

         Based on the available studies, publications, and our clinical experience, we believe that any individual who does not have definitive information regarding their sickle cell status and who might benefit from this information (individuals planning a pregnancy, individuals planning intensive exertion at high altitudes) should be offered screening. Ethnicity cannot be used as a routine criterion to eliminate the possibility of sickle cell trait.
        </p>
        <p>
         Screening should be planned, elective, and linked to meaningful counseling, which should include appropriate and accurate information regarding the implications of a positive result [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. Screening of asymptomatic individuals who are unaware of their status is generally deferred until late adolescence/early adulthood because this is optimal for obtaining informed consent and providing counseling regarding the implications of a positive result. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Information about sickle cell trait status in asymptomatic individuals is most important for preconception counseling. Some individuals may also benefit from this information in other settings, such as prior to strenuous athletic participation. These benefits are weighed against potential harms, including risks related to loss of insurance, employment, athletic participation, and other forms of discrimination. (See

          Reproductive counseling
         </strong>
         – Preconception counseling and screening for sickle cell trait should be offered to all individuals of childbearing age and to all couples wishing to have a child. Many people with sickle trait often do not receive complete education on reproductive options, especially in vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic testing (PGT). New educational materials that incorporate stakeholders' comments have been developed, and these materials should be made available to at-risk communities, accompanied with counseling [

         – In the United States, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) requires mandatory testing (or confirmation from newborn screening or other medical testing) for sickle cell trait for all student athletes participating in Division I and II (college level) sports; an "opt-out" provision was removed in 2022 [

        <p>
         Some athletes may receive a diagnosis of sickle cell trait from screening. As is standard clinical care for non-athletes, any athlete identified as having sickle cell trait should receive formal genetic counseling regarding the risk of having a child with sickle cell trait (and implications for other relatives).
        </p>
        <p>
         If there is a possibility of a child, the partner and the athlete should also receive genetic counseling about the couple having a child with sickle cell disease. In addition, the athlete should be informed of the medical risks associated with sickle cell trait.
        </p>
        <p>
         A common misconception in informal genetic counseling and among individuals who have not received any genetic counseling is that if the individual has sickle cell trait and the partner does not have sickle trait, the couple cannot have a child with sickle cell disease. These assumptions are incorrect, as the partner may be heterozygous for another beta globin variant such as Hb C, beta thalassemia trait, Hb D, Hb E, or other beta globin variants that can lead to a child with compound heterozygous sickle cell disease (SCD). Other less common causes of SCD such as maternal or paternal uniparental disomy may also occur. Although maternal and paternal disomy are rare, it is important not to assume nonpaternity merely because the father does not have a hemoglobinopathy variant identified [

         There are no prospective studies indicating that screening for sickle cell trait decreases adverse events. Potential benefits of screening (or discussions about screening) include the opportunity to review and reinforce healthy practices for all individuals such as adequate hydration and avoidance of exertional heat illness or metabolic abnormalities during intensive physical activity. While sickle cell trait is a risk factor for exertional rhabdomyolysis, the risk is modest and similar to other risk factors such as obesity, tobacco use, and medications including statins and antipsychotic agents (hazard ratio 1.54, 95% CI 1.12-2.12). However, a military study involving 47,000 Black soldiers found that those with sickle cell trait did not have a higher risk of death than those without sickle cell trait [

         – Typically, individuals with sickle cell trait have approximately 50 to 60 percent Hb A and 35 to 45 percent Hb S (may be lower with concomitant alpha thalassemia). The percent Hb S increases with age and plateaus at approximately two years, due to switching from fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) to Hb A; Hb A uses the beta globin chain that is affected by the sickle mutation, whereas Hb F does not. The co-inheritance of other hemoglobinopathies such as alpha thalassemia or beta thalassemia may also affect the percent Hb S  (

         Individuals with sickle cell trait are at risk for a few very rare life-threatening complications, including rhabdomyolysis and/or sudden death with prolonged physical activity (military boot camp, training for an athletic competition). In addition, risks are increased for a rare cancer (renal medullary carcinoma), complications of traumatic hyphema, and splenic infarction at high altitudes. Thus, it is important to seek medical attention promptly for hematuria, eye trauma, or severe abdominal pain, especially when traveling to high-altitude areas or in situations with low oxygen tension.

This analysis revealed that after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and fitness, sickle cell trait was not associated with higher (or lower) rates of hypertension, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome (adjusted hazard ratios [HR], 1.2 [95% CI 0.9-1.7]; 1.5 [95% CI 1.0-2.3]; and 1.3 [95% CI 0.9-1.7]).

         Several studies have evaluated systemic hypertension risk in sickle cell trait.

In a 2022 study from the United Kingdom Biobank that included 8019 Black individuals, 699 (8.7 percent) of whom had sickle cell trait, rates of hypertension were increased in those with sickle cell trait (56 percent) compared with controls (48 percent), with an odds ratio of 1.3, (95% CI 1.09-1.55) [

Sickle cell trait increased the risk of end-stage kidney failure and rhabdomyolysis in the diabetes population.

         There are insufficient data to conclude whether sickle cell trait is an independent risk for ischemic stroke. Investigations of brain volume, cerebral blood flow, oxygen, metabolism, and vascular structure in sickle cell trait are not different than controls [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66
         </a>
         ]. However, it is important for any individual with sickle cell trait who has a stroke to have a full evaluation for the cause and not to attribute stroke to sickle cell trait. In addition, it may be worthwhile to evaluate for a variant sickle cell syndrome such as Hb SC disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         This approach of not attributing stroke to sickle cell trait is supported by a 2018 meta-analysis that assessed the association of sickle cell trait with ischemic stroke in 19,664 African-American individuals [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67

         The prospective Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities [ARIC] Study, which evaluated the risk of stroke in a population-based sample of 3497 African Americans for over two decades, found a slight increase in the risk of stroke in individuals with sickle cell trait compared with hemoglobin AA (13 versus 10 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-2.0; crude incidence rate 7.1 versus 5.3 events per 1000 person-years) [

         Sickle cell trait likely has an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD), a more rapid decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR), and an increased incidence of albuminuria. Two large studies from 2022 analyzed the impact of sickle cell trait on CKD.

         The United Kingdom Biobank study found a statistically significant association of sickle cell trait with CKD (prevalence, 5.6 percent in sickle cell trait compared with 3.5 percent in controls; OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.11-2.29) [

In addition to CKD, there was also an association of sickle cell trait with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD; 0.9 percent, versus 0.2 percent in controls; OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.45-10.36) and rhabdomyolysis (1.6 percent, versus 0.3 percent in controls; OR 5.1, 95% CI 2.14-11.37).

         ]. This dataset was used to determine the association of sickle cell trait with medical complications prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and during and post-COVID-19 infections. In the pre-COVID-19 analysis, sickle cell trait was associated with CKD, diabetic kidney disease, hypertensive kidney disease, pulmonary embolism, and cerebrovascular disease. While rates of COVID-19 were similar in individuals with and without sickle cell trait, individuals with sickle cell trait who developed COVID-19 had a higher risk of mortality than controls. Acute kidney failure was more common in the individuals with sickle cell trait and was a major factor in the increased mortality rate. Sickle cell trait was also associated with a greater risk of declining kidney function following COVID-19, both in individuals with preexisting CKD and those with previously normal kidney function.

         A 2018 meta-analysis of sickle cell trait complications, which was informative but limited by the lack of high-quality data, found an increased risk of proteinuria and CKD in individuals with sickle cell trait [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65
         </a>
         ]. In the one high-quality study evaluating proteinuria, individuals with sickle cell trait had a 32 percent risk of albuminuria, compared with 20 percent in those without sickle cell trait, a 1.86-fold increased risk. Two high-quality studies evaluated CKD and found an increased risk (relative risk [RR] 1.57, 95% CI 1.34-1.84). Among two high-to-moderate-quality studies evaluating dialysis-dependent ESKD, one reported an increased incidence of ESKD compared with individuals without sickle cell trait (hazard ratio [HR] 2.03, 95% CI 1.44-2.84); a similar study of moderate quality did not find any association between sickle cell trait and ESKD. More research is needed to determine composite effect of confounding conditions such as including diabetes and hypertension. (See

         Hyposthenuria refers to an impairment in the ability to concentrate the urine; the risk is related to early CKD and is increased in individuals with sickle cell trait. Hyposthenuria is responsible for nocturnal enuresis in older children with sickle cell trait and increases the likelihood of dehydration in at-risk situations such as exertional rhabdomyolysis [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65,73,74
         </a>
         ]. It occurs because the renal medulla has a hyperosmolar, acidic, hypoxic environment that can induce hemoglobin polymerization in sickle cell trait cells. This environment, together with a low flow state in the renal medulla, reduces the number of vasa recta and damages the normal vascular structure. It is important to counsel individuals with sickle cell trait about this risk so that they can ensure adequate fluid intake and prevent dehydration. (See
         <a class="local">

         Screening for kidney disease in individuals with sickle cell trait is controversial, and the optimal screening is unknown, with issues similar to the general population. A reasonable approach is to screen individuals who have sickle cell trait and risk factors for CKD (hypertension, diabetes) with serum creatinine and urinalysis, with further evaluation based on the results.

          Hematuria

         There is also an unlikely possibility of renal medullary carcinoma.

         ]. The United Kingdom Biobank study reported a trend towards an increased risk of renal medullary carcinoma in individuals with sickle cell trait that did not reach statistical significance; the number of cases was very low (0.4 percent with sickle cell trait, versus 0.2 percent in controls; OR 2.2, 95% CI 0.51-6.78) [

         It is appropriate to evaluate patients with sickle cell trait who have unexplained hematuria or severe flank pain using imaging studies. Individuals with sickle cell trait presenting with hematuria should inform the clinician of their sickle cell trait status and the possibility of renal medullary carcinoma; however, we do not screen for this tumor in asymptomatic individuals with sickle cell trait [

          Splenic infarction

Both altitude level and the percentage of Hb S appeared to be risk factors. However, the altitude level at which splenic infarction occurred could not be clearly established, since 39 percent of the cases occurred at an altitude &lt;3,000 meters. Hb S was &gt;35 percent in 88 percent of the cases. Conservative treatment, including changing altitude, was therapeutic in most cases, though splenectomy was required in over a third of cases.

         The risks of PE and DVT may be more pronounced in some settings. One area of concern is in pregnant and postpartum women. However, one of the largest analyses found a similar incidence of peripartum PE and DVT in non-Hispanic Black women with and without sickle cell trait (0.44 versus 0.49 percent) [

         <a href="#rid95">
          95,101-108
         </a>

         <a href="#rid42">
          42,109-112

         <a href="#rid113">
          113
         </a>
         ]. Proposed contributing factors include heat exposure, dehydration, myocardial ischemia, and arrhythmias.
        </p>
        <p>
         The best available evidence suggests that individuals with sickle cell trait have a slightly increased risk of rhabdomyolysis but not an increased risk of death with strenuous physical activity, as long as proper measures to prevent heat illness are taken. These measures include gradual acclimatization, breaks for hydration and cooling, and prompt intervention for concerning symptoms, as discussed in detail separately. (See

         Evidence for an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis but not increased mortality comes from a 2016 cohort of 47,944 Black soldiers who served in the United States army during the years 2011 to 2014 for whom data on sickle cell trait status were available [

         – There were 391 episodes of rhabdomyolysis during the study period. The magnitude of increased risk attributable to sickle cell trait was relatively small (hazard ratio [HR] 1.54, 95% CI 1.12-2.12). In comparison, the HRs for rhabdomyolysis attributable to smoking, obesity, antipsychotic medications, and statin agents were 1.4, 1.5, 3.0, and 2.9, respectively.

          Mortality
         </strong>
         – There were 96 deaths from all causes during the study period. The risk of death for those with sickle cell trait was similar to those without sickle cell trait (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.46-2.13). Causes of death for the seven individuals with sickle cell trait included battle injuries and other (unrelated) medical conditions. The sole individual who died from an episode of rhabdomyolysis did not have sickle cell trait.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         A 2021 review of 377 cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis in individuals in the Air Force suggests this complication remains a potential problem to all service people exposed to high-risk activities [
         <a href="#rid114">
          114
         </a>
         ]. However, with universal precautions as a policy, these results suggest that individuals with sickle cell trait were at no greater risk of severe rhabdomyolysis than those without sickle cell trait.
        </p>
        <p>
         The finding of increased rhabdomyolysis is consistent with data from two large population-based studies involving approximately two million military recruits undergoing basic training from 1977 to 1981 and approximately two million college athletes studied from 2004 to 2008 [
         <a href="#rid109">
          109,115
         </a>
         ]. Both studies found an increased rate of sudden death in individuals with sickle cell trait (eg, 32.2 per 100,000 military recruits with sickle cell trait, compared with 1.2 per 100,000 without sickle cell trait) [
         <a href="#rid109">
          109
         </a>
         ]. In 2018, the United States Army reported on risk factors for mild heat injury, as well as heat stroke in sickle cell trait-tested African-American soldiers in a setting in which precautions were used for all soldiers to mitigate exercise-induced illness [
         <a href="#rid116">
          116
         </a>
         ]. In this setting, sickle cell trait was not associated with heat injury. Risk factors for heat-associated injury included prescription medications for psychotic illness and overweight or obesity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Exercise-induced deaths in the military decreased dramatically following implementation of sickle cell trait screening in 1982; a general reduction in training intensity and earlier recognition of heat-related injuries also occurred and may have contributed to the decline in deaths. In athletes with sickle cell trait, the risk of sudden nontraumatic death is intensely debated, and rare deaths continue to be reported [
         <a href="#rid112">
          112,117,118
         </a>
         ]. However, it remains unclear whether there is a causal relationship, and data from large epidemiologic studies are limited. In a report of 160 nontraumatic deaths in high school and college athletic activities between 1983 and 1993, cardiovascular conditions (eg, cardiomyopathies, arrhythmia syndromes) accounted for 74 percent of the deaths [
         <a href="#rid119">
          119
         </a>
         ]. Seven deaths were attributed to rhabdomyolysis and sickle cell trait. A report of 10 college-level football players with sickle cell trait who died during the early 2000s found that one-half had been performing serial sprints or drills without interval rest periods at the time of sudden death [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         As discussed below, we favor institution of practices to reduce rhabdomyolysis for all individuals undergoing strenuous physical activity, and rapid intervention should symptoms occur, regardless of sickle cell trait status. (See

         Very rarely, individuals with sickle cell trait show symptoms of sickle cell disease such as anemia or acute chest syndrome. Often these individuals have co-inherited another hemoglobin mutation that decreases hemoglobin solubility (eg, Hb S-Antilles; Hb Quebec-Chori; Hb S-Oman; Hb Jamaica Plain) [
         <a href="#rid120">
          120-122
         </a>
         ]. In one case, a boy who was genetically heterozygous for the sickle mutation had mosaicism for cells in which only the sickle mutation was expressed due to post-zygotic uniparental disomy [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Another rare cause of symptomatic sickle cell trait occurs when sickle cell trait coexists with pyruvate kinase deficiency, which lowers the hemoglobin oxygen affinity, resulting in hemoglobin S polymerization and sickling [
         <a href="#rid123">
          123
         </a>
         ]. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Evaluation for these other inherited conditions is appropriate in individuals who are heterozygous for the sickle mutation yet have symptoms of sickle cell disease, and it may be appropriate to manage these individuals more similarly to those with sickle cell disease, depending on the severity of findings.
        </p>
        <p>
         In contrast, those who co-inherit another beta globin variant (beta thalassemia, Hb C) are considered to have sickle cell disease rather than sickle cell trait. (See

         In most cases, individuals with sickle cell trait are managed similarly to the general population.

         African American women have increased risk of thrombosis with hormonal birth control, which should be explained to the individual.

         Adequate counseling for families with sickle cell trait is important at various stages of family planning. The ethnicity or race of the parents should not influence family screening and counseling, because beta globin mutations occur in all ethnic groups and sickle cell trait is relatively common in mixed ethnic/racial parents.
        </p>
        <p>
         Screening of the parents is a priority to offer prenatal diagnosis to at-risk couples, and it is the responsibility of the clinician to ensure that this counseling occurs [

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Individuals who learn that they have sickle cell trait during preconception or perinatal testing should be informed that they are carriers of the sickle cell mutation, and they should receive appropriate counseling regarding their own health (see
         <a class="local">
          'Information/counseling to be provided with results'

         It may be difficult to leukoreduce blood from donors with sickle cell trait, due to blockage of the leukoreduction filters.

         As noted above, concerns have been raised regarding increased risks of rhabdomyolysis and possibly increased mortality in the setting of intensive physical training in individuals with sickle cell trait compared with the general population, although there is a lack of high-quality evidence that screening improves clinical outcomes. (See

         The American Society of Hematology (ASH) has urged athletics programs to adopt universal interventions to reduce exertion-related injuries and deaths, since this approach can be effective for all athletes regardless of their sickle cell status [
         <a href="#rid135">
          135,136

        </p>
        <p>
         If screening has been done, the sports counseling component by the clinician and trainer should be detailed [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42,43
         </a>
         ]. The recommendations and protocols by the National Athletic Trainers' Association (NATA), the American College of Sports Medicine, and NCAA provide detailed and useful guidelines for counseling [

        <p>
         Regardless of screening policies, anticipatory interventions to prevent dehydration and hyperthermia during intensive exercise or physical training need to be enforced and expanded for all athletes, including those with sickle cell trait, particularly at the onset of conditioning training. The following guidelines for athletic participation and physical training may be useful; these apply to individuals with sickle cell trait as well as to the general population:

          Prompt medical attention for problems
         </strong>
         – If any athlete with sickle cell trait begins to struggle in any drill, the drill should be stopped and medical attention should be prompt. The athlete should lie down, vital signs should be checked, supplemental oxygen given by face mask, and the athlete cooled if necessary. Failing immediate improvement, emergency personnel should be alerted (in the United States, 911 should be called), an automated external defibrillator placed, and an intravenous line with normal

          Modifications to exercise

         – Some sports and medical experts recommend a modified exercise program be instituted for all individuals with sickle cell trait. However, these recommendations should be provided to all individuals participating in sports, in particular those with specific risk factors such as reduced conditioning, excess weight, medication use, asthma, or other comorbid medical conditions [
         <a href="#rid139">
          139
         </a>
         ]. The athlete with sickle cell trait should build up slowly in training, tempo of drills should be slowed, and longer periods of rest given. The athlete should run no timed serial sprints or miles and should avoid lengthy, sustained sprints or any all-out exertion beyond two to three minutes without a rest. Work/rest cycles should be adjusted for heat and altitude. The athlete should stay vigorously hydrated, and any asthma must be controlled.

         Sickle cell trait does not cause death. Rarely, an individual with sickle cell trait may die from a condition such as renal medullary carcinoma, which is more common in individuals with sickle cell trait than the general population. Certain vaso-occlusive events such as splenic infarction at high altitudes have been reported, but causality has not been demonstrated. (See

         The presence of sickled cells on autopsy of an individual with sickle cell trait cannot be used to infer that death was due to sickling, as sickling is likely to be a postmortem phenomenon that occurs in the anoxic environment following death. (See

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.

          Genetics and prevalence
         </strong>
         – Sickle cell trait is a benign carrier condition (heterozygous state) for the sickle hemoglobin variant. It is found in over 300 million people worldwide, and 2.5 million people in the United States. The frequency is higher in sub-Saharan Africa, Mediterranean countries (especially Greece), the Middle East, and parts of India. (See

         <strong>
          Screening indications
         </strong>
         – In many parts of the world, newborns are routinely screened for sickle cell trait; however, reporting of results to the family is highly variable. Screening of asymptomatic individuals who are unaware of their status is generally deferred until late adolescence/early adulthood. We generally offer screening to appropriate individuals as part of preconception counseling and prior to athletic participation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Newborn screening'

         <strong>
          Screening methods
         </strong>
         – Screening for sickle cell trait is done with hemoglobin electrophoresis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68806" href="/z/d/graphic/68806.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ) or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Sickle cell trait is established by the presence of both hemoglobin A (Hb A) and hemoglobin S (Hb S), with the amount of Hb A greater than Hb S (the FAS pattern)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68806" href="/z/d/graphic/68806.html" rel="external">
          figure 1

          table 3
         </a>
         ). The sickle prep test and sickle solubility test are generally avoided. Unlike sickle cell disease, individuals with sickle cell trait have a normal hemoglobin level, hematocrit, reticulocyte count, red blood cell indices, and peripheral blood smear. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Counseling
         </strong>
         – Communication of a screening result consistent with sickle cell trait should always be accompanied by appropriate counseling about the implications  (

          Pregnancy
         </strong>
         – Pregnancy is well-tolerated in individuals with sickle cell trait, and sickle cell trait does not appear to be a risk factor for large or small gestational age infants. (See
         <a class="local">

          Laboratory testing
         </strong>
         – We generally offer testing for sickle cell trait in appropriate individuals with these findings, and in some cases, management differs if sickle cell trait is identified. Sickle cell trait can lead to lower glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values, which may have implications for diabetes testing and monitoring. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Appropriate laboratory testing'

         <strong>
          Medical care
         </strong>
         – In most cases, individuals with sickle cell trait are managed similarly to the general population. However, counseling should be offered by a qualified individual regarding the risk of having a child with sickle cell disease. Individuals with sickle cell trait who are planning to become pregnant or already pregnant should obtain testing for the other parent to allow determination of the likelihood of having a child with sickle cell disease. Individuals with sickle cell trait should receive unrestricted access to birth control and should be informed of a possible increased risk of thrombosis with hormonal birth control methods. Like all individuals engaging in intensive exercise and training, appropriate preventative measures for dehydration and heat related injury should be instituted. While the risk of kidney disease may be increased, there is no evidence to support more aggressive screening and subsequent treatment compared to general population monitoring. The potential risk of thrombosis should be mitigated by improved adherence to standard thromboprophylaxis for hospitalized ambulatory patients. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Management and preventive care'

         <strong>
          Blood and stem cell donation
         </strong>
         – Individuals with sickle cell trait can donate blood or hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and can received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for HSC mobilization. Blood from a donor with sickle cell trait generally is not transfused to an individual with sickle cell disease because it will be more difficult to decrease the Hb S percentage. (See

          Intensive exercise
         </strong>
         – There are ongoing discussions regarding routine screening of athletes for sickle cell trait. Anticipatory interventions to prevent dehydration and hyperthermia during intensive physical training need to be enforced and expanded for all athletes. If any athlete with sickle cell trait begins to struggle in a drill, the drill should be stopped and medical attention should be prompt. Failing immediate improvement, emergency personnel should be alerted; an automated external defibrillator placed; an intravenous line with normal
