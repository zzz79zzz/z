         Itching of the anus or perianal skin is a common disorder usually arising from benign conditions. It may be transient or chronic and difficult to treat. This topic will review the etiology, diagnostic approach, and management of patients with anal pruritus.

         Anal pruritus is estimated to affect 1 to 5 percent of the general population [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         ]. However, most of these patients probably do not come to medical attention. Anal pruritus is more common in the fourth to sixth decades of life and has a higher prevalence in males [

         Approximately 75 percent of cases of anal pruritus are secondary to inflammatory, infectious, systemic, neoplastic, and anorectal disorders that contribute to or underlie the development of pruritus [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. Idiopathic anal pruritus likely results from perianal fecal contamination and resultant trauma from wiping and scratching.

         Inverse psoriasis can involve the intertriginous areas, including the inguinal, perineal, genital, intergluteal, axillary, and inframammary regions, but unlike most cases of psoriasis, there is no visible scaling  (

         Contact dermatitis is characterized by macular erythema, hyperkeratosis, or fissuring  (

         ). Irritant contact dermatitis results from exposure to substances that cause physical, mechanical, or chemical irritation of the skin. Irritant contact dermatitis can be caused by common exposures used repeatedly on a daily basis (eg, soapy water, cleansers, rubbing alcohol) and, in some cases, with one exposure (eg, bleach). Individuals with compromised skin (atopic dermatitis, dry skin) and with light-colored or "fair" skin are at a higher risk. (See

         Atopic dermatitis is characterized by thickened skin, increased skin markings (lichenification), and excoriated and fibrotic papules  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55375" href="/z/d/graphic/55375.html" rel="external">
          picture 7
         </a>
         ). Most patients have manifestations of atopic dermatitis by five to seven years of age. In adults, the flexural areas (neck, antecubital fossae, and popliteal fossae) are most commonly involved and only in rare cases are lesions seen in the gluteal area. Pruritus, chronic and recurring dermatitis, a positive family history of allergic disease, and an early age of onset of symptoms suggest the diagnosis. (See

         Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a debilitating, chronic, suppurative process involving the skin and subcutaneous tissue. The usual initial presentation of HS is of recurrent, painful, and inflamed nodules  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65188" href="/z/d/graphic/65188.html" rel="external">
          picture 8

         ). The nodules may rupture, discharging purulent, sometimes malodorous material. Persistent disease leads to the formation of sinus tracts, end-stage "tombstone" comedones, and scarring. (See

         Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in situ (Bowen’s disease) appears as a well-demarcated plaque with crusting and scaling. Perianal intraepithelial adenocarcinoma (Paget disease) usually occurs in the seventh decade of life and appears as a slowly expanding, sharply demarcated erythematous plaque that can be eczematous, crusting, scaling, or ulcerated.

         Idiopathic anal pruritus likely results from perianal fecal contamination and resultant trauma from wiping and scratching. Fecal soilage in patients with anal pruritus may be due to diarrhea or seepage due to an abnormality of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex and a lower threshold for internal anal sphincter relaxation, or transient internal anal sphincter relaxation [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. In a case-control study that included 23 men with anal pruritus and 16 controls who underwent anorectal electromyography and manometry, patients with anal pruritus had a greater rise in rectal pressure during internal sphincter relaxation (29 versus 18 mmHg), a greater fall in anal pressure (39 versus 29 mmHg), and a longer duration of internal sphincter relaxation (29 versus 8 seconds) as compared with controls. Abnormal internal sphincter relaxation was associated with the development of anal pruritus within one hour in 17 (74 percent) patients.

         The clinical assessment of a patient with anal pruritus begins with a history, physical examination, and anoscopy. The decision to perform laboratory testing and endoscopic evaluation should be guided by the clinical assessment and/or response to initial therapy. The evaluation of patients with generalized pruritus is discussed in detail, separately. (See

         A physical examination including a digital examination of the anorectum should be performed to identify anorectal and dermatological diseases that are associated with anal pruritus  (

         ). In patients with an anorectal fistula, the external opening may be visualized or palpated as induration just below the skin if the external opening is incomplete or blind. The external opening may be inflamed, tender, and/or draining purulent fluid, and the perianal skin may be excoriated and inflamed. (See

         Perianal plaques with a distinct boundary are suggestive of psoriasis, erythrasma, or neoplasia. Perianal erythema may be seen in patients with chronic steroid use and candidiasis. Hyperpigmentation of the skin may result from chronic inflammation due to an infection or chronic discharge. The presence of palpable inguinal lymph nodes is suggestive of a neoplasia or sexually transmitted disease. A biopsy of the skin should be performed when a neoplasia is suspected or if the diagnosis is unclear. (See

         Internal hemorrhoidal bundles appear as bulging, purplish-blue veins. Prolapsed internal hemorrhoids appear as dark pink, glistening, and sometimes tender masses at the anal margin. Thrombosed external hemorrhoids are acutely tender and have a purplish hue. An anal fissure can be visualized as a superficial linear tear in the anodermal lining of the anal canal distal to the dentate line and most commonly occurs in the posterior midline. (See

         In patients with systemic or refractory symptoms or a change in bowel habits, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or hematochezia, we perform endoscopic evaluation with a colonoscopy. While performing a colonoscopy, the distal rectum and anal verge should be inspected in retroflexion, with the rectum partially insufflated. Complete insufflation should be avoided as this causes the rectal vault to distend and stretch, thereby flattening internal hemorrhoids.

         In patients with anal pruritus, initial management consists of improving anal hygiene, avoiding moisture in the anal area, removing offending agents, dietary modification, and protection of skin. Reassurance and conservative treatment are successful in approximately 90 percent of patients with idiopathic anal pruritus [

         Anal pruritus is estimated to affect 1 to 5 percent of the general population. However, most of these patients probably do not come to medical attention. Anal pruritus is more common in the fourth to sixth decades of life and has a higher prevalence in males.

         Approximately 75 percent of cases of anal pruritus are secondary to inflammatory, infectious, systemic, neoplastic, and anorectal disorders that contribute to or underlie the development of pruritus. Idiopathic anal pruritus likely results from perianal fecal contamination and resultant trauma from wiping and scratching. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Etiology'
         </a>

         The clinical assessment of a patient with anal pruritus begins with a history, physical examination, and anoscopy. In patients with systemic symptoms or a change in bowel habits, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or hematochezia, we perform laboratory testing and endoscopic evaluation with a colonoscopy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnostic approach'
         </a>

         We suggest initial management of anal pruritus with conservative treatment and reassurance (

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). This includes improving anal hygiene, avoiding moisture in the anal area, removing offending agents, dietary modification, and protection of the perianal skin with the use of a protective ointment containing

          zinc oxide
         </a>
         . In patients with severe pruritus, 1 percent
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8535" href="/z/d/drug information/8535.html" rel="external">
          hydrocortisone
         </a>
         cream applied twice daily for one to two weeks can relieve symptoms. Hydrocortisone should not be used for more than two weeks to avoid skin atrophy. For patients whose symptoms are worse at night, an antihistamine (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9369" href="/z/d/drug information/9369.html" rel="external">
          diphenhydramine
         </a>
         ) may be helpful until local measures take effect. In addition, in patients with inflammatory, infectious, systemic, neoplastic, and anorectal disorders contributing to anal pruritus, it is important to treat the underlying etiology. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnostic approach'
         </a>
         above.)

         Patients with continued symptoms should be carefully reassessed, paying specific attention to the type of ongoing symptoms, the degree to which symptoms have improved or worsened, and compliance with initial management. In addition, we perform laboratory testing and, if not already performed, a colonoscopy. In patients with idiopathic anal pruritus and refractory symptoms, we suggest a trial of topical
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8840" href="/z/d/drug information/8840.html" rel="external">
          capsaicin
