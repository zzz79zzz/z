The treatment of MPPS is multimodal and tailored to the individual patient. Treatment plans typically include physical therapy, pharmacotherapy, and psychological counseling. The general approach is to block or reduce ongoing stimuli that lead to pain, identify and avoid triggers, and treat symptom flares. The process is defined as chronic after six months; however, patients early in the disease course often benefit from the same interventions, and such interventions may prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic.</p><p>This topic will discuss the treatment of MPPS. As there are few trials evaluating treatment efficacy in this population, our approach is based on the limited available data and clinical experience. Also, some therapies are extrapolated from the treatment of nonpelvic myofascial pain, such as myofascial pain associated with the back, neck, shoulder, or jaw. Topics related to the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of MPPS and chronic pain syndromes are reviewed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5480.html" rel="external">"Myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in females: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116196.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of chronic non-cancer pain in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126111.html" rel="external">"Approach to the management of chronic non-cancer pain in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the terms "women" or "patients" as they are used in the studies presented. However, we encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling and treatment needs of transgender and gender-diverse individuals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H66154027"><span class="h1">DEFINITION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>MPPS is a non-articular musculoskeletal pain disorder characterized by contracted bands of skeletal muscle that contain discrete, painful nodules, also called trigger points [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. MPPS is thought to originate at the trigger point [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. A neuropathic component resulting from inflammatory mediator release likely plays a role as well. Patients do not uniformly respond to available treatments, which likely reflects multifactorial sources of pain.</p><p>In our experience, the initial pain source is typically the pelvic floor muscles, which then impact the pelvic girdle (hip, low back, lower abdominal muscles). The pain can be perceived internally or become "external" (ie, perceived as abdominal, ischial tuberosity, and/or vulvar pain). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5480.html" rel="external">"Myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in females: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5480.html" rel="external">"Myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in females: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H991531292"><span class="h1">OUR APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>One goal of treatment is to help women understand that MPPS can be a chronic, waxing and waning condition that may require long-term management. We counsel patients that the etiology, triggers, and risk factors for MPPS are incompletely understood. Women who develop MPPS, especially those with severe symptoms, likely have a predisposition for symptom recurrence in response to certain triggers, including stress, physical trauma, or other painful events such as a urinary tract infection (UTI). In our experience, it is reasonable to expect 80 percent improvement in symptoms following the treatment plan, and the goal for women is fewer and less intense flares of pain. This goal is especially achievable if the symptoms are relatively recent in onset and there are times of relatively decreased pain. An additional long-term goal is to recognize and manage flares early with techniques that the women learn during treatment and that they know will be helpful. This element of control is important to reducing the anxiety that can accompany pain flares. In addition, we help women understand that improvement can be a slow process, and since there is not a "one size fits all" treatment, finding the correct therapy for them can take some trial and error, time, and patience. Based on our clinical experience, we counsel patients who have chronic or more severe symptoms that it may take longer for symptoms to improve and that they will be more likely to need additional treatment modalities.</p><p>We apply a multidisciplinary approach that addresses both physiological and psychological aspects of MPPS. Some women undergo surgical evaluation as well. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5435.html" rel="external">"Chronic pelvic pain in adult females: Treatment", section on 'Targeted therapies: Surgical'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2991433398"><span class="h2">Initial treatment loop</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment interventions do not have to occur in isolation or in a specific sequential order. In general, patients begin with pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT) to address overall short, tight pelvic floor muscles that are the hallmark finding on examination. In our experience of caring for females with MPPS, PFPT is the one therapy that is needed by all and is the key to reversing some of the changes that occur in MPPS, especially tight painful muscles and alleviation of trigger points. Adjunctive therapy can include local trigger point injections (TPI), medical therapy, and sacral neuromodulation (for symptoms of frequency and urgency that often accompany MPPS and bladder pain). Patients are also prescribed psychological counseling, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and/or sex therapy, to help reduce pain, manage symptoms, restore function, and reduce stress, if needed. Lastly, we aim to help individuals identify and avoid triggers that can cause symptom flares and support them when these flares occur.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We recommend that all women begin treatment with PFPT. The initial evaluation and treatment with PFPT and medical treatment typically require three to four months, after which the patient is reassessed. Women with moderate to severe symptoms (eg, interfering with daily activities or sleep) can also receive adjunctive medical therapy aimed at reducing their most bothersome symptoms (eg, muscle relaxants for women with disrupted sleep). Women with lower back, hip, or other musculoskeletal issues need to address these areas in combination with PFPT.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Initial use of external therapy – For individuals who find internal PFPT painful, the physical therapist can start with external work only until the woman reaches a point where internal physical therapy is possible. This is especially true of women who have had a history of sexual abuse. We have also employed yoga targeted at pelvic pain and techniques for self-release of accessible external muscles, particularly for those who experience a long waitlist to get into PFPT. Both allow women to begin simple self-treatment. Individuals who have pain that does not respond may be candidates for <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9161" href="/z/d/drug information/9161.html" rel="external">onabotulinumtoxinA</a> (BTXA) injections, as discussed in the bullet below.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Role of telehealth and related modalities – Additionally, since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused shutdowns and access to physical therapy was reduced, the authors encourage women to use online resources for stretches and yoga targeting pelvic floor release. Although there is no objective study showing that these resources are effective, patients have reported positive effects in addition to certain levels of control in addressing their symptoms. We plan to formally evaluate outcomes of self-directed pelvic floor releases.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Supporting data and approach for PFPT are presented in separate discussions. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>(See <a class="local">'Pelvic floor physical therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5491.html" rel="external">"Myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in females: Pelvic floor physical therapy for management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Women who are unable to immediately attend PFPT, typically for logistical reasons or because of severe pain prohibiting PFPT, are offered pharmacotherapy with neuromodulating medications, pelvic floor TPIs, or topical <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/z/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> gel or muscle relaxers, given primarily at night. Nighttime dosing avoids fatigue and reduces daytime side effects. These treatments can facilitate PFPT or help control symptoms while women are waiting to start PFPT. Rarely, women with severe pelvic floor hypertonicity are offered pelvic floor injections with BTXA first. This is only done if PFPT is impossible to perform because of pelvic floor hypertonicity or other rare circumstances that require pelvic floor relaxation. Pain relief does not necessarily correlate with a relaxed pelvic floor, however, especially if symptoms have been chronic or other sources of pain exist.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>After three to four months of initial treatment, women who are notably improving with PFPT continue treatment until symptoms stabilize. The goal is to have patients improve enough that they can manage symptoms and minor flares with exercises/stretches or treatment initiated at home. This treatment may include short-term muscle relaxers as well. For women taking concomitant medications, some are able to taper or stop their medical therapy once symptoms stabilize, while others need to continue these medications indefinitely due to return of pain when they taper or apprehension about stopping medications.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Women with minimal or no improvement are reassessed and may be referred for evaluation with a physiatrist or orthopedist to assess for extra-pelvic sources of pain. These women may also be advised to try additional adjunctive medical therapy. If the pelvic floor remains hypertonic, we discuss the benefits and risks of BTXA injections. We reassess these women every three to four months and continue through this treatment loop until symptoms are improved and function is restored to the greatest degree possible. We also may involve a pain specialist at this point to help guide treatments or potential intervention targeting specific nerve roots based on their assessment. The additional involvement of a pain management team, including working with a pain psychologist, is important to attempt desensitization of central pain upregulation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We also recommend referral for evaluation and treatment of concomitant psychological symptoms (eg, depression or anxiety, difficulty with sleep).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For women who are unable to access PFPT, we proceed with mostly medical therapies as well as periodic TPIs, if needed, for flares and if found to be beneficial for the patient, if indicated. Often, oral muscle relaxers or vaginal valium suppositories may help ease flares due to the muscle-relaxing properties of valium. (See <a class="local">'Vaginal diazepam'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3264559875"><span class="h2">Treatment of concurrent bladder symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment of bladder symptoms, including dysuria, bladder pain, and urgency, is often needed in women with MPPS. These symptoms often coexist with those of MPPS. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8087.html" rel="external">"Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome: Management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H838190989"><span class="h2">Maintenance therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once symptoms are manageable, we educate women to monitor for early signs of a flare and intervene quickly. Although there are limited data, we generally advise a quick return to physical therapy if symptoms do not respond to patient-initiated treatments to prevent a long-term or more severe flare. However, even with early treatment, severe flares may occur, and women may need to go through a new course of treatment and reevaluation for possible underlying pathology. Common triggers include UTI or other infections. It is important to evaluate for other pelvic or gastrointestinal issues.</p><p>Management of MPPS can be viewed as long-term control of a chronic underlying predisposition. One challenge in assessing response is that symptoms can improve because of a true treatment effect, because the natural history of the disease includes waxing and waning of symptoms over time, because of the Hawthorne effect (ie, improvement in symptoms simply because the patient is in a clinical trial), because the associated musculoskeletal process resolves, or some combination of these [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PELVIC FLOOR PHYSICAL THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Primary treatment of MPPS involves manual myofascial release and stretching, followed by strengthening of affected areas via pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT). Ideally, PFPT is performed by a physical therapist with specialized training in soft tissue manipulation and rehabilitation of the pelvis. The importance of finding an experienced pelvic floor physical therapist cannot be overemphasized. There is little benefit from physical therapy regimens that do not include internal vaginal release work in addition to external soft tissue manipulation and trigger point release. It is important that the patient not focus on tightening or strengthening the levator muscles (eg, Kegel exercises or electrical stimulation) early in the course of treatment, as this can worsen symptoms [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In addition, an understanding of interrelation of posture, pelvic girdle, and other orthopedic issues and their effect on the pelvic floor is important to ensure all contributing factors are addressed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5491.html" rel="external">"Myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in females: Pelvic floor physical therapy for management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4277723130"><span class="h2">Common components of a treatment session</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>During a treatment session, the patient lies in the supine position as the physical therapist works to manually release the trigger points and the restricted movement of the connective tissues and muscles of the vagina, abdomen, hips, thighs, lower back, and, in some cases, the rectum. Some therapists use other modalities, such as dry needling, to hasten the release of painful tissue around surgical scars [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The details of PFPT for the treatment of myofascial pain are presented separately.</p><p>Treatment sessions are usually 45 to 60 minutes and are scheduled once or twice per week for 8 to 12 weeks. Improvement can be apparent after as few as six sessions. However, in our experience, women with chronic pain often require more than 12 weeks of treatment, and some will require treatment up to one year or beyond. The duration of symptoms typically correlates with the time course for treatment (ie, women with symptoms of longer duration often require longer treatment) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. After treatment is completed, follow-up sessions may be needed periodically to treat flares of pain. Flares can develop as a result of stress, injury, sexual activity, or other physical activity (eg, prolonged sitting). If the patient has to travel a long distance to see a physical therapist, daily intensive physical therapy for a week (longer if needed) can be useful.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4078994487"><span class="h2">Data supporting PFPT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Data supporting PFPT are limited but reassuring [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. A trial of 474 women treated with PFPT for multiple pelvic complaints, including pain, reported clinically significant improvement on standardized pelvic floor distress questionnaires after a mean of 9.3 treatment sessions [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In a trial that randomly assigned 81 women with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome to either PFPT or global massage (control), women in the PFPT group had over twice the response rate compared with global massage (59 versus 26 percent) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In addition, a small trial comparing PFPT and trigger point injections in women with pelvic floor myalgia reported a greater than 50 percent improvement in symptoms for each group [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Two small prospective observational studies of patients with bladder symptoms and a high tone pelvic floor provided some evidence of benefit from manual myofascial physical therapy [<a href="#rid7">7,12</a>]. Similarly, in a retrospective review of 146 women with myofascial pelvic pain who received transvaginal PFPT, 63 percent of patients reported significant improvement in pain scores [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Pain score improvement was proportional to the number of complete physical therapy visits. In contrast to myofascial physical therapy, at least one study has reported that global massage does not appear to be beneficial [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1112867542"><span class="h2">Self-treatment and telehealth</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although self-treatment with vaginal dilators or massage devices (commercial name TheraWand) is possible for some women, in our experience, these techniques tend to exacerbate pain early in treatment and do not replace proper myofascial release techniques. As an alternative, a physical therapist can educate the patient's partner about techniques that can be performed at home. For women with trigger points in deeper vaginal muscles, a willing partner may be able to provide hands-on treatment if an experienced therapist is not available locally, preferably after consultation and direction from a knowledgeable physical therapist [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. We have found that, although self-treatment can help alleviate some symptoms or flares, it is not as effective as assessment and treatment using myofascial release techniques in reversing some of the underlying dysfunction. Telehealth options have become available, but more data need to be collected to assess efficacy. It is unlikely that remote options are a complete substitute for an experienced physical therapist implementing myofascial release techniques.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3362147388"><span class="h2">Yoga as adjunctive treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although the data supporting yoga for MPPS are sparse and often extrapolated from the treatment of other chronic pain syndromes [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>], we advise yoga therapy, either in person, virtually, or using a recording, that is targeted at pelvic floor pain. This gives women an opportunity to proactively address some of their muscle tightness while waiting to get into PFPT or as an adjunct to physical therapy once started. We recommend only using resources from certified pelvic floor physical therapists.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">DRUG TREATMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3498675176"><span class="h2">Commonly used</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In our practice, first-line oral medications include <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8483" href="/z/d/drug information/8483.html" rel="external">gabapentin</a>, tricyclic antidepressants, or a muscle relaxant because of their efficacy, tolerability, and relatively safe side effect profile. This list reflects our experience as well as the available literature and is not meant to be applicable to all women with MPPS. In fact, switches are often made due to side effects or lack of efficacy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Gabapentin</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8483" href="/z/d/drug information/8483.html" rel="external">Gabapentin</a> (commercial name Neurontin) is one of our first choice options for medical treatment of neuropathic pain because it has demonstrated efficacy (for treatment of postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy), is well tolerated, has few contraindications, and has a wide range of dosing options [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>]. Data regarding benefit in the treatment of pelvic pain are mixed. One trial of 306 women with chronic pelvic pain treated with gabapentin versus placebo did not show significant improvement in pain or other aspects of the women's lives [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Two small trials reported that gabapentin improved pain scores [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. For now, its use represents off-label use [<a href="#rid18">18,23</a>]. A detailed discussion of gabapentin for females with chronic pelvic pain is available elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5435.html" rel="external">"Chronic pelvic pain in adult females: Treatment", section on 'Anticonvulsants (gabapentin and pregabalin)'</a>.)</p><p>We prescribe <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8483" href="/z/d/drug information/8483.html" rel="external">gabapentin</a> for women with moderate to severe pelvic or vaginal pain that is chronic and is interfering with sleep or the ability to perform normal daily activities. We initiate therapy with gabapentin 100 mg at bedtime and increase the dose as needed by 100 mg every three to four days, up to 300 mg three times per day. Many women will have a symptom response at lower doses; we give women written instructions on how to slowly increase the dose until they feel relief. The dose may be increased further depending upon the patient's symptoms and ability to tolerate side effects. The maximum tolerated dose in long-term clinical trials is 2400 mg per day in divided doses. It may take four to six weeks to observe an effect.

While cyclobenzaprine has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of fibromyalgia or muscle spasm, few studies have specifically examined the effect of cyclobenzaprine on myofascial pain [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. We have used cyclobenzaprine for women with MPPS, usually in combination with other treatments. We typically start at 5 mg at bedtime and increase to 10 mg if necessary. Most women experience sleepiness with cyclobenzaprine, limiting its use to bedtime. This is often a first-line choice for individuals who prefer not to take a daily medication or to use at the time of pain flares if it is effective for their pain. The sedation effect also helps with sleep. In our practice, we have found the response to cyclobenzaprine and other muscle relaxers to be a potential indicator of response to pelvic <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9161" href="/z/d/drug information/9161.html" rel="external">onabotulinumtoxinA</a> (BTXA) injections.

However, studies of SNM for the treatment of MPPS are lacking. As sacral neuromodulation is an invasive procedure, we only use it for the subpopulation of women with painful bladder syndrome or refractory overactive bladder. In our experience, neuromodulation for urinary urgency and frequency in the setting of myofascial pain is sometimes effective to relieve pain but not enough to warrant its use in the absence of frequency and urgency. Additionally, even if there is a marked improvement of pain, there is often a gradual increase in pain and habituation to the stimulation, despite reprogramming. Therefore, we do not usually recommend sacral neuromodulation as an initial or long-term treatment of MPPS.</p><p>Small trials and case reports have reported benefit with the use of neuromodulation in women with neuropathic pelvic pain.

A systematic review evaluated 134 studies of acupuncture or dry needling (no anesthetic injection) for management of myofascial trigger point pain [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. The review included studies in which one group was treated by needling directly into the myofascial trigger points, while a control group received no treatment, usual care, indirect local dry needling, or a placebo intervention. There was a trend toward treatment efficacy, but major differences in study design, quality, and size limited the ability to analyze combined data. A trial that compared Ashi acupuncture with TPI in 35 women diagnosed with abdominal myofascial pain related to chronic pelvic pain reported similar improvements in pain for both groups [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. However, an earlier systematic review of acupuncture for chronic pelvic pain showed no benefit [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. More and better trials of acupuncture are needed.

Although the injections can be quite uncomfortable, MPPS-related pain is often completely relieved for some duration. As demonstrated with other muscle pain syndromes, TPI can be useful as a diagnostic tool; if the patient's pain improves or resolves after injection, then MPPS is likely the cause [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. A complete or significant response to a TPI is often a good prognostic indicator. TPIs have demonstrated efficacy in a variety of neuromuscular pain syndromes (including abdominal cutaneous nerve entrapment, muscles and nerves of the pelvis [eg, obturator nerve, piriformis syndrome], sciatica, and headaches) and total levator pain [<a href="#rid50">50-54</a>].</p><p>For women with chronic, severe symptoms, even temporary relief from pain can provide a better understanding of the underlying process and motivation to follow through with treatment. We discuss with women that injections are not usually curative or as effective as physical therapy. However, a good response with decreased pain for an interval of time is often a good prognostic sign, indicating that addressing the pelvic floor will be helpful in reducing the pain.</p><p>TPIs can be given by any health care provider who is familiar with pelvic floor anatomy, who can assess for trigger points, and who has received training in pudendal block injections. Although some gynecologists and urologists provide this procedure, specialists in Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery (FPMRS) generally perform the most comprehensive evaluation for trigger points and are often able to inject deeper muscle groups. We locate trigger points by palpating the soft tissues of the pelvic floor and gently applying pressure to areas that feel firm or taut. Clinically, patients are often able to indicate which areas of the muscles are most painful and therefore require injection. Although some clinicians use electromyography or ultrasound to locate trigger points, these modalities do not appear to improve the efficacy of TPIs in studies of nonpelvic trigger points [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. Further studies are needed to determine if imaging or other modalities provide superior accuracy for TPIs. For clinicians who access some of these muscles transcutaneously, through the gluteus muscles, using ultrasound to access the correct muscle may be helpful. Generally, we have found that accessing the pelvic floor muscles transvaginally is the most efficient and comprehensive way to address all of the affected muscle groups.</p><p>The optimal medications and doses for TPIs are not known; mixtures of local anesthetics and glucocorticoids have been associated with reduced pain [<a href="#rid11">11,56</a>].

For most women, we inject 1 to 3 mL doses of 0.25 percent bupivacaine (maximum total volume 30 to 40 mL, depending on patient's weight) throughout the pelvic floor using a pudendal kit. Trigger points in the abdomen may also be injected, as needed, using a long (at least 1 inch) small gauge (27 g) needle. For select women with focal areas of burning pain near the introitus, we add 40 mg of triamcinolone once monthly for no more than three to four injections.</p><p>Some experts use a pudendal block (10 mL of 0.25 percent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9169" href="/z/d/drug information/9169.html" rel="external">bupivacaine</a> injected 1 cm inferior to the right and left ischial spines) for temporary relief of myofascial pain [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. We do not generally use pudendal blocks since most patients get sufficient pain relief with TPIs, although we do also target the area of the pudendal nerve with 1 to 2 mL of Marcaine. Additionally, unlike pudendal blocks, several tender muscle groups are directly injected during TPIs, based on palpation. There is also anecdotal evidence that just introducing a needle into a trigger point (dry needling) can aid with pain control. This may be an added benefit of TPI as opposed to pudendal block.</p><p>Duration of pain relief varies, with most patients having at least four hours of relief and some having relief for up to several days. If the injections are immediately followed by physical therapy (within one to two hours), the patient may note more soreness than when injections do not precede the therapy. This is because deeper physical therapy is possible when pain has been eliminated by the injections. Occasionally, a patient will have a flare of pain after the injections and experience no relief.

Each 100-unit vial is diluted in 10 mL of preservative-free <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a>, and 1 to 2 mL are injected into each palpable trigger point and tender area throughout the pelvic floor. The dose is based on severity as well as concern for side effects. Most patients tolerate the injections in the office setting, although a subset of patients requires sedation and injections in the operating room. Local application of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/z/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> jelly before injection and ice packs after injection may be helpful for injection-related pain. Some women also request premedication with anxiolytics or pain medications for in-office injections. We have tailored our practice to start with 100 units to avoid the side effects and assess relief with the lowest dose. This dose also allows some women who wish to try intrapelvic BTXA to self-pay if it is not covered by insurance.</p><p>Most patients begin to feel relief of pain within one to two weeks. Physical therapy and TPIs may be resumed one week after the BTXA injections. We use BTXA alone or in combination with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9169" href="/z/d/drug information/9169.html" rel="external">bupivacaine</a>. Either liposomal and regular bupivacaine can be used; choice is determined by availability and cost. Repeat injections of BTXA are considered if the first series of injections was effective and the woman did not have significant side effects, but should not be given sooner than 12 weeks after the previous BTXA injection. The manufacturer recommends no more than 400 units of BTXA (for any indication) per 12 weeks [<a href="#rid77">77</a>]. We do not exceed 300 units. If women receive BTXA in other areas of the body for other indications, we will coordinate timing of injection to be within 10 days.</p><p>One potential limitation of BTXA treatment is its cost. Some commercial insurers in the United States do not cover the cost of BTXA for treatment of MPPS, and the cost of self-payment (USD $550 to $700 per 100 unit-vial, with up to three vials needed) is prohibitive in many cases. In these cases, we recommend communicating with the insurer's medical director to advocate for the use of BTXA given the low risk, potential benefits, and limited alternatives to intrapelvic BTXA, especially in those women who have tried multiple other treatments without success.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3217140566"><span class="h2">Glucocorticoid</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In our practice, we do not typically inject glucocorticoids as a single agent into the pelvic floor. We prefer a glucocorticoid/anesthetic mixture (injection of 1 to 3 mL <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9169" href="/z/d/drug information/9169.html" rel="external">bupivacaine</a> 0.25 percent followed by injection of 1 to 2 mL <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10015" href="/z/d/drug information/10015.html" rel="external">triamcinolone</a>). We inject the anesthetic first, in the targeted areas, followed by injection of the triamcinolone. Separating injections allows better mapping of the areas to be targeted by locating all painful areas and achieving complete resolution of pain, then targeting the steroid accordingly. In our experience, this combination works particularly well for women with entry dyspareunia and for women with urethral burning when administered periurethrally. Anecdotally, approximately 70 percent of women with periurethral or introital burning respond. If a response is noted, we repeat these injections at monthly intervals for up to three to four months.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4245502044"><span class="h1">COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most commonly used and studied psychological interventions for pain, including vulvar and sexual pain [<a href="#rid78">78-81</a>]. We encourage patients to participate in a CBT program targeted at treatment of chronic pain syndromes for both symptom reduction and stress management. Women with symptoms suggestive of posttraumatic stress disorder are referred to a mental health specialist for further evaluation and treatment. Access to CBT may be limited by lack of practitioners and/or cost. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14612.html" rel="external">"Overview of psychotherapies", section on 'Cognitive and behavioral therapies'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/500.html" rel="external">"Posttraumatic stress disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126111.html" rel="external">"Approach to the management of chronic non-cancer pain in adults", section on 'Psychological therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20"><span class="h1">TREATMENT OF FLARES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Women with MPPS often develop symptom recurrence months or even years after symptoms have quieted. Despite efforts to avoid known triggers, symptom flares can develop. While we generally treat flares with the approach listed below, the order and type of treatment can vary based on the severity and location of symptoms in a particular patient and also based on which treatments were successful previously. Additionally, these treatments are often encouraged after initial diagnosis while the patient is waiting for pelvic floor physical therapy. Women are instructed to avoid any therapy or manipulation that provokes symptoms.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23"><span class="h2">Conservative treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We educate all women with MPPS regarding the use of conservative treatments, such as ice, heat, stretching, self-massage, and exercise, to temporarily relieve the discomfort associated with MPPS flares. Stress management is also an important part of the treatment plan, as chronic daily or intermittent stress can exacerbate muscle tension. Lastly, we reassess their medical therapy and adjust to address the specific flare symptoms.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Stretch/massage</strong> – Patients with accessible trigger points can treat themselves. We instruct our patients to massage, skin roll, and perform scar release in painful areas. Some patients find this more useful than rest, ice, heat, and exercise [<a href="#rid82">82</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Skin rolling is performed by applying a light moisturizing cream or lotion and using both hands to gently grasp sections of skin in the affected area (eg, abdomen, inner or outer thigh) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The skin is rolled gently between the fingers, with the goal being to release restrictions in the underlying connective tissue. A sharp pinching sensation and erythema are common reactions, especially early in treatment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Similarly, scar release is performed with the fingers grasping the tissue on either side of the scar. The scar should be gently pulled away from the body and rolled between the fingers. The tissue can also be lightly and deeply massaged.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ice</strong> – Most of our patients find that application of ice to painful areas of the abdomen or perineum provides short-term relief of pain, especially during a flare or after sexual intercourse. Ice can be placed intravaginally by filling a finger of a nonsterile examination glove or a condom and inserting into the vagina. We generally recommend applying ice for no more than 20 minutes at a time.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Heat</strong> – For women who cannot tolerate ice, heat can also be soothing during a flare. A hot water bottle or heating pad may be used, although care must be taken to avoid burns.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Exercise</strong> – Women appear to view exercise as more effective for decreasing muscle pain than men [<a href="#rid82">82</a>]. There is no single exercise proven to reduce pain or tightness related to MPPS. We suggest regimens that include stretching (eg, yoga, Pilates). Exercises to strengthen the core, pelvis, or both should be approached with care, as this can sometimes lead to increased pain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Stress management</strong> – Anxiety predisposes some women to continuously contract their muscles, including those of the pelvic floor. Depression and anxiety often coexist with chronic pain and may exacerbate pain [<a href="#rid83">83</a>]. This association has even been noted in adolescents [<a href="#rid84">84</a>]. In our experience, uncontrolled anxiety and pain are associated with poorer outcomes and the need for a longer treatment course. Treatment of MPPS, like that of any type of chronic pain, must include management of depression and anxiety. It is important to include a multidisciplinary approach in these women, with the use of psychotherapy or psychopharmacology as needed [<a href="#rid85">85</a>]. Use of stress reduction techniques such as deep breathing, visualization, mindfulness meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, or prayer are suggested, as well.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Reassess medical therapy</strong> – Women experiencing a flare may require additional medical support to help them through the episode. For example, we may prescribe a muscle relaxant for women with muscle spasms, tricyclic antidepressants for women with sleep issues, and increase the dose of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8483" href="/z/d/drug information/8483.html" rel="external">gabapentin</a> for women who have previously been well controlled. We often start with a short course of muscle relaxers, especially if they have been effective in the past. Narcotics are seldom helpful and are not advised for a flare.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2098291074"><span class="h2">Bladder pain or irritative voiding symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If painful or irritative voiding symptoms are manifested during a flare of MPPS, a bladder instillation of a local anesthetic and other medications can be helpful. A solution of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/z/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9928" href="/z/d/drug information/9928.html" rel="external">sodium bicarbonate</a>, and heparin can provide short-term relief. In our practice, we also add <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10015" href="/z/d/drug information/10015.html" rel="external">triamcinolone</a> to reduce presumed inflammation. Instillations are often done in the office, although patients can learn to administer the solution at home through self-catheterization. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8087.html" rel="external">"Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome: Management", section on 'Intravesical therapies'</a>.)</p><p>Urinary analgesics, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9761" href="/z/d/drug information/9761.html" rel="external">phenazopyridine</a> or a combination drug of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9938" href="/z/d/drug information/9938.html" rel="external">methenamine-sodium phosphate monobasic-phenyl salicylate-methylene blue-hyoscyamine sulfate</a>, can provide temporary relief of dysuria and urgency. Phenazopyridine 100 to 200 mg can be used for up to three times a day for three consecutive days if needed. However, long-term use of phenazopyridine is not recommended due to the theoretic risk of hepatotoxicity. Prior to use, the possibility of urinary tract infection should be excluded. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8063.html" rel="external">"Acute simple cystitis in adult and adolescent females", section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H525996874"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

MPPS is thought to originate at the trigger point, although the full etiology is not known. A neuropathic component resulting from inflammatory mediator release likely plays a role as well. Patients do not uniformly respond to available treatments, reflecting multifactorial sources of pain. (See <a class="local">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient education and treatment approach</strong> – One goal of treatment is to help women understand that MPPS can be a chronic, waxing and waning condition that may require long-term management. We apply a multidisciplinary approach that addresses both physiological and psychological aspects of MPPS and that is tailored to the individual patient. The general approach is to determine the trigger and then block or reduce ongoing stimuli that lead to pain. (See <a class="local">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial treatments</strong> – Treatment interventions do not have to occur in isolation or in a specific sequential order. In general, patients begin with pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT) to address overall short, tight pelvic floor muscles that are the hallmark finding on physical examination. Additional treatments, such as medication and trigger point injections, are then added to the PFPT regimen as needed. We generally proceed with treatments in the order listed below. Trial and error with different treatment modalities is often needed to achieve symptom improvement.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Pelvic floor physical therapy</strong> – For women with MPPS, we suggest initial treatment with PFPT (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). In our experience, most patients benefit from a trial of PFPT to reduce tight painful muscles and alleviate trigger points. Adjunctive therapy can include local trigger point injections (TPI), medication, botulinum toxin injections, and/or sacral neuromodulation. Initial evaluation and treatment with PFPT typically requires three to four months, after which the patient is reassessed and proceeds through the treatments below as needed. (See <a class="local">'Pelvic floor physical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Trigger point injections</strong> – For women who are unable to immediately attend or decline PFPT, typically because of severe pain prohibiting PFPT or for logistic reasons, we suggest trigger point injections (TPI) (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). TPIs improve tolerability and enhance the response to physical therapy as well as often accelerate progress. An alternate approach for women who cannot access TPIs is treatment with topical <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/z/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> gel. (See <a class="local">'Trigger point'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Medication</strong> – For women with moderate to severe myofascial pelvic pain that is interfering with their usual activities, we suggest <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8483" href="/z/d/drug information/8483.html" rel="external">gabapentin</a> as first-line pharmacologic therapy (in addition to PFPT) (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Additional first-line medication treatments include <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9473" href="/z/d/drug information/9473.html" rel="external">pregabalin</a>, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants because of their efficacy, tolerability, and relatively safe side effect profile. This list reflects our experience as well as the available literature and is not meant to be applicable to all women with MPPS. (See <a class="local">'Commonly used'</a> above and <a class="local">'Gabapentin'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Reassess for persistent symptoms</strong> </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Improvement with PFPT</strong> – After three to four months of initial treatment, women who are notably improving with PFPT continue treatment until symptoms stabilize. The goal is to have patients manage symptoms with exercises or treatments that they can perform at home. (See <a class="local">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Persistent pain</strong> – For women who are unable to receive physical therapy due to severe pain, women with persistent pain after six to eight sessions of physical therapy, women who do not make progress with physical therapy, or for women with an identifiable muscle spasm that correlates with their pain symptoms, we suggest botulinum toxin A injections (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Botulinum toxin'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Continued lack of improvement</strong> – Women with minimal or no improvement are reassessed and may be referred for an orthopedic evaluation to assess for extra-pelvic sources of pain. These women may also be advised to try additional adjunctive medical therapy. (See <a class="local">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Use of cognitive behavioral therapy</strong> – Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most commonly used and studied psychological interventions for pain, including vulvar and sexual pain [<a href="#rid78">78-81</a>].
