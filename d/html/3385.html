The optimal treatment requires a multidisciplinary team approach from a head and neck surgeon, radiation oncologist, and medical oncologist, among other clinicians [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Most data suggest that for locoregionally advanced OPSCC, RT and organ-sparing surgery both have comparable survival outcomes and quality of life. However, high-quality randomized trials comparing these treatment paradigms are lacking. Similarly, data are limited for which subset of patients with locally advanced disease may benefit from radiation therapy versus surgery. Further details are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115014.html" rel="external">"Treatment of human papillomavirus associated oropharyngeal cancer", section on 'Surgical resection'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115014.html" rel="external">"Treatment of human papillomavirus associated oropharyngeal cancer", section on 'Is there a role for treatment deintensification?'</a>.)</p><p>For all patients with OPSCC, regardless of HPV tumor status, when selecting between a nonsurgical approach (eg, RT with or without chemotherapy) and primary surgery (eg, transoral robotic surgery [TORS], transoral laser microsurgery [TLM], or more extensive resection techniques), discretion must be used to optimize efficacy, reduce risks of long-term toxicity, and preserve basic oropharyngeal function (eg, swallowing and airway protection). This is especially true for patients with HPV associated tumors, who have a greater likelihood of long-term survival following curative-intent therapy compared with those who have non-HPV associated disease. Clinical trials investigating treatment deintensification in HPV associated oropharyngeal carcinoma are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115014.html" rel="external">"Treatment of human papillomavirus associated oropharyngeal cancer", section on 'Is there a role for treatment deintensification?'</a>.)</p><p>Nonsurgical approaches are often used to treat patients with locoregionally advanced OPSCC. However, surgery followed by either postoperative (adjuvant) RT or concurrent chemoradiation is a reasonable alternative in appropriately selected patients for whom postoperative functional morbidity is anticipated to be minimal. A systematic review of 44 observational studies suggested comparable survival outcomes between TORS and RT, but improved functional outcomes with TORS [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. However, the functional outcome results were likely biased given that no randomized trials were included, and most patients treated with TORS were selected for earlier stage disease compared with those treated with RT. </p><p>Surgical and nonsurgical approaches have subsequently been compared in randomized studies of patients with locoregionally advanced OPSCC, which are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115014.html" rel="external">"Treatment of human papillomavirus associated oropharyngeal cancer", section on 'Surgical resection'</a>.)</p><p>The selection of therapy for patients with locoregionally advanced HPV associated OPSCC  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef129299" href="/z/d/graphic/129299.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) is discussed separately.

However, surgical approaches remains an option in carefully selected patients where postoperative functional morbidity is predicted be minimal. These and other situations where a surgical approach may be indicated are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Patient selection (surgery)'</a> below.) </p><p>Situations for nonsurgical approaches include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Unresectable</strong> <strong>disease </strong>– Some patients are determined preoperatively to have unresectable disease. These patients may be offered concurrent chemoradiation (or single-agent RT if there is a medical contraindication to chemoradiation), induction chemotherapy followed by RT, or sequential therapy (induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation). (See <a class="local">'Concurrent chemoradiation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Sequential therapy is also reasonable approach in select patients with advanced primary or nodal disease. Sequential therapy can also be used to restore function prior to chemoradiation in patients with tumors resulting in significant trismus, impaired swallowing and tongue function, or airway obstruction requiring tracheostomy. Further details on the indications for sequential therapy are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3392.html" rel="external">"Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: Approaches combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy", section on 'Sequential therapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients for whom surgery would result in poor postoperative functional outcomes</strong> – Such patients typically include those with significant soft palate or base of tongue tumor involvement where the surgical defect required to generate negative margins would significantly impair speech or swallowing.

For such patients, the primary intent of RT is curative, regardless of oropharyngeal function. (See <a class="local">'Older adults'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Concurrent chemoradiation</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2281916559"><span class="h4">Rationale</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Various clinical trials in patients with locally or regionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck have established the role of combinations of chemotherapy and RT as an organ-preservation technique. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115014.html" rel="external">"Treatment of human papillomavirus associated oropharyngeal cancer", section on 'Chemoradiation'</a>.)</p><p>Data supporting the addition of chemotherapy (generally cisplatin- or carboplatin-based regimens) to RT comes from the Meta-Analysis of Chemotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer (MACH-NC). In patients with head and neck cancer, this meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy of chemotherapy administered as neoadjuvant (induction), concurrent (concomitantly) with RT, or adjuvant therapy following definitive locoregional treatment (surgery and/or RT) [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>]. Results of this meta-analysis for the entire study population are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3392.html" rel="external">"Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: Approaches combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy", section on 'Chemotherapy plus definitive locoregional therapy'</a>.)</p><p>When the MACH-NC was analyzed by tumor subsite, among the 5872 patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma (both HPV and non-HPV associated), at median follow-up of 5.6 years, the addition of concurrent chemotherapy to locoregional therapy decreased the risk of death (hazard ratio 0.88, 95% CI 0.82-0.93) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. This corresponded to an absolute improvement in five-year overall survival of 8 percent with concurrent chemotherapy [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. There was also no clear survival benefit with adjuvant or induction chemotherapy, even when specific induction chemotherapy regimens were assessed. Similarly, in another randomized trial, among those with oropharyngeal carcinoma, the addition of induction chemotherapy to locoregional treatment did not improve survival [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Sequential therapy and induction chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>It is not clear if these data apply to HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer. Most of the studies included in the MACH-NC were conducted prior to the demographic and biologic shift in oropharyngeal cancer associated with HPV. However, treatment paradigms are similar for HPV associated and non-HPV associated oropharyngeal cancers. Additional studies conducted specifically for HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115014.html" rel="external">"Treatment of human papillomavirus associated oropharyngeal cancer", section on 'Treatment approaches to deintensification'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2690316049"><span class="h4">Radiation schedule and technique</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The standard RT approach for patients with advanced locoregional disease treated with concurrent chemoradiation is to use once-daily fractionation with intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) and image-guided RT (IGRT). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3406.html" rel="external">"General principles of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer", section on 'Three-dimensional conformal RT'</a>.)</p><p>We do not offer altered-fractionation RT schedules in patients with non-HPV associated oropharyngeal carcinoma receiving concurrent chemoradiation, as no clear clinical benefit has been demonstrated over standard (once-daily) fractionation. Furthermore, twice-daily treatment schedules place greater time demands on the patient and the treatment facility, and they may create problems with compliance. Specific definitions for altered RT schedules (hypofractionation, hyperfractionation, and accelerated fractionation) are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3409.html" rel="external">"Definitive radiation therapy for head and neck cancer: Dose and fractionation considerations", section on 'Paradigms of dose and fractionation modification'</a>.)</p><p>Altered-fractionation schedules, including hyperfractionation and accelerated RT, have been investigated to overcome accelerated repopulation and to safely escalate the dose. When RT is administered as a single modality (ie, without chemotherapy), hyperfractionation regimens improve both local control and overall survival compared with once-daily (conventional) fractionation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3409.html" rel="external">"Definitive radiation therapy for head and neck cancer: Dose and fractionation considerations", section on 'Hyperfractionation'</a>.)</p><p>Accelerated fractionation improves locoregional control, but its effect on overall survival is less than that with hyperfractionation [<a href="#rid11">11</a>] and similar to that of standard-fractionation in patients receiving concurrent chemoradiation. As an example, in one randomized trial (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group [RTOG] 0129) evaluating concurrent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a> plus either standard-fractionation RT or accelerated-fractionation RT, overall survival was similar between the two treatment schedules [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Further results of this trial are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3392.html" rel="external">"Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: Approaches combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy", section on 'Radiation therapy schedule'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3409.html" rel="external">"Definitive radiation therapy for head and neck cancer: Dose and fractionation considerations", section on 'Accelerated fractionation RT'</a>.)</p><p>Further studies are necessary to determine the role of intensity-modulated proton beam therapy in the treatment of oropharyngeal carcinoma. In one randomized trial of 147 patients with locoregionally advanced OPSCC, proton beam therapy was associated with improved work and productivity recovery trends compared with standard fractionated chemoradiation [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89528.html" rel="external">"Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment", section on 'Particle therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h4">Choice of radiosensitizer</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most studies suggest clinically meaningful benefit with the addition of concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy to RT to treat locally advanced head and neck cancer, which is discussed separately.

In such patients, it is anticipated that surgical resection would result in negative margins and good postoperative functional outcomes. However, either surgical or nonsurgical approaches may be appropriate, depending on the location of the tumor, patient preference, and care team expertise. Multidisciplinary input is essential. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115014.html" rel="external">"Treatment of human papillomavirus associated oropharyngeal cancer", section on 'T1-T2, single involved node (≤3 cm)'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In such patients, surgery may also reduce the overall radiation impact by reducing the field size, altering the RT dose, or eliminating the need for concurrent chemotherapy with RT. In the absence of these situations, surgery should not be performed unless it palliates a critical lesion in advance of definitive radiation or chemoradiation. Generally, an approach beginning with surgery followed by the need for chemoradiation (triple-modality therapy) is to be avoided as the increased morbidity has not been shown to be balanced by superior outcomes with this approach. Studies investigating these approaches are discussed separately.

These approaches are most feasible for early tumor (T) stage tumors of the oropharynx, where function is more likely to be preserved. However, minimally invasive surgery becomes more challenging for tumors with advanced T stages where postoperative functional morbidity is more likely (eg, locoregionally advanced tumors with pterygoid involvement); in such tumors, nonsurgical therapy is an acceptable approach.
