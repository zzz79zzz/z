The COSR designation is limited to individuals with COSR symptoms during the 72 hours from their onset or identification. (See <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>The effects of battlefield stress on military personnel have been recognized throughout the history of warfare. Older terms to describe the syndrome include “shell shock” [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>], “soldier’s heart” [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], “battle fatigue” [<a href="#rid4">4</a>], and “psychoneuroses” [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].

Many service members have been reported to experience COSR for a self-limited duration of hours to days. Analysis of United States Army data from the first decade of the 2000s found that more than 95 percent of individuals identified as experiencing COSR were subsequently returned to active duty [<a href="#rid4">4,13</a>].</p><p>The association between COSR and suicidality is unclear. In terms of the limited data available, particular military occupational specialties with higher likelihood of combat exposure (eg, combat arms, combat medics, and special forces) showed that occupation was not linked to suicide attempt during deployment [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. This might suggest that the immediate exposure to combat/deployed setting does not seem to confer an acute risk of suicide (though later risk is unknown).</p><p>For others, symptoms and associated impairment persist and, in some cases, meet diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorders such as acute stress disorder (ASD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There is an absence of published data on subsequent rates among individuals identified with COSR of ASD, PTSD, and other psychological sequelae observed in veterans of military combat, including substance use disorders and suicide.

Initial medical assessments are often completed in austere deployment environments, with limited access to mental health providers, presenting challenges for evaluation and initial assistance. A priority is to determine elements of a COSR that require immediate attention as well as elements that may be amenable to simple intervention. (See <a class="local">'Initial management'</a> below.)</p><p>The primary elements of an evaluation include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Current symptoms, stressors, and degree of impairment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recent losses, injuries, or exposures to traumatic events (eg, firefights or blasts)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A medical history</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Screening for serious mental illness</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assessments of safety to self, others, the unit, and the mission</p><p></p><p>Additionally we assess for the following psychosocial concerns:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Interpersonal problems</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Living conditions</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stressors in unit</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stressors with leadership</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pace of work</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Current job</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Extent of training for job</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Past deployment history</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Perceived supports in unit</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Psychiatric evaluation including mental health history, substance use assessment, and mental status examination</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Physical examination to rule out medical or neurologic illness</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If a history of head trauma, possibly imaging to rule out traumatic brain injury</p><p></p><p>The United States Army places an emphasis on the service member’s ability to perform their job, as occupational impairment may put others within the unit at risk. Collateral sources can provide valuable information about a service member’s functioning. As an example, the service member’s supervisor can often provide information about their job requirements as well as observations of performance and/or impairment.</p><p>However, service member concerns about potential stigma can be a barrier to obtaining assistance with a COSR [<a href="#rid18">18</a>], these include concerns that seeking help might harm their career (ie, they may be viewed as weak), or service leaders might lose confidence in them.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16501462"><span class="h2">Overlap with psychiatric and medical conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Numerous psychiatric disorders may initially be classified as COSR. The COSR designation is applied to military personnel with widely varying presentations of signs, symptoms, maladaptive behaviors, or impairments due to combat stress. In contrast, diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder is based on the presence or absence of specific symptoms or behaviors for an established time period that were accompanied by impairment or distress. Psychiatric disorders are diagnosed via a thorough psychiatric evaluation.</p><p>Psychiatric disorders that occur as responses to exposure to traumatic events include acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, and adjustment disorder.

The United States Army does not consider COSR to be a psychiatric or medically diagnosable condition.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Individuals are classified as experiencing COSR independently of whether or not they meet criteria for a psychiatric disorder. COSR is not included in any version of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) or the International Classification of Disease (ICD). The COSR designation is limited to individuals with stress-related symptoms, behaviors, or impairment for the first 72 hours from onset or identification. (See <a class="local">'Definition'</a> above and <a class="local">'Assessment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical symptoms</strong> – COSR has a highly variable presentation. Symptoms can present in several domains: physiologic, mental, emotional, and behavioral. Symptoms overlap with those seen in acute and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but reflect a much wider range of types and intensities. (See <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">COSR may be noticeable immediately after a particularly stressful event or may develop after days or weeks of increased exposure to the rigors of military operations (eg, altered sleep-wake cycles, harsh and austere environments, social isolation). (See <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Course </strong>– Many service members experience COSR for a self-limited duration of hours to days. For others, symptoms and associated impairment persist and, in some cases, meet diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorders such as acute stress disorder and PTSD. (See <a class="local">'Course'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p>The association between COSR and suicidality is unclear. Military occupational specialties with a higher likelihood of combat exposure (eg, combat arms, combat medics, and special forces) are not linked to suicide attempt during deployment. This suggests that the immediate exposure to combat/deployed setting does not seem to confer an acute risk of suicide. Later risk, however, is unknown.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assessment</strong> – United States service members with COSR are categorized as reacting, injured, or ill. For individuals categorized as “reacting” or “injured,” initial intervention in the army occurs without involvement of medical personnel, and generally consists of conservative, restorative activities such as nutrition, hydration, hygiene, and rest/sleep, as well as communication with supportive individuals. (See <a class="local">'Assessment'</a> above and <a class="local">'Initial management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Service members with COSR who are categorized as ill (ie, more severe) require medical assessment, which in frontline units may require separation from the individual’s unit.
