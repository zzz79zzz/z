         Meningococcal disease, especially meningococcal meningitis, is one of the most devastating infections in an individual or community; reports of documented or suspected cases can engender considerable panic, even among well-informed hospital personnel. Part of the explanation for this phenomenon is the fact that meningitis due to
         <em>
          Neisseria meningitidis
         </em>
         tends to strike young, previously well individuals and can progress over a matter of hours to death.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mortality can be very high if the infection is not treated appropriately, and long-term sequelae can be severe even in successfully managed cases. The mortality and morbidity from meningococcal disease has changed very little since the 1950s, principally due to the inability to effectively manage the endotoxin-induced vascular collapse frequently caused by this organism.
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          N. meningitidis
         </em>
         can cause both endemic and epidemic infection. Large numbers of individuals can become infected in a population within a short space of time. With the reduction in cases of meningitis due to
         <em>
          Haemophilus influenzae
         </em>
         ,
         <em>
          N. meningitidis
         </em>
         has now become the second leading cause of meningitis in the United States. The majority of cases of meningococcal infection occur in young children and teenagers.
        </p>
        <p>
         This pathogen has the added capacity to cause epidemics in which all age groups in the entire population become at risk. While the worst of these epidemics have recently been largely confined to less well-developed areas of the world, epidemics have occurred in areas of Europe and North America where there are very high standards of living. Epidemic meningococcal infection can be a terrifying experience for the population affected. The progression of disease can be very rapid. The clinical features can be quite dramatic with profound shock, subcutaneous and gingival hemorrhage, thrombosis of vessels to extremities, delirium, and coma leading to death within 24 hours.

         The epidemiology of infections due to
         <em>
          N. meningitidis

         The annual incidence of invasive meningococcal disease in the United States varies in multiyear cycles; the most recent peak occurred during the mid-1990s  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77474" href="/z/d/graphic/77474.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Subsequently, the incidence has declined annually [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Routine use of meningococcal conjugate vaccine was recommended for adolescents in 2005. The annual incidence of meningococcal disease decreased between 2006 and 2015; during this time, the average annual incidence was 0.26 cases per 100,000 population [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. The rate in 2017 reduced further to 0.11 out of 100,000. Deaths still occurred in approximately 15 percent of cases [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Between 2006 and 2015, there were major changes in the incidence, age, and serogroup distribution of meningococcal disease in the United States [
         <a href="#rid4">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         During this time, annual incidence dropped almost 78 percent (from 0.40 cases to 0.14 cases per 100,000). Among children &lt;1 year of age, the incidence dropped (from 11 cases to 0.73 cases per 100,000); this was associated with a major shift in the median patient age from 17 to 42 years of age  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef134256" href="/z/d/graphic/134256.html" rel="external">

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         The incidence of serogroups B declined from 0.25 to 0.05 cases per 100,000 between 2006 and 2015 [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]; among college students between 2014 and 2016, the average annual incidence was 0.17 cases per 100,000 [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Between 2006 and 2015, the incidence of serogroup C declined from 0.38 to 0.01 cases per 100,000, the incidence of serogroup Y declined from 0.42 to 0.02 cases per 100,000, and the incidence of serogroup W (and other serogroups) remained stable.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The highest case-fatality ratios occurred with infections caused by serogroup W (21 percent) and serogroup C (14 percent). The highest incidence of disease occurred among infants two to three months of age (25 percent), and the highest mortality occurred in patients over 85 years of age (&lt;28 percent). The incidence among males was slightly higher than among females, and the incidence was higher among African-Americans than individuals of other racial groups (0.27 versus 0.20 cases per 100,000).

         The emergence of infections due to serogroup W ST-11 has been the cause of some concern [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. The age distribution of these infections is somewhat different in that the infection has been observed among individuals &gt;18 years. A similar increase in incidence of serogroup W ST-11 strains has been observed in eastern Europe and Great Britain.

        <p>
         Meningococcal infection displays seasonal variation in attack rates, which are highest in February and March and lowest in September. There is no predisposition by sex. The predominant serogroups causing infection in the United States are serogroups B, C, and Y, each accounting for approximately one-third of cases [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The proportion of cases caused by each serogroup varies by age. Serogroups C, Y, and W cause 73 percent of cases among individuals ≥11 years of age. In contrast, approximately 60 percent of disease among children aged 0 to 59 months is caused by serogroup B.

         Large-scale epidemics occur with frequency in Africa, parts of Asia, South America, and the countries of the former Soviet Union. These epidemics are most commonly caused by
         <em>
          N. meningitidis
         </em>
         serogroup A and occasionally by serogroup C.
        </p>
        <p>
         Epidemics of meningococcal infection occur at irregular intervals, often every 7 to 10 years in sub-Saharan Africa [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. The case rate during these epidemics can be as high as 1 in 1000 total population and 1 in 100 for children under two years of age. The largest outbreak of
         <em>
          Neisseria meningitidis
         </em>
         serogroup C in sub-Saharan Africa occurred in 2015; 8500 suspected cases of meningococcal meningitis and 573 deaths were reported to the WHO [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The World Health Organization (WHO) has endorsed a surveillance strategy to predict epidemics early and initiate vaccination drives. A study from Mali showed that detection of 5 cases per 100,000 population in one week was an appropriate threshold for alerting officials that vaccination might be required and 10 cases per 100,000 in one week confirmed regional epidemic activity with few false-positive results [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. These numbers were in contrast to the WHO recommended threshold of 15 cases per 100,000 averaged over two weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
         In one epidemic in Nairobi, Kenya, the attack rate was 2.5 cases per 10,000 population, with a case-fatality rate of approximately 10 percent [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. Areas that included Nairobi's largest dense and poor urban settings were particularly affected. This epidemic displayed an unusual age distribution, with high attack rates among 20- to 29-year-olds.

         ]. There were more than 14,000 suspected cases (fever &gt;100.4°F plus one or more meningeal signs). Among the 1339 individuals who underwent laboratory testing, 32 percent were positive for bacterial pathogens, of which 83 percent had
         <em>
          N. meningitidis
         </em>
         serogroup C. This finding prompted vaccination of two million individuals between ages 2 and 29 years, which was effective in truncating the epidemic.

         Serogroup W represents one of the less common serogroups of meningococci. The largest outbreak of infection due to this strain occurred among more than 400 pilgrims returning in 2000 and 2001 from the Hajj in Mecca, Saudi Arabia [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>

         <a href="#rid15">
          15

         ]. Three cases surfaced in the United States, one in a returning pilgrim and two in contacts of pilgrims [

          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Serogroup W may also play a role in endemic infection. This was illustrated in a national surveillance study in South Africa in which the emergence of endemic serogroup W was associated with an increase in the incidence and severity of invasive meningococcal disease [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. From 2000 through 2005, 2135 cases of invasive meningococcal disease were reported, 52 percent of which occurred in a single province. In this region, rates of disease increased from 0.8 cases per 100,000 persons in 2000 to 4.0 cases per 100,000 in 2005, and the proportion of cases due to serogroup W increased from 7 percent in 2000 to 75 percent in 2005. Overall case-fatality rates doubled from 11 percent in 2003 to 22 percent in 2005. Serogroup W was more likely to cause meningococcemia than serogroup A.

         can cause both endemic and epidemic infection. Meningococcal infections are endemic in the United States, and the annual incidence of invasive meningococcal disease varies in multiyear cycles; the most recent peak in incidence occurred during the mid-1990s  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77474" href="/z/d/graphic/77474.html" rel="external">

          1
         </a>
         ]. Between 2005 and 2011, the incidence of meningococcal disease in the United States was 0.3 cases per 100,000 population [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Disease rates are almost 10 times higher in children below two years of age than in the overall population. (See
         <a class="local">
          'United States'

         Outbreaks of meningococcal infection on college campuses have attracted considerable attention [

          17
         </a>
         ]. However, among affected college students, the rates of illness were higher for those residing on campus. Another case-control study performed in college students determined that the incidence of infection was lower than the general population of 18- to 23-year-old nonstudents (0.7 versus 1.4 per 100,000); however, the incidence was highest in freshmen living in dormitories (5.1 per 100,000), and the risk for disease by multivariate analysis was 3.6 for this group compared with other college students [

Travelers may be at risk for acquiring meningococcal infection, especially when traveling to regions at risk for epidemics or hyperendemic for the disease and for those with extensive contact with local residents. The Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca has been associated with outbreaks of meningococcal infection; pilgrims are required by the government of Saudi Arabia to be vaccinated. (See

         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>

          23,24

         The reason for the epidemic spread of the meningococcus is not known. The organism is considered a respiratory pathogen and spread is most likely by the aerosol route. It is clear that the high attack rates seen in the less well-developed countries are in part due to poverty and the consequences of crowding, poor sanitation, and malnutrition.
        </p>
        <p>
         Factors such as herd immunity and specific virulence properties associated with epidemic strains have been implicated as factors in the rapid spread of infection in these situations [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. Clonal analysis of strains from one epidemic in central and east Africa indicated that the epidemic strain had arisen in central Asia almost seven years prior; spread occurred through Northern India and Pakistan to Saudi Arabia and then to Africa via pilgrims from Mecca [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26

         A number of environmental and host factors have been associated with an increased risk for endemic acquisition of
         <em>
          N. meningitidis
         </em>
         infection. The major associated factor is nasopharyngeal carriage.

         </span>
         The importance of nasopharyngeal carriage of the meningococcus in the transmission of the organism and the development of disease was appreciated early based upon the experience with military recruits [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28,29
         </a>
         ]. Epidemic infections in American military recruit camps were a major problem prior to the introduction of vaccination. Throughout the nineteenth century, the unique susceptibility of military recruits can be attested by the clinical descriptions of this infection that can be found in the records of the Crimean and American Civil Wars. Since the introduction of vaccination of all recruits in the United States in 1972 with a tetravalent vaccine containing serogroup A, C, Y, and W polysaccharides, epidemics have not occurred [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, vaccination of recruits is not universal around the world. The dynamics of carriage was studied in a 1998 report of military recruits in Denmark [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. The rate of carriage in 1069 recruits followed for three months during each of three separate seasons was 39 to 47 percent at entry and did not change appreciably with time or season. Both loss of carriage and acquisition was documented in individuals, with 34 percent experiencing one or more change in carrier status over time. No differences were observed in the acquisition of invasive strains, which had caused disease in other subjects, from other strains in this study.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another study examined the immune response in military recruits carrying the meningococcus or acquiring the organism in the pharynx during basic training [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. Increases in antibody to the colonizing strains were documented; individuals colonized with more than one strain made antibody responses only to the newly acquired strain. Serum bactericidal activity to the homologous strains was also demonstrated.
        </p>
        <p>
         Intimate contacts of cases, including family members, college roommates, and nursery school classmates, are at 100- to 1000-fold increased risk of acquiring meningococcal infection. In one study of contacts of patients with meningococcal infection from Norway, household and kissing contacts had an increased frequency of carriage of the pathogenic strain compared with less close contacts (12.4 versus 1.9 percent) [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. Such individuals should be monitored closely for the development of co-primary cases (cases which arise within 48 hours of the primary case) and be given chemoprophylaxis to prevent secondary cases of infection [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In a study of 2507 university students conducted in the United Kingdom, meningococcal carriage rates increased substantially during the fall term [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. During the first week of school (early October), the rate rose from 7 to 23 percent and the average rate for those living in dormitories increased from 14 percent at the beginning of October to 34 percent in December.
        </p>
        <p>
         When testing for nasopharyngeal carriage, cultures should be taken from the nasopharynx since the rate of salivary carriage is very low (0.4 versus 35 percent in the nasopharynx or tonsils in a series of 258 college students) [

         <a href="#rid47">
          47

         University students in the United States are also at increased risk for serogroup B meningococcal infection, specifically. Surveillance data from 2014 to 2016 found that although the incidence of overall meningococcal infection among persons aged 18 to 24 years was low (0.17 cases per 100,000), university students had an increased risk of infection with meningococcal serogroup B (relative risk 3.54, 95% CI 2.21-5.41) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>

        <p>
         Smoking appears to be another risk factor for meningococcal infection. In a study of 311 marine recruits, both active and passage cigarette smoking were implicated as risk factors for pharyngeal carriage of
         <em>
          N. meningitidis
         </em>
         [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71

         <a href="#rid72">
          72,73
         </a>
         ]. In one report, having a mother who smokes was the strongest independent risk factor for invasive meningococcal disease in children less than 18 years of age [

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         With respect to passive smoking, it has been suggested that the increase in risk is more likely due to exposure to smokers, who are more likely to be carriers of
         <em>
          N. meningitidis

         , than to exposure to smoke [

         Variants in host alleles for mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a serum protein that activates the classical complement pathway and also serves as an opsonin, were associated with an increased susceptibility to meningococcal infection in a study comparing children with meningococcal infection to controls in two separate cohorts [

          46

         Meningococcal disease, especially meningococcal meningitis, is one of the most devastating infections in an individual or community; reports of documented or suspected cases can engender considerable panic, even among well-informed hospital personnel. Part of the explanation for this phenomenon is the fact that meningitis due to
         <em>
          Neisseria meningitidis
         </em>
         tends to strike young, previously well individuals and can progress over a matter of hours to death. (See

         Meningococcal infections are endemic in the United States, and the annual incidence of invasive meningococcal disease varies from 0.5 to 1.5 cases per 100,000 population in multiyear cycles. The most recent peak in incidence occurred during the mid-1990s  (

         ). Disease rates are almost 10 times higher in children below two years of age than in the overall population. The predominant serogroups causing infection in the United States currently are serogroups B, C, and Y. (See

         Large scale epidemics still occur with frequency in Africa, parts of Asia, South America, and the countries of the former Soviet Union. These epidemics are most commonly caused by
         <em>

         serogroup A and occasionally by serogroup C. (See

         Epidemics of meningococcal infection occur at irregular intervals, often every 7 to 10 years in sub-Saharan Africa. The case rate during these epidemics can be as high as 1 in 1000 total population and 1 in 100 for children under two years of age. (See

         The reason for the epidemic spread of the meningococcus is not known. The organism is considered a respiratory pathogen and spread is most likely by the aerosol route. It is clear that the high attack rates seen in the less well-developed countries are in part due to poverty and the consequences of crowding, poor sanitation, and malnutrition. Factors such as herd immunity and specific virulence properties associated with epidemic strains have been implicated as factors in the rapid spread of infection in these situations. (See
