         Fever, an elevation in core body temperature above the daily range for an individual, is a characteristic feature of most infections but is also found in a number of noninfectious diseases such as autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. Definitions of normal body temperature, the pathophysiology of fever, the role of cytokines, and the treatment of fever in adults will be reviewed here. Fever of unknown origin in adults, drug fever, and the treatment of fever in infants and children are discussed separately. (See

         Normal body temperature ranges from approximately 35.3 to 37.7°C (95.5 to 99.9°F), with an average of 36.7°C (98.0°F) when measured orally, as suggested by studies in both outpatients and hospitalized individuals:

         In a study that included 35,488 individuals who underwent 243,506 oral temperature measurements during routine outpatient visits, the mean temperature was 36.6°C (97.9°F), with a 99 percent range 35.3 to 37.7°C (95.5 to 99.9°F) [

         In another study that included 42,622 medical inpatients without known infection, malignancy, or immunocompromising condition who underwent 495,866 oral temperature measurements during the first week of hospitalization, the mean temperature was 36.7°C (98.0°F), with a 99 percent range 35.4 to 37.7°C (95.8 to 99.9°F). The mean age of participants was 61 years, 50 percent were female, 25 were percent Black, and mean body mass index was 30 [

         Normal body temperature varies over the course of the day, controlled in the thermoregulatory center located in the anterior hypothalamus. The normal early morning to late afternoon daily increase is typically 0.5°C (0.9°F). However, in some individuals recovering from a febrile illness, this daily variation can be as high as 1.0°C (1.8°F). Studies suggest that a morning oral temperature &gt;37.2°C (98.9°F) or an afternoon temperature of &gt;37.7°C (99.9°F) could be considered a fever.
        </p>
        <p>
         A detailed study of the range of oral temperature readings in 148 healthy individuals aged 18 to 40 years was reported using over 700 measurements [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Oral temperatures in the cohort ranged from 35.6°C (96.0°F) to 38.2°C (100.8°F) with a mean of 36.8 ± 0.4°C (98.2 ± 0.7°F). Low levels occurred at 6 AM and higher levels at 4 to 6 PM. The maximum normal oral temperature at 6 AM was 37.2°C (98.9°F), and the maximum level at 4 PM was 37.7°C (99.9°F), both values defining the 99th percentile for healthy subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
         In menstruating women, the morning temperature is generally lower during the two weeks prior to ovulation, rising by about 0.6°C (1.0°F) with ovulation and remaining at that level until menses occur. Although it is well established that females in the luteal (post-ovulatory) phase have higher body temperature, the amplitude of the circadian rhythm for body temperature is the same as in males [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Seasonal variation in body temperature has been described, but this may reflect a metabolic change and is not a common observation. Elevation in body temperature occurs during the postprandial state, but this is not fever. The daily temperature variation appears to be fixed in early childhood.
        </p>
        <p>
         During a febrile illness, the daily low early morning and high evening temperature difference is maintained but shifted upwards to higher levels.
        </p>
        <p>
         The circadian rhythms in humans and the genes that regulate daily oscillations in body temperature have been studied. The body is normally able to maintain a fairly steady temperature because the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center balances the excess heat production, derived from metabolic activity in muscle and the liver, with heat dissipation from the skin and lungs. However, when faced with environmental extremes, humans cannot maintain the narrow daily variation of body temperature without the aid of clothing and protective environments [

         Peripheral methods of monitoring temperature (tympanic membrane, temporal artery, axillary, and oral thermometry) are not as accurate as central methods (pulmonary artery catheter, urinary bladder, esophageal, and rectal thermometry) [

        <p>
         Rectal temperatures are generally 0.6°C (1.0°F) higher than oral readings. Oral readings are lower probably because of mouth breathing, which is particularly important in patients with respiratory infections and rapid breathing. Tympanic membrane temperature readings are close to core temperature.

         Fever is an elevation in core body temperature above the daily range for an individual. There is no universal threshold for fever, as normal body temperature varies by individual, time of day, and method of measurement. Based on studies documenting diurnal variations in normal body temperature, a morning oral temperature &gt;37.2°C (98.9°F) or an afternoon temperature of &gt;37.7°C (99.9°F) could be considered a fever. However, in practice, a general threshold of temperature &gt;37.8°C (100.0°F) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ] or &gt;38°C (100.4°F) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ] is often used. It is well established that baseline temperature in older adults is lower than in younger adults, and the ability to develop fever in older adults is impaired [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Thus, temperatures lower than those thresholds may still reflect fever (and potentially severe infection) in older adult patients. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Normal body temperature'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Fever is regulated at the level of the hypothalamus. The thermostat device, which regulates the temperature in a home, is comparable to the way the hypothalamus controls core body temperature. The thermostat setting in the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center shifts upwards during a fever, for example, from 37 to 39°C. In other words, during fever, the "set-point" in the hypothalamus shifts upward from the "normothermia" setting to febrile levels, similar to the way the home thermostat is reset to a higher level in order to raise the ambient temperature in a room. Elevated levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the hypothalamus appear to be the trigger for raising the set-point. Once the hypothalamic set-point is raised, this activates neurons in the vasomotor center to commence vasoconstriction and warm-sensing neurons to slow their firing rate and increase heat production in the periphery.
        </p>
        <p>
         The vasoconstriction produces a noticeable cold sensation in the hands and feet. Blood is shunted away from the periphery to the internal organs, essentially decreasing heat loss from the skin, and the patient feels cold. For most fevers, this is sufficient to raise core body temperature 1 or even 2°C.
        </p>
        <p>
         At the same time, thermogenesis in fat contributes to increasing core temperature. This is termed "nonshivering thermogenesis." At birth, highly thermogenic brown fat is present but rapidly decreases within the neonatal period. It is unclear how much brown fat remains as a source of heat production in the adult.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thermogenesis in either the fat or muscle takes place by uncoupling proteins, which release adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and heat. The combination of heat conservation and thermogenesis accounts for the majority of fever. There is also increased heat production from the liver.
        </p>
        <p>
         Shivering may be initiated in order to increase heat production from the muscles, but shivering is not required for most fevers. Shivering appears to take place when there is a rapid rise to match the new febrile set-point.
        </p>
        <p>
         In humans, behavioral instincts assist in raising body temperature with reduction of exposed surfaces. Subjects seek warm rooms, add extra clothing, and reduce activity. The processes of heat conservation (vasoconstriction), heat production (shivering, nonshivering thermogenesis, increased metabolic activity), and behavioral changes continue until the temperature of the blood bathing the hypothalamic neurons matches the new setting. When that point is reached, the hypothalamus now maintains the new setting at the febrile level temperature, just as it does at the normothermic level. In fact, studies have shown that the mechanisms of balancing heat loss and heat production in fever are the same as in the afebrile state.
        </p>
        <p>
         When the hypothalamic set-point is reset downward, the processes of heat loss are accelerated through vasodilation and sweating. The resetting of the set-point downward can be due to either a reduction in the concentration of pyrogens or the use of antipyretics. Behavioral changes are also triggered at this time and removal of insulating clothing or bedding takes place. Loss of heat by sweating and vasodilation continue until the temperature of the blood supplying the hypothalamus matches the lower setting.
        </p>
        <p>
         In some rare patients, the hypothalamic set-point is elevated owing to local trauma, hemorrhage, tumor, or intrinsic hypothalamic malfunction. The term "hypothalamic fever" is sometimes used to describe elevated temperature caused by abnormal hypothalamic function. However, the majority of patients with hypothalamic damage have hypo- not hyperthermia. These patients do not respond properly to minor environmental temperature changes; in this condition, core temperature falls upon exposure to slight drops in temperature, whereas normal hypothalamic function can maintain core temperature for a few hours. In those very few patients in whom elevated core temperature is suspected to be due to hypothalamic damage, the diagnosis depends upon the demonstration of other abnormal hypothalamic functions, such as production of hypothalamic releasing factors, abnormal response to cold, and absence of circadian temperature and hormonal rhythms.

         Although the vast majority of patients with elevated body temperature have fever, there are a few instances in which an elevated temperature represents hyperthermia. These include heat stroke syndromes, certain metabolic diseases, and the effects of pharmacologic agents that interfere with thermoregulation. In contradistinction to fever, the setting of the thermoregulatory center during hyperthermia remains unchanged (ie, at normothermic levels), while body temperature increases in an uncontrolled fashion and overrides the ability to lose heat. Exogenous heat exposure and endogenous heat production are two mechanisms by which hyperthermia can result in dangerously high internal temperatures. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/176.html" rel="external">
          "Severe nonexertional hyperthermia (classic heat stroke) in adults"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important to make the distinction between fever and hyperthermia. Hyperthermia can be rapidly fatal, and its treatment differs from that of fever. Despite physiologic and behavioral control of body temperature, excessive heat production can easily occur. As an example, overinsulating clothing can result in elevated core temperature. Hyperthermia is most often observed in persons who work or exercise in hot environments and produce heat faster than the peripheral mechanisms can lose it. Hypohydration is a major cause of hyperthermia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Certain metabolic diseases such as hyperthyroidism can result in mild elevations of core temperature. The effects of some pharmacologic agents (
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8983" href="/z/d/drug information/8983.html" rel="external">
          atropine
         </a>
         ) that interfere with thermoregulation by blocking sweating or vasodilation can also raise core temperature. These syndromes represent hyperthermia because they take place in the presence of a normal hypothalamic set-point. The recreational drug "ecstasy" (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) produces hyperthermia, which is due to a loss in heat dissipation (vasoconstriction) and heat production via uncoupling protein 3.
        </p>
        <p>
         A diagnosis of hyperthermia is often made because of a preceding history of heat exposure or use of certain drugs that interfere with normal thermoregulation. There is no rapid way to differentiate elevated core temperature due to fever from hyperthermia. The immediate events prior to the onset of hyperthermia usually play an important role in determining its cause. However, physical examination can assist the clinician in some forms of hyperthermia; for example, the skin is hot but dry in heat stroke syndromes and in patients taking drugs that block sweating. Antipyretics do not reduce the elevated temperature in hyperthermia whereas there is usually some decrease in body temperature in patients with fever or even "hyperpyrexia" after adequate doses of either

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Hyperthermia can also occur when certain anesthetics produce a rapid uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in susceptible individuals [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. This is known as malignant hyperthermia and is often fatal. Another form of hyperthermia results in patients taking certain neuroleptic drugs and is called "neuroleptic malignant syndrome" [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/176.html" rel="external">
          "Severe nonexertional hyperthermia (classic heat stroke) in adults"

          "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Another possible cause of hyperthermia is the serotonin syndrome, which may result from any combination of drugs that has the net effect of increasing serotonergic neurotransmission  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64604" href="/z/d/graphic/64604.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). The syndrome is classically associated with the simultaneous administration of two serotonergic agents, but it can occur after initiation of a single serotonergic drug or increasing the dose of a serotonergic drug in individuals who are particularly sensitive to serotonin. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/301.html" rel="external">

         The term pyrogen is used to describe any substance that causes fever. Pyrogens are either exogenous or endogenous. Endogenous pyrogens belong to the class of biologically active proteins called cytokines. Fever-producing cytokines are more precisely termed pyrogenic cytokines.

         Exogenous pyrogens, derived from outside the host, are mainly microbes or their products, such as toxins. The classic example of an exogenous pyrogen is the lipopolysaccharide endotoxin produced by all gram-negative bacteria. Endotoxins are potent substances not only as pyrogens but also as inducers of various pathologic changes observed in gram-negative infections [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Endotoxins belong to a classification of microbial products termed Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. TLR evolved with insects, and the mammalian homologues on macrophages bind microbial products from several bacteria and fungi and result in activation of the cell. Therefore, TLR recognition of bacteria explains how infections cause fever. As discussed below, the activation of macrophages via the TLR on mammalian cells results in the production of fever-producing cytokines [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Another group of bacterial substances that are potent pyrogens is produced by gram-positive organisms. The toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST-1) is associated with strains of
         <em>
          Staphylococcus aureus
         </em>
         isolated from patients with toxic shock syndrome (TSS) [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16

         ]. TSST-1 and other enterotoxins from
         <em>
          S. aureus
         </em>
         and exotoxins from group A
         <em>
          Streptococcus
         </em>
         act both as direct toxins but also serve as "superantigens" [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,18
         </a>
         ]. Superantigens appear to play a role in the pathogenesis of severe gram-positive infections by interacting with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II and a number of T cell subsets [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,20
         </a>
         ] to release pyrogenic cytokines. Like the endotoxins from gram-negative bacteria, the toxins produced by staphylococci and streptococci produce fever in experimental animals when injected intravenously in the submicrogram/kg range. Of considerable importance is the fact that endotoxin is a highly pyrogenic molecule in humans since 2 to 3 ng/kg produces fever and generalized symptoms of malaise in volunteers [

         Pyrogenic cytokines are specific cytokines produced upon activation of TLR that cause fever [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Cytokines are small proteins (molecular weight 10 to 20,000 Daltons) that regulate immune, inflammatory, and hematopoietic processes  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69910" href="/z/d/graphic/69910.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). As an example, stimulation of lymphocyte proliferation during an immune response to vaccination is the result of various cytokines including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and IL-6. A cytokine called granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) stimulates granulocytopoiesis in the bone marrow (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8383.html" rel="external">
          "Introduction to recombinant hematopoietic growth factors"
         </a>
         ). Of the many cytokines (over 70), only few cause fever by directly acting on the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center.
        </p>
        <p>
         From a historical point of view, the field of "cytokine biology" began with laboratory investigations into the cause of fever by products of activated leukocytes in the 1940s. These fever-producing molecules were called "endogenous pyrogens" [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. When endogenous pyrogens were purified from activated leukocytes, they were shown to cause fever as well as possess a broad range of biological activities, affecting all organ systems. Cytokines can affect organ function during disease, but unless challenged by infection or trauma, cytokines do not seem to play a role in normal physiologic functions, including temperature regulation or endocrine functions.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are several pyrogenic cytokines, namely IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and ciliary neurotrophic factor [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23,24
         </a>
         ]. Others likely exist. Interferon (IFN)-alpha can also be considered a pyrogenic cytokine since it produces fever. In fact, recombinant IL-1, IL-6, or TNF have each been injected into humans and have produced fever. IL-1 is particularly pyrogenic, resulting in fever at doses as low as 10 ng/kg (either subcutaneously or intravenously) [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. IL-6 is also pyrogenic but microgram/kg rather than nanogram/kg doses of IL-6 are needed to produce fever in humans. Nevertheless, large amounts of IL-6 circulate in nearly all febrile diseases and IL-6 induced by IL-1 or the combination of IL-1 plus TNF likely accounts for the clinical fever most often measured. Mice without the gene for IL-6 do not develop fever during bacterial infection. Thus, in most inflammatory and infectious diseases, IL-1 and TNF (even at low concentrations) induce large amounts of IL-6, and it is the IL-6 that likely triggers the hypothalamic centers for control of body temperature. Thus, in addition to exogenous pyrogens from microbial sources, endogenous pyrogenic cytokines cause fever. Each cytokine is coded by a separate gene and each pyrogenic cytokine has been shown to cause fever not only in laboratory animals but also when injected into humans.
        </p>
        <p>
         A wide spectrum of exogenous pyrogens induces the synthesis and release of pyrogenic cytokines via activation of the TLRs. Most exogenous pyrogenic substances are from bacterial or fungal sources. Viruses induce pyrogenic cytokines by infecting cells. Additionally, fever can also be a symptom of a variety of noninfectious diseases. Inflammation, trauma, or antigen-antibody complexes induce the production of IL-1, TNF, and IL-6, and each or all three cytokines trigger the hypothalamus to raise the set-point to febrile levels [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. The cellular sources of pyrogenic cytokines are primarily monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, although many different cells can synthesize these molecules when stimulated.

         During fever, hypothalamic tissue and third cerebral ventricle levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) are elevated [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26-28
         </a>
         ]. The highest concentrations of PGE2 are near the circumventricular vascular organs (organ vasculosum lamina terminalis, OVLT) which are networks of fenestrated capillaries surrounding the hypothalamic regulatory centers [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. Destruction of these organs reduces the ability of pyrogens to produce fever. However, most studies in animals have not been able to show that pyrogenic cytokines pass from the circulation into the brain substance itself [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Thus, it appears that both exogenous and endogenous pyrogens interact with the endothelium of these capillaries, which is probably the first step in initiating fever.
        </p>
        <p>
         The interaction of pyrogens with the hypothalamic circumventricular vascular endothelium is the first step in raising the set-point to febrile levels. The following Algorithm illustrates the key events in the production of fever  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80455" href="/z/d/graphic/80455.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). As shown, several cells have the potential to produce pyrogenic cytokines. Pyrogenic cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are then released from the cell and enter the systemic circulation. Although the systemic effects of these circulating cytokines initiate fever by their ability to induce the synthesis of PGE2, they also induce PGE2 in peripheral tissues [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. The increase in PGE2 in the periphery accounts for the nonspecific myalgias and arthralgias that often accompany fever. However, it is the induction of PGE2 in the brain that starts the process of raising the hypothalamic set-point for core temperature.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are four receptors for PGE2, and each signals the cell in different ways. Studies in mice demonstrated that the third PGE2 receptor (EP-3) is essential for the production of fever; mice deficient in the gene for this receptor do not develop fever following the injection of IL-1 or endotoxin [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. Deletion of the other PGE2 receptor genes leaves the fever mechanism intact. Although PGE2 is essential for fever, PGE2 is not a neurotransmitter. However, release of PGE2 from the brain side of the hypothalamic endothelium triggers the PGE2 receptor on glial cells, and this results in the rapid release of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which is a neurotransmitter [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         As shown in the following Algorithm, release of cAMP from the glial cells activates neuronal endings from the thermoregulatory center that extend into the area  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80455" href="/z/d/graphic/80455.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The elevation of cAMP is thought to account for changes in the hypothalamic set-point either directly or indirectly by inducing the release of monoamine neurotransmitters. Receptors for endotoxin share many similarities to those of IL-1, and, hence, activation of endotoxin receptors on the hypothalamic endothelium also results in PGE2 production and fever [

         Several viral diseases produce active infection in the brain. Glial cells, but particularly microglia and possibly neuronal cells, synthesize IL-1, TNF, and IL-6 [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is also synthesized by neural as well as neuronal cells. These cytokines produced within the brain itself appear to play a role in the production of fever. When a cytokine is injected directly into the brain of experimental animals, the dose required to cause fever is several orders of magnitude lower compared with intravenous injection. Thus, it appears that central nervous system (CNS) production of these cytokines can raise the hypothalamic set-point, bypassing the circumventricular organs involved in the fever that results from circulating cytokines. Local production of cytokines in the CNS may account for the hyperpyrexia of CNS hemorrhage noted above.

         <a href="#rid35">
          35,36
         </a>
         ]. In nearly all reports of infections associated with the use of anticytokine therapies, fever is one of the presenting signs. However, it is likely that fever in these patients is blunted in much the same way as with high-dose glucocorticoids. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1411.html" rel="external">
          "Risk of mycobacterial infection associated with biologic agents and JAK inhibitors"

        </p>
        <p>
         The ability of a patient to present with fever despite being treated with an anticytokine agent can be due to the other cytokines that can cause fever (eg, IL-1, TNF-alpha, IL-6, interferons, and others) that are not affected by a specific anticytokine agent [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. For example, in a patient with staphylococcal skin infection being treated with anti-TNF-alpha for rheumatoid arthritis, the three pyrogenic cytokines, TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6, are produced, but only TNF-alpha is blocked by the anti-TNF-alpha antibody. In that case, the patient may manifest a low-grade fever or no fever, which confounds the diagnosis of an active infection. Another explanation is that microbial products are capable of inducing brain PGE2 directly via hypothalamic toll-like receptors. In the case of the patient with staphylococcal skin infection being treated with anti-TNF-alpha for rheumatoid arthritis, staphylococcal products may reach the TLRs of the hypothalamic endothelium and trigger COX-2 expression.
        </p>

         Anticytokine agents dramatically reduce fever in autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. Some autoimmune diseases and most autoinflammatory diseases have recurrent fever as a prominent presenting sign. The autoinflammatory diseases are diseases in which the monocyte rather than the lymphocyte plays a pathological role. The autoinflammatory diseases include adult and juvenile Still's disease, familial Mediterranean fever, hyper IgD syndrome, familial cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome, neonatal onset multisystem autoinflammatory disease, Blau's syndrome, Schnitzler's syndrome, Muckle-Wells syndrome, and TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome. They are characterized by recurrent fevers, neutrophilia, and serosal inflammation. The fever associated with these diseases is dramatically reduced by blocking IL-1 with the IL-1 receptor antagonist, caspase-1 inhibitors, or anti-IL-1beta neutralizing antibodies [

         Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are potent antipyretics because they inhibit cyclooxygenases (COX-1 or COX-2), an enzyme that promotes the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) [

          43

         Additionally, providers often elect to treat to prevent adverse physiologic consequences of fever. However, there are no data that definitively suggest benefit from treatment. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials that included over 2400 hospitalized patients with fever, there was no difference in mortality between those who received treatment for fever and those who did not (23 percent mortality rate in both groups; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.91-1.19) [

         Physiologic effects of elevated core temperature, whether fever or hyperthermia, include increased demand for oxygen and aggravation of pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary disease.

         – The decision to reduce fever assumes that there is no diagnostic benefit of allowing the fever to persist.

However, most of the febrile illnesses that are thought to exhibit a specific time-related pattern (eg, Hodgkin lymphoma) are in fact, upon close examination, not reliable indicators or are of no diagnostic value. As an example, there is no periodicity of fever in patients with familial Mediterranean fever. (See

         Antipyretics are of no use in reducing body temperature due to hyperthermia. The treatment of hyperthermia is primarily targeted at rapid reduction of body temperature by physical means. It is also crucial to identify the underlying cause of the hyperthermia, since management varies depending on the etiology.
        </p>
        <p>
         Rapid reduction in body temperature can be accomplished by cool or tepid (20°C), not cold, bathing, preferably using damp sponges; alcohol adds nothing to tepid or cool water sponging. Submersion should be avoided so that body heat loss by evaporation can occur. Cooling blankets are of potential danger because of excess vasoconstriction preventing heat loss from the skin's surface. Intravenous fluids should be administered for dehydration, but if cool fluids are administered through a central line, the central line should not terminate close to the heart.

         Normal body temperature ranges from approximately 35.3 to 37.7°C (95.5 to 99.9°F). Body temperature is low in the early morning and high in evening, varying 0.5°C (0.9°F) over the course of the day. Demographic factors, body mass, certain diseases, and physiologic factors also affect body temperature. (See
         <a class="local">

         Fever is an elevation in core body temperature above the daily range for an individual. There is no universal threshold for fever; however, in practice, a general threshold of temperature &gt;37.8°C (100.0°F) or &gt;38°C (100.4°F) is often used. During a febrile illness, daily low and high temperature readings are maintained but at higher levels. (See

         Baseline temperature in older adults is lower than in younger adults, and the ability to develop fever in older adults is impaired. Thus, temperatures lower than commonly used thresholds may still reflect fever (and potentially severe infection) in older adult patients. (See

         Although the vast majority of patients with elevated body temperature have fever, there are a few instances in which an elevated temperature represents hyperthermia. These include heat stroke syndromes, certain metabolic diseases, and the effects of pharmacologic agents that interfere with thermoregulation. It is important to make the distinction between fever and hyperthermia. Hyperthermia can be rapidly fatal, and its treatment differs from that of fever. (See
         <a class="local">

         Hyperpyrexia is the term for an extraordinarily high fever (&gt;41.5°C), which can be observed in patients with severe infections but most commonly occurs in patients with central nervous system hemorrhages. (See

         Patients with autoimmune diseases being treated with biologic agents, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, are at increased risk for routine as well as opportunistic infections. In these patients, a low-grade fever may serve as an early warning sign of a serious infection. (See

         is a poor cyclooxygenase inhibitor in peripheral tissue and does not display noteworthy antiinflammatory activity, acetaminophen is an excellent antipyretic. Acetaminophen is oxidized in the brain by the p450 cytochrome system, and the oxidized form inhibits cyclooxygenase activity. There is no difference between aspirin and acetaminophen in reducing fever. (See

         Elevated core temperature, whether fever or hyperthermia, increases the demand for oxygen and can aggravate preexisting cardiac or pulmonary insufficiency. (See

         The vast majority of fevers are associated with self-limited infections, most commonly of a viral origin, where the cause of the fever is easily identified. The decision to reduce fever with antipyretics assumes that there is no diagnostic benefit of allowing the fever to persist. However, there are rare clinical situations in which observation of the pattern of fever can be helpful diagnostically. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Deciding whether to treat'

         In patients with no contraindications to antipyretics, we suggest treating fever and hyperpyrexia to reduce symptoms of headache, myalgia, and arthralgias or to prevent complications of fever in children (eg, febrile seizures) or in individuals with underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). We also suggest treating patients with hyperpyrexia who have advanced age, are on chemotherapy or checkpoint inhibitors, or have related CNS disease (eg, intracerebral hemorrhage) (

         For hyperthermia, the goal of treating of hyperthermia is primarily to rapidly reduce body temperature by physical means. It is also crucial to identify the underlying cause of the hyperthermia, since management varies depending on the etiology. Antipyretics are of no use for hyperthermia. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Treatment of hyperthermia'
