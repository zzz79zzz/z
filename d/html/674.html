Choledocholithiasis is common in patients with symptomatic gallstone disease. Gallstones may form in the common bile duct in patients with biliary stasis or may form in the gallbladder and then pass into the common bile duct via the cystic duct. In addition, some patients who have undergone cholecystectomy have retained or recurrent stones.</p><p>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) confirms the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis, and ERCP-guided techniques (eg, endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy followed by stone removal with balloon catheters) are used to clear the common bile duct. This topic will provide an overview of endoscopic techniques for removing bile duct stones. </p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of patients with common bile duct stones, including timing of cholecystectomy and surgical common bile duct exploration, are presented in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13922.html" rel="external">"Choledocholithiasis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15093.html" rel="external">"Surgical common bile duct exploration"</a>.) </p><p>An overview of ERCP, including pre- and post-procedure care, is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/632.html" rel="external">"Overview of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2735569876"><span class="h1">PREPROCEDURE EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of choledocholithiasis is often suspected based on presenting symptoms (eg, biliary-type abdominal pain, jaundice), complications (eg, cholangitis, pancreatitis), laboratory studies (cholestatic pattern of liver test abnormalities), and imaging (transabdominal ultrasound, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography). Thus, most patients will have had laboratory studies and imaging, thereby mitigating the need for additional testing before ERCP. Review of the radiographic imaging prior to ERCP will help to define the biliary ductal anatomy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13922.html" rel="external">"Choledocholithiasis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1490742361"><span class="h1">ERCP-GUIDED STONE REMOVAL</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3441779286"><span class="h2">Goals</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with choledocholithiasis, the goal of endoscopic intervention is complete stone removal during the index procedure. Stone removal is confirmed with cholangiogram and/or passage of a balloon through the duct and ampulla without resistance following sphincterotomy. For patients with incomplete duct clearance, an additional intervention (ie, temporary biliary stent placement) may be needed until a follow-up endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is performed. (See <a class="local">'Patients with incomplete duct clearance'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1084111319"><span class="h2">Patient preparation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The preprocedure preparation for patients undergoing ERCP is discussed separately.

This is typically followed by performing a cholangiogram and creating an adequately sized exit path for the stone by enlarging the ampulla by incising it (ie, sphincterotomy) and/or by dilating it with a balloon [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/640.html" rel="external">"Endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/631.html" rel="external">"Endoscopic balloon dilation for removal of bile duct stones"</a>.)</p><p>For some patients with complicated bile duct stones, cannulation of the bile duct may be technically challenging. As an example, impaction of a stone within the biliary sphincter may limit advancing a sphincterotome or guidewire. For such patients, other techniques such as access sphincterotomy or needle-knife sphincterotomy may be used to reach the biliary tree. (See <a class="local">'Patients with complicated stones'</a> below.)</p><p>Access sphincterotomy is discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/675.html" rel="external">"Management of difficult biliary access during ERCP in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3495977053"><span class="h2">Patients with uncomplicated stones</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients have uncomplicated common bile duct stones (ie, ≤3 stones that are ≤1 cm in size) [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. After gaining access to the biliary tree, removal of uncomplicated bile duct stones is typically achieved with biliary sphincterotomy followed by stone extraction with a balloon or basket catheter [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3989108190"><span class="h3">Creating an exit path</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with uncomplicated stones, an adequately sized exit path for stone removal is typically accomplished by performing biliary sphincterotomy. The goal of biliary sphincterotomy is to fully transect the biliary sphincter by severing the deep muscle layers of the sphincter of Oddi  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78786" href="/d/graphic/78786.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). This maneuver eliminates the principal anatomic barrier impeding stone passage, and thus, it facilitates stone extraction. </p><p>The length of the sphincterotomy is tailored to the size of the stone(s), ampulla, and common bile duct. </p><p>Adverse events related to ERCP with biliary sphincterotomy include pancreatitis, bleeding, and cholangitis [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Adverse events and technical aspects of endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy are discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/640.html" rel="external">"Endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H108780148"><span class="h3">Extracting the stone</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Following endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy, some stones will exit the bile duct without further intervention, while other stones will require extraction methods. Commonly used extraction devices include balloon or basket catheters. The devices are available in multiple configurations and sizes, and selecting a device is individualized and guided by stone characteristics, bile duct anatomy, and endoscopist preference:  </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Balloon device</strong> – A balloon device is often used for patients with a nondilated common bile duct and a single, free-floating stone. Balloons may also be used for patients with multiple small stones (≤1 cm)  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60642" href="/d/graphic/60642.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). We choose a balloon that closely approximates or is larger than the diameter of the duct. Tips for removing a stone using a balloon catheter include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with a single stone, advance the balloon into the bile duct and proximal to the stone. Pull the balloon/stone apparatus distally and through the ampulla to extract the stone. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with &gt;1 stone, begin by extracting the stone that is closest to the ampulla (ie, most distal stone). Then, proceed proximally in a gradual fashion to avoid stone impaction. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If there is resistance when the stone reaches the ampulla (eg, sphincterotomy is smaller than stone diameter), greater mechanical advantage can be obtained by turning the small wheel of the duodenoscope to the right and pushing the duodenoscope further into the duodenum, which straightens the bile duct axis. If more force is needed, the left hand can be flexed while grasping the endoscope and turning the body toward the right, which forces the endoscope into a straighter position. However, care should be taken to avoid perforation of the opposite duodenal wall by the endoscope (especially if a considerable amount of force is required), since the bend in the endoscope pushes against the duodenal wall during straightening.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Balloon catheters are generally not used for large, untreated stones (ie, stones &gt;1 cm prior to lithotripsy) because the balloon/stone apparatus may become impacted in the distal common bile duct if it cannot be pulled through the sphincterotomy. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Basket device</strong> – A basket device is often used for patients with a nondilated common bile duct (ie, diameter ≤10 mm) or with multiple stones (ie, &gt;3 stones). When multiple stones are present, each stone is grasped and removed separately to avoid impaction of the basket in the ampulla.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The technique for basket-facilitated stone extraction is summarized as follows:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Advance the basket device into the common bile duct and proximal to the stone.  </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Grasp the stone with the basket. Avoid tightly closing basket wires against the stone surface.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Gently pull the basket/stone apparatus distally and through the ampulla to extract the stone. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If there is resistance, apply suction, apply steady traction, and/or perform maneuvers to improve mechanical advantage as discussed above.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Measures to reduce the risk of impacting the basket/stone apparatus within the bile duct include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Avoid closing the basket tightly against the stone. If wires are imbedded in the stone's surface and the basket/stone apparatus becomes impacted, the stone cannot be easily removed from the basket. In addition, it may be difficult to regain access to the bile duct to perform additional therapeutic maneuvers such as mechanical lithotripsy. In some cases, surgical intervention may be required to remove the basket/stone apparatus.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>When &gt;1 stone is present, begin by first extracting the most distal stone (ie, the one closest to the ampulla) to avoid a "traffic jam" as the captured stone is pulled to the level of the remaining gallstones.</p><p></p><p>Endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone extraction are effective for clearing the bile duct in 85 to 90 percent of patients, with an overall rate of adverse events of approximately 5 percent and a mortality rate of less than 1 percent [<a href="#rid3">3,7</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Special populations'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/631.html" rel="external">"Endoscopic balloon dilation for removal of bile duct stones"</a>.)</p><p>For patients with a large common bile duct stone (ie, size &gt;1 cm)  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59987" href="/d/graphic/59987.html" rel="external">image 2</a>), we typically perform a small or mid-sized biliary sphincterotomy (ie, one-third to one-half of the distance to the papillary roof) followed by endoscopic papillary balloon dilation, and this approach is supported by society guidelines [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>].</p><p>Data suggest that sphincterotomy combined with balloon dilation is more effective for duct clearance than sphincterotomy alone for large bile duct stones [<a href="#rid1">1,12,14-16</a>]. In a meta-analysis of nine trials including over 1100 patients with large bile duct stones, balloon dilation (maximum balloon size, 15 to 20 mm) combined with sphincterotomy resulted in higher likelihood of complete stone clearance compared with sphincterotomy alone (pooled odds ratio [OR] 2.8, 95% CI 1.4-5.7) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Balloon dilation combined with sphincterotomy was associated with lower likelihood of using mechanical lithotripsy for stone extraction compared with sphincterotomy alone (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07-0.72), while there was no significant difference in adverse events between groups. </p><p>Technical aspects and adverse events associated with biliary sphincterotomy and endoscopic papillary balloon dilation are discussed in more detail separately.

Cholangioscopy-guided lithotripsy optimizes stone fragmentation, expedites the procedure, and requires few endoscopic accessories. (See <a class="local">'Cholangioscopy-assisted lithotripsy'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/633.html" rel="external">"Cholangioscopy and pancreatoscopy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1317989694"><span class="h4">Cholangioscopy-assisted lithotripsy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cholangioscopy is an endoscopic technique that facilitates management of complicated bile duct stones by providing direct access to the common bile duct for interventions such as lithotripsy.

After inserting the through-the-scope lithotriptor into the bile duct, the device is opened to capture the stone within the basket. The stone is then fragmented by closing the basket against a metal spiral sheath [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Mechanical lithotripsy can also be performed using an external device that is inserted after the duodenoscope has been removed from the patient (ie, out-of-the-scope device). However, the out-of-the-scope device is only used emergently when a basket containing a large stone becomes impacted in the ampulla. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">To perform mechanical lithotripsy with an out-of-the-scope device, the outer sheath of the basket with the entrapped stone is either cut or disassembled. Then, the basket wire is introduced through the metallic sheath of the lithotriptor. Cranking of the lithotriptor forces the metallic sheath to move forward until it reaches the stone causing tightening, and the resulting pressure fragments the stone.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The out-of-the-scope lithotriptors require the stone to be at the ampullary level, and their use is contraindicated for more proximal stones (unless they can be dragged to an ampullary location) since ductal rupture can occur. In addition, it is very important that after the bare basket is wound in the handle, a loop inside the stomach be formed with the metallic sheath to permit straightening of the lithotriptor cable upon stone fragmentation. Failure to do this can lead to gastric lacerations. Once the stone is fragmented, the basket is removed and the smaller stones are extracted using standard techniques. A small mucosal laceration at the roof of the papilla or at the papillotomy site may be noted but is of uncertain clinical significance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Efficacy</strong> – The success rate for fragmenting stones followed by ductal clearance with mechanical lithotripsy has ranged from 75 to 90 percent, although up to 30 percent of patients require more than one endoscopic session to achieve clearance [<a href="#rid18">18-21</a>]. Predictors of unsuccessful mechanical lithotripsy have included stone impaction, stone size &gt;30 mm, and ratio of stone to bile duct diameter size &gt;1 [<a href="#rid19">19,21</a>].  </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adverse events</strong> – Reported rates of adverse events related to ERCP with mechanical lithotripsy range from 1 to 14 percent and include bleeding, pancreatitis, and cholangitis [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Events that are unique to mechanical lithotripsy include basket entrapment or fracture of the basket, traction wire, or lithotriptor handle. In a study including 643 patients with bile duct stones who had mechanical lithotripsy using through-the-scope technique, the rate of adverse events was 3.5 percent [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Technical complications such as entrapped baskets are typically managed nonsurgically by extending the sphincterotomy or using other lithotripsy methods (eg, cholangioscopy-assisted lithotripsy).

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) confirms the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis, and ERCP-guided techniques (eg, endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy followed by stone removal with basket or balloon catheters) are typically used to clear the common bile duct. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preprocedure evaluation </strong>– Most patients with bile duct stones typically have laboratory studies (liver biochemical tests) and imaging (eg, transabdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography) when the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis is suspected. Thus, additional testing before ERCP is typically not needed. (See <a class="local">'Preprocedure evaluation'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13922.html" rel="external">"Choledocholithiasis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Goal of endoscopic intervention</strong> – For patients with bile duct stones, the goal of endoscopic intervention is complete stone removal during the index procedure by eliminating the biliary sphincter (ie, the principal anatomic barrier impeding stone passage) and facilitating stone extraction  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78786" href="/d/graphic/78786.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients with uncomplicated stones</strong> – Most patients have uncomplicated bile duct stones (ie, ≤3 stones that are &lt;1 cm in size). After gaining access to the biliary tree, removal of bile duct stones is typically achieved with biliary sphincterotomy followed by stone extraction with balloon or basket catheters  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78786" href="/d/graphic/78786.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Patients with uncomplicated stones'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients with complicated stones</strong> – For most patients with complicated bile duct stones  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef138304" href="/d/graphic/138304.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), creating a successful exit path involves a combination of a limited biliary sphincterotomy and endoscopic papillary balloon dilation. For stones requiring fragmentation, selecting a method of lithotripsy is individualized and informed by stone characteristics (eg, size, number), bile duct anatomy, equipment availability, and endoscopist preference. (See <a class="local">'Patients with complicated stones'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Lithotripsy methods include cholangioscopy-guided lithotripsy (ie, electrohydraulic or laser) and mechanical lithotripsy. Cholangioscopy facilitates stone removal by providing direct visualization and access to the bile duct.
