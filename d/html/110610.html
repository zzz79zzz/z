         Ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic malignancy and the most common cause of gynecologic cancer death in the United States. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83387.html" rel="external">
          "Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Incidence and risk factors", section on 'Incidence'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The most common epithelial ovarian cancer histologic subtype is serous. Approximately 90 percent of serous carcinomas are high-grade, and 10 percent are low-grade. Low-grade, serous carcinoma of the ovary or peritoneum appears to exist on a continuum with serous borderline tumors, which are likely precursor lesions, and has a distinct pathology, clinical behavior, and prognosis compared with high-grade, serous carcinoma. Thus, a diagnosis of low-grade serous carcinoma may be made de novo or following an original diagnosis of serous borderline tumor.
        </p>
        <p>
         The pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of low-grade, serous carcinoma will be reviewed here. Aspects of the management of ovarian and peritoneal carcinomas (of higher grade) as well as borderline ovarian tumors are discussed elsewhere.

         </span>
         Based upon pathologic, clinical, and molecular evidence from multiple groups, it is now accepted that low-grade serous tumors of the ovary are a separate disease from high-grade, serous tumors.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pathologic assessment has demonstrated the presence of a serous borderline tumor, non-invasive or invasive implants, and a low-grade cancer in the same patient. Approximately 60 percent of low-grade, serous carcinomas are associated with a serous borderline tumor at diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The continuum between these pathologic entities strongly supports a developmental relationship [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. In addition, clinical studies of the natural history of patients with low-grade serous cancer show that conversion to high-grade cancers essentially never occurs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Furthermore, molecular studies have also supported that low-grade tumors are distinct from high-grade tumors and have a unique developmental pathway.

         Whole genome gene expression profiling shows that borderline tumors are indistinguishable from low-grade tumors and are more similar to normal surface epithelia cells than to high-grade cancers [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3

          CLINICAL PRESENTATION
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The clinical presentation of low-grade, serous carcinoma of the ovary or peritoneum is similar to that of other epithelial cancers of the ovary or peritoneum (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3238.html" rel="external">
          "Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical presentation'
         </a>
         ). However, on average, women with low-grade, serous carcinoma are younger than those with ovarian cancer of all types. Early reports indicate that the median age at diagnosis is 43 to 46.5 years of age [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Approximately 90 percent of low-grade, serous carcinoma present with disseminated disease (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage II to IV). The clinical presentation may range from an asymptomatic adnexal mass to significant symptomatology consisting of bloating, early satiety, urinary urgency, and abdominal or pelvic pain. In more advanced cases, women may also present with a pleural effusion or bowel obstruction.

          DIAGNOSIS
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The diagnosis of low-grade, serous carcinoma is based on histologic evaluation. This evaluation is performed following removal of the ovary(ies) and/or biopsies of the peritoneum. In cases in which primary cytoreductive surgery is deemed inappropriate due to extensive disease or patient comorbidities, the diagnosis is performed following image-guided fine needle aspiration/core biopsy or laparoscopic biopsies.
        </p>
        <p>
         The binary grading system for serous carcinoma was initially proposed in 2004 [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In this system, low-grade, serous carcinoma is characterized by mild to moderate nuclear atypia as a primary feature and up to 12 mitoses per 10 high powered fields (HPF) as a secondary feature. By comparison, high-grade, serous carcinoma is characterized by marked nuclear atypia and &gt;12 mitoses per 10 HPF.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to this report, serous carcinomas were most widely graded using a three-tier system; either the Shimizu-Silverberg system, or the system of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3241.html" rel="external">
          "Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Histopathology", section on 'Low-grade serous carcinoma'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the introduction of the binary grading system for serous carcinoma, it has been demonstrated to be more prognostic than the three-tier systems. It has been widely accepted into clinical practice and incorporated into the 2014 World Health Organization classification [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15
         </a>
         ]. In addition, serous borderline tumors with concomitant invasive peritoneal implants have been reclassified as low-grade, serous carcinomas.
        </p>
        <p>
         In most cases, low-grade, serous carcinoma is characterized by low Ki-67 proliferative rates, wild-type p53 expression, and estrogen receptor (ER) expression. However, ER expression is not pathognomonic for low-grade tumors and should not be used to make the diagnosis.

         The preoperative management of low-grade, serous carcinoma is essentially identical to that for all types of epithelial carcinoma of the ovary or peritoneum. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3193.html" rel="external">
          "Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Surgical staging"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In the process of the preoperative evaluation, based on findings, a determination should be made as to whether the patient is a candidate for surgery. These include several factors, including age, comorbidities, and extent of disease based on imaging. For the rare patient in whom comprehensive surgical staging is not an option (eg, due to unresectable abdominal disease or the presence of extra-abdominal metastases), neoadjuvant chemotherapy is utilized with the goal of proceeding with interval cytoreduction at a later date. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Those in whom primary resection is not feasible'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, if neoadjuvant chemotherapy is being considered, then a histologic diagnosis of serous carcinoma should be confirmed by either image-guided fine needle aspiration/core biopsy or laparoscopic evaluation and biopsies.

There are no distinguishing factors between low-grade, serous carcinoma and other histologic subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer in terms of surgical management. (See

         For patients with apparent stage I disease, comprehensive surgical staging is recommended. In selected young patients with unilateral ovarian involvement, fertility-sparing surgery may be feasible. (See

         For those patients with stage II to IV, low-grade, serous carcinoma, maximum cytoreductive surgery to achieve minimal residual disease (ideally no gross residual disease) is the standard. In an ancillary analysis of Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) 182, 189 women with grade 1 (low-grade), serous carcinoma were accrued. Those women whose primary cytoreductive surgery resulted in microscopic residual disease had a significantly superior progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with women with any gross residual disease [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Among 145 women with stage IIIB to IV low-grade, serous carcinoma treated with primary cytoreductive surgery, those with microscopic residual disease experienced a better PFS and OS (median, 97 versus 35 months) compared with women with residual disease &gt;1 cm [

         The cytoreductive procedure may occur as primary cytoreductive surgery or as interval cytoreductive surgery following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. (See

         Because stage I, low-grade, serous carcinoma is extremely rare (approximately 2 to 6 percent of all low-grade serous tumors [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,11,21

         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. For stage IC, there is no widely accepted standard approach. The NCCN guidelines list a series of options, including observation, taxane/platinum chemotherapy for three to six cycles, or endocrine therapy. The UpToDate authors and editors feel that each of these represents an appropriate option depending on patient and provider preferences, and decisions should be individualized. (See

         Following surgery for more advanced disease, adjuvant systemic therapy consisting of a taxane/platinum regimen is often administered, typically for six cycles. While the NCCN guidelines include alternative options, such as endocrine monotherapy, for most patients we continue to suggest adjuvant chemotherapy, followed by endocrine maintenance therapy. Unlike treatment of higher-grade ovarian cancer, there are no known benefits to intraperitoneal chemotherapy or dose-dense

        </p>
        <p>
         Despite the widespread use of adjuvant chemotherapy for these patients, essentially all of the reports of taxane/platinum chemotherapy in women with newly diagnosed, stage II to IV, low-grade, serous carcinoma have noted the relative chemoresistance of this subtype compared with high-grade, serous carcinoma [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11,20,22-25
         </a>
         ]. These findings have underscored the need for more effective therapy for the first-line treatment of low-grade, serous carcinoma. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Recurrent or metastatic disease'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, there may be a benefit to maintenance endocrine therapy, though prospective data are needed. In a retrospective single-institution study of women with stage II to IV, low-grade, serous carcinoma, those who received endocrine maintenance therapy following completion of primary chemotherapy had an improved PFS compared with women who underwent observation (65 versus 26 months) [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. There was a trend towards improved OS that did not reach statistical significance (116 versus 103 months, respectively).
        </p>
        <p>
         Yet another strategy under investigation is adjuvant endocrine therapy in place of adjuvant chemotherapy. In a second retrospective study, 27 women were treated with cytoreductive surgery followed by endocrine monotherapy (no adjuvant chemotherapy) [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. Optimal cytoreduction to no gross residual disease was achieved in 85.2 percent of patients. Following a median follow-up of 41 months, only six patients had relapsed, and two patients had died due to tumor. The three-year PFS and OS rates were 79.0 and 92.6 percent, respectively.

         For patients in whom initial surgical resection is not appropriate (eg, multiple hepatic or other visceral metastases), an attempt with primary systemic therapy is appropriate. In such cases, we re-image after three cycles to identify patients who can proceed with interval cytoreductive surgery. The approach following surgery mirrors that for patients with higher-grade ovarian cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86318.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Women who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy appear to have a significantly worse outcome than those who undergo primary surgery followed by chemotherapy, though this a likely consequence of their more extensive disease rather than the sequence of treatments. In a retrospective report of 24 evaluable women treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the response rate was only 4 percent (one patient had a complete response), with 88 percent having stable disease and 8 percent having disease progression [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, the median OS for this cohort was only 56.1 months (versus over 100 months for those who undergo surgery and adjuvant therapy, seen in other studies [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]). In an updated series from this group, 36 women with low-grade serous carcinoma received neoadjuvant chemotherapy; the response rate was 11 percent compared with 75 percent for a matched group of 36 women with high-grade serous carcinoma [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28

          Secondary cytoreductive surgery
         </strong>
         – Secondary cytoreductive surgery is considered selectively for a subset of women with relapsed, low-grade, serous carcinoma. For ovarian cancer of all subtypes, there are no strict criteria for recommending this procedure. In general, ideal patients for such an operative procedure are those with platinum-sensitive disease and a limited number of metastatic sites. In a retrospective study of 41 women with recurrent, low-grade, serous carcinoma, no gross residual disease was achieved in only 22 percent [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. Patients who had no gross residual disease following secondary cytoreductive surgery had a significantly better median PFS and OS from the time of secondary surgery compared with women with gross residual disease (60.3 versus 10.7 months, respectively; and 93.6 versus 45.8 months, respectively). Despite the low rate of achievement of no gross residual disease, some gynecologic oncologists may consider secondary cytoreductive surgery with more enthusiasm for low-grade ovarian carcinomas owing to its relative chemoresistance.

          Chemotherapy
         </strong>
         – As in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy setting, the reported response rates to conventional chemotherapy in the relapsed setting are low. In a study of 58 evaluable women who received a total of 108 separate chemotherapy regimens, the overall response rate was &lt;4 percent [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. The response rate was 4.9 percent in the platinum-sensitive cohort and 2.1 percent in the platinum-resistant cohort. However, stable disease was observed in over 60 percent of the treatment regimens. In addition, the median PFS was 29 weeks, and 58 percent of women were progression-free at six months. Patients in this study were generally heavily pretreated. It is possible that a cohort of women who have had a more limited number of prior regimens may demonstrate a higher response rate. In two subsequent prospective randomized trials of a MEK inhibitor versus standard of care drugs in the relapsed setting (see below), the response rate to chemotherapy (

          Endocrine therapy

         Although epidemiologic or trial data are lacking, we avoid hormone replacement therapy for women with low-grade, serous carcinoma, based on the high frequency of ER positivity and activity of anti-estrogen endocrine therapy. Clearly, more studies are needed to define the role of hormonal agents in the management of low-grade, serous carcinoma and to also understand the correlation between ER expression and response to therapy.

In a review of the MD Anderson Low-Grade Serous Tumor Database, of 287 women treated with primary surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy for stage II to IV, low-grade, serous carcinoma, the median progression-free survival was 25.3 months, and the median OS was 97.8 months [

         Ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic malignancy and the most common cause of gynecologic cancer death in the United States. The most common epithelial ovarian cancer histologic subtype is serous. Approximately 90 percent of serous carcinomas are high grade, and 10 percent are low-grade. (See

         On average, women with low-grade, serous carcinoma are younger than those with ovarian cancer of all types, with a median age at diagnosis of 43 to 46.5 years of age. Approximately 90 percent of low-grade, serous carcinoma present with disseminated disease (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage II to IV). (See

         The diagnosis of low-grade, serous carcinoma is based on histologic evaluation of the ovary(ies) and/or biopsies of the peritoneum. Low-grade, serous carcinoma is characterized by mild to moderate nuclear atypia as a primary feature and up to 12 mitoses per 10 high powered fields (HPF) as a secondary feature. By comparison, high-grade, serous carcinoma is characterized by marked nuclear atypia and &gt;12 mitoses per 10 HPF. (See

         The preoperative management of low-grade, serous carcinoma is essentially identical to that for all types of epithelial carcinoma of the ovary or peritoneum. In the process of the preoperative evaluation, based on findings, a determination should be made as to whether to recommend primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on several factors, including age, comorbidities, serum cancer antigen (CA) 125 level, and extent of disease based on imaging.

         With rare exceptions, primary surgery is the recommended approach for the optimal treatment of low-grade, serous carcinoma. There are no distinguishing factors between low-grade, serous carcinoma and other histologic subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer in terms of surgical management. (See

         For patients in whom initial surgical resection is not appropriate (eg, multiple hepatic or other visceral metastases, or comorbidities), an attempt with primary systemic therapy is appropriate. In such cases, we re-image after three cycles to identify patients who can proceed with interval cytoreductive surgery.

         For those undergoing surgery, the approach to adjuvant treatment depends on the stage of the disease. (See

         For those with stage II to IV disease who have undergone surgery, we suggest adjuvant systemic therapy with a taxane/platinum regimen, typically for six cycles, rather than observation or other regimens (

          Grade 2C

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines list a series of options, including observation, taxane/platinum chemotherapy for three to six cycles, or endocrine therapy. Decisions should be individualized based on patient and provider preferences. (See
