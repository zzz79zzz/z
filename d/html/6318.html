         Hair tourniquet or hair-thread tourniquet syndrome describes swelling or ischemia of an appendage (eg, toe, finger, or genitalia) caused by a tightly wound hair or thread in a young infant, although it may rarely occur in older patients [
         <a href="#rid1">

         Narrow constriction of the digit or external genitalia decreases lymphatic and venous drainage, which results in pain, swelling, and edema. If not recognized in a timely fashion, ischemia occurs. With progressive swelling, the constricting agent may become embedded in the soft tissue or cut through the skin and underlying tissues. If not promptly removed, permanent tissue necrosis can develop.

          Hair tourniquet
         </strong>
         – In young infants, hair or thread entrapment of digits  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50150" href="/z/d/graphic/50150.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ) or genitalia arises from the presence of a loose hair or fiber that wraps around the appendage because of movement of the digit or genitalia in a confined area (eg, feet-in pajamas, socks, mittens, or diaper). Discomfort from the hair or thread leads to additional movement, which encourages further entrapment of the appendage over the course of hours or days.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In infants, the hair is frequently the mother's because of increased maternal hair loss during the postpartum period (telogen effluvium). When hair falls unnoticed into the bath water during routine care, it may become attached to the patient's toe, finger, or genitalia (penis, labia, or clitoris) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Hair stretches when wet and can be wound loosely around an appendage but will become constrictive as it dries. Hair may also fall into the diaper during changing.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In addition, pubic hair tourniquets of the clitoris, labia majora, or labia minora may occur in postpubertal adolescents [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-10

          Elastic band tourniquets of the penis

         Hair tourniquets and entrapment of the digit or genitalia are rare conditions. Based upon reviews of reported cases and one small single-center observational series, the tourniquets are most commonly found on the toes, but can also involve the fingers or the external genitalia [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,10,13,14
         </a>
         ]. Hair tourniquet syndrome is more common during winter months in settings with colder climates [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Strangulation injuries of the digits are usually considered to be unintentional.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although most commonly unintentional in young infants, tourniquets of the penis should raise the question of self-application by the patient in older children, adolescents, and adults or child abuse in toddlers who are toilet training. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6600.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although evidence is limited, the location of the injury appears to be associated with the patient's age and the type of tourniquet:

         <strong>
          Toes
         </strong>
         – Toe strangulation most commonly happens in infants younger than 6 months and typically is caused by hair tourniquets  (

         <a href="#rid1">
          1,13
         </a>
         ]. Postpartum telogen effluvium (postpartum hair loss, seen in 90 percent of mothers) may be a contributing factor. (See

         <strong>
          Fingers
         </strong>
         – Finger strangulation tends to be caused by fiber or thread tourniquets and also occurs primarily during infancy [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,13
         </a>
         ]. Finger tourniquets have been described in patients as young as the first few days of life with the thread likely arising from mittens worn to prevent scratching of the face and eyes.

         <strong>
          External genitalia
         </strong>
         – Hair tourniquets occur less commonly on the external genitalia than the digits but have been well described [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,10,13,15
         </a>
         ]. Outside of infancy, tourniquets of the penis are more commonly intentionally applied by the patient or caregiver  (

         <a href="#rid3">
          3,11
         </a>

         The infant with a hair or thread tourniquet usually presents with irritability. Parents/primary caregivers may also report a swelling and discoloration at the site of strangulation. The tourniquet frequently has not been discovered when the infant presents. Older patients frequently report pain and swelling at the site of constriction.
        </p>
        <p>
         Among prepubertal girls and older males with genital tourniquets, some patients will admit that they applied the constricting band. However, this history is not always forthcoming. Furthermore, if the genital tourniquet was applied as punishment or a means to prevent nocturnal enuresis in a toddler or young child by the caregiver, a history may be absent. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Etiology'

         Infants who present with fussiness or irritability should be carefully examined for evidence of a hair or thread tourniquet as well as other etiologies of prolonged or excessive crying  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79185" href="/z/d/graphic/79185.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The digits and genitalia should be carefully inspected for a circumferential band proximal to the swelling. On the fingers or toes, the physician can more easily see the hair on the dorsal surface where it usually penetrates less deeply. Magnification can help to differentiate nonspecific swelling from a hair or fiber tourniquet [

          Superficial tourniquets
         </strong>
         – In patients with superficial tourniquets, the constricting band is readily visible with magnification and the type of material (hair, thread, or other substance) is often discerned  (

         <strong>
          Deep tourniquets
         </strong>
         – Deeply embedded tourniquets present with significant edema and often have tissue ischemia with distal color change (purple, blue, or black). Swelling or reepithelialization can obscure or hide the strand, making the diagnosis more difficult. Due to deep penetration into the soft tissue, the constricting hair, thread, or other tourniquet usually cannot be seen without probing the wound or manipulating the digit which may be too painful to accomplish without sedation. However, a deep, encircling, and narrow indentation of the appendage is highly suggestive of a tourniquet  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112577" href="/z/d/graphic/112577.html" rel="external">
          picture 3
         </a>
         ). Rarely, patients may have ischemia and necrosis from long neglected hair tourniquets [

         When intentional application of a penile tourniquet by the caregiver is suspected, the physician should evaluate for other signs of child physical abuse  (

         </span>
         The diagnosis of a superficial hair tourniquet or other entrapment is made by visualization of a constricting hair, thread, or other material proximal to swelling in the affected appendage (digit, penis, labia, or clitoris)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50150" href="/z/d/graphic/50150.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). On the fingers or toes, the physician can more easily see the hair on the dorsal surface where it usually penetrates less deeply. If the tourniquet is visible, magnification often serves to differentiate hair from other types of tourniquets.
        </p>
        <p>
         Embedded tourniquets usually hide the constricting band but have a characteristic appearance of a narrow, encircling constriction of the digit or external genitalia  (

         Deeply embedded tourniquets present with significant edema and often have tissue ischemia with distal color change (purple, blue, or black). Due to deep penetration into the soft tissue, the constricting hair, thread, or other tourniquet usually cannot be seen without probing the wound or manipulating the digit which may be too painful to accomplish without sedation. However, a deep encircling and narrow indentation of the appendage is highly suggestive of a tourniquet  (

        </p>
        <p>
         Direct incision of the constricting band is necessary to ensure proper treatment of a deeply embedded tourniquet; surgical consultation is warranted. The specific specialist necessary depends upon the location of the tourniquet (ie, urologist for penile tourniquets; gynecologist or, in young females, a pediatric surgeon for tourniquets of the vulva; or general surgeon, plastic surgeon, or orthopedic surgeon for digital tourniquets).

          General anesthesia
         </strong>
         – Examination under anesthesia and lysis of the ligature in the operating room enables the best control of pain and visualization of the injury. This approach is especially appropriate for deeply embedded tourniquets of the penis (maybe complicated by urethral disruption) or vulva (especially if the clitoris is involved).

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Incision of penile or vulvar ligatures require detailed knowledge of the anatomy and are best performed by a surgical subspecialist (urologist or gynecologist).

        <p>
         Some experienced physicians may feel comfortable excising embedded digital tourniquets without surgical consultation. Otherwise, consultation of a general surgeon, plastic surgeon, or orthopedic surgeon, depending upon local availability and practice, is warranted.
        </p>
        <p>
         Key principles for successful incision of digital tourniquets by experienced physicians include:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         When incising the tourniquet, avoid the neurovascular bundles by choosing the 3 o'clock or 9 o'clock position  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79634" href="/z/d/graphic/79634.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). The incision should be made longitudinally in the proximal to distal direction with the scalpel blade perpendicular to the surface of the skin. To ensure that the hair is cut completely, the incision should be to the depth of bone.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         Alternatively, an incision can be made in the dorsal surface of the digit, completely avoiding the neurovascular bundles [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Injury to the extensor tendon is the major disadvantage for this approach. However, a longitudinal incision parallel to the length of the tendon is expected to heal well without long-term sequelae.

         After incision, identify and remove any residual hair, thread, or constricting band from the digit and assess neurovascular and motor (tendon) function. Reperfusion and improvement of pain is usually evident within a few minutes of tourniquet excision. Depending upon the degree of soft tissue injury, however, normal perfusion may not return for several days.

          Etiology
         </strong>
         – Hair tourniquet or hair-thread tourniquet syndrome describes swelling or ischemia of the digit or external genitalia caused by a tightly wound hair or thread in a young infant although it may also occur in older patients and be caused by self-application of other materials which form a constricting band. Intentional application by a caregiver to discourage urination at night in young boys has also been described. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Terminology'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          History
         </strong>
         – The infant with a hair or thread tourniquet usually presents with irritability. Parents/primary caregivers may also report a swelling and discoloration at the site of strangulation. However, the tourniquet frequently has not been discovered when the infant presents. Older patients typically report pain and swelling at the site of constriction but often do
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         admit to intentional application of the tourniquet. (See
         <a class="local">
          'History'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Physical examination and diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Infants who present with fussiness or irritability should be carefully examined for evidence of a hair or thread tourniquet as well as other etiologies of prolonged or excessive crying  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79185" href="/z/d/graphic/79185.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The diagnosis of hair tourniquet is usually made on physical examination (see
         <a class="local">
          'Physical examination'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">

         </span>
         Superficial tourniquets – Superficial tourniquets are typically visible with magnification and the type of material (hair, thread, or other substance) can often be identified  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50150" href="/z/d/graphic/50150.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). On the fingers or toes, the physician can more easily see the hair on the dorsal surface where it usually penetrates less deeply. Swelling may be significant but discoloration or large amounts of skin breakdown associated with ischemia is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         present.

         Deeply embedded tourniquets – Deeply embedded tourniquets present with significant edema and often have tissue ischemia with distal color change (purple, blue, or black). Due to deep penetration into the soft tissue, the constricting hair or other material usually
         <strong>
          cannot
         </strong>
         be seen, but the physician can appreciate a characteristic narrow, encircling constriction of the digit or external genitalia  (

         <strong>
          Management
         </strong>
         – The management of a hair or thread tourniquet depends upon whether it is superficial or deeply embedded and whether strangulation is caused by hair or other material  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112609" href="/z/d/graphic/112609.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ):
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         We suggest that patients with superficial hair tourniquets of the digit or penis initially have a chemical depilatory agent (eg, Nair, Magic Shave, or Veet), if available, applied to dissolve the hair (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). If this method is unsuccessful or a chemical depilatory is not available, the physician should proceed to mechanical removal. Because chemical depilatory agents should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be applied near mucosa, superficial hair tourniquets of the labia or clitoris must
         <strong>
          always
         </strong>
         undergo mechanical removal. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Superficial tourniquet'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         Superficially constricting strings or other band located on the digit or external genitalia require direct excision under magnification. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Thread or other constricting band'
         </a>
         above.)

         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         Deeply embedded tourniquets with ischemia or necrosis require excision and warrant consultation with a surgical specialist. The patient must have proper pain control or sedation for removal. In some patients, especially children with deep tourniquets of the genitalia, general anesthesia may be most appropriate. Alternatively, regional anesthesia (digital or dorsal penile block) and procedural sedation may suffice. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Indications for specialty consultation'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Reperfusion and pain relief is usually evident within a few minutes of tourniquet release. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Superficial tourniquet'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Aftercare and follow-up
         </strong>
         – After removal of the tourniquet, the caregiver or patient should be instructed to keep the affected region elevated if possible to promote more rapid decrease of swelling. Prophylactic antibiotics are not necessary. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Aftercare and follow-up'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The patient should be reevaluated 24 hours later to assure resolution of swelling (superficial tourniquets) or continued improvement (deep tourniquets). If swelling is not changed or worse, surgical consultation is warranted to evaluate for continued strangulation caused by a residual tourniquet. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Aftercare and follow-up'
         </a>
