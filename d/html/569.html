         The "classic" signs and symptoms of asthma are intermittent dyspnea, cough, and wheezing. While typical of asthma, these symptoms are nonspecific, making it difficult to distinguish asthma from other respiratory diseases and even nonrespiratory disease. The definitive diagnosis of asthma requires the history or presence of respiratory symptoms consistent with asthma, combined with the demonstration of variable expiratory airflow obstruction and/or hyperresponsiveness [

         The diagnosis of asthma is based upon a compatible clinical history and characteristic findings from a series of pulmonary function tests (PFTs) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>

          4-7
         </a>
         ]. It is important to realize that these techniques are not necessarily equivalent because of the complex physiology of the lung, the variable ability of patients to perform the tests, the accuracy of the tests themselves, and the underlying disease process.

          Technique

          Typical results in asthma
         </strong>
         – During times when individuals with asthma are asymptomatic, spirometry is often normal. When asthma is symptomatic, airflow limitation is usually present on spirometry, as indicated by an FEV

         /FVC ratio less than lower limits of normal (LLN; the fifth percentile of the confidence interval provided electronically by computerized spirometers). On the other hand, some patients with asthma have persistent airflow limitation with or without symptoms, usually associated with long standing disease that has not been well controlled.

          Role of race
         </strong>
         – The role of race in the selection of reference values for spirometry has garnered increasing attention and controversy. The 2022 European Respiratory Society / American Thoracic Society guidelines suggest the use of the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) equations, which allow for the determination lung function predicted values and lower limits of normal for persons aged 3 to 95 years [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. These equations are available for a few self-identified ethnic groups: Caucasian, African-American, North Asian, and Southeast Asian. Race-neutral approaches using different GLI-derived equations [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>
         ] have been advocated as an alternative that may prevent underdiagnosis of clinically significant disease in some racial groups; however this universality comes at the cost of widening the normal range and therefore modestly decreasing the sensitivity of the test [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14

         The flow-volume relationship or loop is obtained by plotting flow against volume during the FVC (forced expiratory) maneuver. An inspiratory loop is obtained when a maximal inhalation to total lung capacity is performed after the FVC maneuver or from functional residual capacity. This measurement yields useful additional information beyond that obtained with measurement of FEV
         <sub>
          1
         </sub>
         and FVC, specifically by providing rapidly recognizable patterns that permit the clinician to differentiate bronchial asthma from the airflow limitation due to other causes, such as paradoxical vocal fold motion or a fixed obstruction [

         ). The upper left panel shows intrathoracic airflow limitation, such as might be seen in asthma or COPD. The notable feature is the downward "scooping" of the expiratory curve. In milder airflow limitation or disease largely confined to the small airways, the "scooping" occurs at low lung volume, so the FEV
         <sub>

         – When using the flow-volume loop to identify processes other than asthma that can cause similar symptoms, the reductions in maximal respiratory flow shown in the lower three panels often accompany clinical symptoms of dyspnea and wheeze. However, the cause of airflow limitation in these situations is central airway narrowing rather than asthma. Such patients will not respond to asthma therapy, since inflammation or bronchospasm are not the cause of the airflow limitation.

One actuation of the inhaler is made into the chamber; the patient inhales fully to total lung capacity; the breath is held for 5 to 10 seconds before exhalation. The dose is repeated one to three times. The post-bronchodilator spirometry is performed after an appropriate delay for the bronchodilator used (10 to 20 minutes) to allow the beta-agonist to work.

         – For patients with baseline airflow limitation, a bronchodilator response is defined as an increase in FEV

         or FVC by greater than 10 percent of their mean predicted value [

         ]. To calculate the bronchodilator response, one can use the following equation: Bronchodilator response = ([Postbronchodilator value – Prebronchodilator value] x 100)/Predicted value, where "value" is either FEV
         <sub>

          Other measures of airflow limitation
         </strong>
         – It has been suggested that additional parameters of airflow obstruction be used to assess reversibility, such as specific airway conductance (SGaw) obtained with a plethysmograph. This approach increases the likelihood of observing airflow reversibility, although it is not universally accepted. As an example, one study of 100 patients with clinically suspected reversible airway obstruction reported that spirometry detected reversible obstruction in 82 [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Using body plethysmography revealed that 15 of the remaining 18 patients also responded to bronchodilators with either a change in SGaw or lung volumes. If a patient fails to show an improvement in FEV

         </a>
         treatment and a clinical response appears to occur, body plethysmography can be used to document this change. Similar results are seen when oscillometry is used as an alternative measure of reversibility [

         Peak expiratory flow (PEF) is measured during a maximally forceful and rapid exhalation that immediately follows a maximal inhalation. An advantage is that small, portable devices can be used. PEF measurements are most often used to monitor patients with a known diagnosis of asthma or to assess the role of a particular occupational exposure or trigger, rather than as a tool for the primary diagnosis of asthma [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. The technique of measuring PEF and the role of PEF monitoring in asthma management are discussed separately. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Measurement of PEF has several shortcomings for the diagnosis of asthma, the most serious of which is its significant dependence on effort [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,22
         </a>
         ]. In contrast to spirometry, it is difficult to apply quality control to PEF measurement, as PEF meters cannot be easily calibrated; and the lack of graphic display makes it difficult to ensure optimal technique and maximal patient effort. Furthermore, the large variability of PEF between individuals (±30 percent) and for a given individual (±15 percent) makes PEF insensitive for detecting airflow limitation [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         PEF is a useful method of monitoring changes or trends in the patient's lung function [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,6,8
         </a>
         ]. PEF results that vary little over time (less than 20 percent of the maximal value) argue against the diagnosis of asthma, while values that repeatedly fall by more than 20 percent when symptoms are present and return to baseline as symptoms resolve are consistent with asthma. Peak flow is gradually being replaced by a plethora of portable devices that can directly measure FEV

         Peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurement can be a useful component of home self-assessment and can help the patient identify changes in lung function during exacerbations or trigger exposure. Ongoing twice daily PEF assessment is typically reserved for patients with severe asthma or those with impaired perception of airflow limitation [

         The optimal frequency of spirometry during follow-up office visits for asthma has not been determined. Guidelines suggest repeat spirometry three to six months after initiation of controller therapy and periodically thereafter [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. We base the frequency of follow-up spirometry on the degree of asthma symptom control and the results of previous testing. If symptoms are well-controlled and prior spirometry was normal, follow-up spirometry can be obtained infrequently (eg, every one to three years). If the patient has persistent symptoms (eg, dyspnea, poor exercise tolerance, frequent short-acting beta-agonist use) or had baseline airflow limitation in the past, more frequent testing may be warranted (eg, at three- to twelve-month intervals). Test results can be used to determine whether symptoms reflect poor asthma control or an alternate process and whether therapy has improved lung function, or not. (See

         Lung volumes provide indirect information about the elastic recoil of the chest wall and lung. At total lung capacity, the elastic recoil of the lungs is the key determinant of the driving pressure for expiratory airflow during passive exhalation. Hence, a decrease in TLC may indicate an increase in recoil whereas an increase in TLC may indicate a decrease in recoil.

         Measurement of lung volumes can be useful in the evaluation of other causes of dyspnea or periodic airflow limitation due to restrictive processes, which can masquerade clinically as asthma. As an example, in a patient who presents with episodic dyspnea after working in a barn or exposure to epoxy resin, a reduced forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV
         <sub>

         ) combined with a reduced total lung capacity (TLC) suggests a restrictive process, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, rather than asthma. This alternate diagnosis might be further evaluated with chest computed tomography, which would likely demonstrate centrilobular nodular opacities, consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

         ). Elevation in the TLC is usually associated with more severe airflow limitation or asthma of longer duration. The likely physiological mechanisms for hyperinflation include a loss of lung elastic recoil, increased outward recoil of the chest wall, and increased inspiratory muscle strength [

         Use of RV/TLC or FRC/TLC ratios can be quite helpful in patients for whom predicted values of the individual measurements are less reliable, eg, young children or patients with unusual ethnic origins. The RV/TLC is generally high but must be greater than approximately 150 percent of predicted before it can be considered to be abnormal.

          Asthma and COPD overlap

         </a>
         ]. According to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) and Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) consensus statement, ACOS "is characterized by persistent airflow limitation with several features usually associated with asthma and several features usually associated with COPD. ACOS is therefore identified in clinical practice by the features that it shares with both asthma and COPD" [

          Asthma and obesity
         </strong>
         – Obesity alone, unless severe or combined with another respiratory disease, has a measurable but small effect on spirometric values and gas transfer. When severe, chest wall and abdominal obesity can cause reduced chest wall and lung compliance with associated restrictive changes in lung volumes. Adults with obesity and asthma often have normal baseline pulmonary function tests without airflow limitation (defined as a ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity [FEV

         – A patient with asthma could develop diaphragmatic weakness or other respiratory muscle impairment as a comorbid disease or as a consequence of systemic glucocorticoid therapy. Respiratory muscle weakness is most often assessed by measurement of maximal inspiratory/expiratory mouth pressures, although other less well-established measurements can also be performed. (See

          Lung static recoil
         </strong>
         – Lung static recoil refers to the elastic forces in the lung causing passive exhalation. As the lung expands during inhalation, the elastic recoil forces increase. At full inspiration after flow ceases, the lung static recoil is maximal. Elastic recoil is inversely proportional to compliance (volume/pressure), which is the slope of the pressure-volume curve. While it is generally believed that asthma causes a parallel upward shift of the pressure-volume (PV) curve of the lung [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ], several studies have demonstrated a loss of elastic recoil, ie, decreased static recoil pressure at a given volume [

         – Reversible airflow limitation is an essential component in the diagnosis of asthma. According to national and international guidelines, virtually all adolescents and adults being treated for asthma should have a baseline spirometry before and after inhaled bronchodilator. (See

         While consensus is lacking on the exact criteria for reversibility following inhaled bronchodilator, a reasonable approach is to use this equation: Bronchodilator response = ([Postbronchodilator value – Prebronchodilator value] x 100)/Predicted value. A bronchodilator response of &gt;10 percent relative to the predicted value for FEV
         <sub>
          1
         </sub>
         or FVC is considered significant. Normal baseline airflow that increases by similar amounts is consistent with mild, reversible airflow limitation. (See

          Flow-volume loops
         </strong>
         – For patients in whom the diagnosis of asthma is not clear after expiratory spirometry, we examine flow-volume loops (inspiratory and expiratory) to exclude upper airway obstruction as a cause of the patient’s symptoms  (

          Bronchoprovocation testing
         </strong>
         – For patients with suspected asthma, but normal airflow without a bronchodilator response, bronchoprovocation challenge testing may be useful to confirm (or exclude) the diagnosis of asthma. (See

          Effects of asthma on other lung function measurements
         </strong>
         – Although not typically part of the evaluation of asthma, lung volumes and diffusing capacity can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis in some situations.

         <strong>
          Lung volumes
         </strong>
         – Lung volume measurements are indicated in the evaluation of asthma when the results from the above tests are suggestive of other processes (eg, a decrease in FVC) or the initial studies are equivocal. In asthma, the residual volume (RV) is the most consistently abnormal of all the lung volumes  (

         <strong>
          Diffusing capacity
         </strong>
         – The diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) has a limited role in asthma. However, it is useful in the evaluation of possible emphysema and in patients whose dyspnea is out of proportion to their airflow limitation. The diffusing capacity is usually normal or elevated in asthma and decreased in emphysema, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary hypertension. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diffusing capacity'

         <strong>
          Other measurements
         </strong>
         – Difficulty performing spirometry may indicate the need for either a neuromuscular evaluation or tests that do not require maximal patient effort, such as measurement of specific airway conductance (SGaw) by plethysmography or respiratory resistance with oscillometry. (See
