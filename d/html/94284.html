For elective aneurysm surgery, an arterial catheter may be deferred until post-induction for patient comfort or preference if the surgical and neuro-anesthesia team feel that there is low risk of aneurysm rupture during induction and intubation. Standard anesthesia monitors should also be applied (ie, ECG, pulse oximeter, temperature, end-tidal carbon dioxide [ETCO<sub>2</sub>]). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/93391.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for craniotomy in adults", section on 'Monitoring'</a>.)</p><p>Patients may have other neurocritical care monitoring devices in place, such as an external ventricular drain (EVD), a jugular saturation (SjVO<sub>2</sub>) catheter, or a brain tissue oxygen intraparenchymal probe. When possible, such monitoring should be continued throughout the perioperative period. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94283.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for patients with acute traumatic brain injury", section on 'Monitoring'</a>.)</p><p>Neurophysiologic monitoring (ie, electroencephalography [EEG] and/or evoked potential monitoring) may be used and will affect the choice and timing of anesthetic drugs and neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91216.html" rel="external">"Neuromonitoring in surgery and anesthesia"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H83433575"><span class="h4">Venous access</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We place two intravenous (IV) catheters for intracranial aneurysm procedures, including at least one large-bore catheter (≥16 gauge).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2421983272"><span class="h4">Blood pressure goals</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The optimal therapy for hypertension and goals for BP in patients with aneurysms are unclear. In patients with ruptured aneurysms, systemic hypertension may be a normal hemodynamic response, which maintains cerebral perfusion in the setting of increased ICP. One study showed a lack of association between variable EtCO<sub>2</sub> and BP values and neurologic outcome in patients with SAH [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. However, it is likely, that participating anesthesiologists sought to maintain reasonable EtCO<sub>2</sub> and BP goals throughout endovascular coiling or clipping of the cerebral aneurysm in trial patients . </p><p>Our usual approach to BP management during induction and maintenance of anesthesia in these patients is as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Unruptured aneurysms and ruptured aneurysms with suspected normal ICP (ie, normal neurologic examination)</strong> – Aim for systolic BP ≤ the patient's normal systolic BP, maximum 140 mmHg, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥60 mmHg.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ruptured aneurysms with suspected or known intracranial hypertension</strong> – Passive hypertension should not be treated. Hypertension in response to noxious stimulation and iatrogenic hypertension due to vasopressors should be avoided. If an ICP monitor is in place, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = MAP - ICP) ≥50 to 60 mmHg should be maintained.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H854385389"><span class="h3">Premedication</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Anxiolytic premedication (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9650" href="/z/d/drug information/9650.html" rel="external">midazolam</a> 1 to 2 mg IV, titrated to effect) is usually appropriate for elective aneurysm procedures. Premedication for patients with SAH should be tailored to the patient's mental status.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1355849161"><span class="h3">Induction of anesthesia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>IV induction of anesthesia is usually performed for adult patients. The goal for induction for these procedures is to maintain <strong>hemodynamic stability</strong>. Drugs and doses should be selected to avoid hypertension and the risk of aneurysmal rupture, while avoiding hypotension, to maintain a stable CPP, particularly in patients with high-grade SAH who may not have normal autoregulatory capacity.</p><p>The choice of induction agents, adjuvant drugs for induction, and airway management strategies are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/93391.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for craniotomy in adults", section on 'Induction of anesthesia'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94135.html" rel="external">"Induction of general anesthesia: Overview"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3295081700"><span class="h3">Maintenance of anesthesia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A variety of anesthetic regimens may be used for craniotomy for aneurysm surgery, depending on the degree of preexisting intracranial hypertension, the need for brain relaxation during surgery, the use of neuromonitoring, and the patient's medical comorbidities. At the authors' institution, where neuromonitoring is routinely used for these procedures, the usual anesthetic includes a <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9826" href="/z/d/drug information/9826.html" rel="external">propofol</a> infusion in conjunction with low-dose volatile anesthetics. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91216.html" rel="external">"Neuromonitoring in surgery and anesthesia", section on 'Balanced anesthetic approach'</a>.) </p><p>Maintenance of anesthesia for craniotomy is discussed in detail separately.

Prior to clip placement, decreased BP may help the surgeon manipulate the artery, though profound hypotension should be avoided. Specific, individualized goals should be discussed with the surgeon. </p><p>The temporary clip creates an area of focal ischemia, and neurologic outcomes are worse with prolonged occlusion times [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Neuromonitoring (eg, somatosensory evoked potential [SSEP], EEG) can be used to assess the adequacy of blood flow; when changes suggest ischemia, or during longer clip times, an increase in MAP of 10 to 20 percent may be appropriate. The authors routinely use neuromonitoring with SSEPs during temporary clipping, particularly for internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery territory aneurysms. SSEPs are generally used rather than motor evoked potentials to allow for the use of neuromuscular blockade. Motor evoked potentials may be added for aneurysms placing certain vascular distributions at risk, including the internal capsule [<a href="#rid7">7</a>] .

A post hoc analysis of the Intraoperative Hypothermia for Aneurysm Surgery Trial (IHAST) study, which was randomized for hypothermia but not for neuroprotective medications, found that anesthetic neuroprotective drugs and induced hypothermia (33.3 ± 0.8 degrees C) were not associated with improved outcomes in patients who had temporary clips applied [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].

This technique can be used as an alternative to temporary clipping in selected patients, or in the event of aneurysmal rupture [<a href="#rid9">9-13</a>].

Transcutaneous pacing pads should be considered for possible temporary pacing or cardioversion for patients in whom adenosine is either planned or likely based on the risk for aneurysmal rupture. Optimal dosing for adenosine in this setting is unclear, and the dose response may vary. Escalating doses have often been administered, starting with an initial dose of 6 to 12 mg IV and adding increments of 6 mg. In one case series including 27 patients, adenosine doses between 0.24 and 0.42 mg/kg IV resulted in 30 to 60 seconds of asystole or hypotension [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. If there is no time for dose escalation (eg, aneurysmal rupture), we administer an initial dose of adenosine 0.4 to 0.6 mg/kg IV, expecting asystole for 20 to 40 seconds, though it may last 60 seconds or more.

EC-IC bypass is usually performed for patients with intracerebral atherosclerotic disease, moyamoya disease, or complex intracerebral aneurysms requiring aneurysm trapping (ie, permanent feeding and outflow arterial clipping) that results in permanent occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid artery. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1112.html" rel="external">"Moyamoya disease and moyamoya syndrome: Treatment and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25149520"><span class="h2">Extracranial-intracranial bypass procedures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A variety of EC-IC bypass procedures have been described. A direct anastomosis of either the superficial temporal or middle meningeal artery to a branch of the MCA can be considered in some patients, especially those requiring acute internal carotid artery occlusion for aneurysm trapping. However, given that the extracranial and intracranial vessels often have a small diameter (making direct anastomosis technically challenging), other indirect bypass procedures can be considered. Indirect procedures include encephalomyosynangiosis, where a branch of the superficial temporal artery is dissected along with its surrounding muscle and secured directly to the brain surface. In time, and in a brain with chronic hypoperfusion as is common in patients with Moyamoya disease, collateral vessels develop between the superficial temporal artery and branches of the MCA.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2307428707"><span class="h2">Anesthesia for extracranial-intracranial bypass</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>EC-IC bypass procedures require craniotomy, as a skull defect is produced to allow for the superficial temporal artery to enter the cranial vault. Anesthetic management for craniotomy is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/93391.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for craniotomy in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Anesthetic considerations specific to patients having EC-IC bypass are discussed here.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Blood pressure (BP) management </strong>–<strong> </strong>A primary goal for anesthesia for these procedures is to avoid cerebral ischemia or infarction by maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Patients with intracranial vascular stenosis or Moyamoya disease are exquisitely sensitive to hypotension as it may precipitate cerebral ischemia. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) should be maintained at or above awake level at all times. An arterial catheter placed prior to induction of anesthesia is recommended to monitor for hypotension with induction of anesthesia. Hypovolemia should be avoided as it can contribute to hypotension.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ventilation</strong> – Hyperventilation should be avoided, as should hypoventilation because the resulting cerebral vasodilation can potentially lead to a steal physiology in the cerebral circulation, diverting blood flow away from ischemic vessels. Therefore, documented normocapnia should be maintained throughout the procedure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neuromonitoring </strong>–<strong> </strong>Intraoperative electroencephalography (EEG) or evoked potential monitoring can be considered to detect cerebral hypoperfusion. If ischemia is detected, both surgeon and anesthesiologist should be notified. The anesthesiologist can increase BP, confirm normocapnia, ensure adequate arterial oxygen content, and treat anemia if present in an effort to try to improve cerebral oxygen delivery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Temporary arterial occlusion</strong> – In patients having direct EC-IC bypass, temporary arterial occlusion is often required for vessel anastomosis. If temporary clipping is planned, BP should be increased by 10 to 20 percent in an attempt to improve collateral blood flow while vessels are clamped. The use of anesthetics for neuroprotection during temporary clipping is discussed separately. (See <a class="local">'Temporary clipping'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2926982903"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intracranial aneurysm – </strong>Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) may exhibit physiologic derangements that affect anesthetic management, including neurologic dysfunction, cardiac abnormalities, electrolyte disturbances, anemia, and seizures. (See <a class="local">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Hemodynamic management – </strong>A primary goal for anesthesia for these procedures is hemodynamic stability, avoiding hypertension and aneurysmal rupture while maintaining cerebral perfusion. An arterial catheter should be placed prior to induction of anesthesia to allow continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Unruptured aneurysms and ruptured aneurysm with suspected normal intracranial pressure (ICP) (ie, normal neurologic examination)</strong> – Aim for systolic BP ≤ the patient's normal systolic BP, maximum 140 mmHg, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥60 mmHg.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Ruptured aneurysm with suspected or known intracranial hypertension</strong> – Passive hypertension should not be treated. Hypertension in response to noxious stimulation and iatrogenic hypertension due to vasopressors should be avoided, and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) ≥50 to 60 mmHg should be maintained. (See <a class="local">'Blood pressure goals'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Temporary clipping – </strong>A temporary clip may be placed on a feeding vessel to facilitate dissection and permanent clipping. During longer clip times, or if neuromonitoring shows ischemic changes during temporary clipping, increasing MAP by 10 to 20 percent may be appropriate.(See <a class="local">'Temporary clipping'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9359" href="/z/d/drug information/9359.html" rel="external">Adenosine</a> may be administered to induce temporary bradycardia or cardiac arrest to reduce or suspend flow through the aneurysm as an alternative to temporary clipping, or in the event of intraoperative aneurysm rupture.

If using a propofol infusion for maintenance of anesthesia, increase the propofol rate to &gt;125 mcg/kg/minute IV. If electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring is being used, propofol dosing can be titrated to achieve burst suppression.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Volume resuscitate</strong> – After aneurysm clipping, administer IV fluid and blood products to achieve euvolemia and hemoglobin ≥8 gm/dL.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">If aneurysm rupture occurs prior to exposure of the aneurysm in an anesthetized patient, signs may include unexplained hypertension and/or ICP and a drop in heart rate. Management may include brain imaging, angiography, or continuation with surgery. Anesthetic management should include the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Optimize CPP</strong> – Allow permissive hypertension. Aim for a CPP 50 to 70 mmHg if ICP monitor is in place, or MAP &gt;90 mmHg without ICP monitoring; administer vasopressors as necessary to increase BP. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Manage intracranial hypertension</strong> – Optimize ventilation, administer osmotherapy, and optimize venous drainage.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Reduce cerebral metabolic rate</strong> – Administer <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9826" href="/z/d/drug information/9826.html" rel="external">propofol</a> 20 to 60 mg IV to achieve EEG burst suppression. If using total IV anesthesia (TIVA), increase propofol rate as able to sustain burst suppression (typically &gt;125 mcg/kg/minute IV).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) – </strong>AVMs are often treated with combined therapy, including endovascular procedures designed to occlude feeding arteries and reduce the risk of intraoperative hemorrhage, followed by surgical resection of the lesion.

(See <a class="local">'Brain arteriovenous malformations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Endovascular therapy – </strong>Goals for anesthesia for endovascular therapy for aneurysms and brain AVMs are similar to the goals for open procedures.
