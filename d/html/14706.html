In addition, most patients report some degree of impairment in psychosocial functioning (home, work, personal life, or social life), and 19 percent report severe impairment.</p><p>The phenomenon of binge eating was first described formally in 1959 in individuals with obesity [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. However, binge eating disorder was first formulated as a distinct diagnosis in the 1990s [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>This topic provides an overview of evaluating and treating patients for binge eating disorder. The use of cognitive-behavioral therapy to treat binge eating disorder is discussed separately, as is the diagnosis and treatment of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and obesity:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15601.html" rel="external">"Binge eating disorder: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2093.html" rel="external">"Eating disorders: Overview of epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2094.html" rel="external">"Eating disorders: Overview of prevention and treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5371.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Overview of management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H130122329"><span class="h1">DEFINITION OF BINGE EATING DISORDER</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Binge eating disorder is defined as eating an amount of food in a discrete period of time (eg, two hours) that is definitely larger than most people would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. These episodes occur, on average, at least once a week for three months. Episodes of binge eating are associated with a lack of control and with distress over the eating. Additional information about the diagnosis of binge eating disorder is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2093.html" rel="external">"Eating disorders: Overview of epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H118452871"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An assessment of the patient with binge eating disorder is necessary in order to plan treatment. The evaluation should include the following:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22437814"><span class="h2">Psychiatric status</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The history and mental status examination include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Attitude toward body weight and shape</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Self-esteem</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Comorbid psychiatric disorders (eg, depression and substance use disorder)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22437822"><span class="h2">Medical status</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The history and physical examination should focus upon the following parameters and comorbidities associated with excess weight or obesity in appropriate patients.

In addition, patients with diabetes mellitus may deliberately withhold insulin doses to prevent weight gain, and patients with hypothyroidism may overuse thyroid hormone supplements to promote weight loss. Regular use of compensatory measures in the presence of binge eating suggests a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa rather than binge eating disorder.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H130122336"><span class="h1">TREATMENT PLANNING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>After evaluating patients with binge eating disorder, clinicians need to determine the treatment setting, type of treatment that should be used, and who will treat the patient.</p><p>Treatment goals determine treatment selection and should be clearly established. Goals for treatment may include reducing the patient’s:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Binge eating episodes</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Excess weight if overweight or obese</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Excessive concerns with body image (ie, enhancing self-acceptance of one’s body)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Psychiatric comorbidity such as anxiety, depression, or substance use disorder</p><p></p><p>It is useful to distinguish treatment for binge eating disorder per se from treatment of obesity in patients who have both. Patients with binge eating disorder who are overweight or obese have varying goals. (See <a class="local">'Treating obesity in patients with binge eating disorder'</a> below.)</p><p>It is not clear if binge eating causes negative medical consequences in patients with normal weight [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. However, such patients may wish to undergo treatment, because our clinical experience is such that the disorder may lead to excess weight or obesity over time.</p><p>Different types of treatment are available, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Psychotherapy adapted for binge eating disorder</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Self-help treatment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pharmacotherapy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Behavioral weight loss treatment</p><p></p><p>(See <a class="local">'Psychotherapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Behavioral weight loss therapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Combining CBT and pharmacotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Reviews have consistently concluded that psychotherapy alone is more beneficial than pharmacotherapy alone in treating binge eating disorder [<a href="#rid7">7-12</a>]. Thus, standard, first-line treatment consists of psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy. Medication is also efficacious as a second-line treatment. However, head-to-head trials comparing different active treatments are lacking [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In addition, it is not known whether there are different subtypes of the disorder that respond preferentially to each treatment option.</p><p>Although binge eating disorder tends to follow a long-term remitting and relapsing course, nearly all treatment studies have been short term. Some of these studies have collected follow-up data one to two years after the end of treatment, but there is limited information describing the status of patients more than two years after treatment ended.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H130122345"><span class="h2">Treatment setting</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment for binge eating disorder nearly always takes place on an outpatient basis. Inpatient, partial hospital, or long-term residential treatment is considered only if the patient has additional psychopathology or medical morbidity that requires a more intense level of care, (eg, suicidality) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3060059"><span class="h2">Treatment team</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients with binge eating disorder receive individual psychotherapy, although group therapy is also commonly provided. Pharmacotherapy may be provided by a clinician with prescribing privileges. Thus, the treatment team typically consists of a therapist and/or psychiatrist or primary care clinician, particularly if medications are being prescribed. Nutritionists (registered dieticians) may also be involved in providing behavioral weight loss therapy or nutritional counseling. Primary care clinicians who typically do not treat binge eating disorder may refer the patient. (See <a class="local">'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H130122373"><span class="h1">PSYCHOTHERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Psychotherapy (eg, cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]) is first-line treatment for binge eating disorder [<a href="#rid9">9,11,13</a>]. A meta-analysis examined six randomized psychotherapy trials (five with CBT, one with dialectical behavior therapy, total of 301 patients) and found a large clinical effect for psychotherapy in reducing binge eating [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. By contrast, the same study performed a separate meta-analysis of randomized pharmacotherapy trials, and found a medium-sized clinical effect. None of the underlying trials involved a head-to-head comparison of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy.</p><p>Psychotherapies that have demonstrated efficacy for treating binge eating disorder include CBT, interpersonal psychotherapy, and dialectical behavior therapy [<a href="#rid11">11,14</a>]. There are fewer data supporting the use of psychodynamic psychotherapy, but the consensus of clinical experts is that it may help reduce binge eating in some patients [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>The psychotherapy of choice for binge eating disorder is either CBT or interpersonal therapy, based upon the results of randomized trials that have evaluated each treatment, either separately or within the same study [<a href="#rid8">8,13,15-21</a>]. We suggest CBT because there is more evidence supporting its use. In addition, CBT has been adapted for use in different formats.</p><p>Persistent improvement in binge eating disorder often occurs following treatment with CBT, interpersonal psychotherapy, or behavioral weight loss therapy; however, many patients tend to follow a long term remitting and relapsing course of illness:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In an observational study of 55 patients initially treated with CBT or interpersonal psychotherapy in a randomized trial, assessments were completed posttreatment, one year after treatment cessation, and four years after treatment [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Recovery at the four-year follow-up was observed in 65 percent of patients, whereas persistent recovery across all three assessments occurred in approximately 25 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An observational study assessed 48 patients approximately six years after they were initially treated with CBT or behavioral weight loss therapy in a randomized trial [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Substantial improvement during treatment was followed by worse outcomes during follow-up; nevertheless, at the six-year follow-up, only 8 percent met diagnostic criteria for binge eating disorder.</p><p></p><p>A longer duration of psychotherapy leads to better outcomes. In a pooled analysis of 11 randomized trials (1073 patients with binge eating disorder), the probability of remission was greater with longer treatments (odds ratio 2.6) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3058077"><span class="h2">Cognitive-behavioral therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with binge eating disorder, we suggest CBT as first line treatment. CBT has been more widely studied for binge eating disorder than any other treatment, and multiple reviews and treatment guidelines concur that CBT is the primary treatment for binge eating disorder [<a href="#rid8">8,9,11,14</a>]. CBT is suitable for most patients, and there are no specific contraindications.</p><p>CBT is usually administered by a clinician (therapist-led) to either an individual patient or a group [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Alternatively, patients with binge eating disorder can receive CBT through a self-help program, which requires either limited or no involvement of a clinician (guided or pure self-help). The use and administration of CBT to treat binge eating disorder is discussed separately, including the theoretical foundation of CBT, the format for providing the treatment, self-help forms of CBT, and the specific interventions that comprise CBT. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15601.html" rel="external">"Binge eating disorder: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)"</a>.)</p><p>Randomized trials indicate that CBT can be efficacious for binge eating disorder [<a href="#rid8">8,9,11,14,25</a>]. As an example, a pooled analysis of four randomized trials (n = 295 patients) compared therapist-led CBT with a waiting list control condition (no treatment), and found that abstinence from binge eating episodes occurred in more patients who received CBT than controls (59 versus 11 percent) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In addition, CBT appears to be well tolerated, based upon excellent rates of treatment completion (approximately 80 percent), and remission with CBT is maintained at one- and two-year follow-up [<a href="#rid9">9,26</a>]. However, waiting lists do not control for nonspecific aspects of psychotherapy (eg, attention), and a review found that reduction of comorbid depressive symptoms was comparable for CBT and waitlists [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>For patients with binge eating disorder who are treated with CBT, a good prognostic sign is a prompt and clinically-meaningful change in symptoms. In a 16-week randomized trial, rapid response was defined as a 65 percent reduction in binge eating by the fourth week of treatment [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Among patients who received CBT (n = 54), remission occurred in more patients with a rapid response than patients without a rapid response (73 versus 43 percent).</p><p>Among patients with binge eating disorder who are treated with CBT, a history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa is associated with poorer outcomes. At the end of a 20-week randomized trial that compared three types of group CBT for treatment of binge eating disorder (n = 189), the mean number of binge episodes in the past month was greater in patients with a lifetime history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa than patients with no such history (seven versus two episodes) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. In addition, the difference persisted at the one-year follow-up assessment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H122508709"><span class="h3">Self-help CBT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many studies have demonstrated that self-help based upon cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is efficacious for treating binge eating disorder. In addition, self-help may be as effective as specialty treatments such as therapist-led CBT or interpersonal psychotherapy. However, self-help CBT may be less effective when delivered in a primary care setting, rather than a specialty setting such as an eating disorder clinic [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p>Various methods are available for administering self-help CBT to patients with binge eating disorder. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15601.html" rel="external">"Binge eating disorder: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)", section on 'Self-help forms of CBT'</a>.)</p><p>Evidence supporting the use of self-help CBT includes the following [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 2008 review included six studies of self-help interventions for patients with binge eating disorder and found that self-help was superior to waiting list control [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. The review also found that patients may respond better to guided self-help that specifically addresses binge eating disorder, as opposed to nonspecific self-help focusing upon obesity or self-assertion. In addition, symptomatic improvement with self-help was consistently maintained at follow-up 3 to 18 months after treatment was finished.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 2010 meta-analysis of four randomized trials (152 patients with binge eating disorder) compared self-help CBT with a waiting list control (no treatment) and found that CBT provided a large clinical benefit in reducing the frequency of binge eating as well as concerns with eating, shape, and weight [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Subsequent randomized trials have also found that self-help CBT is beneficial [<a href="#rid31">31-36</a>], but face-to-face CBT may be superior to the self-help format [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H36401440"><span class="h3">CBT compared with other psychosocial interventions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with binge eating disorder, the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy are similar, based upon randomized trials [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In one trial, 205 patients with a high body mass index were assigned to 10 sessions of guided self-help based upon CBT, 19 sessions of individual interpersonal psychotherapy, or 20 sessions of behavioral weight loss therapy [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Remission from binge eating at the two-year follow-up was significantly greater for patients who received guided self-help CBT or interpersonal psychotherapy, compared with patients who received behavioral weight loss therapy (62 and 68 versus 44 percent). Attrition was significantly higher for guided self-help CBT or behavioral weight loss therapy compared with interpersonal psychotherapy (30 and 28 versus 7 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A secondary analysis identified four subtypes (latent classes) of patients with binge eating disorder [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. For patients with high depression scores at baseline, interpersonal psychotherapy was significantly more effective than guided self-help CBT or behavioral weight loss therapy.

Interpersonal psychotherapy does not focus on weight loss and does not produce significant weight loss in most individuals, but it appears that the subsequent weight course in individuals who stop binge eating is more normal compared with the weight course seen in individuals who continue to binge eat.</p><p>Interpersonal psychotherapy has primarily been studied in a group format.

These episodes are accompanied by a sense of disinhibition and lack of control over eating. Binge eating episodes occur, on average, at least one day per week for three months. (See <a class="local">'Definition of binge eating disorder'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2093.html" rel="external">"Eating disorders: Overview of epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation </strong>–<strong> </strong>Assessment of the patient with binge eating disorder should include the patient’s psychiatric status (attitude toward body weight and shape and comorbid psychiatric disorders), medical status (focusing on overweight- and obesity-related comorbidities when appropriate), and nutritional status (lifetime weight and dieting history, current eating pattern, and types of overeating). (See <a class="local">'Evaluation'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5372.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Prevalence, screening, and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treating binge eating disorder</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Standard treatment</strong> – For patients with binge eating disorder, we suggest psychotherapy rather than behavioral weight loss therapy or pharmacotherapy (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a class="local">'Treatment planning'</a> above and <a class="local">'Psychotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Psychotherapies that have demonstrated efficacy for treating binge eating disorder include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy, and dialectical behavior therapy. For patients with binge eating disorder, we suggest CBT rather than other psychotherapies (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). CBT has been studied more often and also has the advantage of being adapted for use in self-help formats. However, interpersonal psychotherapy is a reasonable alternative. (See <a class="local">'Psychotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Alternative treatment for patients with overweight or obesity</strong> – For patients with binge eating disorder who are overweight or obese and do not have access to psychotherapy, decline it, or do not respond to it, we suggest behavioral weight loss therapy rather than other treatments (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). However, pharmacotherapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor is a reasonable alternative, as is the use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10006" href="/d/drug information/10006.html" rel="external">topiramate</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9862" href="/d/drug information/9862.html" rel="external">zonisamide</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10143" href="/d/drug information/10143.html" rel="external">lisdexamfetamine</a> for patients who have marked weight problems. (See <a class="local">'Behavioral weight loss therapy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Treating incomplete response to standard treatment</strong> – Some patients treated with CBT may achieve only a partial response. When augmentation is desired, we suggest adding a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor rather than other drugs (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Combining CBT and pharmacotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treating obesity in patients with binge eating disorder</strong> – For patients with binge eating disorder who are overweight or obese and primarily interested in losing weight, we suggest behavioral weight loss therapy rather than psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). Psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy may be offered to address persistent episodes of binge eating.
