The number of international divers is even more difficult to estimate, but SCUBA remains popular worldwide and is a significant aspect of the tourism industry in many countries. Based on data from training and certification agencies, there are approximately 200,000 diving instructors globally [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Diving is generally considered a safe activity. In 2018, the Divers Alert Network reported an average fatality rate of 1.8 per 100,000 divers per year [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Although fatality rates are low, a variety of diving-related injuries and illnesses may occur, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Barotrauma, including arterial gas embolism (AGE)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decompression sickness (DCS)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nitrogen narcosis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Immersion pulmonary edema</p><p></p><p>The pathophysiology, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of complications of compressed gas diving are reviewed here. The imaging and management of pneumothorax, ear barotrauma, and air embolism are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6691.html" rel="external">"Treatment of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6845.html" rel="external">"Ear barotrauma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8263.html" rel="external">"Air embolism"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1201130491"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The terms decompression sickness (DCS) and decompression illness (DCI) are often used interchangeably, but this is not correct [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. DCS refers to the pathophysiologic condition that occurs when bubbles form in the tissues due to supersaturation with an inert gas. This process is distinct from arterial gas embolism (AGE), which stems from pulmonary overinflation and barotrauma. DCI is often used to encompass both conditions.</p><p>In this topic, we refer to DCS and AGE separately when discussing the distinct pathophysiology and presentation of each disease. We use the collective term DCI only when it is relevant clinically, such as when discussing treatment, which is the same for both conditions. (See <a class="local">'Management of arterial gas embolism and decompression sickness'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1940068"><span class="h1">GAS LAWS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The majority of diving-related medical conditions are related to the behavior of gases under varying pressures, which is governed by two basic gas laws:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Boyle's law</strong> states that at a constant temperature, the volume of a gas varies inversely with the ambient pressure. In other words, the volume of a gas decreases as pressure increases and increases as pressure decreases. This law helps to explain the principles behind diving-related barotrauma and air embolism.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Henry's law</strong> states that at a constant temperature, the amount of a gas that is dissolved in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas. This law helps to explain decompression sickness (DCS).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">BAROTRAUMA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Barotrauma is the most common form of diving-related injury and develops when an air-filled body space fails to equilibrate its pressure with the environment following changes in ambient pressure. Barotrauma can occur due to under-pressurization (during descent) or over-pressurization (during ascent), with the latter generally causing more severe sequelae. During descent, decreasing air volume in a space that also contains tissue leads to mucosal edema, vascular engorgement, and hemorrhage. During ascent, increasing gas volume in a confined space can produce tissue disruption and rupture. Gas-filled spaces potentially affected by barotrauma include sinuses, middle ear, lungs, and any artificial spaces created by equipment, such as a tight wetsuit seal or drysuit.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Pulmonary barotrauma</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3239494825"><span class="h3">Arterial gas embolism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Arterial gas embolism (AGE) is the most serious potential complication of pulmonary barotrauma. It occurs when air bubbles enter the pulmonary vasculature. This can occur when numerous venous bubbles overwhelm pulmonary capillary filtration or when gas that has ruptured from alveoli dissects into the vessels [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8263.html" rel="external">"Air embolism"</a>.)</p><p>After reaching the systemic arterial circulation, gas emboli typically break up as they reach vascular branch points and ultimately lodge in vessels with diameters ranging from 30 to 60 micrometers. At such locations, they produce distal ischemia and local activation of inflammatory cascades [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The symptoms and signs produced depend upon the final location of gas emboli. Life-threatening consequences can occur with embolization to the cerebral and coronary arteries. Cerebral manifestations are most common. The treatment of AGE, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy, is reviewed below. (See <a class="local">'Management of arterial gas embolism and decompression sickness'</a> below.)</p><p>The presentation of AGE varies widely, with signs ranging from subtle neurologic changes to cardiac arrest. Manifestations of cerebral emboli range from focal motor, sensory, or visual deficits to seizures, loss of consciousness, apnea, and death. Findings can be extremely subtle, such as discrete alterations in a mini mental status examination, "feeling off," or mild cognitive impairment [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>Rarely, divers may present in cardiac arrest. Initially, this was thought to be due to coronary artery gas embolism. However, although coronary AGE may cause electrocardiographic (ECG) changes or arrhythmia, it is an unlikely cause of sudden cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest is more likely to be caused by obstruction of the central circulation by air emboli [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p>AGE can affect other organ systems. Embolization to the hepatobiliary system has been reported, as have elevations in liver function tests and creatine kinase [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Embolization to the kidneys can produce hematuria, proteinuria, and renal failure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3826829420"><span class="h3">Barotrauma of descent</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As a diver descends, the air in the lungs becomes compressed. Although pulmonary edema and hemorrhage may occur when lung volume decreases below residual volume, such injury (sometimes referred to as "lung squeeze") is uncommon because the lungs are continually re-inflated during normal inhalation. It occurs more often in breath-hold divers [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. When pulmonary edema does occur in divers, it is more often caused by immersion pulmonary edema. (See <a class="local">'Breath-hold or free diving'</a> below and <a class="local">'Immersion pulmonary edema'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3590333967"><span class="h3">Barotrauma of ascent</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As a diver ascends and transalveolar pressure exceeds 20 to 80 mmHg, alveolar rupture can occur [<a href="#rid14">14-16</a>]. This can happen in depths as shallow as 1 to 1.5 meters [<a href="#rid5">5,8</a>]. Divers who hold their breath as they ascend (because they run out of air or panic) are at increased risk. Although some had hypothesized that obstructive lung disease (eg, asthma) increases the risk of such episodes, the risk has not been quantified and may not be as significant as previously suggested [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Such injuries may occur in divers without underlying pulmonary pathology or a history of rapid ascent.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">Pneumomediastinum</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Following alveolar rupture, gas can dissect along the perivascular sheath into the mediastinum to produce pneumomediastinum. Symptoms of pneumomediastinum include a sensation of fullness in the chest, pleuritic chest pain that may radiate to the shoulders, dyspnea, coughing, hoarseness, and dysphagia. Crepitation in the neck due to associated subcutaneous emphysema may be present, and a crunching sound heard over the heart during systole (Hamman's sign/Hamman's crunch) may be appreciated upon auscultation (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef127478" href="/d/graphic/127478.html" rel="external">movie 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67176" href="/d/graphic/67176.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The diagnosis can be confirmed on the basis of chest and neck radiographs, though computed tomography (CT) is more sensitive. Typically, a radiolucent band is seen along the cardiac border on the posteroanterior film and retrosternally on the lateral view (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69215" href="/d/graphic/69215.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). No specific treatment is required, but we suggest having patients breathe 100% oxygen to hasten resorption of extra-alveolar gas. There are rare (and severe) cases where hyperbaric oxygen has been used, but this is not routinely necessary [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>A careful history and neurologic examination should be performed to rule out concomitant AGE that would require hyperbaric oxygen treatment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Pneumothorax</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pneumothorax is relatively uncommon, developing in about 10 percent of episodes of pulmonary barotrauma. Patients with a history of spontaneous pneumothorax, bullae, or cystic lung disease may be at increased risk of pneumothorax [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. A history of spontaneous pneumothorax is a contraindication to SCUBA diving.</p><p>Pneumothorax develops when gas ruptures from the lung parenchyma into the pleural space. If this occurs at a significant depth, the pleural gas expands as the diver ascends (as described by Boyle's law) and can result in a tension pneumothorax. Manifestations can include dyspnea, chest pain, tachycardia, hypotension, cyanosis, distended neck veins, tracheal deviation, hyperresonance to percussion, unilateral decrease in breath sounds, and accompanying subcutaneous emphysema (approximately 25 percent of cases).</p><p>If a pneumothorax results in severe hypoxemia or hemodynamic compromise (tension pneumothorax), immediate pleural decompression is required. This is usually accomplished by inserting a large-bore needle into the second intercostal space just over the third rib in the mid-clavicular line of the affected hemithorax, followed by tube thoracostomy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6691.html" rel="external">"Treatment of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7816.html" rel="external">"Thoracostomy tubes and catheters: Indications and tube selection in adults and children"</a>.)</p><p>As with pneumomediastinum, a careful history and neurologic examination should be done to rule out concomitant AGE that would require hyperbaric oxygen treatment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Ear barotrauma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Involvement of the middle ear during descent ("ear squeeze") is the most common disorder among divers [<a href="#rid20">20-23</a>]. Pressure in the middle ear normally equilibrates with ambient pressure via the eustachian tube. However, if upon descent this equilibration is prevented by mucosal edema secondary to an upper respiratory infection or anatomic variation [<a href="#rid24">24</a>], the negative pressure in the middle ear can lead to its filling with serous fluid or blood or to inward rupture of the tympanic membrane [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Equilibration may also be impeded when an artificial air space is created by external material, such as cerumen impaction, ear plugs, or a tight-fitting hood. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6845.html" rel="external">"Ear barotrauma"</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms vary from a sensation of pressure to hearing loss and pain, which may suddenly be relieved with rupture of the tympanic membrane. Acute unilateral tympanic membrane rupture can also produce vertigo, nausea, and disorientation due to leakage of cold water into the middle ear and uneven caloric stimulation. Over-pressurization of the middle ear can occur during ascent (often termed "reverse squeeze"), but tympanic membrane rupture is rare.</p><p>Divers should attempt to prevent ear barotrauma by the use of maneuvers that open the eustachian tubes and equalize pressure between the middle ear and the ambient environment (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61166" href="/d/graphic/61166.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Treatment of middle ear barotrauma consists of topical and systemic decongestants, analgesics, and antihistamines. Antibiotics should be used if purulent otorrhea is observed [<a href="#rid26">26</a>] or if there is perforation of the tympanic membrane. Most tympanic membrane ruptures heal spontaneously if normal eustachian tube function is restored and infection is controlled. Patients should follow up with an otolaryngologist specialist. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6872.html" rel="external">"Acute otitis media in adults", section on 'Treatment of acute otitis media'</a>.)</p><p>Inner ear barotrauma is a fairly uncommon injury but should be excluded in all cases of middle ear barotrauma [<a href="#rid22">22,27</a>]. Inner ear injury can occur following the development of a sudden pressure differential between the inner and middle ear, leading to rupture of the round or oval window [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. The main symptoms are tinnitus, vertigo, and hearing loss, which in turn can cause disorientation and panic. The resulting labyrinthine fistula and leakage of perilymph can result in permanent inner ear damage. It can be difficult to distinguish from decompression sickness (DCS).</p><p>Long-term follow-up of a small cohort of divers who experienced inner ear barotrauma and inner ear DCS treated with hyperbaric recompression noted that persistent vestibular deficits were common (though often asymptomatic) in this population [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. The primary treatment of this complication is complete bed rest for 7 to 10 days with the head elevated to avoid increases in cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which can increase the leakage of perilymph [<a href="#rid29">29,31,32</a>]. Deteriorating inner ear function generally requires tympanotomy and patching of the round or oval window [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. If an inner ear injury is suspected, we recommend urgent referral to a head and neck surgeon for evaluation and definitive treatment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Sinus barotrauma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Sinus barotrauma is the second most common disorder among divers following ear barotrauma. During descent, increases in ambient environmental pressure can lead to mucosal engorgement, edema, and inflammation producing blockage of the sinus ostia; the frontal sinus is most commonly affected due to the relatively long and tortuous course of its duct [<a href="#rid33">33,34</a>]. Common symptoms include headache, epistaxis, and localized sinus pain. Treatment includes the use of topical and systemic decongestants and antibiotics if purulent nasal discharge is seen.</p><p>If a one-way valve blockage occurs at a sinus ostium, a sudden decrease in ambient pressure during ascent may lead to a pressure difference sufficient to rupture the sinus and produce pneumocephalus. The treatment in such cases is admission for careful observation, including frequent neurologic examinations, and prophylactic antibiotics against meningitis [<a href="#rid35">35,36</a>]. Normobaric oxygen (typically via nasal cannula) may hasten reabsorption of the air [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Antibiotic coverage should be directed at nasopharyngeal flora and traditionally has included agents in the penicillin or cephalosporin classes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Dental barotrauma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>During ascent or descent, the volume of air in spaces at the roots of infected teeth or adjacent to fillings can change rapidly, leading to toothache or breakdown of the tooth [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Dental barotrauma is a common complication, reported in 66 of 709 (9 percent) experienced divers in one series [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Over-the-counter pain medication (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a>) is generally sufficient for initial treatment, but follow-up with a dentist is recommended, and diving should be avoided until the underlying problem has been addressed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h1">DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pathophysiology, symptoms, and signs of decompression sickness (DCS) are summarized in the table (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139053" href="/d/graphic/139053.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) and discussed below; treatment, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy, is reviewed below. (See <a class="local">'Management of arterial gas embolism and decompression sickness'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H917833156"><span class="h2">Pathophysiology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As a diver descends and breathes gas (often air) under increased pressure, the tissues become saturated with dissolved nitrogen as predicted by Henry's law. As the diver returns to the surface, the sum of the gas tensions in the tissue may exceed the ambient pressure and lead to the liberation of free gas from the tissues in the form of bubbles; the location of bubble formation depends somewhat upon tissue characteristics. The liberated gas bubbles can alter organ function by blocking blood vessels, rupturing or compressing tissue, or causing endothelial damage and subsequently activating clotting and inflammatory cascades [<a href="#rid7">7,38</a>]. The volume and location of these bubbles determine whether and what symptoms occur [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. Gas bubbles are generally present in the venous circulation due to low pressure and high gas tension [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The presence of bubbles alone does not necessarily mean that DCS will develop.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Risk factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several factors can increase the risk of developing DCS.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Right-to-left shunt</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Right-to-left shunts (eg, pulmonary arteriovenous malformations) or congenital or acquired defects through which there may be transient right-to-left shunting (eg, patent foramen ovale [PFO], atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, and partially corrected Tetralogy of Fallot) increase the risk of paradoxical air emboli [<a href="#rid19">19,40,41</a>]. As an example, the presence of a PFO is associated with a two- to fivefold increase in the risk for developing severe DCS, although the overall incidence of this complication is low (4 to 6 per 10,000 dives) [<a href="#rid42">42-46</a>]. Among patients with a PFO, the risk is increased with larger PFO and increased atrial septal mobility [<a href="#rid44">44,45,47</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h3">Air travel and altitude</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who travel by air soon after SCUBA diving are at increased risk for developing DCS [<a href="#rid48">48,49</a>]. Therefore, many experts suggest a waiting period before flying after diving, although research is limited and the optimal waiting period is not known. We concur and believe that a passenger should be advised to wait 12 hours before flying if they have been making only one dive per day. Individuals who have participated in multiple dives, or those requiring decompression stops, should consider waiting up to 48 hours before flying [<a href="#rid50">50,51</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2788.html" rel="external">"Assessment of adult patients for air travel"</a>.)</p><p>Travel to altitude (such as mountains, volcanoes, etc) by car or other vehicle after diving may also increase the risk of DCS, and comparable waiting periods should be observed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h3">Additional factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multiple risk factors for DCS have been proposed, including obesity, age, and sex, but there is no consensus about their significance.

DCS can manifest as a wide range of symptoms and signs (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139053" href="/d/graphic/139053.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), and it may affect multiple organ systems simultaneously. Symptoms may be static, wax and wane, or steadily worsen. Listed below are common symptoms and signs organized by organ system.</p><p>Although DCS has been categorized using several classification schemes, these are typically used for research purposes [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. When evaluating a patient, it is more useful to describe the specific symptoms and organ systems involved.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Musculoskeletal</strong> – Localized joint pain is the most common manifestation of DCS and is described as type I DCS [<a href="#rid8">8,52,54,55</a>]. Joints appear particularly vulnerable to the development of gas bubbles because local regions of negative pressure are created during the movement of lubricated articular surfaces. Symptoms are believed to result from bubbles in periarticular tissues, which impair blood flow and stretch noncompliant tissues. Pain is described as deep and throbbing and is generally not aggravated or alleviated by palpation or movement. The elbow and shoulder are affected three times more often than the knee and hip.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neurologic</strong> – Approximately 60 percent of divers with DCS have signs and symptoms of nervous system involvement. The great majority of cases involve damage to the spinal cord, usually the upper lumbar or lower thoracic regions. Paresthesias and weakness may progress to paraplegia, and loss of sphincter control (particularly of the bladder) may occur [<a href="#rid56">56</a>]. "Girdle" or back pain and urinary retention may be early signs of neurologic DCS. Paresthesias or numbness often occur in a non-dermatomal distribution and may not localize to a spinal cord "level."</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Cerebral manifestations can occur and may include memory loss, ataxia ("the staggers"), visual disturbances, and changes in personality, speech, or affect [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. Most of these manifestations are believed to be caused by formation and coalescence of gas bubbles within low-pressure venous plexi and consequent venous obstruction. However, microvascular arterial embolization or bubble formation within nervous tissue may also play a role [<a href="#rid5">5,8,58,59</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cutaneous</strong> – The spectrum of possible cutaneous findings includes pruritus without skin changes, a scarlatiniform rash with pruritus often over the trunk and thighs, and a mottled, livedoid dermatitis commonly referred to as "cutis marmorata" (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef132375" href="/d/graphic/132375.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) [<a href="#rid60">60</a>]. This term continues to be used, although the rash is more correctly called livedo racemosa, which describes an irregular, broken rash caused by thrombotic and embolic phenomena [<a href="#rid60">60</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Livedo racemosa (cutis marmorata) is often centrally distributed and commonly associated with more severe cases of DCS. A case series of divers with livedo racemosa reported bubbles in the underlying arterioles and venules of the skin detectable with ultrasound.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A few observational studies have reported right-to-left shunts (eg, PFO) in patients with cutaneous DCS [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lymphatic</strong> – Lymphatic obstruction by bubbles, although rare, can lead to pain, lymphadenopathy, and localized edema, usually with follicular depressions and a peau d'orange effect [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. These lesions are mainly seen on the chest and torso. Isolated lymphatic DCS is generally considered mild and self-limited, although it may not respond immediately to hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and swelling may persist after initial treatment [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cardiopulmonary</strong> – Rarely, DCS presents with cardiopulmonary symptoms and signs, usually in the context of significant decompression stress from extreme depth, prolonged diving time, or a combination. Gas bubbles may occlude portions of the cardiopulmonary circulation and produce dry cough, chest pain, wheezing, dyspnea, and pharyngeal irritation ("the chokes"). Obstruction of right ventricular outflow can cause acute right-sided cardiac failure ("air lock") and circulatory collapse, and death may ensue. Gas bubbles may traverse the pulmonary capillary bed or a PFO to produce arterial gas embolism (AGE) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8263.html" rel="external">"Air embolism"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inner ear </strong>– Inner ear DCS may manifest with vertigo, nausea, vomiting, ataxia, deafness, or tinnitus. It can occur in isolation or in combination with other symptoms. Although commonly associated with deep or mixed-gas diving, it can occur after recreational dives.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The presentation of inner ear DCS may be similar and difficult to distinguish from inner ear barotrauma, such as a perilymph fistula [<a href="#rid63">63</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Ear barotrauma'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Constitutional symptoms </strong>– In isolation (ie, when not associated with any focal symptoms or signs), constitutional symptoms such as malaise, fatigue, and headache are due to general decompression stress and not of clinical significance [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1746916820"><span class="h1">OTHER COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2297402149"><span class="h2">Nitrogen narcosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Nitrogen narcosis is caused by the raised partial pressure of nitrogen in nervous system tissue and usually occurs at depths greater than 30 meters (100 feet). It has been called "rapture of the depths" because it induces symptoms and signs similar to alcohol or benzodiazepine intoxication, such as impairment of intellectual and neuromuscular performance and changes in behavior and personality. Hallucinations and loss of consciousness can occur at depths greater than 90 meters (300 feet).</p><p>A diver's susceptibility to nitrogen narcosis is increased by other factors that have intoxicating effects on the central nervous system, such as hypercarbia, fatigue, alcohol use, and hypothermia (core temperature below 35°C) induced by cold water. Divers recover rapidly upon ascent to a shallower depth. The main danger stems from impaired judgment, which can lead to other serious accidents (drowning, omission of decompression, rapid ascents, etc). If a diver remains persistently altered or confused after returning to the surface, alternative diagnoses should be sought.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2009392367"><span class="h2">Immersion pulmonary edema</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Immersion pulmonary edema is a form of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. The mechanism is not well understood but presumably stems from failure of pulmonary capillaries under stress caused by central redistribution of blood and the resulting increased pulmonary vascular pressures. The condition commonly occurs in young, healthy athletes (often swimmers or triathletes) in whom there is likely a genetic predisposition, as recurrence is common. The condition may also occur in older divers with underlying cardiopulmonary risk factors, such as hypertension, ischemic coronary disease, or cardiomyopathy.</p><p>The presentation of immersion pulmonary edema is similar to other forms of pulmonary edema and includes dyspnea, hypoxia, crackles, and possibly hemoptysis [<a href="#rid64">64-66</a>]. Symptoms generally start at depth (while diver is immersed) or at least while swimming (as it occurs in triathletes). Immersion pulmonary edema is not a form of decompression sickness (DCS) or gas embolism, but it can cause a diver to ascend rapidly or to omit decompression stops, and thus, it may contribute to DCS or acute gas embolism. Therapies used to treat other forms of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema should be used for the immersion form [<a href="#rid64">64</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3456.html" rel="external">"Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema", section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2443719867"><span class="h1">EVALUATION OF THE SICK DIVER</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evaluation of the sick diver should include a careful history, including a diving profile, assessment of symptoms associated with arterial gas embolism (AGE) and decompression sickness (DCS), and a focused examination including signs associated with AGE and DCS (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139053" href="/d/graphic/139053.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139054" href="/d/graphic/139054.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Such signs can range from the subtle (eg, errors in mini-mental status assessment) to the severe and life threatening (eg, seizure).</p><p>The risk of developing DCS depends upon exposure to high partial pressures of nitrogen. Thus, the likelihood of DCS increases with the time and depth of the dive. DCS is exceedingly unlikely among those diving to 10 meters or less. Although dive tables and computer models are available to minimize risk, following these tables does not eliminate such risk, and DCS can still occur.</p><p>AGE develops independently of the time of gas exposure and can occur during dives limited to shallow water [<a href="#rid8">8,67</a>].

However, they may use other gas mixtures such as "Nitrox," which has a higher percentage of oxygen than air, to decrease the risk of DCS. Technical divers may use multiple breathing gases that they change during the dive depending on depth to mitigate other risks, such as oxygen toxicity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptoms</strong> – Did the patient experience any symptoms during the dive (eg, any discomfort, breathing problems, difficulty clearing ears), and when exactly during the dive did they occur (eg, during descent, at depth, during ascent, post dive)?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Events</strong> – During the dive, did any unusual events occur, such as running out of air or an equipment malfunction?

Such violations suggest the diver has had significant decompression stress and is at higher risk for DCS.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If a computer profile is available (from the diver or their partner), record the information, which will assist hyperbaric medicine consultants.

(See <a class="local">'Additional resources'</a> below and <a class="local">'Hyperbaric oxygen therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>While not exhaustive, the presentations below are relatively common among divers and may stem from diving illness or diseases that can mimic diving illness:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chest pain or shortness of breath</strong> – All divers who complain of shortness of breath or chest discomfort need a thorough evaluation, including a chest radiograph and electrocardiogram (ECG). The history is important when evaluating such complaints. Key components of the history include the timing of symptoms and dive profile, particularly any history of rapid ascent. Symptoms that begin at depth (ie, during the dive) are unlikely to be due to DCS or AGE and suggest an alternative diagnosis such as ACS, pulmonary embolism, or immersion pulmonary edema. Symptoms that begin just after surfacing suggest barotrauma or DCS; however, they may be caused by pulmonary embolism or ACS.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Severe cases of decompression illness (particularly gas embolism) can cause ECG abnormalities and elevations in cardiac biomarkers.

Recompression therapy should begin as soon as possible once the need is recognized, but delays do not preclude treatment. There are many documented cases of marked improvement with delayed therapy [<a href="#rid76">76-78</a>], and there is no universally accepted period of delayed presentation for which treatment is considered futile [<a href="#rid79">79</a>]. Resources are available to help identify the closest hyperbaric treatment facility. (See <a class="local">'Additional resources'</a> below.)</p><p>The exact protocol, duration, and number of hyperbaric oxygen treatments is determined by the hyperbaric physician and can be modified based on the patient's response to therapy. Minor cases may resolve with a single treatment, while severe cases may require a series of treatments [<a href="#rid79">79</a>].</p><p>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is generally considered safe and low risk. The most common side effect is middle ear barotrauma, which occurs in approximately 2 percent of patients. The injury generally resolves with rest and time, and symptoms may be treated with decongestants. For emergency hyperbaric treatments when patients are unable to equilibrate pressures in their eustachian tubes, emergency myringotomies or tympanostomy tubes may be required.</p><p>Oxygen toxicity affecting the central nervous system may occur, with seizures being the most serious manifestation. The estimated incidence is between 1 in 5000 and 1 in 10,000 treatments. Seizures resolve after oxygen is removed and are not a permanent condition. Other, more rare side effects include transient worsening of myopia, pulmonary oxygen toxicity, and pulmonary barotrauma. Although it has not been extensively studied, no significant long-term side effects from hyperbaric oxygen treatment have been reported.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2087251353"><span class="h3">Mechanism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The administration of pure oxygen displaces inert gases (primarily nitrogen) from the lungs and increases the oxygen and nitrogen gradients between the lungs and other tissues. This increased gradient enhances the removal of nitrogen from the tissues. A gradient is created by the administration of surface oxygen (ie, at 1 atmosphere) but is increased substantially in the hyperbaric chamber under higher pressures [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>An additional rationale for hyperbaric oxygen therapy includes the reduction of bubble size caused by higher pressures, oxygenation of ischemic tissue, reduced cerebral edema, and decreased inflammatory response (due to reduction in neutrophil adhesion to vasculature endothelium [<a href="#rid79">79</a>]).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4047311737"><span class="h3">Prognosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prognosis for DCS is generally good. Some studies report that 80 percent of patients had complete resolution of their symptoms [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. At least one study of spinal cord decompression reported that divers presenting with more severe initial signs had higher likelihood of residual disease [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]. Patients with inner ear DCS have higher rates of residual symptoms [<a href="#rid80">80</a>]. The timing of recompression treatment and its effect on prognosis have not been clearly established, but it is generally accepted that early treatment is better, and recompression should be performed as soon as possible [<a href="#rid76">76</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3632807505"><span class="h1">COMPLICATIONS OF OTHER TYPES OF DIVING</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4290451189"><span class="h2">Closed-circuit rebreathers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Rebreather diving is a form of technical diving involving a closed-loop system that recycles breathing gas, removes carbon dioxide, and periodically injects oxygen as needed [<a href="#rid81">81</a>]. This system enables longer, deeper dives while breathing gases with less nitrogen. While rebreather divers are theoretically at lower risk for decompression sickness (DCS) and barotrauma, they are at increased risk of other conditions described here that are rare in open-circuit (SCUBA) diving.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypoxia</strong> – Due to the complex closed breathing circuit, divers may become hypoxic during a dive. Symptoms can range from nausea, euphoria, tunnel vision, paresthesias, and dizziness to loss of consciousness. They may begin insidiously but progress rapidly to incapacitation or unconsciousness before the diver can take corrective action.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hyperoxia (oxygen toxicity)</strong> – As it is common to breathe higher partial pressures of oxygen while on a rebreather (to minimize the risk of DCS), oxygen toxicity can ensue. Risk increases with depth, and toxicity is rare at depths less than six meters. The range of possible symptoms is broad. These may include nausea, limb twitching, auditory and visual disturbances, dizziness, and seizures. Less severe symptoms may progress rapidly to incapacitation and seizures.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypercarbia</strong> – With a closed-circuit system, carbon dioxide must be removed from the exhaled breath before it is re-inhaled. This is done using a "scrubber," similar to those in anesthesia circuits, that depends upon an exothermic reaction between the scrubber and the exhaled breath. Scrubbers can fail for several reasons, causing the diver to become hypercarbic. Symptoms of hypercarbia can include dyspnea, air hunger, dizziness, and headache. Symptoms similar to nitrogen narcosis may also develop, including impaired judgment and poor-decision making, loss of consciousness, and death.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>"Caustic cocktail"</strong> – While the scrubber requires some moisture to work effectively (present in exhaled breath), excessive liquid (eg, saltwater) can create a toxic slurry. If this happens, and the diver inadvertently inhales this mixture, it can be catastrophic. Potential injuries range from oropharyngeal burns to full-thickness liquefactive necrosis resulting in perforation of the trachea-bronchial system or the esophagus. Symptoms may include severe pain, laryngospasm, stridor, and dysphagia. Emergency airway management may be required.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3038385383"><span class="h2">Breath-hold or free diving</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pathophysiology of breath-hold or free diving is beyond the scope of this topic. However, clinicians should know that breath-hold divers can develop DCS (generally with repeated deep dives) and arterial gas embolism (AGE). In addition, they may suffer from a condition commonly referred to as "shallow water blackout," more correctly termed hypoxia of ascent, which involves losing consciousness just before reaching or at the water surface. Breath-hold divers are also more likely to suffer barotrauma of descent (lung squeeze) than scuba divers [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21"><span class="h1">DIVING WITH COEXISTING CONDITIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The physiologic changes engendered by diving are generally well tolerated, but a number of medical conditions can increase the potential for complications [<a href="#rid82">82</a>]. Diving has been successfully undertaken in the presence of a variety of medical conditions, but decisions about the safety of diving must be individualized in the context of the individual's overall health. The rate of mishaps during SCUBA dives among participants both with and without chronic medical conditions appears to decrease when pre-dive safety checklists are used [<a href="#rid83">83</a>]. Screening of patients with medical conditions who wish to dive is discussed separately.

If such consultation is not readily available, we recommend calling the Divers Alert Network, an international organization, for telephone consultation and information regarding the nearest hyperbaric chambers (Divers Alert Network emergency hotline: +1 United States country code (919) 684-9111).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1940060"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sickness while SCUBA diving</strong> – Decompression sickness (DCS) and barotrauma (including arterial gas embolism [AGE]) are specific to diving, but injuries such as immersion pulmonary edema, hypothermia, trauma, and submersion-related injuries can occur while diving.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Barotrauma</strong> – Barotrauma is the most common form of diving-related injury and develops when an air-filled body space fails to equilibrate its pressure with the environment. Barotrauma can cause lung injury (including pneumothorax), ear or sinus injury, or AGE. AGE can manifest a wide range of symptoms and signs depending on its extent and the arteries affected. AGE develops independently of the time of gas exposure and can occur during dives limited to shallow water. AGE that compromises cerebral, coronary, or pulmonary vasculature can be life threatening. (See <a class="local">'Barotrauma'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>DCS</strong> – DCS occurs when a diver returns to the surface and gas tensions in the tissue exceed the ambient pressure, causing free gas to leave tissues in the form of bubbles. These gas bubbles can impair organ function by blocking blood vessels, compressing or rupturing tissue, or activating clotting and inflammatory cascades. DCS is highly unlikely with dives ≤10 meters. Symptoms usually manifest upon surfacing and can affect a wide range of organ systems (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139053" href="/d/graphic/139053.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Possible findings are myriad and can include joint pain (elbow and shoulder are common), signs of spinal cord injury, signs of brain injury, characteristic rashes, localized edema, vertigo, ataxia, tinnitus, and (less frequently) compromised cardiac function. (See <a class="local">'Decompression sickness'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation of the sick diver</strong> – Essential aspects of evaluation are the history, including the diving profile, and the physical examination, including assessment of symptoms and signs associated with AGE and DCS (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139053" href="/d/graphic/139053.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139054" href="/d/graphic/139054.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). The timing of symptom onset is critical to diagnosis. Symptoms caused by AGE typically manifest within 10 minutes of surfacing (and often immediately). Symptoms that begin during descent or at depth are generally <strong>not</strong> due to AGE or DCS. They may be caused by barotrauma of descent, immersion pulmonary edema, or unrelated medical problems (eg, myocardial ischemia, stroke).
