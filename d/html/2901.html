         Genetic testing can uncover a diagnosis that allows tailored interventions to prevent or treat disease or disease complications. Appropriate use of genetic testing, including understanding the limitations and challenges of available testing approaches, is crucial to the successful use of genetic testing in improving health and quality of life.

         The genotype can be defined as the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) blueprint that is associated with the clinical manifestations of a trait, phenotype, or disease. This and other commonly used terms in genetic testing are summarized in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72267" href="/z/d/graphic/72267.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         ). An extensive glossary of genetic terms is provided separately. (See

         Genetic testing can refer to any type of testing that helps determine an individual's genotype. It can be determined for the germline (cells arising from the germ cells and applicable to the vast majority of cells in the body) or for selected somatic cells such as tumor cells.
        </p>
        <p>
         The term "genotyping" is used differently in two different contexts:

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The terminology used to describe the results of clinical genetic testing is shifting, based on guidance from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) published in 2015 [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. This guidance seeks to avoid nonspecific, pejorative, or confusing terms such as mutation or polymorphism, which refer to genetic variation but do not specify whether the variation is associated with disease. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2898.html" rel="external">
          "Genetics: Glossary of terms", section on 'Polymorphism'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The ACMG guidance uses the term "variant," which refers to variation from a reference sequence; for clinical testing, variants are classified into one of five categories of pathogenicity [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         Generally, variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic are considered appropriate for incorporating into clinical care. In this document, the term pathogenic will be used to refer to both pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants. These designations indicate the degree of confidence that a variant is associated with the disease phenotype, but they do not specify the likelihood of developing disease. Disease likelihood depends on the presence of specific genetic variants as well as other factors such as the inheritance pattern (recessive or dominant), penetrance and expressivity, the individual's age, and other contributory genetic and environmental factors. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Likelihood of disease'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The assignment of a variant to a category of pathogenicity is based on available data that include family studies (testing of additional first-degree relatives, such as parents, can determine if the variant segregates with the disease), epidemiologic data, and laboratory testing that can involve functional studies that demonstrate altered protein function in cells or animals [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Additional discussion of these categories and the criteria used to assign them is presented separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/96539.html" rel="external">
          "Secondary findings from genetic testing", section on 'Definitions and classification of variants'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The term "mutation" is still sometimes used in several circumstances such as when discussing certain known mutations, disease pathogenesis, and laboratory techniques. However, use of this term in a clinical setting should be avoided whenever possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been used to refer to single base pair substitutions that are present in a large portion of the typical, or healthy, population. The frequency of SNPs has traditionally been defined as &gt;1 percent. However, this term can be vague when used in reference to genetic testing. SNP is also sometimes used to refer to a type of panel testing that can evaluate the presence of a subset of nucleotide changes (as in "SNP array"). (See

         The extent of genetic testing can range from analyzing a single variant (such as the variant for factor V Leiden) to the entire genome. The appropriate test depends on the indication or presenting feature(s), the tests available for the suspected condition(s), and the available information regarding the genetic cause(s) of the condition or presenting features.

         For every gene, it is possible to evaluate selected variants (certain nucleotide substitutions or other changes) or the entire gene (every coding nucleotide and the nucleotides near the splice sites in the coding region of the gene). The approach used depends on the purpose of the testing and the current state of knowledge about the variants that can cause disease in that gene.

         Some gene panels that are bundled as direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests include variants that have been associated with common, complex diseases such as type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disease, and metabolic traits. Due to the inherent genetic complexities of these disorders, the effects conferred by each variant alone are often relatively small (odds ratios of &lt;1.5 for risk variants) and can be inconsistent across different ethnic populations. Therefore, the predictive accuracy of these tests is highly variable, and most of the panels have not been comprehensively validated. (See

          Entire gene
         </strong>
         – For many genetic disorders, the disease gene is very sensitive to variation at many locations, with large numbers of pathogenic variants known to cause disease. Examples include the breast and ovarian cancer genes,
         <em>
          BRCA1
         </em>
         and
         <em>
          BRCA2
         </em>
         , and the cystic fibrosis gene,
         <em>
          CFTR.
         </em>
         There are different approaches to testing in these cases.

         <strong>
          Single-nucleotide genotyping panels
         </strong>
         – When the majority of cases of a disease are caused by a limited number of variants, one approach is to genotype for the most common pathogenic variants first, followed by reflex to more comprehensive testing of all potential variants (using sequencing) if the initial testing is negative but concern for the disease remains high. This practice is used frequently for screening in cystic fibrosis, where a panel of 25 variants in the
         <em>
          CFTR
         </em>
         gene will correctly classify more than 90 percent of patients of European ancestry. This approach is less expensive, and the turnaround time is typically faster than more comprehensive approaches. However, additional testing should be considered in patients of non-European ancestry, as rarer, ancestry-specific variants may not be well represented on these panels.

         <strong>
          Sequencing
         </strong>
         – The more comprehensive approach of sequencing consists of evaluating all nucleotides across the gene to identify all possible pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. The two main advantages of sequencing are that all positions in the gene are tested and that rare variants that would not be included on genotyping panels can be identified. Examples in which initial gene sequencing is useful include the
         <em>
          F9
         </em>
         gene associated with hemophilia B. Sequencing can be limited to one gene, to a set of genes implicated in a group of related disorders (so-called "gene sequencing panels"). Massively parallel sequencing can also be performed for extended, genome-wide testing. This type of genomic testing can be limited to the coding regions of all genes, called whole exome sequencing (WES), or it can include coding and noncoding regions, termed whole genome sequencing (WGS).

          Copy number variation
         </strong>
         – In addition to screening for single base-pair changes, detection of deletions or duplications of exons or entire genes is often necessary as part of clinical testing. This is particularly important for genes where duplications or deletions are frequently observed (for example,
         <em>
          PMP22
         </em>
         in Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies). Copy number variants (CNVs) are also referred to as deletion/duplications (del/dups) and can be of varying sizes. CNV testing is often included as part of the standard evaluation of genes by many clinical laboratories in gene panels, and CNV analysis can also be performed on exome sequencing data. CNVs can be identified using microarray technologies that rely on hybridization of patient and control DNA to probes on the array. (See

         – Some disorders, such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21), are associated with chromosome aneuploidy. Segmental chromosomal gains or losses, also resulting from CNVs, unbalanced chromosome translocations, or other structural cytogenetic rearrangements, can also be associated with genetic conditions.

         – If the clinical presentation does not suggest a particular gene or group of genes, an individual may undergo sequencing of all of the known genes as part of WES or WGS. WES or WGS is now a standard tool for gene discovery studies where a large number of patients (or ideally, large kindreds) with similar disease manifestations are available for study. Their utility in the clinical setting, however, is largely dependent on the availability of practitioners with expertise in interpretation of such sequence data.

         Genetic counselors and/or clinical geneticists should consult with patients prior to WES or WGS to assist with both pre-test and post-test counseling. Given the frequency of disease-causing variants, WES and WGS will often result in the identification of variants of unknown significance (VUSs). Moreover, the unexpected finding of one or more pathogenic variants in genes that cause genetic disorders different from the condition being investigated (referred to as incidental or secondary findings) is not uncommon. Most studies find a prevalence of secondary findings of at least 1 percent. The return of such findings to unprepared patients can have deleterious consequences, including negative psychologic impacts, and there may be implications for obtaining life insurance and disability insurance. Genetic counselors and/or clinical geneticists can address these issues prior to testing and advise patients and providers accordingly. (See

         Microarrays for genetic testing consist of a glass surface (or other matrix) coated with paired sets of oligonucleotide probes (short DNA sequences) that code for a target reference sequence and for the alternate, disease-associated variants. An individual's DNA sample is hybridized to the DNA on the slide, and probes labeled with fluorescent dyes corresponding to the reference and alternate variants are used to detect the patient's DNA sample. This approach is also referred to as allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. (See

         Microarrays can be used to identify DNA changes of varying size, such as at the level of a single nucleotide, larger portions of one or more genes, or larger regions of one or more chromosomes (CNVs). Most microarrays are SNP microarrays used for CNV detection. Arrays used to identify SNPs are called SNP arrays, genotyping arrays, or genotyping panels. Genotyping panel can also be used to refer to sequencing a group of genes. (See

         Advantages of microarrays for detecting SNPs are the ability to evaluate a large number of variants (including variants involving multiple genes) in a single test. This testing can be more cost-effective than sequencing in some cases, especially when the specific variants being evaluated cause the majority of disease cases (eg, the common

         A disadvantage of microarray testing for detecting SNPs is that it can only identify changes for which probes have been created and placed on the array. As a result, this method may not detect certain rare, yet clinically important, variants. Additionally, the variants on the array may differ from panel to panel, although there is usually a fair amount of overlap for the best-characterized variants.

         Sequencing determines the identity of each nucleotide along a region of DNA. Sequencing can be performed using traditional methods (Sanger sequencing) or next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods. NGS uses massively parallel sequencing in a high-throughput format. As a result, it can generate a large amount of sequence data, or almost the entire exome or genome, orders of magnitude more rapidly than would be possible using traditional methods. In many cases, specific NGS results, such as an identified pathogenic variant in a gene, are confirmed by Sanger sequencing as quality control prior to the return of results to patients. NGS technology is discussed in more detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17039.html" rel="external">

         Advantages of NGS are the ability to provide information regarding numerous sequence variants and to query a broad group of genes. This is especially useful if the clinical picture does not provide enough information to identify a single gene or small group of genes likely to be responsible for the disease phenotype.

         Limitations of NGS include identification of many variants for which the significance is uncertain (VUS), as well as identification of unexpected pathogenic variants unrelated to the original reason for testing, referred to as secondary findings. Decisions regarding which findings to disclose to the patient are an area of active research; typically, only "medically actionable" secondary findings that are designated as pathogenic or likely pathogenic are disclosed to patients and families. Counseling individuals about these limitations prior to testing, and provision of an "opt-out" option if the individual prefers not to receive certain information, is an important component of informed consent for NGS.

         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/96539.html" rel="external">

         As NGS sequencing technology is increasingly adopted and costs decrease, the method is becoming more widely used in settings that previously used array technology, such as genotyping panels. The laboratory may continue to report only a subset of variants identified by sequencing, despite having additional information about other variants. This potentially avoids the concerns noted above about how to handle information regarding VUSs.
        </p>
        <p>
         In some cases, future research may allow additional interpretation of findings and greater predictive accuracy than was available at the time the testing was performed or than information gained from genotyping panels. This increases the potential promise of NGS but also increases the need for extensive data storage capacity and means for reinterpretation and recontacting the tested individual.
        </p>
        <p>
         With new data or reinterpretation of existing data, a VUS may be reclassified as pathogenic or benign at a future date. Many factors impact the rate of variant classifications. Research consortia and methodologic advances are accelerating the classification of variants in some genes. Analysis of a large dataset of hereditary cancer multigene panel testing found that 7 percent of VUS were reclassified, after finding that the variants were present in multiple individuals [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Ultimately, one-fourth of the tested population had a reclassified variant. The majority (90 percent) of VUS were downgraded to benign or likely benign.
        </p>
        <p>
         Laboratory policies have not been standardized for noting VUSs on reports, reclassifying variants, and notifying patients or ordering clinicians that a variant has been reclassified, and clinicians should be aware of the policies when ordering a test [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Many laboratories have protocols for systematically reviewing VUSs and providing amended reports to ordering providers. In situations in which a laboratory reports VUSs but does not provide reclassification information, the burden for tracking that variant can fall on the clinician.
        </p>
        <p>
         Laboratories that do not report VUSs may reduce the need to counsel and re-contact patients when classifications change. However, up to 10 percent of VUSs will be upgraded to actionable pathogenic variants, and if VUSs are not reported, those diagnoses will be missed [

         Cytogenetic testing and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are used to determine chromosomal changes at the level of larger regions of the genome such as an entire chromosome or chromosome segment, rather than a single gene. Examples include detection of aneuploidies (chromosome gains [trisomies] or losses); chromosomal translocations or inversions; and copy number variants (CNVs; gains or losses within a region of a chromosome).
        </p>
        <p>
         Typical uses for these methods include prenatal diagnosis of fetal aneuploidies and oncology testing (eg, classification of hematologic malignancies). As cytogenetic testing and FISH require many cells for analysis, and in the prenatal setting this requires invasive procedures such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, prenatal testing is moving towards the use of noninvasive methods that evaluate small fragments of circulating fetal DNA in the maternal blood.
        </p>

         Disease variants causing cancer can initially be identified from kindreds with high-disease penetrance. In many cases, subsequent studies in the general population reveal a lower penetrance rate for the same variant (ie, ascertainment bias for high penetrance from the high-risk families). This may be the case with certain cancer genes such as the breast cancer genes

         Testing can be performed at different times during a patient's life and for different purposes (diagnosing a disease, predicting disease risk, or determining carrier status). Testing to determine germline genotype (present at birth) can be performed on blood, saliva, or buccal (cheek) cells, all of which contain the individual's germline DNA. Testing on tissues such as tumors can be used to identify additional acquired genetic changes.

          Screening
         </strong>
         – Prenatal screening can be done using maternal blood to analyze fetal DNA (cell-free DNA [cfDNA]); this is increasingly being used to assess for chromosome aneuploidies and genetic conditions [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. This type of noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS) is primarily used for individuals at higher risk of carrying a fetus with a chromosomal abnormality or congenital anomaly, but several professional organizations recommend that doctors discuss all screening options, including NIPS, with all pregnant individuals [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8

         ]. NIPS has the advantage of limiting risks associated with invasive procedures [

          9

         ].There is a crucial difference between screening and diagnostic testing. Those who screen positive should be offered diagnostic testing (eg, by amniocentesis). (See

          Testing
         </strong>
         – Prenatal testing determines whether a variant is present in a fetus. Typically, this is used for genes that are inherited in Mendelian patterns (autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked) or for chromosomal abnormalities. Prenatal testing can also be performed to follow up an abnormal screen for fetal aneuploidy. Specimens for analysis traditionally have been obtained by chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis.

         Prenatal testing can provide reassurance or guide decisions regarding options as to whether to continue or terminate a pregnancy with an affected fetus. Prenatal testing for a condition such as Huntington disease, which is fully penetrant and has no specific or life-extending treatment, or for conditions that are lethal in childhood, carries different implications from testing for a condition that confers an increased risk of developing a disease for which preventive therapies are available, such as colon cancer.

         Genetic testing is incorporated into pediatric care when the findings will provide a diagnosis or affect timely management during childhood. Predictive testing for adult-onset conditions is not generally pursued until adulthood, when the individual can make their own decision regarding testing. However, due to the complex overlapping phenotypes of many pediatric genetic conditions, whole exome sequencing (WES) may be considered to be an efficient approach for making a diagnosis in childhood, particularly when the child's health status is critical [

         The clinical utility is the likelihood that a test will prompt an intervention to improve health; the clinical utility of a genetic test depends on the impact of the results on clinical care. As an example, while the genetic test for Huntington disease has high clinical validity (predictive value), the clinical utility is limited because of few treatment or intervention options available for those who test positive. However, family members at risk for this disease may choose to undergo genetic testing to make reproductive plans or for the psychologic benefit in relieving uncertainty and facilitating future planning [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. In other cases, the information from genetic testing raises more questions for the patient than it answers, sometimes at considerable expense and with the potential for harm (eg, from invasive diagnostic procedures).

        <p>
         Before initiating genetic testing, it is important to determine whether an alternative testing approach would be more useful, such as iron studies in an individual with suspected hereditary hemochromatosis or lipid panel in an individual with suspected familial hypercholesterolemia. These questions can be challenging to answer and may require consultation with a specialist in the specific disorder or with a genetic counselor or clinical geneticist.

         Genetic testing should be coordinated with appropriate genetic counseling to help patients understand the consent process and the implications of a positive or a negative result for themselves and their relatives. Patients should also be counseled about the possibility of receiving a result that they have a variant (or variants) of uncertain significance (VUS), if relevant. Targeting genetic counseling to the patient is vital to the successful use of genetic testing.

         Health care providers should consider the need for pretest genetic counseling services before offering genetic testing. These services may include obtaining family history including a three-generation family pedigree, discussing the objectives of testing, clarifying the limitations of testing, and outlining the myriad potential implications of test results, including secondary findings, VUS, and the potential implications of findings for other family members.

         For certain common disorders for which genetic testing is used, it may be impractical to involve a genetic counselor or clinical geneticist prior to testing. As an example, individuals with iron overload are frequently tested for a pathogenic variant in the
         <em>
          HFE
         </em>
         gene associated with hereditary hemochromatosis. Practitioners who will be confronted with such testing on an ongoing basis should become familiar with and routinely apply the principles of genetic counseling as they relate to the specific disorder.

         A number of ethical and psychosocial issues apply to genetic testing, including the consequences for the family, issues related to testing children who are unaffected, and concerns about genetic discrimination. Clinicians and patients must consider the benefits and risks of genetic testing, including the possibility of false-positive and false-negative results. Genetic information may have unique risks based upon the meaning attributed to the diagnosed disorder and the value of the information for family members [

         Because of the familial nature of genetics, the results of testing may impact the patient as well as other family members. The family dynamics and the family support system may determine how the results impact the tested individual and their family. Many genetics professionals use the family history intake to assess the family dynamics and to understand outside influences that impact the social support of the patient [

         The patient should be encouraged to inform family members of genetic risk that may affect their care. Genetic counselors and clinical geneticists include a discussion about information sharing when providing the test result, and they often provide the patient with a copy of the test result or a model letter for family members to use for this purpose. If a genetic counselor is not involved in the testing process, the provider who orders the test should assume that responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most patients are willing to provide consent for such disclosure or to readily disclose the information themselves [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,20
         </a>
         ]. For some, their express purpose for genetic testing is to make information available to family members.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the rare situation in which a patient refuses to voluntarily disclose information about a genetic risk to family members raises a conflict between two competing ethical obligations: the duty to protect patient privacy and autonomy versus the duty to disclose information for the purpose of preventing future harm. Sometimes, if the primary care provider is caring for multiple members of the same family, that person is in a position to further explore reasons for the refusal and potentially help the patient understand the impact of sharing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Legal opinions vary regarding the clinician's duty to warn at-risk family members about a familial genetic condition:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         There does not appear to be a legal obligation to inform family members in the United States, although legal opinions may vary [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Some genetics providers obtain consent for disclosure and family member contact information at the time of testing; others highly encourage the patient to share the information obtained from their genetic testing with family members.
        </p>
        <p>

         Despite numerous guidelines and policy papers, there is no clear consensus or set of legal guidelines available in most countries. As an example, in 2017, the high court in the United Kingdom ruled on appeal that health care practitioners may be liable for failing to disclose a patient's Huntington gene status, if affected, to offspring [
         <a href="#rid22">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Until clear legal obligations are defined, it is important to document conversations about disclosure, and in some cases, clinicians may wish to consult with medical geneticists, genetic counselors, or bioethicists in the event that patients do not provide consent to share information.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is also strongly advised that pretest counseling and consent discussions include informing the patient of the potential implications of genetic test results for other family members, and, if appropriate, these discussions should emphasize that in situations where others' lives are at risk, although maintenance of patient confidentiality is a paramount concern, the practitioner may deem that the risks to relatives of not disclosing results would outweigh any potential harm to the patient by disclosure.

         Genetic testing of children and adolescents raises additional caveats, especially in cases when establishing a genetic diagnosis would have no immediate impact on the child's clinical care or prognosis. In such situations, it is frequently recommended that testing be postponed until the child is old enough to decide if they themselves will consent to testing and would like to undergo the test, as discussed above. (See
         <a class="local">

        </p>
        <p>
         However, a broad sequencing approach with whole exome sequencing (WES) or whole genome sequencing (WGS) may identify numerous variants of potential future clinical significance that might manifest during adulthood but would be of no use to the patient during their youth, and the patient and relatives may be burdened rather than empowered by the information. This must be balanced by the greater diagnostic yield of broad sequencing approaches in some clinical situations.
        </p>
        <p>
         A position statement by the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) addressing the issue of testing children was published in 2015 [

         Parents or caregivers should be encouraged to defer their child's testing until adulthood so that the individual concerned can evaluate the risks and benefits of testing, unless there is a clinical intervention appropriate for childhood.

         When genetic testing is indicated and the diagnosis is apparent from clinical examination or other investigations, initial testing should be limited to targeted gene panels or single gene testing based on the clinical presentation, and WES or WGS generally should be reserved for patients for whom initial testing has been unrevealing or in whom a diagnosis or condition is not obvious. This approach reduces the possibility of identifying secondary (incidental) findings unrelated to the testing indication.

         Disclosure of unexpected family relationships, such as a finding of nonpaternity, has been publicized as an outcome of direct-to-consumer ancestry tests. (See

        <p>
         However, information about familial relationships cannot be determined by all clinical genetic tests. Testing of a single individual or family variant testing would not generally provide enough information to reveal an unexpected relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
         When clinical genetic analysis involves comprehensive testing of family members, such as testing parent-child trios to maximize interpretation of whole exome or whole genome sequencing results, it is possible to identify previously undisclosed or unknown relationships such as undisclosed adoption or misattributed paternity. Discussion of this possibility should be included as part of the consent process when this is possible based on the testing method and family members involved [

         Whenever possible, initial genetic testing should be performed on an affected individual. Once a disease variant has been identified, testing of first-degree relatives is technically straightforward, and they are usually tested for the specific variant. Cascade testing to the first-degree relatives of individuals who test positive can then be performed. Relatives who have inherited the variant may be candidates for enhanced screening or risk reduction strategies, while those who have not inherited the alteration can be spared unnecessary procedures. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Management and follow-up'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         This strategy can reduce the number of tests performed on unaffected individuals and simplifies interpretation, which in turn reduces cost and the possibility of identifying variants of uncertain significance.
        </p>
        <p>
         While it is possible to begin the genetic testing process in an unaffected individual, there is a greater chance that these results will be uninformative. As an example, if an unaffected person does not have a pathogenic variant in a particular gene, it may be impossible to know whether there is no identifiable familial variant or whether a familial variant is present in the kindred but not in the tested individual (a true negative).
        </p>
        <p>
         In some cases, however, the affected relatives may have died or may be unable or unwilling to be tested. Genetic counseling in these situations should evaluate the optimal testing approach, facilitate communication among relatives, and explain the limitations of genetic testing when it cannot be performed on an affected individual.

         Genetic evaluation can be performed in the context of a genetic counseling appointment with a genetic counselor or clinical geneticist, by a primary care provider, or by a disease specialist. What is most important is that individuals ordering genetic testing are able to determine the appropriate test and methodology, address the logistic issues of test ordering, prepare patients for psychosocial outcomes and implications for family members, interpret results, and incorporate test findings into management.

         The use of genetic testing has increased, and the increase in clinical indications for genetic testing has caused the number of patients needing this service to outpace the availability of genetic specialists. Strategies for delivering genetic services will need to be developed to ensure appropriate use and equitable access to testing. This may involve technologies such as telephone and telemedicine to increase access to genetic specialists, group counseling, and non-genetics health care providers developing expertise in the role of genetic testing within their specific specialties [

         Informed consent, a tenet of patient-centered medicine, is a foundation for the voluntary nature of genetic testing.

        <p>
         Informed consent means that the patient fully understands and agrees to the procedure. Consent involves more than just the signing of a document; consent requires discussion that includes the details of the testing and its risks, benefits, and limitations, including the sensitivity and specificity of different genetic tests (if available). When offering genetic testing, especially to unaffected individuals, most clinicians follow language from the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, which encourages the patient to voluntarily exercise free power of choice, without any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion [

         Genetic testing for germline variants can be conducted on virtually any tissue. Most laboratories prefer blood specimens, although cheek (buccal) swabs and saliva samples may be an option for certain types of genetic testing. Germline testing of individuals with active hematologic malignancies often requires isolating DNA from skin or other tissue samples.

         Testing for acquired (somatic) mutations requires the appropriate tissue (eg, tumor, bone marrow). DNA can be obtained from essentially any nucleated cell type, whereas classical cytogenetic analysis, such as karyotyping, requires dividing cells. (See

        <p>
         The use of robotics and standardized primers for gene amplification have helped to lower the costs of genetic testing. However, the costs of interpreting the results of DNA testing can be expensive, especially if the interpretation of pathogenicity is uncertain. Including samples from other affected relatives or biological parents may help with the interpretation. Public databases can be helpful in the interpretation process by establishing the frequency of a variant in different populations within that database.

         In the United States, insurance reimbursement is becoming more common for genetic testing as testing becomes a more routine part of clinical care. Coverage of genetic testing by insurance will vary depending on the type of test, whether it is being done to make a diagnosis in an affected person or to predict risk in an unaffected individual, and on the patient's specific type of insurance coverage.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a pre-authorization letter, a clear indication of the purpose of the test and the manner in which it will change management is more effective than a vague form letter. A study that reported on findings of whole exome sequencing (WES) for 250 patients (mostly children with neurologic phenotypes, all of whom had undergone prior genetic testing) found that insurance coverage for the costs was similar to other genetic testing and provided reimbursement for the majority of tests [

         For some rare conditions, testing is only available in a research setting. Most research laboratories are not Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments certified and thus not authorized to provide results to the patient for the purpose of clinical decision making. Therefore, when pursuing testing through a research study, it is important to clarify with the investigator the exact testing that will be done on the sample, if and how results might become available, and the expected turnaround time.

         No variant is identified. Failure to identify a pathogenic variant does not eliminate the possibility of a causative genetic variant or an inherited risk. A negative result may mean that a genetic alteration still exists in the gene(s) tested but cannot be identified with available technologies, a genetic alteration exists in a known gene that was not tested, or a genetic alteration exists in a currently unknown or undescribed gene.

         A variant of uncertain significance (VUS) is identified. The uncertainty refers to the available data regarding disease risk from clinical and research studies, not the accuracy of testing or the likelihood of disease (see

         Generally, germline genetic testing does not need to be repeated for a specific gene as long as the results are obtained from a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory and are considered to be accurate, since germline DNA sequence does not change. However, more extensive testing or re-analysis of previous sequence data may be appropriate when new information about pathogenicity of certain genes becomes available, and (as for any clinical test) re-testing for a specific gene(s) may be reasonable if there is a basis for questioning the initial results (eg, strong family history of breast and ovarian cancer with
         <em>
          BRCA

         Repeat testing on tumor or blood samples may be appropriate when evaluating for new genetic changes (eg, a mutation that confers resistance to therapy) or for residual disease following potentially curative treatment.

         For conditions in which genes have not yet been identified or there is a lack of evidence of an effective intervention, preservation of genetic material from the affected individual by DNA banking for future genetic testing can be a reasonable option. This involves the storage of DNA (usually extracted from blood, occasionally from tissue samples) for future testing should it become desired. In the United States, most insurance companies will not pay for testing of affected family members whom they do not insure. This includes testing of banked DNA from a deceased individual to determine appropriate testing for an unaffected family member.

         <strong>
          Terminology
         </strong>
         – Genetic testing is any type of testing that helps determine the genotype (DNA blueprint) in the germline or somatic cells. Terminology is shifting to avoid nonspecific, pejorative, or confusing terms such as mutation or polymorphism and instead to use the "variant," which refers to a difference from a reference sequence, along with a qualifier about pathogenicity  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). (See

         <strong>
          Methods
         </strong>
         – Testing can involve a single gene, panel of genes, or the entire exome or genome. For each gene, it is possible to analyze a single variant, a panel of variants, or the entire coding sequence. Methods include Sanger sequencing, microarrays, next-generation sequencing, cytogenetics, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH); cytogenetics and FISH assess alterations in chromosome number or structure. The laboratory generally determines which method to use. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Purpose
         </strong>
         – The purpose of genetic testing is to determine the likelihood or presence of a condition or disease, and in some cases the likely response to treatment. Disease likelihood can also depend on other factors, both genetic (inheritance pattern, penetrance, and expressivity) and environmental, not all of which are well-characterized. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Likelihood of disease'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Applications
         </strong>
         – Clinical applications cover the lifespan, from fetal testing to oncology and pharmacogenomics. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical applications'

         <strong>
          Pretest considerations
         </strong>
         – Determine whether the test is indicated, the ideal age at which to test, and which test provides useful information with the least cost and burden. These considerations can be discussed during pretest genetic counseling, which can help patients understand the implications of a positive or a negative result. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Questions to consider before testing'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Ethical and psychosocial
         </strong>
         – Ethical and psychosocial concerns related to genetic testing include potential consequences for at-risk relatives, inability to obtain informed consent from children, and fears about genetic discrimination. Racial disparities exist and should be addressed. In the United States, legal protection is available at the federal level through the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA); however, these protections do not apply to long-term care, life insurance, or disability insurance. Other countries have enacted privacy and nondiscrimination legislation as well. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Ethical, legal, and psychosocial issues'
         </a>

         <strong>
          How to order
         </strong>
         – Initial testing should be performed on an affected individual when possible; future testing can be tailored for at-risk relatives. Testing can be ordered by any clinician involved in the individual's care who address the appropriate test and methodology, logistics of test ordering, counseling, and use of results in clinical care. This may include a clinical geneticist, genetic counselor, primary care provider, or disease specialist. Informed consent is a foundation for the voluntary nature of genetic testing. The

         <strong>
          Follow-up
         </strong>
         – Management may involve additional testing or interventions tailored to disease or disease risk. If testing is negative or reveals a variant of uncertain significance, management depends on the estimated likelihood of disease. Positive results from germline testing generally do not need to be repeated if the results are obtained from a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory and are considered to be accurate, since germline DNA sequence does not change. More extensive testing, re-analysis of sequence data, or review of new information about pathogenicity may be appropriate. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Management and follow-up'
