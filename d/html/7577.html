However, there are unique features regarding both medical and behavioral health of MSM of importance to practicing clinicians [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. In addition, MSM may have specific concerns about access to care, insurance coverage, and the clinical office environment that should be considered as part of ensuring equitable and quality care [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p>Healthy People 2030, a document that outlines health goals in the United States, highlighted areas of concern regarding health care disparities impacting MSM and other sexual minorities [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In particular, MSM are disproportionately impacted by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that in 2019, close to 70 percent of new cases of HIV in the United States were in MSM [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Despite likely underreporting of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, nearly 2.4 million cases of syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia were diagnosed in 2020 in the United States [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Though the number of primary and secondary syphilis cases in MSM slightly decreased in 2020, the majority of cases continue to be diagnosed in MSM [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In addition, gay men across a broad age spectrum are more likely to attempt suicide, experience homelessness, and have high rates of tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. All MSM, but especially older individuals, may face additional barriers to health due to isolation and lack of supportive services due to homophobia and stigma.</p><p>Despite ample evidence of these disparities, education about the medical care of MSM is sorely lacking in both undergraduate and graduate medical settings [<a href="#rid10">10-12</a>], leading to official calls for program revisions to include curricula about LGBTQ care [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The population that has come to be referred to as "gay" in the Western world is not a descriptive term that would be recognized by all men who have sex with men (MSM). While LGBTQ culture is increasingly open and discussed, MSM comprise a diverse population that may respond differently depending on how communications in clinical settings are framed [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. MSM are a diverse group with respect to race, ethnicity, religion, education level, and socioeconomic status [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>Sexual orientation is generally considered to encompass three components: identity, attraction, and behavior. “Gay” is generally used to describe how people identify themselves, while “men who have sex with men” (MSM) describes a behavior. It is important to recognize that “MSM” refers to a range of sexual behaviors and may not specifically reference anal sex. MSM may self-identify as gay, bisexual, queer, non-binary, same-sex loving, transgender, genderqueer, questioning, or heterosexual/straight. Additionally, some men who are beginning to explore their sexuality may experience a desire to be intimate with other men but may not identify as being gay or have yet to be sexually active with men.</p><p>Some persons may identify as belonging to a gender that differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. They may identify as transgender, using a term such as transwoman, or use a term such as "genderqueer", which blurs the gender male-female binary. Other terms are used around the world, but transgender is often used as an umbrella term to describe individuals whose gender varies from their assigned sex at birth. Transgender individuals challenge existing conceptions of “men who have sex with men,” as they may not identify as men or have traditionally “male” anatomy. Care of transgender individuals involves both general primary care as well as consideration of behavioral, hormonal, and gender-affirming surgical care. It is important that primary care clinicians know whether their patients are transgender so they can manage these issues as well as preventive and other care related to natal anatomy, such as screening for cancer. Transgender men and women may have unique behavior patterns related to HIV risk and their gender identity is entirely separate from their sexual orientation. For example, a transgender woman may identify as heterosexual because she partners with men, and a transgender man may identify as gay because he partners with men. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/82964.html" rel="external">"Primary care of transgender individuals"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7456.html" rel="external">"Transgender women: Evaluation and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/109911.html" rel="external">"Transgender men: Evaluation and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5426.html" rel="external">"Sexual and gender minority women (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, plus): Medical and reproductive care"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14352.html" rel="external">"Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and other sexual minoritized youth: Primary care"</a>.)</p><p>Some MSM struggle with cognitive dissonance, stigma, and internalized homophobia related to their sexual behavior and may not identify as MSM or as any sexual minority. Some do not even consider same-sex or same-gender sexual activity to be sex at all. Stigma, oppression, and stress related to sexual desire, sexual activity, and sexual identity may affect the risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and certain cancers. Understanding a patient's sexual orientation, including one's identity, behavior, and desires, all have a bearing on the ability to provide quality care.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">PREVALENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Kinsey's 1948 study Sexual Behavior in the Human Male was the first report on same-sex sexual experiences among men in the United States (US) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. More contemporary studies suggest that about 3.5 percent of the United States adult population identifies as gay or bisexual, while higher percentages engage in same-sex sexual activity (8 percent) and an even greater number are attracted to people of the same sex (11 percent) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The study, which also included surveys from other countries (Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, and Norway), demonstrated that 1.8 percent of adults in the United States identified as gay or lesbian, with similar rates in the other included countries, ranging from 0.7 to 1.1 percent.</p><p>In Gallup polls, persons identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) increased from 3.5 percent in 2012 to 7.1 percent in 2021 [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. An estimated 10 million United States adults identify as LGBT. Among the millennial (born between 1981 and 1996) and generation Z (born 1997 to 2003) populations in 2021, 10.5 and 20.8 percent of adults, respectively, identified as LGBT [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Identities within gender and sexual minorities include genderqueer, intersex, asexual, and others, expanding LGBT to LGBTQIA+.</p><p>Regardless of the precise numbers, United States census figures confirm that "same sex"-headed households are widespread throughout the country. Such households were found in over 93 percent of counties in every state [<a href="#rid19">19</a>] and suggest MSM live across the United States. Thus, all clinicians, at least in the United States, should be familiar with the concepts of sexual orientation and identity and how to discuss sexual behaviors when seeing patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">OBTAINING A HISTORY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some trainees in United States medical schools are taught, when taking a sexual history, to ask whether someone is sexually active, and if so, how their partner/s describe their gender; how many sexual partners they have had in the past year; and whether they engage in anal, oral, and/or vaginal sex. Patients should be told that the information related to their sexual activity is asked of everyone and has relevance to their health care and prevention decisions.</p><p>Nonjudgmental questions about sexual behavior are valuable, although they may not identify those who have never engaged in same-sex behavior, but have the desire to do so. Unrealized sexual desires may be an important trigger for discussing issues such as related anxiety or depression, fear of "coming out," and concern about how this information in the medical record could affect potential insurance coverage or employment.</p><p>Additional questioning about concerns with sexuality or gender identity may help identify issues related to sexual health and concern about sexual function, as well as possible gender identity issues.</p><p>Providers should routinely ask the following questions to normalize sexual history taking for sexual minorities. Questions such as the following can be incorporated into routine screening questionnaires that may be completed by the patient prior to seeing a provider and can inform discussion and screening tests during a visit.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>"What is your current gender?"</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>"What sex was recorded on your birth certificate?"</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>"What is the gender of your sex partners?" or, alternatively, "Do you ever have sex with men, women, trans or non-binary partners?"</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>"What type of sex do you have? Insertive anal (top), receptive anal (bottom), or versatile (both)? Oral? Vaginal?"</p><p></p><p>It is also important to ask about any history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including exposure to HIV (see <a class="local">'HIV'</a> below). For patients who identify as transgender, it is important to ask about plans or goals for medical transition (eg, hormonal therapy) and surgical history, which may affect sexual behavior and thus HIV/STI risk. For example, many transgender women report that maintaining an erection is often difficult after starting hormone replacement therapy. This may make them more likely to be a receptive anal sex partner. Additionally, for providers who feel more comfortable with obtaining a sexual history, it may be prudent to ask about other sex behaviors including anilingus ("rimming") or insertion of the entire hand into the anus and rectum ("fisting"), as these activities have also been associated with transmission of STIs including hepatitis C and shigellosis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">ISSUES TO TARGET</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are few population-based studies of health issues in gay men. Based on clinical experience and epidemiology, we identify several areas in which clinicians providing primary care to gay men should lend additional attention beyond what they might focus on in heterosexual men. A 2020 consensus report published by the National Academies that summarizes studies of disparities among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in general and gay men specifically highlighted that important issues to target include: HIV; infectious diseases including sexually transmitted infections (STIs); cancer; immunizations; substance and tobacco use; behavioral health, mental disorders, and intimate partner violence [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2924084"><span class="h2">HIV</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the United States, the overall incidence of HIV decreased in populations of men who have sex with men (MSM) between 2010 through 2019, with new infections decreasing in White MSM, and no change in new infections among African American or Latino MSM [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. In 2020, 21 percent of the overall incident HIV diagnoses were among Latino MSM, while they represented 31 percent of all diagnoses among MSM. Black MSM accounted for 26 percent of all new HIV diagnoses and 39 percent of diagnoses among all MSM [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The high incidence among Black MSM is not due to increased unsafe sexual practices or drug use but is likely related to structural racial inequality, lack of access to prevention services and care [<a href="#rid20">20</a>], lack of awareness of HIV status, delayed recognition and treatment of STIs, and increased prevalence of HIV in Black MSM sexual networks, which all make the risk of any single sexual encounter greater [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that, of the 36,801 new HIV infections reported in 2019, 69 percent were among MSM, including MSM who inject drugs [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The highest prevalence of HIV (up to 42 percent in the United States) is found among transgender women [<a href="#rid23">23-25</a>], who also experience high rates of STIs, discrimination, violence, and poverty.</p><p>While a combination of prevention activities seems most effective, key interventions are universal screening, treatment as prevention, and post- and preexposure prophylaxis (PEP and PrEP) using a harm-reduction approach that empowers patients to make informed choices and manage their risks [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p>In the United States, the CDC recommends that for effective HIV prevention [<a href="#rid27">27-30</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sexually active MSM can take steps to reduce the risk of contracting HIV, such as serosorting (choosing sexual partners based on HIV status) or seropositioning (choosing sexual activities based on HIV status) with men who are known to be HIV positive, consistent condom use, and, if HIV positive, letting potential sex partners know their status. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16612.html" rel="external">"HIV infection: Risk factors and prevention strategies", section on 'Clinical approach to HIV prevention'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For MSM who are HIV-negative, are not taking PrEP, and have a significant exposure event, taking PEP can reduce HIV risk after an exposure.

Recommendations for universal screening are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3736.html" rel="external">"Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7596.html" rel="external">"Screening for sexually transmitted infections", section on 'HIV and hepatitis viruses'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2924345"><span class="h3">Treatment to virologic suppression for all persons with HIV</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>One of the major preventive benefits of HIV testing is the identification of individuals who have HIV and are therefore candidates for antiretroviral therapy (ART). In the United States, ART is recommended for everyone with HIV, regardless of CD4 count, because it halts the progression of disease and prevents HIV transmission by lowering viral loads and making transmission to individuals without HIV much less likely. Studies have shown that the risk of HIV transmission from a virologically suppressed patient (ie, person with a HIV viral load &lt;200 copies/mL) is zero [<a href="#rid31">31</a>], prompting the “U=U” campaign (ie, undetectable equals untransmittable). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3777.html" rel="external">"When to initiate antiretroviral therapy in persons with HIV"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H77651224"><span class="h3">Use of barrier methods</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although condom use has declined among MSM in the United States [<a href="#rid32">32</a>], for individuals without HIV, counseling about HIV risk reduction when condoms are used properly during vaginal or anal intercourse remains important. There is a minimal risk of HIV transmission with oral sex, which is highest when a man with HIV and a detectable viral load ejaculates into the mouth of a person with open mouth sores. While it makes sense to inform patients that routine use of condoms can decrease the risk of HIV transmission, it is also important to recognize that many patients prefer not to use condoms for sex on a regular basis and that, in the United States, there has been an increase in condomless anal intercourse [<a href="#rid27">27,32</a>]. This suggests the need to consider recommending use of HIV PEP or PrEP accompanied by ongoing counseling and monitoring for adherence.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2924403"><span class="h3">Post-exposure prophylaxis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>MSM should be educated about obtaining HIV PEP in the event of a substantial nonoccupational exposure, such as condomless receptive anal intercourse with a partner of unknown HIV status or with a partner known to be HIV-positive with a detectable viral load. Repeated exposures suggest the need for additional counseling about risk reduction and recommendation of HIV PrEP. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3768.html" rel="external">"Management of nonoccupational exposures to HIV and hepatitis B and C in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H77651254"><span class="h3">Pre-exposure prophylaxis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HIV PrEP most commonly consists of using daily oral tenofovir-emtricitabine (TDF-FTC [generally preferred] or TAF-FTC), along with HIV and STI testing every three months and ongoing counseling and assessment of risk at follow-up visits. Long-acting injectable PrEP (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="130319" href="/d/drug information/130319.html" rel="external">cabotegravir</a> LA), a newer formulation approved in 2022 for persons weighing at least 35 kg, can be administered intramuscularly every two months and may be an alternative for some populations. Education and monitoring for injectable PrEP are more complex than for oral PrEP. Irrespective of the formulation, PrEP has and continues to be evaluated in several large clinical trials in a range of populations at increased risk for HIV, including MSM, adolescents, cisgender women, transgender women, and serodiscordant heterosexual couples (ie, couples in which one partner has HIV and the other does not). Overall, these studies demonstrate that the effectiveness of oral PrEP is highly contingent upon medication adherence; when used consistently and correctly, effectiveness for HIV prevention is &gt;99 percent. Additional information is reviewed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/113426.html" rel="external">"HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2924598"><span class="h2">Other sexually transmitted infections</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevention </strong>–<strong> </strong>Clinicians can play an important role in prevention of STIs by discussing risk reduction and safe sexual practices with patients [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Individuals may need reassurance that close physical contact, kissing, and hugging are safe. While there is a minimal risk of HIV transmission associated with oral sex, the same is not true for other STIs like syphilis, herpes, and chlamydia. STIs are largely transmitted during oral, vaginal, or anal intercourse. Consistent and correct condom use can reduce the risk for these STIs, but pericoital antibiotic prophylaxis may be a preferred method for some people [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Clinicians should spend more time on such discussions when there is a concern that a patient may have multiple sexual partners, has not been using barrier methods, has been recently diagnosed with an STI, or engages in drug use, particularly stimulants, while having sex.

In 1986, the term "ego-dystonic homosexuality" was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III). Several studies have identified higher rates of depression in gay men [<a href="#rid59">59-64</a>]. There also appears to be an increased prevalence of anxiety disorders, particularly in relation to a man's growing consciousness of being gay and navigating societal pressures to come out [<a href="#rid65">65</a>] and coping with minority stress [<a href="#rid15">15,66</a>]. LGBTQ veterans also experience increased rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, and suicidality [<a href="#rid67">67,68</a>].</p><p>Although there has been debate about whether MSM at large are at higher risk for suicide, many studies show increased suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among sexual minority men and transgender people [<a href="#rid15">15,69</a>]. Rates are particularly high among gay youth who may experience stigma, discrimination, and violence during vulnerable periods of biopsychological development; suicidal ideation and attempts are three to seven times higher among gay youth than among heterosexuals. Gay adolescents and men also experience increased incidence of body dysphoria and eating disorders [<a href="#rid70">70</a>].</p><p>The environment in which many LBGTQ adolescents and adults were raised, the violence and victimization faced by many at times in their lives, and the anxiety and fear about coming out can leave emotional scars that often need to be addressed. As a result, discussion of these and related issues is important and referral for counseling and/or psychopharmacologic intervention is often warranted. Many continue to struggle with the pressure of coming out, integrating their identity, and finding a sense of community or belonging. Nevertheless, many men demonstrate great resilience and are able to embrace their identity with no substantial adverse impacts to their mental health [<a href="#rid71">71</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h2">Intimate partner violence, sexual assault, and hate crimes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Studies suggest that the pooled prevalence of intimate partner violence among MSM is over 30 percent [<a href="#rid72">72</a>] and likely approaches similar rates as for heterosexual partners [<a href="#rid73">73,74</a>]; however, LGBTQ youth are at increased risk for dating violence compared with heterosexual youth [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2789.html" rel="external">"Intimate partner violence: Epidemiology and health consequences"</a>.)</p><p>Two striking differences are that informal discussions with survivors suggest that there is little screening done for intimate partner violence among gay individuals, and facilities designed to accommodate survivors of partner violence are rarely able to accommodate men [<a href="#rid75">75</a>].</p><p>A related and significant issue is that sexual assault among gay men is often underreported due to victim shaming and bias among some law enforcement officers. One study showed that only a small percentage of violent incidents were reported due to fear that open discussion would lead to further injury and that some victims had been victimized by police [<a href="#rid76">76</a>]. For gay men, finding a safe and supportive place to seek aid can be difficult as rape crisis programs are often unprepared to deal with male (and especially gay male) victims of sexual assault and rape. Furthermore, some legal definitions of rape exclude male victims.

Perhaps the most important feature of care is the application of an open and nonjudgmental approach to finding out about each patient, their individual circumstances, concerns, and needs.</p><p>The same applies to the general office environment. Educational materials in waiting areas can give subtle signs that a practice may not be sensitive to same-sex issues, particularly if they do not include images of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) partners and families.</p><p>Some centers are now routinely asking patients for information on sexual orientation and gender identity at the time of registration. Forms asking for this information in language seeming to promote only traditional heteronormative family structures can be off-putting to gender and sexual minorities. Rather than just asking if a patient is married, single, or divorced, there should also be an option to indicate if a patient has a significant other or domestic partner. In countries and states where same-sex marriages are recognized, medical staff should acknowledge these relationships as they would with any heterosexual marriage, and they must recognize the legal status of these relationships for the purposes of hospital visitation [<a href="#rid77">77,78</a>].</p><p>In the United States, the Joint Commission and other agencies continue to collect data, looking at ways to improve the care environment for gay men in clinical settings [<a href="#rid15">15,79</a>]. The Joint Commission has implemented policies allowing patient choice of visitors in hospitals, prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.</p><p>Same-sex couples and families with same-sex parents may look to clinicians for guidance on issues of family commitment, marriage, adoption, parenting, foster parenting, and gestational carrier/surrogate pregnancy in the same ways that other partners and families do. Facilities for families must recognize that increasing numbers of children will now register with two same-sex parents or caregivers.
