         Trauma remains the leading cause of death in those less than 44 years of age in the United States, and for those older than 45, trauma is one of the top five causes of death. The management of patients with traumatic injuries presents a variety of challenges. Patients require multidisciplinary evaluation, securing the airway and breathing, hemorrhage control, resuscitation, and stabilization in the emergency department and possible operative intervention prior to inpatient admission. For the combined burn/trauma patient, the immediate management priority is stabilization and resuscitation of the patient from a trauma/management of injury perspective [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Management of the burn wounds is a secondary priority.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients remain at risk for complications due to unrecognized injuries or related to initial or ongoing management.
        </p>
        <p>
         The general care and management of injured patients who require hospital admission is reviewed here. Initial evaluation and treatment in the emergency department is discussed separately. Specific injuries are discussed in separate topic reviews. (See

         Damage control surgery, which has become a common approach to the treatment of the severely injured patient, involves immediate operative control of hemorrhage and contamination (ie, bowel injury) followed by transfer to the intensive care unit for ongoing resuscitation. Damage control surgery has been shown to reduce mortality in severely and multiply injured patients [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-4
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15148.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of damage control surgery and resuscitation in patients sustaining severe injury"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Upon arrival to the intensive care unit, acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy are corrected with ongoing fluid resuscitation and component transfusion therapy. Once the patient is stabilized, definitive treatment of the patient's injuries can be undertaken. Damage control and the management of specific injuries are discussed in separate topic reviews.

         Ongoing inpatient assessment and monitoring is critical to managing injured patients. This is particularly true in patients who have undergone damage control surgery or those with injuries that are being managed nonoperatively, such as blunt splenic, hepatic, duodenal, or pancreatic injury. Recognition of the full extent of traumatic injury requires an accurate history, skillful physical examination, and timely and judicious use of diagnostic studies.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Patients with serious traumatic injuries often are unable to give details of their past medical history upon presentation to the emergency department, and collateral sources of information (eg, family or other caregivers, friends) may not be available initially. It is therefore incumbent upon the admitting clinician to obtain additional information about past medical history, outpatient medications, allergies, and any history of drug or alcohol use.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is also important to obtain information about the circumstances that led to the injury since falls from a height or motor vehicle collisions may have been precipitated by medical causes such as cardiac dysrhythmia, hypoglycemia, or stroke and injuries from assault may be a result of domestic violence. In addition, self-inflicted injuries may be a manifestation of a psychological disorder that needs to be identified and treated.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to its value in optimizing medical management, accurate information about the medical history can be valuable in estimating prognosis. The patient's baseline health status also affects the length of stay. One study of over 27,000 trauma admissions found that the probability of a trauma patient remaining hospitalized for more than three weeks nearly doubles with the presence of at least one significant underlying medical condition, such as end-stage kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or malignancy [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Outcomes'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In one study, ongoing drug or alcohol use disorder was present in over 30 percent of individuals admitted for trauma [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. These individuals had increased risk of complications during hospitalization, particularly those related to pneumonia and other infections. These patients are at risk for withdrawal syndromes, which may be difficult to recognize in the setting of obtundation, intubation, or closed-head injury [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. The possibility of an intentional drug overdose prior to injury should also be considered. (See

         The injured patient admitted from the emergency department or operating room warrants full reassessment by the receiving team in accordance with advanced trauma life support (ATLS) guidelines. Missed injuries are more likely to occur in the patient with polytrauma who requires emergent surgical intervention. Performing a repeat trauma survey (tertiary survey) on all patients decreases the frequency of missed injuries [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. A review of observational studies that included over 12,000 trauma patients found a significantly increased risk of missed injury for trauma patients who did not have a tertiary survey compared with those who did (odds ratio 2.65, 95% CI 1.40-5.01) [

         Each of the diagnostic studies the patient has previously undergone, including plain films and computed tomography (CT) studies, should be reviewed and the final radiology report obtained.

         In spite of diagnostic guidelines for the initial evaluation in trauma, the reported incidence of missed injuries ranges from 1.3 to 39 percent [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14-16
         </a>
         ]. The true incidence of missed injuries and delayed diagnoses is difficult to determine, in part because of the variability in the definition of what constitutes a missed injury. Missed injuries have been shown to increase morbidity, prolong hospital stay, and increase mortality [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17-19
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Missed injuries are more commonly associated with an abbreviated injury scale (AIS) &gt;3, but missed injuries that are life-threatening are uncommon [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Reasons cited for missed diagnoses include assessment errors, misinterpretation of radiographs, and, for musculoskeletal injuries, lack of radiographs of the specific area of injury. A review of 1124 patients admitted to a level I trauma center identified missed injuries in 8 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. The missed injury involved an extremity in 68 percent of patients. Significant factors associated with missed injury were injury severity score (ISS) ≥16 and Glasgow coma scale &lt;8. Of the 122 missed injuries, 72 were missed in spite of a tertiary survey. In another review in which the missed injury rate was 15 percent, higher ISS, higher maximum AIS of the thorax, and nonsurgeon trauma team leader status were significant predictors of missed injuries [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Injuries can also be missed during emergent exploratory laparotomy. In a database review from two level I trauma centers, 19 of 90 patients who underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy for penetrating (n = 66) or blunt (n = 25) trauma had additional injuries within the surgical field that were not identified intraoperatively but were diagnosed on postoperative abdominopelvic CT [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. The injuries included mostly solid organ injuries but also unexpected active bleeding, a diaphragmatic injury, spine injury, colonic injury, and arteriovenous fistula. Eight of the injuries (8.9 percent of the entire cohort) were severe enough to require additional treatment (surgery or angioembolization). Undiagnosed fractures were also identified. Rates of unsuspected injuries within the surgical field were similar for patients who were empirically imaged compared with those with specific indications for CT (20.9 versus 21.4 percent). However, those with a specific indication for CT had a higher rate of intervention (14.2 versus 6.5 percent). These retrospective findings suggest that when clinical suspicion is present (unknown trajectory of penetrating missile or unexplored regions following blunt trauma), postoperative CT imaging can be useful to elucidate additional injuries, but whether empiric imaging is useful is not clear.

         A concerted effort should be made to identify potentially life-threatening injuries that can be missed so that they may be properly treated. These are discussed briefly below.

         A missed or delayed diagnosis of intra-abdominal injury constitutes an important cause of preventable death in injured patients, particularly in the setting of blunt trauma [

         A review of 607 abdominal trauma patients reported that 2 percent of patients had injuries that were missed on initial evaluation or at first surgery [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Missed diagnoses were attributed to clinical inexperience, overlooked or atypical radiographic findings, and an unclear history of trauma.
        </p>
        <p>
         A missed intra-abdominal injury should be suspected in patients with blunt or penetrating trauma who have evidence of ongoing acidosis, persistent tachycardia, need for ongoing fluid resuscitation or transfusion, abdominal sepsis, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Abdominal sepsis is a late finding, whereas the other clinical signs usually manifest within 24 to 36 hours of injury.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tests to diagnose intra-abdominal injury include computed tomography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and diagnostic peritoneal lavage. However, exploratory laparotomy remains the gold standard and should be performed in any patient for whom a significant operable injury is suspected but that cannot be determined by abdominal examination (eg, intubated, spinal cord injury) along with available diagnostic studies. Diagnostic laparoscopy may represent a less invasive means to directly examine the peritoneal cavity and its contents but may miss small intestinal injuries.

         Pulmonary contusion, which is injury to the parenchyma of the lung, is the most common lung injury identified in the setting of blunt chest trauma, occurring in 17 percent of multiple trauma patients. The associated mortality rate ranges from 6 to 25 percent, often due to a superimposed pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25,26
         </a>
         ]. Common mechanisms of pulmonary contusion include rapid deceleration in high-speed motor vehicle collisions, falls, assault, penetrating injury, and blast injury (often combined blunt and penetrating trauma) [

          26
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Pulmonary contusion is often not initially suspected because the clinical and radiographic findings (homogenous opacification of the lung) are delayed. In addition, pulmonary contusion can occur in the absence of any visible chest wall injury or radiographic evidence of rib fractures, particularly in children [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27

         Blunt injury to an artery may not be immediately apparent depending upon the location and grade of the injury. High-grade injuries (pseudoaneurysm, transection) are usually symptomatic, causing hard signs of arterial injury (pain, pulsatile mass, hypotension, extremity ischemia); however, intimal tears are often asymptomatic. These lesions may remain static or progress as a subintimal dissection that can cause luminal narrowing or acute vessel occlusion over a variable period of time, reducing distal perfusion. These low-grade (minimal) injuries need to be identified so that appropriate therapy, which can be nonsurgical, can be initiated. The diagnosis and management of injuries to the vasculature is discussed in separate topic reviews.

         The need for monitoring in patients who require admission for traumatic injury is determined by the nature and severity of their injuries.

         A complete blood count is obtained and compared to values obtained upon arrival in the emergency department or in the operating room. Serial hemoglobin measurement may be useful to trend slow, internal bleeding but is of limited use in guiding transfusion therapy in patients with brisk bleeding. Most importantly, an active search must be initiated to find and arrest the source of hemorrhage. Serial counts are typically obtained every six hours (and as needed based upon clinical condition) in patients with conservatively managed solid organ injuries (liver, spleen, kidney) and in patients with pelvic fracture. In patients without evidence of bleeding, the frequency of repeat blood counts depends upon the clinical situation.

         Renal function – Renal function tests (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine) should be obtained daily in patients who received intravenous contrast agents, particularly if the patient is at high risk for contrast-induced nephropathy, such as patients with chronically impaired renal function and those who received contrast agents while hypovolemic. A serum creatinine concentration that begins to increase within 24 to 48 hours of contrast administration, with or without oliguria, may indicate contrast-induced nephropathy. The serum creatinine concentration generally reaches a peak after three to five days and then returns to baseline over a period of one to three weeks. Therapy of contrast-induced nephropathy is primarily supportive; dialysis is rarely required. (See

         Coagulation parameters – Coagulopathy in the injured patient may be the result of physiologic derangements such as acidosis, hypothermia, hemodilution, and tissue disruption. An acute coagulopathy can occur in severely injured patients independent of these factors. Coagulopathy can be especially profound following severe traumatic brain injury due to release of brain thromboplastin into the blood stream. Early recognition and management using appropriate transfusion strategies is important to reduce morbidity and mortality. (See

         Injured patients with normal coagulation parameters on arrival to the emergency department and who do not have signs of bleeding do not require repeat coagulation tests. Those patients who have received massive transfusions or who have ongoing transfusion requirements should have coagulation studies performed every four to six hours or following administration of procoagulant agents until the coagulation parameters are corrected. The American College of Surgeons recommends that level I and level II verified trauma centers have elastography (thromboelastography [TEG] or rotational thromboelastometry [ROTEM]) capability. These tests may be useful in detecting the specific cause of coagulopathy, including inappropriate clot dissolution, thereby allowing more targeted component repletion or pharmacologic therapy [

         Creatine kinase and myoglobin – Rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria can develop in patients with significant muscle injury, including crush injuries, prolonged immobilization, compartment syndrome, and ischemia-reperfusion following repair of vascular injuries in those who have undergone extensive arterial embolization to arrest hemorrhage (eg, hypogastric artery). Secondary compartment syndrome can also occur in the absence of a direct extremity injury following a massive resuscitation. A high index of suspicion and perhaps empiric laboratory testing in this cohort should be considered [

         Rhabdomyolysis presents with elevated serum muscle enzymes (including creatine kinase), red-to-brown urine due to myoglobinuria if there is persistent renal function, and electrolyte abnormalities. Peak serum creatine kinase levels depend upon the volume of muscle breakdown and the muscle mass of the patient. Creatine kinase values should be measured if there is a suspicion for rhabdomyolysis until decreasing levels are observed. Urine myoglobin levels may also be assessed. A brisk urine output should be maintained with intravenous fluid therapy until the creatine kinase value starts to decrease. Additionally, the potassium level should be monitored. Potassium levels may decrease due to the brisk urine output or increase if renal function deteriorates or there is ongoing myocyte necrosis. Alkalinization of the urine is no longer routinely recommended in trauma patients. (See

         Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is recognized as a potentially fatal complication of aggressive fluid resuscitation in seriously injured patients. Assessment of bladder pressure (which correlates closely with intra-abdominal pressure) should be performed in patients at high risk for ACS or when there is suspicion for ACS  (

         ) but is not required in all patients. A diagnosis of ACS constitutes a surgical emergency and should prompt immediate surgical consultation. (See

         Combined burn/trauma patients may be particularly prone to this problem, given the extent of fluid resuscitation that is required, even in the absence of intra-abdominal trauma. In a retrospective review of 1825 burn patients admitted to the United States Army Institute of Surgical Research Burn Center, acute abdominal catastrophe without intra-abdominal trauma occurred in 2.8 percent (51 patients), the majority occurring in the first few days of injury and associated with abdominal compartment syndrome [

         Patients with extremity injury can develop increased extremity compartment pressures as a result of crush injury, long bone fracture, ischemia-reperfusion following revascularization for arterial injury, or from burns either from constricting eschar or as a consequence of fluid resuscitation.

         Patients with severe extremity injury who have combined arterial and venous injury are particularly prone to developing an extremity compartment syndrome and may require prophylactic fasciotomy or repeated evaluation for 24 hours or more following repair of injury. Although a diagnosis of extremity compartment syndrome may be suggested by an elevation in creatine kinase, the diagnosis is clinical, and the absolute level of creatine kinase is
         <strong>
          not

         Screening for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in injured patients using duplex ultrasound remains controversial. There are no data or guidance to support routine screening. Although the prevalence of occult deep vein thrombosis (DVT) may be significantly higher in centers that screen trauma patients [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>

          38
         </a>
         ]. In spite of adequate pharmacologic anticoagulation in trauma populations, VTE persists. Many clinicians feel that a better assessment of quality of care includes evaluating adherence to an evidence-based regimen for VTE prophylaxis and, rather than using duplex testing to screen for VTE, appropriately evaluating high-risk and symptomatic patients as needed [

         Routine antibiotic administration is not warranted in most injured patients. In particular, the presence of a penetrating injury (eg, gunshot wound, stab wound) does not indicate the need for antibiotic coverage in the absence of local signs of infection. For patients who require abdominal exploration, a single dose of prophylactic antibiotics given within one hour of incision is appropriate [

         In the face of hollow viscus injury, antibiotics can be continued, and provided there has been no delay in identification and surgical management, no more than 24 hours should be needed. (See

Severely injured patients should receive early, aggressive VTE prophylaxis, which is continued until hospital discharge for all high-risk patients and beyond hospital discharge with patients with significant orthopedic injuries that limit mobility. It is generally agreed that the probability of VTE increases with each day of delay in initiation of pharmacologic prophylaxis. However, the benefit of pharmacologic prophylaxis has to be factored against the risk of hemorrhage. Furthermore, it is important to remember that inferior vena cava filter insertion does not prevent DVT and may increase the incidence of DVT; however, the filter can prevent a pulmonary embolism. Recommendations for thromboprophylaxis are discussed in more detail separately. (See

         Severely injured patients (intubated, coagulopathic) and patients with a history of prior ulcer disease are at increased risk for stress ulcerations. Stress ulcerations are mucosal erosions involving the fundus and body of the stomach but sometimes occurring in the antrum, duodenum, or distal esophagus. They tend to be shallow and cause oozing of blood from superficial capillary beds, but deeper lesions can erode into the submucosa, can cause massive hemorrhage, and can occasionally perforate.

         Hypothermia following injury is due to cold exposure at the time of injury, during initial evaluation, compounded by the administration of cold intravenous fluids in the emergency department or prehospital setting. Hypothermia can also represent advanced shock, which is most commonly due to hemorrhage in the trauma population. Patients who require surgery are at a greater risk for hypothermia due to further physical exposure in the operating room, the effects of general anesthesia, and use of cold intravenous or intracorporeal fluids. Hypothermia may impair clot formation and platelet dysfunction, which is of particular concern in trauma patients. Injured patients with hypothermia generally have worse outcomes compared with noninjured patients with hypothermia; however, hypothermia alone is a weak independent predictor of mortality [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Upon admission, the patient's temperature should be noted and measures instituted to warm the patient if the body temperature is low. Continuous temperature monitoring is essential to ensure that mild hypothermia does not worsen. Specific measures to prevent and correct mild hypothermia include controlling physical exposure, administration of warmed fluids, and passive rewarming with blankets and forced-air devices. In the case of moderate or severe hypothermia and coagulopathy, central rewarming may be needed.

         Patients who have been assaulted, or who have suffered severe physical injury, particularly those who required intensive care unit monitoring, are susceptible to acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These disorders are characterized by intrusive thoughts, nightmares and flashbacks of past traumatic events, avoidance of reminders of trauma, hypervigilance, and sleep disturbance. Patients exhibiting persistent symptoms (&gt;2 weeks) should be referred for psychological evaluation and potentially treatment. Anxiolytics may be necessary in the interim. In more severe cases, early referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist may be beneficial. (See

         Severely injured patients who require operative intervention have an increased risk for anesthetic underdosing related to the often emergency nature of the procedure and hypotension prior to induction of anesthesia.

         For patients with severe injury, the period of acute resuscitation combines several key principles: optimizing tissue perfusion, ensuring normothermia, and restoring coagulation. Specific goals include a core temperature &gt;37ºC, base deficit &lt;6, and normal coagulation parameters. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         There are a multitude of management algorithms aimed at accomplishing these goals; the majority involve goal-directed resuscitation with initial volume loading to attain adequate preload, followed by judicious use of inotropic agents or vasopressors, as needed. For patients with active hemorrhage, the focus should be on hemorrhage control and damage control resuscitation, which minimizes crystalloid exposure in favor of a balanced resuscitation of blood products and allows permissive hypotension prior to hemorrhage control for patients without significant traumatic brain injury. (See

         Although the optimal hemoglobin (Hb) level remains debated, during shock resuscitation hemoglobin levels should be titrated to optimize oxygen delivery. For patients who are not bleeding, a more judicious transfusion trigger of Hb &lt;7 g/dL in the euvolemic patient limits the adverse inflammatory effects of stored red blood cells (RBCs). (See

         Hemodynamically stable euvolemic patients should receive maintenance and replacement fluids and electrolytes, as indicated, depending upon dietary status. Drainage from chest tubes, and wound sites such as an open abdomen and fasciotomy wounds, should be quantified, if possible. A preset fluid replacement regimen is rarely necessary, but these sources of fluid efflux should be considered when adjusting the volume of fluid therapy. (See

         Crystalloid boluses in addition to maintenance fluid are administered to patients who remain hypotensive or oliguric and are not actively bleeding and may be needed in hemodynamically stable patients who have a negative fluid balance. Therapy should be guided by urine output in patients with normal renal function. Ongoing bleeding requires transfusion therapy (packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma [FFP] or similar products [eg, PF24], platelets) to maintain an adequate oxygen carrying capacity and to reverse coagulopathy.

         A positive fluid balance is likely in severely injured patients, particularly those who have received massive transfusion. Crystalloid administration is minimized in this population. Transfusion may be guided by thromboelastography parameters, where available. As discussed above, patients requiring significant fluid resuscitation should be observed for abdominal compartment syndrome. (See

         Similarly, patients with large body surface area burns in addition to traumatic injury may require large volume resuscitation. This will be especially true in patients who present with both hemorrhage from injury as well as insensible losses due to a large surface area burn. Whereas bleeding patients should be resuscitated with blood products as previously discussed, burn care guidelines directing the volume of fluid are used to manage large surface area burns. (See

         Open abdomen is an abdominal wall defect created by intentionally leaving the fascia and skin open at the completion of surgery. Damage control surgery and suspected abdominal compartment syndrome are the most frequent reasons for open abdomen. The open abdomen is managed using temporary abdominal closure techniques that control abdominal fluid losses and assist with the progressive closure of the defect  (

         During the initial assessment in the emergency department, most severely injured patients will have received an indwelling bladder catheter, various intravenous catheters, and possibly a nasogastric tube or an endotracheal or chest tube. Postoperative patients, particularly those who underwent damage control surgery, may also have had intraoperative drains placed.

        <p>
         At admission, the correct positioning of each tube and line should be confirmed, using radiographs if needed. Intravenous lines are often placed under duress during resuscitation, and frequent breaks in sterile precautions occur. These lines should be changed, whenever possible. Indications for use, placement, and appropriate care and management of these tubes and drains helps prevent complications.

         Pain management in the injured patient follows similar principles for managing postoperative pain. Critically injured patients in the intensive care unit are assessed frequently to ensure that pain control is adequate. It is imperative that a multimodality treatment strategy be used whenever possible to minimize narcotic use [

The most common cause of death from rib fractures is pneumonia related to inability to breathe deeply, cough, and move. Thus, controlling pain in this population is critically important. (See

Patients requiring dialysis had a higher mortality rate compared with patients with severe AKI who didn't require dialysis, and those without AKI (28.4 versus 20 and 8.8 percent, respectively).

         There is evolving evidence on the utility of serum and urine biomarkers to predict onset of AKI and probability of renal recovery. However, these studies are mostly in the overall critically ill population and not specific to the trauma cohort. Similarly, there have been reports on the use of a "

         <a href="#rid103">
          103
         </a>
         ]. These studies suggest that this test is more sensitive than serum or urine biomarkers of AKI for predicting progression of AKI, but, as before, the studies were performed in the general intensive care unit (ICU) population and are not unique to injured patients. Regardless, once AKI is established, the treatment is primarily supportive. (See

         The incidence of catheter-associated infection is higher in trauma populations, which may be due to the placement of lines under less-than-ideal conditions. Issues related to catheter-associated blood stream infection are discussed in detail elsewhere. When possible, central venous catheters (which include peripherally inserted central catheters or PICC lines) should be exchanged to peripheral IVs or midline catheters when the indication for central access is no longer present.

         Injury severity scores have been devised to quantitate injury and predict outcome for multitrauma patients; however, each scoring system has limitations [
         <a href="#rid104">
          104-108
         </a>
         ]. Examples of scoring systems include the anatomical scoring system Injury Severity Score (ISS), the physiologic scoring system Revised Trauma Score (RTS), TRISS (age plus ISS and RTS), and A Severity Characterization of Trauma (ASCOT) [
         <a href="#rid104">
          104-110
         </a>
         ]. TRISS can accurately predict the probability of survival in blunt trauma patients and provides a reasonable assessment of survival in patients with penetrating injuries [
         <a href="#rid104">
          104
         </a>
         ]. Trauma scores have not been typically used to quantitate burn injuries, as burns are assessed as total body surface area (TBSA) burned. Burns are a component of ISS, but the contribution of the burn injury to TRISS is often inaccurate and cannot be used for prognostication.

         Early recognition and treatment of patients at risk for complications may help reduce morbidity and mortality. Multivariate analysis of data from over 30,000 patients identified the following independent risk factors for multiorgan failure (MOF), which has a high rate of death: increasing age, higher injury severity score, head abbreviated injury scale (AIS) ≥3, thoracic AIS ≥3, male sex, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ≤8, massive transfusion, base excess &lt;-3, systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg on admission, and presence of coagulopathy. A scoring system using parameters obtained within four hours of presentation to the emergency department may help predict those who could develop MOF within seven days of hospitalization [
         <a href="#rid111">
          111
         </a>
         ]. Elements of the Denver Emergency Department Trauma Organ Failure (TOF) scoring system include age ≥54 years (1 point), emergency intubation (3 points), hematocrit &lt;20 percent (2 points), hematocrit ≥20 percent and &lt;35 percent (1 point), emergency department systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg (1 point), and white blood cell count ≥20,000/microL (1 point). Based on this scoring system, the risk of MOF can be considered low, moderate, or high for scores of 0 to 1, 2 to 3, or &gt;4, respectively. Among 2072 patients in a multicenter study, 120 (6 percent) developed MOF [
         <a href="#rid112">
          112
         </a>
         ]. MOF developed in 3 percent of those with low score, 26 percent of those with moderate score, and 36 percent of those with high scores.

        <p>
         Mortality among victims of civilian trauma is substantially increased in the presence of one or more underlying chronic conditions. As an example, one study of approximately 7800 patients admitted with traumatic injures found that patients with at least one underlying medical condition had a significantly higher mortality compared with patients without such conditions (9 versus 3 percent), despite similar Glasgow Coma and Injury Severity Scores [
         <a href="#rid113">
          113
         </a>
         ]. Underlying renal disease, malignancy, or cardiac disease were particularly ominous indicators. Similar associations have been observed in the APACHE and other models of illness severity. (See

         Obesity also appears to worsen outcomes in trauma patients [

          114,115

         ]. A systematic review of 18 studies compared outcomes in 7751 patients with a body mass index [BMI] ≥30 with patients with BMI &lt;30 [
         <a href="#rid115">
          115
         </a>
         ]. The ISS was similar between the groups. Using a random effects model, the pooled estimate of effect showed that patients with obesity had a significantly increased risk of death, complications (acute renal failure, multiorgan failure, adult respiratory distress), and length of stay in the intensive care unit.

         <strong>
          Initial assessment
         </strong>
         – The injured patient admitted from the emergency department or operating room warrants full reassessment of the medical history. Patients with alcohol or drug use disorder are more likely to have complications during their hospital stay, while patients with medical comorbidities have an increased risk of mortality. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Patient assessment'

         <strong>
          Repeat assessment
         </strong>
         – Repeat head-to-toe trauma examination (tertiary survey) on all patients decreases the frequency of missed injuries. Missed injuries are more common in multiply injured patients who require emergent surgical intervention shortly after hospital arrival. Extremity injuries are commonly missed. Significant injuries that can be missed during the initial evaluation include intra-abdominal injury, diaphragm injury, pulmonary contusion, arterial injury, and intracranial injury. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Consider other potential injuries'

         <strong>
          Preventive strategies
         </strong>
         – Preventive strategies are important to reduce the incidence of common complications and include monitoring to identify and treat extremity and abdominal compartment syndromes, as indicated by the patient's injuries, and prophylactic therapies such as antibiotics prior to surgical intervention, thromboprophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, steroid prophylaxis for those on chronic therapy, and prophylaxis for drug/alcohol withdrawal.

          Complications
         </strong>
         – Complications that may arise in injured patients are often related to specific injuries (eg, biliary fistula) but may also be due to incomplete or absent prophylaxis (eg, deep vein thrombosis), lack of monitoring (eg, abdominal compartment syndrome), or complications arising from diagnostic and resuscitative efforts (eg, contrast-media-associated nephropathy, transfusion-associated acute lung injury), prolonged ventilation (eg, ventilator-associated pneumonia), or immobilization (eg, pressure ulcers).
