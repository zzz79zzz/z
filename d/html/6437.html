The approach to cyanosis in the newborn is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14305.html" rel="external">"Approach to cyanosis in the newborn"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5780.html" rel="external">"Cardiac causes of cyanosis in the newborn"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H462401450"><span class="h1">BACKGROUND</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cyanosis, a bluish purple discoloration of the tissues due to an increased concentration of deoxygenated hemoglobin in the capillary bed, results from a variety of conditions, many of which are life-threatening [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. It is most easily appreciated in the lips, nail beds, earlobes, mucous membranes, and locations where the skin is thin. It may be enhanced or obscured by lighting conditions and skin pigmentation. In children, life-threatening cyanosis most often results from respiratory disorders.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Two mechanisms result in cyanosis: systemic arterial oxygen desaturation and increased oxygen extraction by the tissues. Based upon these mechanisms, two types of cyanosis are described: central and peripheral. In addition, dermatologic conditions may result in blue skin color that mimics cyanosis in the absence of increased levels of deoxygenated blood in the capillary beds. (See <a class="local">'Mimics of cyanosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Central cyanosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Central cyanosis is evident when systemic arterial concentration of deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb) in the blood exceeds 5 g/dL (3.1 mmol/L) (oxygen saturation ≤85 percent) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Of note, cyanosis may not be readily detectable in patients with severe anemia (eg, Hb &lt;5 g/dL [3.1 mmol/L]).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Peripheral cyanosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with peripheral cyanosis have a normal systemic arterial oxygen saturation. However, increased oxygen extraction results in a wide systemic arteriovenous oxygen difference and increased deoxygenated blood on the venous side of the capillary beds. The increased extraction of oxygen results from sluggish movement of blood through the capillary circulation. Causes include vasomotor instability, vasoconstriction caused by exposure to cold, venous obstruction, elevated venous pressure, polycythemia, and low cardiac output.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">LIFE-THREATENING CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cyanosis may be caused by a wide range of disorders, but it usually stems from one of several common disorders of childhood and adolescence  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82520" href="/d/graphic/82520.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Respiratory causes are most often to blame in previously healthy children with the new onset of central cyanosis [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Vascular causes, including cardiac and pulmonary vascular etiologies, are also important etiologies of both central and peripheral cyanosis, particularly in young infants. (See <a class="local">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p>Other serious conditions produce central cyanosis through disordered breathing caused by neurologic disease or decreased ability for hemoglobin to carry oxygen (eg, methemoglobinemia) [<a href="#rid1">1,3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Respiratory causes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Any condition that inhibits oxygen from reaching the alveoli or disrupts its movement across the alveolar interface can cause life-threatening cyanosis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Decreased inspired oxygen</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Exposure to an environment where the concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) is decreased can lead to cyanosis [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In children, the most common scenario is smoke inhalation from house fires. With this exposure, hypoxia from the diminished ambient FiO<sub>2</sub> is frequently compounded by toxicity from carbon monoxide exposure (which primarily affects O<sub>2</sub> delivery and to a lesser extent O<sub>2</sub> utilization), and cyanide poisoning (which primarily affects O<sub>2</sub> utilization). In addition, lower airway obstruction from smoke particles and upper airway obstruction from direct thermal injury are common. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/322.html" rel="external">"Carbon monoxide poisoning"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/299.html" rel="external">"Cyanide poisoning"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/105477.html" rel="external">"Inhalation injury from heat, smoke, or chemical irritants"</a>.)</p><p>Occasionally, children experience environments with diminished FiO<sub>2</sub> through unintentional exposure to asphyxiating gases (eg, hydrogen sulfide ["sewer gas"], methane [common in peat bogs]) or intentional inhalation of hydrocarbons (eg, propane, butane, trichloroethane). Initial treatment consists of removal from the asphyxiating environment and immediate administration of 100 percent oxygen. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6502.html" rel="external">"Inhalant misuse in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Upper airway obstruction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Severe upper airway obstruction, as with a foreign body, croup, thermal injury, epiglottitis, bacterial tracheitis, tracheal/bronchial disruption, or congenital airway abnormalities, quickly leads to decreased alveolar ventilation and hypoxemia [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Physical findings include stridor, voice changes or aphonia, drooling, suprasternal retractions, and prolonged inspiratory time.</p><p>The initial approach to the child with severe symptoms includes a rapid assessment of respiratory function and identification of key clinical features (such as history of injury, fever, and onset of symptoms) that suggest the diagnosis and guide therapeutic interventions  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54996" href="/d/graphic/54996.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6455.html" rel="external">"Emergency evaluation of acute upper airway obstruction in children", section on 'Emergency airway assessment and management'</a>.)</p><p>Central cyanosis indicates severe airway obstruction and is an ominous finding. The child's condition will rapidly deteriorate if the airway obstruction is not relieved. Treatment must be initiated immediately by the most expert clinician available  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef55990" href="/d/graphic/55990.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6455.html" rel="external">"Emergency evaluation of acute upper airway obstruction in children", section on 'Severe or complete obstruction'</a>.)</p><p>Nasal secretions may cause obstruction and, in infants younger than six months of age who are obligate nasal breathers, can cause cyanosis. Suction of secretions may rapidly restore normal oxygenation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Impairment of chest wall or lung expansion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cyanosis ensues rapidly when chest wall movement or lung inflation is impeded  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef55990" href="/d/graphic/55990.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). This condition is often a result of major trauma (eg, motor vehicle collisions) and includes external chest compression (eg, victims of building collapse or mudslides), flail chest, open pneumothorax, tension pneumothorax, or hemothorax  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79921" href="/d/graphic/79921.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6568.html" rel="external">"Thoracic trauma in children: Initial stabilization and evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6557.html" rel="external">"Chest wall injuries after blunt trauma in children"</a>.)</p><p>Clinical features include abnormal chest wall movement (as may occur with splinting from pain or with a flail segment), chest wall ecchymosis or abrasions, deformity of the chest wall, subcutaneous air with crepitus, open sucking chest wound, tracheal deviation, abnormal breath sounds, or focal tenderness to palpation over ribs, sternum, or scapula.</p><p>Immediately life-threatening injuries must be identified and treated during the initial rapid assessment. Interventions may include assisted ventilation (flail chest), needle or tube thoracostomy (tension pneumothorax, hemothorax), application of an occlusive dressing secured on three of four sides (open pneumothorax), or (rarely) emergency thoracotomy (hemothorax unresponsive to tube thoracostomy). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6568.html" rel="external">"Thoracic trauma in children: Initial stabilization and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p>Cyanosis also accompanies chest wall muscle fatigue in infants and children with worsening respiratory distress and is an indication for advanced respiratory support such as noninvasive or mechanical ventilation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/100358.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation for acute and impending respiratory failure in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/109649.html" rel="external">"Initiating mechanical ventilation in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Intrinsic lung disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Primary pulmonary conditions such as severe asthma, bronchiolitis, pertussis, pneumonia, empyema, cystic fibrosis, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and, in the premature infant, hyaline membrane disease, comprise the most common life-threatening conditions that cause cyanosis [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. These etiologies can be broadly described as causing small airway obstruction (eg, asthma, bronchiolitis), parenchymal disease (eg, pneumonia), or disruption of oxygen exchange in the alveoli (eg, pulmonary edema, hyaline membrane disease).</p><p>The work of breathing is often increased in such patients and may be associated with retractions, nasal flaring, and/or grunting. The auscultatory abnormalities vary by etiology:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Expiratory wheezing typically occurs in diseases that cause small airway obstruction (eg, asthma, bronchiolitis).

The classic cough of pertussis is distinctive. The paroxysm is a long series of coughs during which the child may develop gagging and cyanosis and appear to be struggling for breath  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef80861" href="/d/graphic/80861.html" rel="external">movie 1</a>). Whooping, which is characterized by the noise of the forced inspiratory effort, may be observed following a coughing attack during the paroxysmal phase  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef57822" href="/d/graphic/57822.html" rel="external">movie 2</a>) but is not always present  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef55250" href="/d/graphic/55250.html" rel="external">movie 3</a>). Post-tussive emesis occurs frequently. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5995.html" rel="external">"Pertussis infection in infants and children: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Classic presentation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Patients with severe lung disease and poor air entry may not have lung findings that easily distinguish among the possible causes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Circulatory causes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Circulatory conditions may cause cyanosis by mixing oxygenated and deoxygenated blood (eg, intracardiac or vascular shunts), structural or vascular alteration in pulmonary blood flow, cardiac decompensation with pulmonary edema, or shock.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Congenital heart disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD) is a common cause of central cyanosis in newborns  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50161" href="/d/graphic/50161.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1,3</a>]. Although most newborns with cyanotic congenital heart disease are discovered either in utero or while still in the newborn nursery, occasionally infants with cyanosis from undiagnosed CHD will present to an emergency department or a primary care office. Specifically, those infants with lesions dependent upon a patent ductus arteriosus for pulmonary blood flow (eg, coarctation of the aorta, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, pulmonary atresia) can have profound cyanosis when the ductus closes, usually one to two weeks after birth  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef103087" href="/d/graphic/103087.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The hyperoxia test can help distinguish cardiac from pulmonary causes of cyanosis in some infants, but ultimately echocardiography is necessary to diagnose structural heart disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5785.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and initial management of cyanotic heart disease in the newborn", section on 'Hyperoxia test'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5045.html" rel="external">"Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN): Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Arterial blood gas'</a>.)</p><p>Infants with suspected cyanotic congenital heart disease warrant emergency pediatric cardiology consultation.

Myocarditis is one of the most important causes of acquired heart failure in children  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79989" href="/d/graphic/79989.html" rel="external">table 6</a>).

Early symptoms include headache, fatigue, dyspnea, and lethargy. At higher methemoglobin levels, respiratory depression, altered consciousness, shock, seizures, and death may occur. Acquired methemoglobinemia is life-threatening when methemoglobin comprises more than 40 percent of total hemoglobin.

Of note, cyanosis may not be readily detectable in patients with severe anemia (eg, Hb &lt;5 g/dL [3.1 mmol/L]) despite significant oxygen desaturation. Patients with peripheral cyanosis have a normal systemic arterial oxygen saturation but increased deoxygenated blood on the venous side of the capillary beds due to impaired capillary perfusion.
