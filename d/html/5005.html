(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4966.html" rel="external">"Preterm birth: Definitions of prematurity, epidemiology, and risk factors for infant mortality", section on 'Trends over time'</a>.)</p><p>However, infants cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) represent a vulnerable population, and they continue to need comprehensive clinical care after discharge.</p><p>This topic will review the care of the NICU graduate, focusing on the role of the primary care clinician. The discussion focuses on preterm infants who represent the majority of NICU graduates. Discharge planning, criteria for NICU discharge, and neurodevelopmental follow-up after NICU discharge are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4974.html" rel="external">"Discharge planning for high-risk newborns"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/103308.html" rel="external">"Long-term neurodevelopmental impairment in infants born preterm: Risk assessment, follow-up care, and early intervention"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ROLE OF THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The primary care provider plays a key role in providing optimal continuity of treatment for NICU graduates by coordinating transition of care from the neonatologist, delivering direct medical care, and facilitating ongoing care for specific medical conditions of the infant by subspecialists and other health professionals [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>].</p><p>The responsibility of overseeing the infant's medical care, communicating with parents/caregivers, and coordinating subspecialty care is shared between the primary care provider and the neonatologist. Continuity of care at the time of discharge from the NICU is critical [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The primary care clinician's role is:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To communicate with the neonatologist and family during the NICU course of the infant; especially when the infant is close to discharge. Ongoing communication facilitates the transfer of medical information (patient's medical history, medications, and technologic needs); allows collaborative arrangements for follow-up with primary, subspecialty, and neurodevelopmental care; and determines the appropriate timing of transfer and discharge home. For the parents/caregivers, contact with both the neonatologist and primary care provider decreases confusion, anxiety, and uncertainty regarding transfer of care. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4974.html" rel="external">"Discharge planning for high-risk newborns"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To assume primary responsibility for outpatient medical care upon discharge from the NICU.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To coordinate ongoing care among subspecialists and other health care professionals. The primary care provider should be aware of and be able to utilize community services for both the patient and the parents/caregivers as needed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To provide support to the parents/caregivers, including resources and information to help them foster the infant's development. This includes optimizing developmental stimulation in the home with early intervention services and early language exposure [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">INITIAL VISIT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial visit should occur within 48 to 72 hours after discharge from the hospital.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5003.html" rel="external">"Growth management in preterm infants", section on 'After discharge'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5003.html" rel="external">"Growth management in preterm infants", section on 'Interventions'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6366.html" rel="external">"Sudden infant death syndrome: Risk factors and risk reduction strategies", section on 'Sleep position and environment'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Address new concerns</strong> – Address any new concerns the parents/caregivers have. The primary care provider should confirm that the family understands the infant's medical diagnoses, and any medications (including dosage, mode of administration, and schedule) and equipment required for the infant's care. During this visit, the primary care clinician should also check on how the family is handling the responsibility and stress of bringing an infant home from the NICU.

(See <a class="local">'Screening'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">SUBSEQUENT VISITS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Subsequent visits focus on routine primary care (eg, immunization and growth), general care targeted for NICU graduates (ie, hearing, vision and neurodevelopment screening), and management of specific medical problems of the individual patient. The schedule depends on the patient's medical status but in general, primary care visits will be more frequent in the beginning (eg, every one to two weeks) to monitor and establish adequate growth.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Growth and nutrition</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H181789607"><span class="h3">Type of feeds</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is the goal for NICU graduates, as is true for all infants, to receive maternal breast milk for as long as the mother can provide it during the first year of life. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5013.html" rel="external">"Infant benefits of breastfeeding"</a>.)</p><p>Some preterm infants will be discharged with fortified breast milk or supplemental formula feeds to ensure adequate caloric intake for growth. However, other NICU graduates will be discharged on formulas when breast milk is not available, including alternate formulas for infants with intestinal surgery, necrotizing enterocolitis, or other feeding intolerance. </p><p>Transitional preterm infant formula has increased caloric density, calcium, and phosphorus. Other formulas have alternate carbohydrate ingredients, hydrolyzed proteins, and medium-chain triglycerides, and some are elemental for optimal ease of digestion. If an infant is discharged home with feeding other than breast milk or term formula, the primary provider should know the indication and planned duration of its use and instruct parents accordingly.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4006613514"><span class="h3">Monitoring growth</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>NICU graduates are at risk for inadequate growth due to their increased caloric and nutrient requirements.</p><p>After discharge from the hospital, patients require frequent monitoring of their growth and overall nutritional intake. Greater weight gain before reaching term equivalent appears to be associated with improved neurodevelopmental outcome [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. If growth is inappropriate (inadequate or excessive), the infant's nutrition is evaluated, and corrective measures (eg, changes in the composition, volume, and caloric density of the feeds, and mode of feeding) are initiated as needed. In addition, evaluation for contributing conditions (eg, gastroesophageal reflux or feeding difficulties) may be performed. Even if growth is adequate from the last visit, it is important to inquire about frequency of feeding and the length of each feeding session at each visit. </p><p>For infants who are receiving supplemental nutrition and/or diuretic therapy, follow-up laboratory testing may be needed including hematocrit, reticulocyte count, electrolytes, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, and vitamin D levels. </p><p>Monitoring the growth and nutritional management of the preterm NICU graduate are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5003.html" rel="external">"Growth management in preterm infants", section on 'Monitoring of growth'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5003.html" rel="external">"Growth management in preterm infants", section on 'Interventions'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4961.html" rel="external">"Gastroesophageal reflux in premature infants"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5876.html" rel="external">"Gastroesophageal reflux in infants"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2864307582"><span class="h3">Feeding difficulties</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Feeding difficulties contribute to poor growth and are more common among children who were extremely preterm (EPT, gestational age [GA] ≤28 weeks) due to swallowing problems, oral motor dysfunction, hypersensitivity, delayed feeding skill development, and behavioral problems (oral aversion) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4976.html" rel="external">"Neonatal oral feeding difficulties due to sucking and swallowing disorders"</a>). A study that followed children into school age found that feeding problems continued to be present at six years of age [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. When difficulties are identified, prompt referral to a feeding specialist for direct oral motor feeding therapy can avoid growth failure and pathologic feeding practices.</p><p>Infants who are discharged home on tube feedings (nasogastric or via gastrostomy tube) are at risk for complications, including need for emergency department visits and rehospitalization. They require specialized support from an interdisciplinary team that includes gastrointestinal specialists, nutritionists, oral motor feeding specialists, and feeding behavioral specialists [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. Family support from other families who have experience with tube feedings and transitions from tube feeding is also a valuable resource. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15643.html" rel="external">"Overview of enteral nutrition in infants and children", section on 'Administration'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Immunizations</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3955801959"><span class="h3">Routine vaccinations and prophylaxis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Preterm infants are at increased risk for vaccine-preventable infections. Immunization in the preterm infant results in a protective antibody response [<a href="#rid11">11-19</a>].

In addition to other aspects of routine pediatric primary care, subsequent visits should include the following (see <a class="local">'Subsequent visits'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Monitoring growth</strong> – If growth is inappropriate (inadequate or excessive), the infant's feeding and intake should be evaluated and addressed as warranted (eg, modify the composition, volume, and/or caloric density of the feeds, or mode of feeding). In addition, an assessment for contributing conditions (eg, gastroesophageal reflux or feeding difficulties) may be appropriate. These issues are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a class="local">'Growth and nutrition'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5003.html" rel="external">"Growth management in preterm infants"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4976.html" rel="external">"Neonatal oral feeding difficulties due to sucking and swallowing disorders"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Immunizations and immunoprophylaxis</strong> – Medically stable preterm infants should receive full immunization based upon their chronological age consistent with the schedule and dose recommended for full-term infants, as summarized in the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82617" href="/d/graphic/82617.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) and discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2876.html" rel="external">"Standard immunizations for children and adolescents: Overview", section on 'Infants and children'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15389.html" rel="external">"Respiratory syncytial virus infection: Prevention in infants and children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">In preterm infants, the site for administering intramuscular vaccines is the anterolateral thigh. The length of the needle is based upon the muscle mass of the infant and may be less than the length normally used for term infants. (See <a class="local">'Administration'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Screening </strong>– Screening for hearing, vision, and neurodevelopmental disorders is necessary because of the high rate of abnormalities for the NICU graduate. These infants require additional routine follow-up screening for these potential problems even if screening was performed during the birth hospitalization. (See <a class="local">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Counseling regarding risk of SIDS</strong> – Preterm infants are at a greater risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) compared with term infants. It is essential to provide education and counseling to parents/caregivers about the importance of safe sleep practices, including infant sleeping in the supine position. Strategies to reduce the risk of SIDS are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6366.html" rel="external">"Sudden infant death syndrome: Risk factors and risk reduction strategies"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management of specific complications</strong> – Clinicians who care for NICU graduates should be familiar with common medical problems in this population. Coordination of care between multiple specialists, when needed, is important to ensuring optimal care. Common medical problems in this population include bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), apnea of prematurity, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and anemia of prematurity. Other complications are listed above. (See <a class="local">'Medical care of specific conditions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hospital readmissions</strong> – NICU graduates are at risk for hospital readmissions. The rate of rehospitalization increases with decreasing GA and with increasing number of significant neonatal morbidities (eg, BPD, neurologic impairment). (See <a class="local">'Hospital readmissions'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Fetus and Newborn.
