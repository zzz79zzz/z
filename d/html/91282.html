The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of concussion in children, the sideline evaluation of concussion, concussions and traumatic brain injury in adults, and postconcussion syndrome are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90569.html" rel="external">"Concussion in children and adolescents: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/85893.html" rel="external">"Sideline evaluation of concussion"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4828.html" rel="external">"Acute mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4830.html" rel="external">"Postconcussion syndrome"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2832459"><span class="h1">INITIAL APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some concussions are dramatic, resulting in loss of consciousness, convulsions, gross imbalance, or other obvious signs of injury [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. In such cases, clinicians should immediately immobilize the cervical spine, assess for emergency conditions and other coexisting injuries, and treat according to the principles of Advanced Trauma Life Support  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64241" href="/z/d/graphic/64241.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). This guidance assumes that the clinician has made a firm diagnosis of concussion and that serious injury has been excluded. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90569.html" rel="external">"Concussion in children and adolescents: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Evaluation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90569.html" rel="external">"Concussion in children and adolescents: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The management of concussions in children and adolescents is based upon observational studies in high school and college athletes, clinical experience, and consensus guidelines [<a href="#rid3">3-9</a>]. Although this topic focuses on sport-related concussions, the principles of management are the same for children and adolescents who sustain concussions from blunt head injury by other mechanisms: [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial management</strong> – After medical evaluation by a physician, the initial management of concussion focuses on avoidance of additional head injury through removal from competition (if applicable), restriction of physical activity, and relative neurocognitive rest. Cognitive and physical relative rest are the primary initial interventions for concussion [<a href="#rid5">5-12</a>]. The timing for return to school and return to exercise vary from patient to patient depending upon their individual clinical course. Some students who become asymptomatic quickly can return to school and noncontact, low-risk exercise immediately. (See <a class="local">'Physical rest and activity'</a> below and <a class="local">'Cognitive rest'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although small observational studies suggest that athletes suffering from concussions who engage in very high levels of cognitive and physical activity have longer recovery times than those who engaged in low to moderate levels of activity [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>], care should be taken to prevent physical deconditioning and social isolation in patients with atypical recovery and prolonged symptoms. Those same studies suggest that low levels of activity are <strong>not</strong> harmful and may in fact be helpful [<a href="#rid12">12-15</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Physical rest and activity'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anticipatory guidance</strong> – Anticipatory guidance with education of the patient and parents or legal guardians regarding concussion, including the signs and symptoms, effects on cognition, and typical duration of recovery is also an integral component of clinical management [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Because concussion may have no outward sign of injury, friends, teammates, teachers, coaches, and family members may not feel the diagnosis is legitimate and may pressure athletes into excessive physical and cognitive exertion. Education regarding concussion helps to mitigate this stress and to improve compliance with follow-up. As an example, in a multicenter observational study of 354 children (mean age 11 years) undergoing evaluation for concussion in pediatric emergency departments, provision of specific and detailed concussion discharge instructions significantly improved patient follow-up [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p>In preparation for optimal medical management, sports teams should have a written concussion protocol that details how the medical team will respond to a concussion as part of an Emergency Action Plan [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The plan should specify:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Steps involved in the acute field response to a suspected concussion.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sideline and in-office evaluations used.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Medical personnel responsible for decision-making including referral for emergency department evaluation.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Team discharge instructions given to injured athletes not undergoing emergency evaluation and their families/legal guardians or roommates when they leave the event.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2832471"><span class="h2">Prevent additional injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Expert consensus indicates that any child or adolescent with a suspected sport-related concussion should be removed from further competition that day [<a href="#rid5">5,7,9</a>]. The athlete should undergo additional evaluation with a licensed practitioner to determine if a concussion has occurred. If a concussion is diagnosed, the athlete should <strong>not</strong> return to play until a full recovery has occurred. (See <a class="local">'Return to play (RTP)'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to removal from organized athletic activities, children and adolescents recovering from concussions should also avoid any recreational activities that may result in a second head injury (eg, cycling, skateboarding, ice skating, or skiing) until they are cleared for competition.</p><p>During recovery, athletes suffering from concussions may be particularly vulnerable to worsening symptoms, additional concussions, or potential catastrophic outcomes, such as second impact syndrome if repeated injury occurs. Animal models and observational studies in humans suggest that these additional injuries may occur even with relatively low energy collisions [<a href="#rid18">18-24</a>].</p><p>Similarly, patients with concussions caused by other mechanisms should avoid all activities that would place them at risk for additional blunt head trauma during their recovery.</p><p>This window of increased brain vulnerability and danger of potentially catastrophic head injury has also been suggested by observational human studies and animal models [<a href="#rid19">19-22,25,26</a>]. As an example, in a case series of 94 incidents of severe head injury while playing American football, 42 percent of athletes had sustained a previous head injury during the same season and almost 40 percent were playing with residual neurologic symptoms at the time of severe head injury [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. The incidence of injury was significantly higher among high school athletes when compared with college athletes (risk ratio 3.3) possibly due to more high school athletes playing with residual injury; 9 percent of included athletes died. In an observational study of traumatic brain and spinal cord fatalities in high school and college American football players over 10 years, 4 of 22 high school players who died had a history of concussion within the previous four weeks and second impact syndrome was the cause of death in 3 of these 4 patients [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Thus, although rare, serious head injury and death may be associated with continued competition too soon after mild head injury.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2832477"><span class="h2">Physical rest and activity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For children and adolescents with concussions, we recommend a brief period of physical rest lasting 24 to 48 hours followed by a gradual and progressive return to noncontact, supervised, aerobic activity individualized to avoid symptom exacerbation until full recovery, rather than strict physical rest [<a href="#rid9">9,28,29</a>]. If symptoms are worsened by light physical activity, then further activity should be deferred and retried the next day until it can be initiated without worsening of symptoms. Early limited aerobic exercise has been associated with more rapid recovery from concussion [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. These low levels of exercise are safe and put the athletes in a proactive position, prevent deconditioning, and support the message that school can be attempted.</p><p>One way to initiate this activity is to have the child exercising at low levels (stretching and walking limited to "nose-breathing" level of exertion) as soon as they can physically tolerate it, typically after one to two days of rest. From this point, athletes can be advanced gradually as tolerated to more vigorous aerobic activity, to resistance training, to noncontact sport-specific activity according to guidance for return to play. A more rapid return to vigorous exertion is likely to exacerbate symptoms and should be discouraged. (See <a class="local">'Return to play (RTP)'</a> below.)</p><p>While they are recovering from concussion, athletes should also be restricted from activities where they may sustain head injury (eg, contact sports, skiing, skating, or cycling). Incomplete recovery may make the athlete more vulnerable to worsening of symptoms or more catastrophic head injuries in the event of recurrent collisions (ie, second impact syndrome).</p><p>Evidence supports sub-symptom threshold physical activity during recovery to decrease concussion symptom scores and duration of symptoms [<a href="#rid15">15,28-35</a>]<em>. </em>For example, in a meta-analysis of seven randomized trials (269 patients, mostly children &lt;18 years), concussion symptoms resolved more quickly in individuals assigned to early return to sub-symptom aerobic activity or multimodal activity (aerobic activity plus visualization and coordination exercise) compared with no prescribed activity (standardized mean difference 0.39, 95% CI 0.15-0.63) [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. By contrast, strict physical rest beyond 48 hours has been demonstrated to exacerbate self-reported symptoms and should be avoided. For example, in a trial of almost 90 patients (11 to 22 years of age) with concussion, individuals who adhered to strict physical rest for five days had increased symptoms of concussion over 10 days compared with patients who were assigned to usual care (one to two days of rest followed by stepwise return to activity) [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2832483"><span class="h2">Cognitive rest</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The available evidence suggests that minimizing of cognitive activities that exacerbate symptoms in concussed patients followed by a gradual resumption of these activities with reassessment by a clinician with expertise in managing pediatric concussions is most likely to result in the shortest duration of symptoms and most timely return to full cognitive function [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p>Our approach to cognitive activity in children and adolescents with concussion is as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptoms worsened by cognitive effort</strong> – We suggest that patients who have sustained a concussion, are symptomatic, and have worsening of symptoms by activities such as reading, video games, or screen time minimize activities that make them feel worse, potentially including absence from school [<a href="#rid7">7,37</a>]. Social visits both in and out of the home and trips should be limited if they exacerbate symptoms. During this period of reasonable rest, the child may often engage in light cognitive activities such as watching television, family interaction, and limited amounts of homework without exacerbating symptoms [<a href="#rid37">37,38</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Follow-up with a pediatrician, sports medicine specialist, or other capable provider is needed to help guide the liberalization of cognitive activity. Patients can return to school as soon as they can tolerate 30 to 45 minutes of concentration. In our experience, concussed patients typically benefit from one to two days of reasonable rest before returning to school. To avoid the harm of prolonged absence from school, we usually return student athletes to school after a day or two of rest, with a maximum of five days of rest being rarely recommended.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Asymptomatic or low-level symptoms</strong> – We suggest that patients who are asymptomatic or have low-level symptoms not worsened by routine cognitive activities progress back to full cognitive exertion as tolerated by symptoms. In our experience, exposure to video games, loud music, prolonged screen time, or mental activities requiring high levels of focus and concentration (eg, taking standardized tests) are activities that frequently induce symptoms early in the course of recovery and may need to be avoided for a few days after injury. These patients may continue to attend school.</p><p></p><p>All children and adolescents returning to school after a concussion warrant monitoring of symptoms and academic accommodations (eg, rest break in the nurse's office or reduced class time  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91450" href="/z/d/graphic/91450.html" rel="external">table 2</a>)), as needed, if symptoms are exacerbated by schoolwork or the school environment [<a href="#rid28">28,37</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Return to learn'</a> below.)</p><p>Cognitive rest is designed to avoid overtaxing a functionally injured brain and to prevent metabolic overload [<a href="#rid7">7,37,38</a>]. The recommendation for cognitive rest after a concussion is based upon evidence that suggests a higher rate of prolonged and recurrent symptoms in patients with concussion who engage in higher levels of cognitive activity [<a href="#rid12">12,38-41</a>]. For example, in a randomized trial of 125 adolescents and young adults (mean age 17 years) with acute head trauma who were diagnosed with a concussion during an emergency department evaluation, individuals permitted to have screen time as tolerated on discharge had a longer time to recovery (defined as Post-Concussive Symptom Scale ≤3) compared with those assigned to abstain from screen time for 48 hours after injury (median 8 versus 3.5 days, respectively) [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. The median reported screen time was 630 minutes in patients with unrestricted screen time compared with 130 minutes in patients advised to abstain from screen time. Limitations of this study include a high loss to follow-up and use of self-report to measure screen time. It is important to note that this study only limited screen time during the first 48 hours after injury. Several observational studies in children, adolescents, and young adults have also found that high cognitive activity after a concussion is associated with prolonged recovery [<a href="#rid12">12,38,40</a>]. </p><p>On the other hand, the proper degree of cognitive rest and the optimal duration varies from patient to patient. Some experts have noted that prolonged rest with absence from school may be harmful in children and adolescents with concussions, especially in patients with lengthy recoveries [<a href="#rid36">36,42</a>]. Limited evidence also indicates a potential for worsening symptoms in patients with varying degrees of concussion, who are prescribed overly restrictive rest. As an example, in a trial of 99 patients aged 11 to 22 years who were diagnosed with a concussion after pediatric emergency department evaluation (36 percent with loss of consciousness), all subjects reduced physical activity and one group was assigned to strict cognitive rest for five days while the other was assigned to usual care (one to two days of rest followed by gradual return to full cognitive activities) [<a href="#rid31">31,36</a>]. Longer cognitive rest was associated with significantly more daily postconcussive symptoms during the 10 days of follow-up compared with usual care. Strict rest for five days was also associated with an increased duration of symptoms relative to usual care, which was not significant (median of seven versus four days respectively, p = 0.08). There was no clinically significant difference in neurocognitive and balance outcomes at 3 and 10 days after injury as measured by computerized neurocognitive testing or the balance error scoring system (BESS).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2832489"><span class="h2">Symptom management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pediatric patients may experience a variety of symptoms while recovering from concussions. In most instances, adherence to physical and cognitive rest followed by gradual resumption of activities will improve symptoms [<a href="#rid6">6,7,43</a>]. Although briefly prescribed medications for symptomatic treatment may be helpful, clinicians should avoid relying too heavily upon pharmaceutical therapies. Under no circumstance should medications be used to mask symptoms with the goal of permitting an athlete to compete. In addition, athletes should not return to play until they are symptom-free while off medications that are prescribed to treat concussion. (See <a class="local">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2832495"><span class="h3">Headache</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Headache is the most common symptom following a concussion (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90569.html" rel="external">"Concussion in children and adolescents: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Evaluation'</a>). Recurrent headaches are also an important marker for physical or cognitive overexertion during recovery. While <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13028" href="/z/d/drug information/13028.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13371" href="/z/d/drug information/13371.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a>) are reasonable adjuncts to reasonable physical and cognitive rest during the first few days after injury, they may be ineffective and rebound headaches can complicate treatment and recovery [<a href="#rid6">6,44-47</a>]. Therefore, their prolonged or frequent use beyond the first few days after injury should be discouraged. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3340.html" rel="external">"Medication overuse headache: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>Patients with a prior history of migraine headaches may develop a migraine that is triggered by a minor head injury. Initiation of abortive therapy is appropriate if the headache is typical of prior migraine episodes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6168.html" rel="external">"Acute treatment of migraine in children", section on 'Efficacy of specific drugs'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with prolonged headache, the clinician should ensure that there is not a cervicogenic component. Patients with cervicogenic headaches warrant referral for physical therapy and the headache should <strong>not</strong> be a justification for absence from school. However, these patients should <strong>not </strong>return to play until the headache resolves. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90569.html" rel="external">"Concussion in children and adolescents: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Primary headache'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2832501"><span class="h3">Nausea</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12659" href="/z/d/drug information/12659.html" rel="external">Ondansetron</a> is a reasonable therapy for nausea for the first one to two days after a concussion, especially if it is interfering with eating or drinking. However, ondansetron can cause headaches, drowsiness, and dizziness that may exacerbate other symptoms of concussion. Thus, caregivers should be instructed to stop ondansetron if it makes their child feel worse.</p><p>Phenothiazine antiemetics (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12602" href="/z/d/drug information/12602.html" rel="external">metoclopramide</a> or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12735" href="/z/d/drug information/12735.html" rel="external">promethazine</a>) should be <strong>avoided</strong> in children and adolescents due to the potential adverse effects of drowsiness, orthostatic hypotension, and in younger patients, acute dystonic reaction.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2832507"><span class="h3">Sleep disturbance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children and adolescents with concussion frequently have signs of sleep disturbance including daytime drowsiness, difficulty falling asleep, and difficulty staying asleep. Emphasis on proper sleep hygiene provides the best initial treatment for these patients  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52760 graphicRef120097" href="/z/d/graphic/52760.html" rel="external">table 3A-B</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6353.html" rel="external">"Behavioral sleep problems in children", section on 'Older children and adolescents'</a>.)</p><p>Sleep may also be difficult due to symptoms of headache or dizziness. Thus, control of these symptoms may improve sleep as well.</p><p>For most patients, sleep will improve with proper sleep hygiene. If pharmacotherapy is necessary because sleep disturbance is prolonging recovery and sleep hygiene has not resulted in improved sleep, then we typically prescribe a trial of melatonin (up to 3 mg in older children and 5 mg in adolescents) [<a href="#rid6">6,48</a>]. The lack of side effects or significant toxicity makes melatonin an attractive choice although efficacy in the setting of concussion is not established [<a href="#rid49">49</a>].

They must also sign a release of information for school personnel to be able to coordinate appropriate adjustments as recommended by the primary clinician managing the concussion. In general, participation in school-sponsored extra-curricular activities, including athletics, is typically <strong>not</strong> allowed until the athlete is fully back to school.</p><p>For athletes with prolonged symptoms lasting beyond three weeks, academic accommodations, as determined by the school system's regulations, polices, and practices, may be needed rather than adjustments [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. As opposed to academic adjustments, academic accommodations are designed to provide a specific individualized education plan for student instruction that will address specifically identified learning deficits based upon professional (eg, psychological or neuropsychological) testing. For most patients, referral to a specialist (eg, sports medicine specialist, neurologist, or neurosurgeon) with expertise in managing concussions is warranted for such patients. (See <a class="local">'Indications for subspecialty referral or consultation'</a> above.)</p><p>Accommodations are also intended to keep schoolwork at a manageable level and to permit full recovery. Given the quantitative deficits in cognitive function that occur with concussion, especially in executive function, processing speed, concentration, and memory [<a href="#rid63">63,76-78</a>], such academic support is frequently needed [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Students, the school academic team, and parents or legal guardians should work together to keep up with as much current work as tolerable while planning to make up missed work as efficiently as possible after recovery. For patients who suffer prolonged recoveries, plans to make up incomplete work may include assignments during scheduled school breaks or summer vacation [<a href="#rid6">6,46,75,79</a>].</p><p>For older children and adolescents with concussion, early return to school within one to two days after injury may also be associated with more rapid recovery.

This association was stronger for patients with a higher initial symptom burden and suggests a possible benefit for early school return among the patients with the most symptoms at diagnosis.

Each has advantages and disadvantages. Traditional neuropsychological testing is more thorough and can be tailored to meet the needs of each patient. Interpretation by a neuropsychologist permits the assessment of other potential factors that may be affecting test performance. Furthermore, assessment by a neuropsychologist has the added advantage of an additional clinical opinion.</p><p>However, pen-and-paper testing typically takes several hours. Also, many patients may not have access to a neuropsychologist. In addition, pen-and-paper testing is relatively costly and health insurance may not cover the cost of testing.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Concussion in Sport Group consensus statement, children and adolescents should remain at each stage of rehabilitation no less than 24 hours before advancing to the next level. Thus, a <strong>minimum</strong> of five days should pass before consideration of full return to competition [<a href="#rid5">5,9</a>]. Furthermore, some clinicians recommend building in an additional symptom-free waiting period and some jurisdictions have legislation requiring a minimum number of symptom-free days prior to returning to play. The clinician should be aware of any such laws or local recommendations.</p><p>If there is return of symptoms at any level, the athlete should rest until the symptoms resolve, and then attempt the protocol again beginning at the previous level of symptom-free exertion.</p><p>There may be advantage to allowing low-risk, non-contact aerobic activity prior to full symptom resolution, particularly in those athletes with prolonged symptoms. Such a decision should be made by those with expertise in the management of sport-related concussions.</p><p>Because of the concern for complications and permanent brain injury that are associated with overly aggressive return to play in children and adolescents, we have athletes younger than 13 years of age and those at higher risk (eg, longer duration of symptoms, higher numbers of previous concussions, or returning to higher risk sports) engage in a longer symptom-free waiting period before returning to play. For instance, a 12 year-old athlete recovering from a second lifetime concussion, with symptoms that took longer than four weeks to resolve should consider one week of success at each of the stages of exercise progression before returning to a high-risk sport, such as American football or ice hockey. Some clinicians have advocated a requirement of equal number of symptom-free weeks as there were symptomatic weeks during recovery before return to contact practice and play is considered.</p><p>Thus, the plan for RTP after a concussion should be individualized, gradual, and progressive. This progression permits the athlete to restore confidence, sharpen skills, and simulate sports-specific activity in a controlled setting before entering competitive play. The final decision for RTP should be made by a licensed clinical provider with experience in the evaluation and management of sports-related concussions. The prognosis for RTP cannot be easily predicted by the presenting features of a concussion.

In a follow-up to this study, once checking was permitted at the ages of 13 and 14 years for both Canadian provinces, concussion rates did not differ significantly between the groups, but players introduced to body checking for the first time at that age had a significantly higher risk of injuries resulting in seven days or more time loss from hockey compared with players who had at least two years of previous body checking experience (2.2 versus 1.5 injuries per 1000 player-hours) [<a href="#rid108">108</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Further investigation is needed to determine if the higher observed risk of other injuries can be mitigated by interventions such as on and off ice exercises designed to teach younger players how to absorb a body check without being injured during seasons when checking is not permitted.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Evidence is lacking concerning whether restrictions on tackling in American football can reduce concussions [<a href="#rid97">97</a>]. In a preliminary study that compared the incidence of injury between tackle football and flag football leagues, the incidence of severe injuries or concussions was <strong>not</strong> significantly different [<a href="#rid109">109</a>].

These findings suggest that mouth guards may prevent concussion in children and adolescents engaged in collision sports such as football, ice hockey, or rugby. Evidence is lacking on whether mouth guards prevent concussions in non-collision sports such as soccer, basketball, field hockey, or women's lacrosse. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fair play</strong> – Observational studies of youth and high school sports show that adherence to the rules of the sport and encouragement of fair play is associated with decreased injuries, including concussions [<a href="#rid87">87</a>]. For example, greater accelerations of the head and many concussions in sports occur during illegal play, when athletes do not anticipate the collision, or when athletes use improper technique [<a href="#rid111">111-113</a>]. Thus, proper coaching technique and adherence to the rules of play may reduce the overall incidence of concussion [<a href="#rid114">114,115</a>].</p><p></p><p>By contrast, existing evidence does <strong>not</strong> support the ability for helmets to prevent concussion [<a href="#rid87">87,97,116</a>]. Furthermore, injury risk rating systems provided by equipment manufacturers have not been shown to correlate with actual concussion risk. Although new devices are available that can noninvasively monitor the number and magnitude of head impacts, further study is needed to determine if this information can identify players that should be removed from competition [<a href="#rid87">87</a>].</p><p>However, the associated reduction of catastrophic brain injuries for athletes who wear helmets warrant their continued promotion. Similar evidence also supports the use of helmets when performing high risk activities outside of organized sports (eg, climbing, riding bicycles or motorcycles, or skiing) and the use of seat belts or appropriate car seats to protect children and adolescents during motor vehicle collisions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6556.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of dental injuries in children", section on 'Mouthguards'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2859.html" rel="external">"Bicycle injuries in children: Prevention", section on 'Bicycle helmets'</a>.)</p><p>In theory, strengthening of the muscles of the neck and posterior shoulders might reduce the risk of sports-related concussion by reducing acceleration during direct or indirect head trauma [<a href="#rid112">112,117-120</a>]. However, evidence is lacking on the benefit of this approach and recommending neck strengthening exercises may be counterproductive because young athletes may believe they are protected against concussion by doing these exercises and may engage in dangerous play.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2860610477"><span class="h2">Impact of legislation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Laws designed to encourage identification of concussion and to prevent concussed youth athletes from continuing play exist in all 50 of the United States. These laws, modeled after the Zackery Lystedt Law, which was named after a 13-year-old middle school boy who suffered permanent brain injury when he continued to play in a football game despite having a concussion and was enacted in Washington State in 2009, consist of three components:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mandatory removal of athletes with confirmed or suspected concussion from play</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clearance from a licensed health professional before athletes may return to play</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Annual education of coaches, parents/primary caregivers, and athletes on the signs and symptoms of concussion</p><p></p><p>Adoption of these laws has been associated with a decrease in the incidence of recurrent concussions among United States high school athletes [<a href="#rid121">121</a>]. Passage of this legislation has also been associated with increased reporting of new concussions from the prelaw through the post law period, likely attributable to increased awareness and identification of concussions.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2358772606"><span class="h1">ADDITIONAL RESOURCES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following resources provide additional educational materials related to concussion and mild traumatic brain injury in children and adolescents:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A sample form for physicians to use to provide guidance on academic accommodations is provided  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117214" href="/z/d/graphic/117214.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The Acute Concussion Evaluation (ACE) tool that is part of these educational materials has been adapted for use in the emergency department as described in the following reference [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Pediatric Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Guideline, provider tools, and patient and family resources are available <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Ftraumaticbraininjury%2FPediatricmTBIGuideline.html&amp;token=yqeg18pvmMDpcrnqq90jrfMdryPoLKQVdRNjWjCHK%2Fzbt7bhXCbsMNon1A%2FlDMZ6FPRphFCUef4isvYDtIVCKmehwpRZ0MikcBbFtYpNd%2FU%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=91282" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1155262648"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Patients with concussions, regardless of mechanism, should also avoid any recreational activities that may result in a second head injury (eg, cycling, skateboarding, ice skating, or skiing) until they have fully recovered. (See <a class="local">'Prevent additional injury'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/85893.html" rel="external">"Sideline evaluation of concussion"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Physical rest</strong> – For children and adolescents with concussions, we recommend a brief period of physical rest lasting 24 to 48 hours followed by a gradual and progressive return to noncontact, supervised, aerobic activity individualized to avoid symptom exacerbation until full recovery, rather than strict physical rest (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a class="local">'Physical rest and activity'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Cognitive rest</strong> – For children and adolescents with a concussion whose symptoms are made worse by activities such as reading, video games, or screen time, we suggest reasonable rest consisting of light cognitive activities such as watching television, family interaction, and limited amounts of homework that do not exacerbate symptoms with gradual progression as tolerated (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Social visits both in and out of the home and trips should be allowed as tolerated. (See <a class="local">'Cognitive rest'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">In symptomatic patients, close follow-up with a pediatrician, sports medicine specialist, or other capable provider is needed to help guide the liberalization of mental activity. Patients can return to school as soon as they can tolerate 30 to 45 minutes of concentration (typically one to two days after injury). To avoid the harm of prolonged absence from school, we usually return student athletes to school as soon as it is tolerated. For athletes who report intolerance to school for more than a few days, we explore other potential etiologies contributing to their symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Cognitive rest'</a> above and <a class="local">'Return to learn'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">For patients who are asymptomatic or have low-level symptoms <strong>not</strong> worsened by routine cognitive activities, we suggest progressing back to full cognitive exertion as tolerated by symptoms (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). In our experience, exposure to video games, loud music, prolonged screen time, or mental activities requiring high levels of focus and concentration (eg, taking standardized tests) are activities that frequently induce symptoms and need to be curtailed for a few days after injury. These patients may continue to attend school. (See <a class="local">'Cognitive rest'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Return to school</strong> – All children and adolescents returning to school after a concussion warrant monitoring of symptoms and academic adjustments (eg, rest break in the nurse's office or reduced class time  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91450" href="/z/d/graphic/91450.html" rel="external">table 2</a>)), as needed, if symptoms are exacerbated by schoolwork or the school environment. (See <a class="local">'Return to learn'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptom management</strong> – Children and adolescents may experience a variety of symptoms while recovering from concussion. In most instances, adherence to reasonable physical and cognitive rest will improve symptoms. Although briefly prescribed medications for symptomatic treatment (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13028" href="/z/d/drug information/13028.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13371" href="/z/d/drug information/13371.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a> for headache) may be helpful, clinicians should avoid prolonged use of pharmaceutical therapies. Under no circumstance, should medications be used to mask symptoms with the goal of permitting an athlete to compete. (See <a class="local">'Symptom management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Return to play</strong> – For all athletes with a confirmed concussion, we suggest the consensus graduated return to play (RTP) protocol  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61318" href="/z/d/graphic/61318.html" rel="external">table 5</a>) after an individualized period of cognitive and physical rest before clearance for competition (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). The following are requirements for children and adolescents to begin the RTP protocol (see <a class="local">'Return to play (RTP)'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Successful return to school.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Symptom-free and off any medications prescribed to treat the concussion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Normal neurologic examination.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Back at baseline balance and cognitive performance measures. If baseline assessments are unavailable, the clinician may use age-adjusted normative data to inform the decision, along with other clinical parameters.

(See <a class="local">'Neuropsychological testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Worsening or persistent symptoms</strong> – Worsening of the patient's symptoms despite appropriately following a regimen of physical and cognitive rest should prompt the clinician to evaluate for other potential diagnoses and, if serious intracranial injury cannot be excluded, neuroimaging. (See <a class="local">'Worsening symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with the following findings warrant referral to a physician with specific expertise in managing pediatric concussion (eg, sports medicine specialist, physiatrist or neurologist) (see <a class="local">'Indications for subspecialty referral or consultation'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Prolonged symptoms of concussion (eg, persistent symptoms 21 days or longer after injury).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients with multiple concussions occurring with progressively less force and/or associated with more intense symptoms or greater cognitive dysfunction.
