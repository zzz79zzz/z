Although there is interest in screening for CHD, questions persist regarding the appropriateness, cost-effectiveness, and optimal approach to such screening.</p><p>Screening for CHD should be distinguished from estimation of risk for CHD. By definition, both are performed in asymptomatic persons, and both aim to improve outcomes with interventions, if indicated. However, screening for CHD identifies existing disease rather the likelihood of future events related to CHD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1546.html" rel="external">"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention in adults: Our approach"</a>.)</p><p>The issues surrounding screening for CHD will be reviewed here, with particular emphasis on the effectiveness of available screening methodologies. Screening for CHD in patients with diabetes, generally a higher-risk population, is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1551.html" rel="external">"Screening for coronary heart disease in patients with diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">RATIONALE FOR SCREENING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Advanced obstructive coronary heart disease (CHD) can exist with minimal or no symptoms, with manifestations that can progress suddenly and/or rapidly. The first clinical manifestations of CHD (eg, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or sudden cardiac death) are often associated with significant morbidity and/or mortality [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The rationale for screening and subsequent detection of CHD during the subclinical stages of disease is the hope that appropriate treatment (medical therapy or coronary revascularization) may improve prognosis [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Screening may be appropriate for persons in certain high-risk occupations (eg, pilots, bus drivers) where an acute cardiac event could endanger large numbers of people, or for individuals with higher perceived risk of CHD who are beginning an exercise program. However, although screening can identify patients with CHD at increased risk, there is a paucity of evidence that such screening actually improves outcomes. (See <a class="local">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H349915818"><span class="h2">Bayesian considerations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Understanding the theory of conditional probability (Bayes' theorem) as applied to medical decision-making is useful in understanding the utility of screening tests for CHD [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Diagnostic test performance is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2759.html" rel="external">"Glossary of common biostatistical and epidemiological terms", section on 'Measures of diagnostic test performance'</a>.)</p><p>The pretest likelihood of CHD in a population influences the posttest risk of having CHD. A positive result is likely to be a true positive result (ie, a low false-positive rate) in a population with a high pretest risk for CHD, while a negative test is likely to be falsely negative  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50189" href="/d/graphic/50189.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Conversely, in a population with a low pretest risk for CHD, a positive test is only weakly correlated with the presence of CHD (ie, a high false-positive rate), while a negative test is highly predictive of the absence of CHD. Thus, when performing a screening test, the result (positive versus negative) has the greatest impact to differentiate high versus low posttest probability of disease in a population with an intermediate pretest probability of disease.</p><p>In the case of CHD, as in other diseases, testing in low-risk subjects can add to the costs of care without significant benefit, as positive screening results can lead to unnecessary tests and procedures. Conversely, in persons with a high estimated CHD risk, testing should be approached keeping in mind the higher likelihood of false negatives.</p><p>The pretest probability of CHD has, for decades, been based on patient age, sex, and typicality of anginal symptoms, as validated using invasive coronary angiography [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. However, since subsequent studies have found symptom-based pretest probabilities to be overestimated, especially in patients with symptoms of atypical angina, a clinician-patient discussion for shared decision-making is warranted before ordering a screening study [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H99485079"><span class="h1">OUR APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>By definition, screening for a medical condition takes place in asymptomatic persons without a history of the disease in question. Therefore, our approach to screening starts with determining coronary heart disease (CHD) disease status (see <a class="local">'Bayesian considerations'</a> above). All patients aged 20 years or older without established cardiovascular disease (CVD) should undergo periodic cardiovascular risk assessment every three to five years. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1546.html" rel="external">"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention in adults: Our approach", section on 'Our approach to ASCVD risk assessment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H99485408"><span class="h2">History and physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We do not perform screening tests to evaluate for CHD on the basis of cardiovascular risk factors alone. Estimation of cardiovascular risk requires both a history identifying risk factors and a formal or informal risk score calculation. Our approach to estimation and mitigation of cardiovascular risk in an asymptomatic patient is presented in detail separately.<em> </em>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1546.html" rel="external">"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention in adults: Our approach"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>History</strong> – Questions should focus on detection of angina or angina equivalent symptoms as well as an assessment of lifestyle factors, including the level of physical activity and overall fitness, dietary choices, smoking, intake of alcohol, use of illicit drugs, emotional stress, and quality of sleep, all of which impact cardiovascular risk.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A family history of premature atherosclerotic disease or sudden cardiac death is often associated with an increased risk of CHD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1506.html" rel="external">"Overview of established risk factors for cardiovascular disease", section on 'Family history'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk score calculation</strong> – A variety of cardiovascular risk scores have been developed and validated in different populations, with no single risk score being optimal for every patient.

In these populations, the decision to screen may be driven by a need to satisfy regulatory or other requirements rather than by traditional medical decision-making.</p><p>Screening for CHD in asymptomatic patients with diabetes mellitus, generally a population at higher risk of CVD, is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1551.html" rel="external">"Screening for coronary heart disease in patients with diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H691501489"><span class="h3">Pre-participation testing for athletes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pre-participation evaluation of asymptomatic patients differs slightly depending on whether the goal of the athlete is recreation or competition:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Recreational athletes</strong> – For asymptomatic patients who have been fairly sedentary and who plan to begin a recreational exercise program, no pre-participation testing is mandatory prior to beginning an exercise program [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>]. Some patients, however, may request reassurance that they will be able to actively exercise; in such cases, medical clearance is appropriate, with exercise testing being at the discretion of the provider per the American College of Sports Medicine [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/107636.html" rel="external">"Exercise for adults: Terminology, patient assessment, and medical clearance", section on 'Medical assessment and clearance for exercise'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Screening in this population is of limited value as both the prevalence of CHD and the sensitivity of testing is low. For example, only 2 percent of 3617 asymptomatic, hypercholesterolemic men who underwent exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) testing at baseline prior to an exercise program experienced an activity-related acute cardiac event during follow-up (average of 7.4 years) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Although the risk of a cardiac event was increased 2.6-fold in patients with clinically silent, exercised-induced ST-segment changes during submaximal exercise treadmill test (ETT) at study entry, only 11 of the 62 men who experienced an activity-related event had a positive ETT at entry (sensitivity 18 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Competitive athletes</strong> – Professional societies in both North America and Europe have published recommendations for pre-participation screening for young competitive athletes (those younger than 35 years of age). A full discussion of screening prior to participation in competitive athletics is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/960.html" rel="external">"Screening to prevent sudden cardiac death in competitive athletes"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H893234517"><span class="h3">Public safety occupations, high-risk occupations, and high-risk avocations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some asymptomatic patients who have an occupation associated with public safety (eg, airline pilots, bus drivers, truck drivers) or a high-risk occupation or avocation (eg, scuba divers) are required by regulatory agencies or governing bodies to have routine testing as part of a periodic health assessment. In such patients, our experts typically proceed with the requested testing. In the absence of any mandated testing, our experts do not perform regular screening or routine pre-participation testing in these otherwise asymptomatic patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1283380497"><span class="h3">Other patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Outside of the specific situations mentioned above, CHD screening tests are generally not recommended for asymptomatic patients, and cardiac stress testing should not be part of a routine annual physical or health screening examination. However, there are other patients in whom we perform stress testing: patients who need reassurance that it is safe for them to be active, in which a stress test can help providers delineate an activity program with specific levels of exercise to achieve; and patients who have an occupation in which high levels of exertion may be routinely required (eg, farmer).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2323999805"><span class="h2">Persons in whom screening to detect CHD is not indicated</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Screening does not apply to individuals with established CVD or CVD risk equivalents. Such patients should be treated with appropriate secondary prevention measures. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1505.html" rel="external">"Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease (secondary prevention) or at very high risk"</a>.)</p><p>Screening does not apply to patients with symptoms suggestive of CHD. Such patients should be evaluated for CHD or with appropriate diagnostic testing. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6832.html" rel="external">"Outpatient evaluation of the adult with chest pain"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1534.html" rel="external">"Stress testing for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary heart disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4086707947"><span class="h1">SCREENING TESTS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1880659352"><span class="h2">Choice of test</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The choice of screening test depends on the patient and the circumstances in which the test is being ordered. In general, if a patient can exercise, it is best to have them exercise rather than to perform a pharmacologic stress test.</p><p>It is best to begin with a physiologic assessment using an exercise stress test in patients who are able to exercise to an anticipated workload of 5 Mets and have an interpretable ECG. In particular, persons who require screening because they wish to begin an exercise program should be screened with an exercise stress test. This will also allow the clinician to outline specific exercise level goals based on their test. In addition, an exercise test is the most appropriate and useful test for persons who require screening and who are at high risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). In symptomatic individuals, an exercise stress test is favored for baseline assessment because a negative test generally avoids any downstream testing.</p><p>In asymptomatic individuals at intermediate or high risk who are able to exercise, an exercise stress test is also the first preferred test. For patients who develop a positive stress test at a low workload or &gt;20 percent of the myocardium showing ischemia, invasive coronary angiography is indicated. A positive test at higher workloads may warrant treatment or further workup with additional imaging modalities, and CT angiography would be favored given the advantage of anatomic coronary assessment. However, in those with a higher baseline risk, CT angiography would provide the advantage of an anatomic assessment to help assess extent of underlying disease and deciding next steps in invasive testing.</p><p>The anticipated quality of the study in the particular patient should be considered. In patients with anatomical issues such as obesity, quality radionuclide perfusion or echocardiographic images may be difficult to obtain; in patients of advanced age with high incidence of coronary calcium, CT angiography may not be the best option.</p><p>Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is most helpful in patients who require screening and who are at intermediate or borderline risk with the presence of risk-enhancing factors, such as a family history of very early coronary artery disease [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. However, CAC scoring should not be used in high-risk patients due to the likelihood of a false-negative test. For example, a negative scan can frequently occur in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, especially when young, and gives a false sense of the patient being low risk [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. High-risk patients with a negative computed tomography (CT) scan for CAC still have an event rate of 15 to 20 percent over the next few years [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. CAC scoring should be used judiciously in the young (&lt;50 years for females, &lt;40 years for males), because these patients may have a negative scan due to noncalcified plaque, and in older patients (&gt;70 years for females, &gt;60 years for a males), since calcium is frequently present in these age groups.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H349915867"><span class="h2">Exercise stress testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients who will undergo screening, exercise stress testing can indirectly identify the presence or absence of underlying obstructive CHD by assessing for myocardial ischemia [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Although exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) testing is a part of the diagnostic evaluation of patients with known or suspected CHD and provides prognostic information in patients with CHD, there is controversy regarding its use in screening asymptomatic individuals [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. While asymptomatic ischemia detected during exercise ECG testing has predicted increased risk of coronary events and cardiac death at later follow-up [<a href="#rid13">13-19</a>], there are concerns about the predictive value of exercise ECG testing and its relation to the prior probability of disease in the population being tested. (See <a class="local">'Bayesian considerations'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2769.html" rel="external">"Evaluating diagnostic tests", section on 'Disease prevalence'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Screening exercise ECG testing was performed in more than 10,000 subjects who participated in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) and the Lipid Research Clinic's Coronary Primary Prevention Trial (LRCPPT); asymptomatic ischemia detected during baseline treadmill exercise testing predicted an increased risk of coronary events and cardiac death at 7- to 10-year follow-up [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a study of 2994 asymptomatic women who underwent exercise ECG testing and were followed for 20 years, exercise-induced ST segment depression (≥1.0 mm) did not increase the risk of cardiovascular death (age-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.02) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. By contrast, women who were below the median for both exercise capacity and heart rate recovery, which were considered measures of fitness, had a 3.5-fold increased risk of cardiovascular death (95% CI, 1.57-7.86) compared with those above the median for both variables.</p><p></p><p>Stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging and stress echocardiography are alternative approaches to exercise ECG testing [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. These studies may be particularly useful in patients who are unable to exercise or have uninterpretable ECGs. However, they are expensive and their utility as screening tests has not been well studied. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5328.html" rel="external">"Overview of stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5310.html" rel="external">"Overview of stress echocardiography"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2460912514"><span class="h2">CAC score and CT angiography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Screening can also be performed with CT to obtain a CAC score or to perform noninvasive coronary CT angiography. In the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for cholesterol management (2018) and primary prevention (2019) for those adults at intermediate 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD; 7.5 to 20 percent) if statin therapy decision remains uncertain, a CAC score to screen for underlying CHD is considered reasonable to help with risk stratification [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. CAC scoring should not be used in high-risk patients, including those with familial hypercholesterolemia. (See <a class="local">'Choice of test'</a> above.)</p><p>CT angiography is useful in patients with an uninterpretable ECG and in those who cannot exercise [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].

Similarly, although gene expression testing has been shown to have a relatively high sensitivity and negative predictive value for CHD in symptomatic patients referred for stress testing, it has not been evaluated in asymptomatic patients as a screening tool [<a href="#rid22">22-25</a>].
