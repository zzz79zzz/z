Extended right hemicolectomy refers to extension of the distal resection margin to include the distal transverse colon up to the splenic flexure.</p><p>The techniques used to perform right and extended right colectomy are reviewed here. Left colectomy is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15008.html" rel="external">"Left colectomy: Open technique"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20137535"><span class="h1">COLON ANATOMY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The colon and rectum occupy the retroperitoneal and intraperitoneal spaces, in close approximation to solid organs  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60998" href="/z/d/graphic/60998.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The ascending and descending colon are retroperitoneal, while the transverse colon, which extends from the hepatic flexure to the splenic flexure, is intraperitoneal. The sigmoid colon continues from the descending colon, ending where the teniae converge to form the rectum.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20137558"><span class="h2">Arterial supply</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The right colic artery and the ileocolic artery provide the principal blood supply to the right colon  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73756" href="/z/d/graphic/73756.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). The marginal artery of Drummond and the arc of Riolan provide collateral blood vessels. Typically, the blood supply of the transverse colon is excellent provided the marginal artery is not damaged. Variability in the arterial anastomoses occurs, which is an important point when performing a segmental resection. Two sites of tenuous perfusion are the splenic flexure (Griffith's point) and distal descending colon (Sudeck's point). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2559.html" rel="external">"Overview of intestinal ischemia in adults", section on 'Intestinal vascular anatomy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20137593"><span class="h2">Venous and lymphatic drainage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The venous drainage of the right colon is through the superior mesenteric vein  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81960" href="/z/d/graphic/81960.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). The lymphatics drain via the corresponding arterial supply  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58219" href="/z/d/graphic/58219.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20139022"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS FOR COLON RESECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Malignant, premalignant, and benign diseases are indications for a right colectomy and include a right colon cancer (eg, cecum, ascending colon), appendiceal cancer, large adenomas, right-sided diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, ischemia/infarction, infection, trauma, and cecal volvulus. The indications for an extended right colectomy include a cancer located between the hepatic flexure and mid-transverse colon, synchronous ascending and transverse colon cancers, and multiple adenomas, which may or may not be part of a genetic syndrome. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15261.html" rel="external">"Overview of colon resection", section on 'Indications for colon resection'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H186829957"><span class="h1">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION AND PREPARATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>General issues regarding the medical preparation of patients, including antibiotic prophylaxis, bowel preparation, and other considerations prior to colon resection, are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15261.html" rel="external">"Overview of colon resection", section on 'Preoperative evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>It can be helpful to have a flexible colonoscope available in the operating room as it may be needed to identify a cancer or other mucosal lesion that cannot be palpated.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H452622"><span class="h1">ABDOMINAL EXPLORATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prior to proceeding with colon resection, the abdomen should be systematically explored. The anatomy of the colon and its blood supply should be verified, noting any anatomic variations or possibly any congenital anomalies (eg, malrotation).</p><p>For patients with abdominal trauma, the abdomen is packed and systematically examined, removing the packs in turn. Bleeding is controlled first, followed by control of gastrointestinal leakage. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15700.html" rel="external">"Traumatic gastrointestinal injury in the adult patient", section on 'Abdominal exploration'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with cancer, this evaluation includes an assessment of local, regional, and distant disease.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The abdomen is explored for evidence of anomalies and/or metastatic disease, including peritoneal implants, hepatic metastases, and distant nodal metastases.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The primary tumor is palpated to confirm its location. Local and regional resectability is determined by assessing tumor invasion into the abdominal wall, gallbladder, liver, stomach, vena cava, duodenum, pancreas, and/or superior mesenteric vessels. The entire colon is palpated to identify synchronous colonic lesions.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H186830016"><span class="h1">EXTENT OF RESECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The selection of the operative procedure (eg, right or extended right colectomy) is based upon the location of the lesion, malignant or benign indication, blood supply, and venous and lymphatic drainage of the colon. The blood supply, venous return, and lymphatic drainage of the colon are shown in the figures linked above and are critical in planning a colectomy. (See <a class="local">'Colon anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H115081012"><span class="h2">Right colectomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neoplastic lesions located in the appendix, cecum, and ascending colon and benign lesions (eg, cecal diverticulum, inflammatory bowel disease) limited to the right colon can be resected by a standard right colectomy. The resection extends from the distal ileum and can extend to the mid-transverse colon; this involves isolating and dividing the ileocolic, right colic, and either the right or hepatic branch of the middle colic artery and vein  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70995" href="/z/d/graphic/70995.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H115081019"><span class="h2">Right extended colectomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Malignant lesions located in the hepatic flexure or proximal to the mid-transverse colon and benign inflammatory conditions extending to the mid-transverse colon may be resected with an extended right colectomy  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51067" href="/z/d/graphic/51067.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). An extended right colectomy includes the resection of the distal transverse colon and sometimes the splenic flexure and involves ligating the ileocolic, right colic, and middle colic vessels. An anastomosis is avoided in areas of unreliable blood supply (eg, mid-ascending colon or splenic flexure). An option for the extended right colectomy for proximal to mid-transverse colon cancers is a transverse colectomy  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69341" href="/z/d/graphic/69341.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>). The caveat of this procedure is that the distal and proximal ends of the resected bowel need to be well mobilized and assessed carefully to ensure a tension-free and well-vascularized anastomosis; hence, the extended right colectomy may be preferred in these settings.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H115081026"><span class="h2">Mesenteric resection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The extent of the mesenteric resection also varies according to the indication for surgery. For example, when performing a colectomy for non-neoplastic disease, mesenteric vessels may be divided closer to the mesenteric border of the colon as it is unnecessary to resect draining lymph nodes  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98812" href="/z/d/graphic/98812.html" rel="external">figure 8</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98859" href="/z/d/graphic/98859.html" rel="external">figure 9</a>). However, for settings of severe mesenteric inflammation (eg, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease) and thickening of the mesentery near the bowel wall, a more radical mesenteric dissection may be warranted. When colectomies are performed for malignancy, the mesenteric vessels are ligated close to their root for optimal resection of lymphovascular tissue  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106973" href="/z/d/graphic/106973.html" rel="external">figure 10</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H115081033"><span class="h2">Omental resection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The omentum is dissected off the transverse colon  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75897" href="/z/d/graphic/75897.html" rel="external">figure 11</a>) or divided at the distal bowel resection margin and the proximal portion removed for ascending colon, hepatic flexure, and transverse colon cancers.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H451980"><span class="h1">MOBILIZING THE RIGHT COLON</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are two approaches to resecting the right colon; one begins laterally by mobilizing the colon and progresses medially, while the other begins medially by identifying the lymphovascular bundle and progresses laterally. The approach is at the discretion of the surgeon.</p><p>In the lateral-to-medial approach, the mesentery is thoroughly mobilized prior to vascular division. This allows for accurate identification of the root of the mesentery, the retroperitoneal duodenum, and the right ureter prior to dissection in the mesenteric root and division of the vessels. The medial-to-lateral technique has been used primarily in laparoscopic surgery where vascular ligation prior to mobilization is necessary in order to maintain necessary traction and exposure of the mesenteric structures; however, this approach is also easily applied in the open setting.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H186830023"><span class="h2">Lateral-to-medial approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The lateral-to-medial approach begins by mobilizing the right colon by first dividing the lateral attachments of the colon and developing the retromesenteric plane in a lateral-to-medial fashion. This approach is performed for both malignant and benign right colon diseases.</p><p>The general principles for performing a right or extended right colectomy, beginning with the mobilization of the colon, include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Retract the colon medially and divide the lateral peritoneal attachments of the cecum and ascending colon along the white line of Toldt. The peritoneum and the colon are gently separated from the loose areolar tissue by finger dissection  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70302" href="/z/d/graphic/70302.html" rel="external">figure 12</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoid injury to the duodenum, right ureter, and gonadal vessels. These structures should remain posterior and lateral to the right colon, underneath an intact retroperitoneal fascia  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54457" href="/z/d/graphic/54457.html" rel="external">figure 13</a>). Dissection is carried out between the posterior aspect of the right colon mesentery and Gerota's fascia, taking care to avoid excessive traction on the duodenum. Injury to the duodenum can occur during hepatic flexure mobilization. This usually results from excessive caudal and medial retraction of the colon during attempts to bring the superior aspect of the hepatic flexure into view or from overly aggressive blunt dissection of the retroperitoneal structures, including the duodenum, off the posterior aspect of the transverse colon mesentery  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57463" href="/z/d/graphic/57463.html" rel="external">figure 14</a>). Some degree of fusion may exist between Toldt's retroperitoneal fascia and the mesentery, making dissection precarious, particularly around Gerota's fascia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Divide the right renocolic ligament using electrocautery. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dissect distally along the colon until the gastrocolic ligament is encountered. The gastrocolic ligament is a portion of the greater omentum, extends from the greater curvature of the stomach to the transverse colon, and forms the anterior portion of the lesser sac (omental bursa). It is inferior and parallel to the stomach and is the left continuation of the transverse mesocolon  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75897" href="/z/d/graphic/75897.html" rel="external">figure 11</a>). Once the lesser sac is opened, the gastrocolic ligament is divided from left to right, completing mobilization of the hepatic flexure. The duodenum and head of the pancreas are now exposed  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85980" href="/z/d/graphic/85980.html" rel="external">figure 15</a>). Any remaining attachments between the right colon mesentery and anterolateral portion of the second and third part of the duodenum are divided.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Release the terminal ileum by dividing the fold of Treves on its antimesenteric border.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ligate the lymphovascular pedicle and resect the bowel.

One may doubly ligate the larger vessels with a nonabsorbable (ie, silk) or a slowly dissolving (ie, polyglycolic acid) suture. Single ligatures are used for small- to medium-size vessels  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73546" href="/z/d/graphic/73546.html" rel="external">figure 16</a>). Energy and stapling devices may also be used to ligate and divide appropriately sized vessels.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Resect the mesentery by sequentially clamping and tying or with the use of energy devices (eg, LigaSure, Enseal)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73546" href="/z/d/graphic/73546.html" rel="external">figure 16</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53575" href="/z/d/graphic/53575.html" rel="external">figure 17</a>). In cases of right colectomy for Crohn disease where the mesentery is thick and friable, we often find the clamp and tie technique superior. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H186830037"><span class="h1">ILEOCOLONIC ANASTOMOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Options for restoring bowel continuity include side-to-side, end-to-side, and end-to-end configurations, which are performed with stapling devices or hand-sewn. Stapling the anastomosis requires less time to perform and offers the potential for reduced fecal contamination. </p><p>Data regarding outcomes following stapled versus hand-sewn ileocolonic anastomosis are conflicting. In a Cochrane review of seven randomized trials that included 1125 patients, stapled anastomosis was associated with significantly fewer anastomotic leaks compared with handsewn (odds ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.24-0.95) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, a subsequent nationwide retrospective cohort study of 1414 right-sided colon cancer patients demonstrated a twofold increase in anastomotic leak after stapled versus handsewn ileocolic anastomosis [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Given these inconsistencies and the equivalence of the two approaches for most outcomes evaluated, we feel that the anastomotic technique should depend on the surgeon's preference, experience, and availability of equipment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86841.html" rel="external">"Bowel resection techniques", section on 'Type of anastomosis'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with Crohn disease, the risk of recurrence of disease is not influenced by the approach used for bowel anastomosis. A randomized trial of 139 patients with Crohn disease found no difference in symptomatic or endoscopic recurrence rates at 12 months for patients undergoing a stapled side-to-side ileocolic anastomosis compared with a hand-sewn end-to-end ileocolic anastomosis (22.7 versus 21.9 percent and 37.9 versus 42.5 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Small bowel resection for Crohn disease is different from ileocolic resection and is discussed in another topic.

Injury to these structures is avoided by dissecting anteromedial to them within the areolar plane along the white line of Toldt  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54457" href="/z/d/graphic/54457.html" rel="external">figure 13</a>). (See <a class="local">'Lateral-to-medial approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Injury to the duodenum – Injury to the duodenum can occur during hepatic flexure mobilization. This usually results from excessive caudal and medial retraction of the colon during attempts to bring the superior aspect of the hepatic flexure into view or from overly aggressive blunt dissection of the retroperitoneal structures, including the duodenum, off the posterior aspect of the transverse colon mesentery  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57463" href="/z/d/graphic/57463.html" rel="external">figure 14</a>). (See <a class="local">'Lateral-to-medial approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Venous bleeding – When ligating the middle colic vessels, the surgeon must avoid excessive upward traction as this may cause avulsion of a large collateral branch between the middle colic vein and inferior pancreaticoduodenal vein  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81960" href="/z/d/graphic/81960.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). The most effective method of obtaining hemostasis if bleeding occurs in this area is to hold pressure for a period to allow the anesthesia team time to prepare for significant blood loss. If pressure alone is insufficient, one may carefully place figure-of-eight sutures incorporating the point of injury. Attempting to clamp and tie the injured vessel can cause further avulsion and hemorrhage. (See <a class="local">'Medial-to-lateral approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inadvertent ligation of the superior mesenteric artery – The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) must not be mistaken for the right colic artery  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73756" href="/z/d/graphic/73756.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). The surgeon should lift the right and transverse colon in a cephalad direction and visualize and palpate the ileocolic vessels arising from the root of the mesentery, traversing to the terminal ileum and cecum. The superior mesenteric vessels are located medial to the ileocolic trunk. Ligation of the SMA will result in bowel infarction. (See <a class="local">'Medial-to-lateral approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Excessive tension on the anastomosis – Failure to divide a sufficient amount of the gastrocolic ligament distally can lead to suboptimal mobility of the transverse colon and, consequently, undue tension on the ileocolic anastomosis. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3842724995"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The resection extends from the distal ileum to a point between the distal ascending colon and the mid-transverse colon and involves isolating and dividing the ileocolic artery and possibly the right colic artery and either the right or hepatic branch of the middle colic artery and vein. (See <a class="local">'Extent of resection'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Extended right colectomy</strong> – Neoplastic lesions located in the hepatic flexure or in the proximal to mid-transverse colon and benign inflammatory conditions extending to the mid-transverse colon may be resected with an extended right colectomy<strong> </strong> (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51067" href="/z/d/graphic/51067.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). An extended right colectomy includes the resection of the distal transverse colon and sometimes the splenic flexure and involves ligating the ileocolic and middle colic vessels.

There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate superiority of stapled over hand-sewn anastomosis. In the setting of thickened bowel and inflammation, we suggest a hand-sewn rather than stapled anastomosis (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>).
