Empyema that develops from an adjacent pneumonia is a subclass of a complicated parapneumonic effusion. While a complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema represent a spectrum of infection within the pleural space, no pus is directly visualized in patients with a complicated parapneumonic effusion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A complex effusion refers to an effusion with internal loculations (septae).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A uniloculated effusion is one where the effusion is without internal septae (it is not necessarily free-flowing).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1478645894"><span class="h1">GENERAL APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The management of parapneumonic effusions and empyema generally includes prompt antibiotic initiation and drainage of infected pleural fluid.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For most patients with known or suspected parapneumonic effusions or empyema, we start empiric antibiotics immediately. Antibiotic selection varies based on the site of acquisition (ie, community versus hospital-acquired), severity of illness, local epidemiology, and patient risk factors for drug-resistant pathogens or infection with other specific organisms.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In general, empiric regimens should include antibiotics that target anaerobes and other likely pathogens (eg, streptococci if community-acquired; methicillin-resistant<em> Staphylococcus aureus</em> [MRSA] and<em> Pseudomonas</em> if hospital-acquired) when a complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema is suspected. Patients with known or suspected uncomplicated effusions can generally be treated similarly to other patients with CAP. (See <a class="local">'Antibiotic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with acute pneumonia and infected pleural effusions, antibiotics should not be delayed pending diagnostic testing or drainage of the effusion. However, an exception includes selected stable patients with indolent illness onset who lack signs or symptoms of systemic infection, it is reasonable to drain the effusion and send for microbiologic testing before starting antibiotic treatment. The spectrum of pathogens that cause subacute and chronic pleural effusions and empyema differs from acute empyema (eg, includes mycobacteria, fungi). Deferring antibiotic therapy until microbiologic testing has been obtained may enhance diagnostic yield and allow for targeted therapy.</p><p></p><p>The approach to drainage depends on the type, size, and complexity of the effusion.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with small uncomplicated parapneumonic effusions (ie, sterile effusions), drainage is generally not necessary unless the effusion is sizeable enough to impair respiratory function. Close clinical and radiographic monitoring should be performed to ensure that the effusion is resolving. Larger effusions have increased risk of complications  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef122293" href="/z/d/graphic/122293.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion (antibiotics alone)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with complicated parapneumonic effusions (ie, with clinical or laboratory evidence of infection) or empyema, drainage should be performed as soon as possible for source control  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef122291" href="/z/d/graphic/122291.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). This is particularly true for empyema, which carries a worse prognosis. Loculated effusions, large free-flowing effusions (eg, ≥0.5 hemithorax), and effusions with a thickened pleural membrane should also be drained. When the collection is free-flowing, a single tube or catheter thoracostomy is the procedure of choice. When the collection is loculated, the approach to drainage is individualized depending on the complexity of the effusion and the patient's severity of illness. A common approach is to place a single tube or catheter in the largest locule and reassess the need for placement of additional drains and/or surgical intervention based on clinical and radiographic response. (See <a class="local">'Complicated pleural effusion and empyema (antibiotics plus drainage)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Because a substantial proportion of patients require more than one procedure to achieve adequate evacuation of the effusion and lung reexpansion, the need for close clinical monitoring and serial imaging to assess treatment response cannot be overstated [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Assessment of response'</a> below and <a class="local">'Treatment failure'</a> below.)</p><p>Our approach is generally similar to that outlined by the American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS), the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS), the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), the British Thoracic Society (BTS), and the European respiratory Society/European Society of Thoracic Surgeons  [<a href="#rid2">2-6</a>]. However, the original categories outlined by the ACCP have largely fallen out of favor.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2515714005"><span class="h1">ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, antibiotic therapy mirrors that selected for the underlying pneumonia. However, attention should also be paid to the appropriate coverage of anaerobic bacteria and to choosing antibiotics that have good penetration into the pleural space.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3928366559"><span class="h2">Empiric therapy (agent choice)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most patients, empiric antibiotic therapy should be started as soon as the diagnosis of a parapneumonic effusion or empyema is known or suspected. While drainage of infected fluid within the pleural space is critical to care, antibiotic initiation should not be delayed while awaiting diagnostic procedures (eg, thoracentesis) or drainage. Exceptions can be made for selected stable patients with long-standing effusions since the pathogens that cause subacute and chronic empyema differ from those associated with acute pneumonia (eg, mycobacteria and fungi); in such situations, deferring antibiotic therapy until microbiologic testing has been obtained may enhance diagnostic yield and allow for targeted therapy.</p><p>Generally, empiric antibiotic regimens should include an antibiotic that targets anaerobic bacteria, which are common causes of complicated parapneumonic effusions and empyema. Additional antibiotics should be selected based on the site of acquisition (eg, community- versus hospital-acquired), mode of acquisition (eg, aspiration, trauma), and local epidemiology. While data suggest that influenza may precede pneumonias that develop pleural space infections, no data suggest that empiric treatment of influenza is indicated [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Nearly all antibiotics adequately penetrate the pleural space. Aminoglycosides (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8489" href="/z/d/drug information/8489.html" rel="external">gentamicin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8536" href="/z/d/drug information/8536.html" rel="external">amikacin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10000" href="/z/d/drug information/10000.html" rel="external">tobramycin</a>) are exceptions. Because their pleural penetration is poor and because they may be inactivated in acidic environments (eg, empyemas), we generally avoid them when alternatives are available [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>Initial antibiotic therapy should be given intravenously. Transition to oral therapy can be considered once the patient has demonstrated clear clinical improvement and adequate drainage has been achieved. There is no role for routine use of intrapleural antibiotics.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3633198001"><span class="h3">Community-acquired</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most community-acquired complicated parapneumonic effusions or empyema, we select an empiric IV antibiotic regimen that targets <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and the pathogens that colonize the oropharynx, including microaerophilic streptococci (eg, <em>S. anginosus, S. intermedius</em>) and anaerobic bacteria  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73450" href="/z/d/graphic/73450.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).

Although <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9275" href="/z/d/drug information/9275.html" rel="external">clindamycin</a> has been used historically for the treatment of anaerobic lung infections, resistance rates to clindamycin among anaerobes now consistently exceed 20 percent across treatment settings. For this reason, we no longer routinely use clindamycin for empiric treatment of anaerobic infections. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5520.html" rel="external">"Anaerobic bacterial infections", section on 'Antimicrobial resistance'</a>.)</p><p>Modifications to these regimens may be needed for severely-ill patients or for those with risk factors for specific pathogens. As examples, we may expand coverage to include methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) in patients with antecedent influenza infection or other MRSA risk factors  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118967" href="/z/d/graphic/118967.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). For patients with concurrent necrotizing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), we may include coverage for both MRSA and <em>Pseudomonas.</em></p><p>Local epidemiology should also be taken into account when selecting empiric antibiotics because the prevalence of pathogens that cause parapneumonic effusions vary with geography. Prominent examples include <em>Burkholderia pseudomallei </em>(cause of melioidosis) in Southeast Asia and tuberculosis in developing regions of the world. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3136.html" rel="external">"Melioidosis: Treatment and prevention"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8012.html" rel="external">"Tuberculous pleural effusion"</a>.)</p><p>In general, we do not include an agent that targets atypical pathogens (eg, <em>Legionella, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma </em>spp) in our empiric treatment regimens, as these pathogens rarely cause complicated parapneumonic effusions and empyema. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6702.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic evaluation of parapneumonic effusion and empyema in adults", section on 'Microbiology'</a>.)</p><p>Generally, patients with uncomplicated parapneumonic effusions can be treated similarly to other patients with CAP. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/117561.html" rel="external">"Overview of community-acquired pneumonia in adults", section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1432171701"><span class="h3">Hospital-acquired</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most hospital-acquired infections (eg, empyema secondary to health care-associated pneumonia or postprocedural empyema), we select an empiric IV antibiotic regimen that targets MRSA, gram-negative bacteria (including <em>Pseudomonas</em> spp), and anaerobic bacteria  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73450" href="/z/d/graphic/73450.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). For example, combining <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10037" href="/z/d/drug information/10037.html" rel="external">vancomycin</a> with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9646" href="/z/d/drug information/9646.html" rel="external">metronidazole</a> and an antipseudomonal cephalosporin (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9215" href="/z/d/drug information/9215.html" rel="external">cefepime</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9226" href="/z/d/drug information/9226.html" rel="external">ceftazidime</a>) is appropriate. Combining vancomycin with an anti-beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9777" href="/z/d/drug information/9777.html" rel="external">piperacillin-tazobactam</a>, ticarcillin-clavulanate [limited supply]) is an alternative. However, there is growing concern that the combination of vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam is nephrotoxic [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Thus, some clinicians use <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10283" href="/z/d/drug information/10283.html" rel="external">linezolid</a> in place of vancomycin when piperacillin-tazobactam is used.

In these circumstances, we select a regimen based on the likely source of infection (eg, health care-associated pneumonia, community acquired pneumonia, or aspiration) that also targets the isolated pathogen as well as any other anaerobic bacteria. Because anaerobic bacteria can be difficult to culture and are common causes of parapneumonic effusions and empyema, most experts include an antibiotic that targets anaerobes for the duration of therapy regardless of culture results.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1243673783"><span class="h2">Duration of therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The optimal duration of therapy is not known.

While we take radiographic response into account when determining the duration of therapy, complete radiographic resolution may take many weeks or months and residual pleural thickening can persist for longer periods. Thus, treating with the goal of complete radiographic resolution is not necessary.</p><p>The initial IV antibiotic regimen can be switched to an oral regimen with a similar treatment spectrum when clinical response is clear (eg, patient is afebrile, hemodynamically stable, clinically improving), no further drainage procedures are needed, and the patient is able to tolerate oral medications.</p><p>The duration of antifungal and antituberculous therapies for empyema is discussed separately.

Importantly, this recommendation applies to those in whom residual effusion remains following diagnostic thoracentesis. However, when an effusion is loculated, choosing to drain the largest locule (usually guided by ultrasound or chest computed tomography [CT]) is appropriate; in such situations, consideration should be given to the prompt insertion of a second or third drain during follow-up.

It is best suited for patients with free-flowing or uniloculated effusions (ie, effusion without internal septae), but is also frequently used to drain complex effusions (ie, effusions with internal septations or locules). Details of tube or catheter thoracostomy management that are specific to patients with parapneumonic effusion and empyema are discussed in this section. The technique of insertion, general management, and complications of tube thoracostomy are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7816.html" rel="external">"Thoracostomy tubes and catheters: Indications and tube selection in adults and children"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Image guidance</strong> – When draining infected pleural fluid, thoracostomy tubes are typically placed using either ultrasound or CT guidance. However, many experts place chest tubes blindly at the bedside, especially when the effusion is large or free-flowing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Size</strong> – There is no consensus on the size of chest tube or catheter for drainage and guidelines vary on their recommendations [<a href="#rid2">2-5,11</a>]. In general, we prefer small-bores tubes (10 to 14 French [Fr]) based upon data that suggest similar efficacy and less pain when compared with large-bore thoracostomy tubes [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. However, in practice the choice may be dependent upon factors including physician and patient preference, institutional policy, and available expertise. Some experts prefer larger bore tubes in patients with effusions that have multiple locules since larger tubes may penetrate locules more readily than smaller tubes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Traditionally, larger bore tubes (&gt;28 Fr) were preferred for drainage of more viscous empyema fluid and smaller bore tubes were reserved for less viscous fluid. However, in a prospective, nonrandomized study of 454 patients who underwent chest tube drainage for empyema as part of the Multi-center Intrapleural Streptokinase Trial (MIST1), no significant difference was found in mortality or need for thoracic surgery between large (15 to 20 Fr), medium (10 to 14 Fr), or small (&lt;10 Fr) bore tubes [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. Pain was markedly less with the smaller sized tubes. However, data suggest that smaller bore tubes (up to 14 Fr) may be more prone to blockage with viscus empyema fluid as well as with blood or fibrinous debris, with one study reporting that drain occlusion occurs more commonly in those with empyema (11 to 30 percent) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Given the propensity for small-bore catheters to become blocked, periodic flushing (eg, 30 mL of sterile <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> every six hours via a three-way valve) may help to maintain tube patency [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Large-bore chest tubes do not need to be flushed (unless blockage is suspected) and often do not have a three-way tap for frequent flushing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Suction</strong> – The application of suction is typical to assure maximal and consistent pleural fluid removal since pleural fluid output is the major determinant that suggests that any tube can be removed. However, suction is not necessary unless the pleural space fails to drain or an air leak is present. Once an air leak is excluded, the chest tube or catheter can be placed to water seal. In rare cases, some catheters empty directly into a drainage bag without the option of suction, similar to percutaneous catheters commonly used for abdominal abscess drainage.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Efficacy</strong> – Although some patients with complicated parapneumonic effusions may improve with antibiotics alone, the response is variable and drainage is not always successful. No controlled studies are available to guide selection of patients for drainage. All of the features that comprise a complicated effusion and empyema (loculations, large size, pleural fluid acidosis) are associated with an increased risk of progression and poor outcomes including the requirement for more than one procedure, eventual need for surgery, and longer hospitalization [<a href="#rid17">17-20</a>]. One meta-analysis of seven observational studies reported that pleural pH &lt;7.2 was the most useful predictor of a complicated clinical course [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. If pleural pH is not measured, a pleural fluid glucose value &lt;40 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L) and/or pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value &gt;1000 international units/L, or significant loculations also appear predictive of the need for tube thoracostomy. Thus, most experts agree that drainage is indicated in this population. Thoracic empyema (ie, pus in the pleural space) invariably requires drainage (akin to draining a pyogenic abscess for source control) because among those with an infected pleural space, patients with empyema have the highest mortality.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H80721672"><span class="h3">Assessment of response</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Immediately following drainage, patients typically undergo chest radiographic imaging for a rudimentary assessment of tube or catheter placement and response. Patients are then followed clinically (signs and symptoms, laboratory values, and drainage volume) for the next 24 to 48 hours.

Complete resolution of pleural thickening radiologically is not required as this may require months. The patient is typically discharged on antibiotics and evaluated as an outpatient with follow-up imaging (typically chest CT) in about two weeks. A small fraction of patients may be discharged with a temporary catheter in place for clearance of residual fluid, provided adequate follow-up in outpatient clinic is assured. Antibiotics should be discontinued once clinical and radiologic improvement is observed and it is assured that the effusion has not worsened or reaccumulated. Infectious disease experts are helpful in determining the point at which antibiotics can be stopped.

This approach is based upon the high success rate of tPA/DNase treatment which decreases the likelihood of intervention and shortens the duration of hospitalization. (See <a class="local">'Assess adequate antibiotic coverage and drainage'</a> below.)</p><p>Most experts consider sizeable residual loculations and poor lung reexpansion as evidence of treatment failure; others do not use these parameters as indicators of treatment failure but rather rely on clinical assessment only. The former approach is more aggressive and focused on a more rapid resolution of the complicated parapneumonic effusion, whereas the latter approach is based upon the rationale that many parapneumonic effusions should resolve over time with antibiotics alone.

The rationale for this approach is that this strategy reduces the need for surgery and shortens the duration of hospitalization. A repeat chest CT should be performed 24 hours following the completion of the chosen intervention(s) and early thoracic surgical consultation is also advisable.

In such cases, surgery is not urgently needed and preoperative assessment with pulmonary function testing can proceed on an elective basis.

The increasing use of fibrinolytics was reflected in a retrospective analysis of over 4000 patients undergoing an intervention for empyema, which reported that over half of patients underwent nonsurgical therapies (including antibiotics, thoracostomy tubes, and fibrinolytics); a quarter of these patients needed VATS and one-fifth needed open surgery, suggesting a 55 percent response rate to nonsurgical therapies [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator with DNase</strong> — The indications, dosing, follow-up, and efficacy of tPA/DNase are discussed in this section.

One study suggested that pleural thickening and the presence of an abscess/necrotizing pneumonia may help to predict failure [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. In theory, this strategy is probably best suited to patients with multiloculated effusions in whom septae are suspected to be early and amenable to breakdown. In contrast, it is less effective for those with significant organization (ie, stage 3 disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121162" href="/z/d/graphic/121162.html" rel="external">table 3</a>)) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6702.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic evaluation of parapneumonic effusion and empyema in adults", section on 'Stage 3 (chronic organization)'</a>). While a thickened pleural space may indicate significant organization, in reality, it can be difficult to determine how organized a parapneumonic effusion or empyema is by chest CT scan, or to determine whether locules are in communication with another; thus, many experts administer tPA/DNase empirically and decide whether surgery is needed depending on the response. Because there is often a diagnostic delay in recognition of a parapneumonic effusion, there are no data that define a time after which fibrinolytic/mucolytic therapy will not work.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Dosing</strong> – Although several agents and several doses of fibrinolytics have been used (urokinase, streptokinase, tPA), most institutions use a regimen that is similar to that described in the largest randomized trial that showed a reduction in the need for surgery when tPA was combined with DNase [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Both tPA (10 mg) and DNase (5 mg) are administered via the chest tube or catheter twice daily for three days [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. In the trial, tPA and DNase were administered separately and tubes were clamped for one hour after each agent had been given, although newer data suggest that the simultaneous administration of both agents may be as efficacious [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Retrospective series describe that regimens with lower doses of tPA may be as effective (eg, 5 mg tPA two times per day and 5 mg DNase two times per day, for 3 day)  and may be considered in patients at higher bleeding risk [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Once a course of tPA/DNase has been administered, it is not typically repeated, since this is thought to increase the risk of pleural bleeding.

In addition, blood in the pleural space perpetuates the lack of visceral and parietal pleural apposition and increases the risk for lung entrapment; it is, therefore, frequently an indication for evacuation by VATS. The incidence ranges from one to seven percent. The risk for pleural hemorrhage is highest in those who are already at risk of bleeding (eg, renal failure, thrombocytopenia, anticoagulation) [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Thus, one should be cautious administering fibrinolytics in those with a known coagulopathy. Hemothorax will be detected relatively quickly by seeing blood in the thoracostomy tube output. Any coagulopathy should be reversed, if feasible, and thoracic surgery should be consulted for a VATS evaluation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"> Fibrinolytics are quickly neutralized (usually within an hour) by plasminogen activator inhibitors that are increased during pleural infection [<a href="#rid29">29,31,32</a>].

DNase, by breaking down DNA (released from tissue and bacteria), reduces the viscosity of pleural fluid. In theory, these agents, when administered together, should improve the efficacy of pleural drainage by thoracostomy tube/catheters. Data show that when administered together [<a href="#rid24">24,25,35,36</a>], they are more efficacious than when fibrinolytics are administered alone [<a href="#rid37">37-43</a>]. These agents typically decrease the need for surgery (by approximately 30 to 80 percent) but a mortality benefit has not been proven.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Fibrinolytics plus DNase</strong> – One trial randomly assigned 210 patients with empyema to one of four intrapleural treatments: 10 mg intrapleural tPA twice daily for three days, 5 mg intrapleural DNase twice daily for three days, a combination of tPA and DNase twice daily for three days, or double placebo [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Combination tPA-DNase therapy resulted in a greater decrease in radiographic pleural opacity (-7.9 percent change in pleural opacity; 95% CI -13.4 to -2.4), an 83 percent reduction in the rate of surgical referral (odds ratio 0.17; 95% CI 0.03-0.87), and a shorter hospital stay (-6.7 days; 95% CI -12.0 to -1.9) compared with placebo. Neither of the individual agents performed better than placebo. Two episodes of pleural hemorrhage and one episode of hemoptysis were seen with combined tPA-DNase therapy, although the rate of adverse effects was not different across study groups. In preplanned subgroup analyses, there were no differences in the outcomes between those with purulent versus nonpurulent effusions, large- versus small-bore drainage tubes, or patients with evidence of loculations versus no loculations. On the basis of this study, most institutions use this protocol when administering tPA/DNase to patients with complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">A Cochrane meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials found a similar reduction in surgical intervention with the use of tPA-DNase compared with placebo (odds ratio [OR] 0.37; 95% CI 0.21-0.68) [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. There were fewer treatment failures (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.05 - 0.58) but no clear mortality benefit was identified (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.71-1.91). However, most of the trials were at high risk of bias, and the efficacy was diminished when only trials at low or unclear risk of bias were included in the analysis. Thus, per 1000 people, tPA-DNase may lead to 19 more deaths (36 fewer to 59 more), 115 fewer surgical interventions (150 to 55 fewer), and 214 fewer treatment failures (252 to 93 fewer).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Fibrinolytics alone</strong> – While early retrospective studies suggested benefit [<a href="#rid13">13,37-39,41,42</a>], newer data suggest mixed or no benefit when fibrinolytic agents are administered alone [<a href="#rid13">13,43</a>]. One randomized, double-blinded trial of 454 patients parapneumonic effusion or empyema showed no benefit from streptokinase in any category, including mortality, referral for surgery, imaging outcome, or hospital stay [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. A subsequent meta-analysis of seven trials that included 761 patients with parapneumonic effusion or empyema reported that compared with conservative therapy alone (tube thoracostomy), intrapleural fibrinolytics did not result in a mortality benefit (28 versus 33 percent; relative risk [RR] 1.08; 95% CI 0.69-1.68) but did reduce the need for surgical intervention (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.46-0.85) [<a href="#rid45">45</a>].

In the majority of cases, a second (and occasionally third) catheter is placed under image-guidance, typically chest CT. Occasionally, replacement of a small-bore catheter with a larger chest tube is performed by some experts, but the efficacy of this approach is unproven. Placement of additional drainage tubes is more likely to succeed if there is a small number of locules (eg, two to three, especially if large) or if it is known or suspected that one particular locule is infected. However, it is unlikely to work if patients have multiple small locules which are difficult to access and the location of infected locule(s) is along the mediastinal pleura or interlobar fissures. Lung abscesses should not be drained since these usually drain by the bronchial route with adequate antibiotics. Interventional radiologists should take care to not place drainage catheters through the lung parenchyma.

While some surgeons prefer to proceed directly with open thoracotomy in some cases (eg, patients with significant adhesions, greater visceral pleural thickness, or larger empyema cavity size), others prefer to start with VATS and convert intraoperatively to open thoracotomy [<a href="#rid52">52-54</a>]; for example, some patients in whom stage 2 disease is suspected (fibropurulent stage) who turn out to have components of stage 3 (chronic organization) may need an open procedure for complete decortication; conversion is also appropriate in those with intolerance of single lung ventilation, uncontrollable bleeding, or needing access to structures not amenable to VATS repair. Conversion rates of up to 44 percent have been reported (on average, conversion rates are approximately 10 percent) [<a href="#rid49">49,50,52-55</a>]. Conversion to thoracotomy was more common in patients with delayed referral (&gt;2 weeks) for VATS and those who had gram-negative bacteria causing empyema.

While several small series suggest that thoracoscopy is superior to intrapleural fibrinolysis [<a href="#rid58">58-62</a>], a meta-analysis of seven randomized trials reported that when compared with tube thoracostomy (with or without fibrinolytics), VATS did not result in a mortality benefit but did result in a reduced length of hospital stay [<a href="#rid57">57</a>].

The empyema can drain directly through the chest wall if a skin flap is pulled into the opening (an Eloesser flap) or can drain through a chest tube that is gradually advanced outward as the tract closes. This process takes approximately 60 to 90 days. Although this procedure is less invasive than decortication, the risks of general anesthesia and the morbidity of prolonged chest tube drainage remain. Some experts use multiple daily dressing changes or a wound vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) device instead of a chest tube to facilitate drainage of the empyema, although a wound VAC may worsen a bronchopleural fistula, if present, and should be avoided under those circumstances.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4275566697"><span class="h1">SPECIAL POPULATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2409794591"><span class="h2">Postsurgical empyema</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Empyema can complicate resective thoracic surgery (ie, lobectomy or pneumonectomy) and often occurs in association with a bronchopleural fistula.

Antibiotic therapy should be administered promptly and not delayed for sampling or drainage procedures. (See <a class="local">'Antibiotic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>General principles</strong> – Empiric antibiotic selection varies based upon the site of acquisition (ie, community- versus hospital-acquired), severity of illness, local epidemiology, and patient risk factors for drug-resistant pathogens or infection with other specific organisms. For complicated parapneumonic effusions and empyema, empiric regimens should generally include antibiotics that target anaerobes  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73450" href="/z/d/graphic/73450.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and other likely pathogens (eg, streptococci if community-acquired; methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> [MRSA] and <em>Pseudomonas</em> if hospital-acquired).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Community-acquired</strong> – For infections in the pleural space that are acquired in the community, we suggest use of a third-generation cephalosporin (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9229" href="/z/d/drug information/9229.html" rel="external">ceftriaxone</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9221" href="/z/d/drug information/9221.html" rel="external">cefotaxime</a> [3<sup>rd</sup>]) <strong>plus</strong> <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9646" href="/z/d/drug information/9646.html" rel="external">metronidazole</a> <strong>or</strong> single agent therapy with a beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8745" href="/z/d/drug information/8745.html" rel="external">ampicillin-sulbactam</a>) (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>).

For most patients, we suggest continuing antibiotic therapy until there is clinical and radiographic improvement. In general, for self-resolving parapneumonic effusions, therapy may last one to two weeks, while therapy for complicated parapneumonic effusions and empyema are often longer (eg, two to three weeks for a complicated parapneumonic effusion and four to six weeks for empyema).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Drainage</strong> – The following is a reasonable approach to drainage:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion</strong> – Patients with uncomplicated parapneumonic effusions (ie, typically small or moderate-sized, free-flowing effusion  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59099" href="/z/d/graphic/59099.html" rel="external">table 4</a>)), do not generally require drainage and are treated with antibiotics alone  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef122291" href="/z/d/graphic/122291.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef122293" href="/z/d/graphic/122293.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). This approach is based upon the rationale that most of these effusions do not have direct microorganism invasion of the pleural space and resolve with antibiotics alone. Should patients or the effusion not improve, repeat imaging with chest computed tomography (CT) should be performed to evaluate for the development of a complicated parapneumonic effusion that may need to undergo sampling and drainage. (See <a class="local">'Uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion (antibiotics alone)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Complicated parapneumonic effusion</strong> – For patients with a complicated parapneumonic effusion, we suggest prompt drainage of pleural fluid in addition to antibiotic therapy (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). A complicated parapneumonic effusion is one that has Gram stain, microbiologic or biochemical evidence of infection  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef122291" href="/z/d/graphic/122291.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). Although high quality data are lacking to guide selection of patients for drainage, such patients appear to be at risk for poorer outcomes including an increased requirement for more than one procedure, eventual need for surgery, and longer hospitalization. For patients with empyema, we recommend antibiotics and prompt drainage together with antibiotic treatment (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_3" rel="external">Grade 1C</a>), based upon the rationale that among those with parapneumonic effusion, those with empyema have the highest mortality. (See <a class="local">'Complicated pleural effusion and empyema (antibiotics plus drainage)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Tube type</strong> – The initial procedure of choice is a single tube or catheter thoracostomy. Image-guided placement of a catheter(s) may be needed when pleural loculations prevent adequate drainage by a single tube. During the next 24 to 48 hours, patients should be followed clinically (signs and symptoms, laboratory values, and drainage volume) and radiologically with chest CT to assess the response to drainage (degree of evacuation and reexpansion). (See <a class="local">'Initial drainage (tube or catheter thoracostomy)'</a> above and <a class="local">'Assessment of response'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Duration</strong> – For those who clinically improve and in whom imaging reveals significant improvement or resolution of the effusion with adequate reexpansion of the lung, and the drainage rate has fallen to below 50 to 100 mL/day for two to three days, the chest tube or catheter can be removed, antibiotics continued, and the patient can be followed up as an outpatient in two weeks with repeat imaging. (See <a class="local">'Discontinuing drainage'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Follow-up and reassessment</strong> – For patients who fail antibiotics and thoracostomy drainage from a well-placed chest tube (eg, the effusion persists or worsens, fever persists or new fever develops, persistent or worsening leukocytosis), attention should be paid to reassessing antibiotic coverage and need for additional drainage options. (See <a class="local">'Treatment failure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Ongoing or worsening infection</strong> – For patients with evidence of ongoing or worsening infection, options include reculturing pleural fluid directly from the pleural space or undrained locule (not from the tube or catheter) and adjustment of antibiotic coverage ensuring adequate anaerobic coverage or coverage of resistant organisms. Consideration should also be given to the presence of underlying necrotic lung as a focus of infection. (See <a class="local">'Assess adequate antibiotic coverage and drainage'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Additional drainage options</strong> – For patients who require additional drainage, options include nonsurgical approaches using intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator/deoxyribonuclease (tPA/DNase) and/or placement of an additional drainage tube(s) <strong>or</strong> surgery, typically video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Choosing among the options is often provider-specific, and recommendations vary among clinicians, institutions, and guideline committees. Factors that influence the decision include the clinician's specialty, expertise availability, patient values, patient prognosis from comorbidities, and candidacy for select surgical procedures as well as the number and size of locules and degree of pleural thickening on chest CT. (See <a class="local">'Choosing among drainage options'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>tPA plus DNase</strong> – As an initial strategy, we suggest intrapleural administration of a combination of tPA 10 mg and DNase 5 mg, twice daily for three days rather than surgery (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). The rationale for this approach is based upon data that report lower rates of referral for surgery (by 30 to 80 percent) when tPA/DNase are used. Drainage of residual locules is also appropriate, especially in those who fail tPA/DNase therapy. A repeat chest CT should be performed 24 to 48 hours after the chosen intervention(s) to evaluate the response. (See <a class="local">'Assess adequate antibiotic coverage and drainage'</a> above and <a class="local">'Intrapleural tPA +/- additional drainage'</a> above and <a class="local">'Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Failed tPA/DNase</strong> – Patients who fail tPA/DNase and/or additional drainage procedures should be evaluated for VATS. (See <a class="local">'Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Refractory patients</strong> – In patients refractory to nonsurgical therapy who are not candidates for or decline VATS, options are limited but may include persisting with conservative care (antibiotics and multiple drains) and in some cases, an open-window thoracostomy can be performed. (See <a class="local">'Refractory cases'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Special populations</strong> – Patients with an infected pleural space following resective thoracic surgery (ie, lobectomy or pneumonectomy) require special attention since infection is often associated with a bronchopleural fistula that may also require surgical or endoscopic closure. Patients with malignant pleural effusion and an indwelling catheter who have an infected pleural space should be treated conservatively with continued indwelling catheter drainage and a prolonged course of antibiotics. (See <a class="local">'Special populations'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1457.html" rel="external">"Sequelae and complications of pneumonectomy", section on 'Pleural space complications'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115897.html" rel="external">"Bronchopleural fistula in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complications</strong> – Apart from complications associated with medical and surgical treatments, long-term complications of infection in the pleural space include residual pleural thickening on chest CT and rarely, when untreated, fibrothorax and pleural calcification. The pleural changes usually resolve over three to six months, and patients should not be considered for decortication unless they fail to improve and are symptomatic after six months. Rare complications include bronchopleural fistula formation, empyema necessitans (rupture of the empyema through to the chest wall), and pleural lymphoma. (See <a class="local">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prognosis</strong> – The long-term survival of patients with parapneumonic effusion and empyema is good, provided therapy is adequate and prompt. Mortality is highest in those with empyema as well as in those who require open surgery or decortication. Death is highest during the first 400 days and is often due to comorbid conditions or surgical complications rather than due to the empyema itself.
