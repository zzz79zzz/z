The periprocedural complications related to PCI will be reviewed here. The complications of cardiac catheterization are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1470.html" rel="external">"Complications of diagnostic cardiac catheterization"</a>.)</p><p>In this discussion, PCI refers to any therapeutic procedure during which a wire or catheter is inserted into a coronary artery and luminal enlargement is attempted.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H266822817"><span class="h1">INCIDENCE AND CAUSES OF EARLY MORTALITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A 2013 report from the Cleveland (United States) Clinic's institutional PCI registry presented the incidence and causes of death within 30 days of 4078 PCIs performed between 2009 and 2011 [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There were 81 deaths (2 percent), of which 58 percent were cardiac and 42 percent noncardiac. There were 19 deaths after the initial hospital discharge.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Only 42 percent of the deaths were attributable to PCI-related complications. Of these, 73 percent were attributable to definite or probable stent thrombosis, 12 percent to bleeding, 9 percent to coronary dissection, and 6 percent to renal failure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Of the noncardiac causes of death, the most common were complications of infection or neurologic events.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PREDICTORS OF MORTALITY AND MAJOR COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Absence of on-site cardiac surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We and others believe it is reasonable to perform elective PCI at hospitals without on-site cardiac surgical services, as multiple studies have shown that outcomes are similar for stable patients undergoing PCI at hospitals with and without on-site cardiac surgical backup when measures of institutional and operator quality are evaluated  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68713" href="/z/d/graphic/68713.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80948" href="/z/d/graphic/80948.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61364" href="/z/d/graphic/61364.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The best evidence comes from a 2011 meta-analysis and two subsequent randomized trials:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 2011 meta-analysis of 11 studies that included over 900,000 patients found no increase in the average mortality rate (0.9 versus 0.8 percent, respectively; odds ratio [OR] 1.15, 95% CI 0.93-1.41) and no significant difference in the risk of emergency bypass surgery (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.52-2.85) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The noninferiority CPORT-E trial randomly assigned 18,867 patients with stable and unstable coronary disease in a 3:1 ratio to PCI at a hospital without or with on-site cardiac surgery [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Patients with ST-elevation MI, unprotected left main disease, or a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 20 percent were excluded. There was no difference in the rates of the two co-primary outcomes at hospitals without or with cardiac surgery: mortality at six weeks (0.9 versus 1.0 percent, respectively; difference, -0.04 percentage points, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.23) or major adverse cardiac events at nine months (12.1 versus 11.2 percent, respectively; difference, 0.92 percentage points, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.80). However, the incidence of target vessel revascularization was significantly higher at non-SOS sites.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The MASS COMM trial randomly assigned, in a 3:1 ratio, 3691 patients with indications for nonemergency PCI who presented at Massachusetts hospitals without on-site cardiac surgery to undergo PCI at that hospital or a hospital with cardiac surgery services [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. With regard to the co-primary composite end points of major adverse cardiac events (death, MI, repeat revascularization, or stroke) at 30 days (safety end point) and at 12 months (effectiveness end point), PCI procedures performed at hospitals without on-site cardiac surgery were noninferior (9.5 versus 9.4 percent; relative risk 1.00, 95% one-sided upper confidence limit, 1.22 and 17.3 versus 17.8 percent, relative risk 0.98, 95% one-sided upper confidence limit, 1.13).</p><p></p><p>The discussion of primary PCI at hospitals without on-site cardiac surgery is found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/72.html" rel="external">"Primary percutaneous coronary intervention in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Determinants of outcome", section on 'PCI without on-site cardiac surgery'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Short-term outcomes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A number of multivariable risk models have been developed to predict in-hospital mortality and major complications after PCI  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120337" href="/z/d/graphic/120337.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6-18</a>]. Such models have typically been validated only within the institution at which they were developed, and some were based upon patient populations treated with balloon angioplasty alone.</p><p>In one analysis, five of these multivariable mortality models were compared for their ability to predict in-hospital mortality in 4448 patients in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Dynamic Registry who underwent PCI from 1997 to 1999 [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. During the index hospitalization, 64 patients died (for an in-hospital mortality rate of 1.4 percent).</p><p>This outcome was closely approximated by three of the models: the New York state model [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>], the Northern New England model [<a href="#rid10">10</a>], and the Cleveland Clinic model [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Two other models were less accurate: the University of Michigan model, which predicted 47 deaths (1.1 percent) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>], and the American College of Cardiology Registry model, which predicted 603 deaths (13.5 percent) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>The Mayo Clinic developed a risk score to identify patients at increased risk for major complications after PCI [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The score, derived from patients who underwent PCI between 1996 and 1999 and then validated in 2000, is relevant to current clinical practice since it was performed after stenting became routine, the patients were usually treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/z/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9996" href="/z/d/drug information/9996.html" rel="external">ticlopidine</a>, and intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors were available [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>A predictive point score was based upon eight clinical and angiographic variables, including a number of high-risk parameters such as shock, heart failure, urgent or emergent PCI, and left main or multivessel disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54653" href="/z/d/graphic/54653.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). Major complications were defined as in-hospital mortality, ST-elevation MI, urgent or emergent CABG, and stroke. In the validation cohort, the observed complication rates were comparable to the expected rates for all risk levels. Since this risk model includes three angiographic variables, a low score derived from the five clinical variables would not permit exclusion of high risk prior to intervention.</p><p>A subsequent study from the Mayo Clinic, using data from over 9000 PCIs performed between 2000 and 2005, developed two risk-prediction models, one for mortality alone and one for all major adverse cardiovascular events [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The model consisted of seven baseline clinical and noninvasive variables: age, MI within the past 24 hours, preprocedural shock, serum creatinine, left ventricular ejection fraction, heart failure, and peripheral artery disease. The two models successfully predicted the risk of adverse events during the index hospitalization. Limitations of the study include performance at a single referral center in a lower-risk patient population.</p><p>The risk models discussed above were derived from cohorts that included a high percentage of patients with a recent MI [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Whether a preprocedural cardiac troponin (cTn) elevation in patients with stable coronary artery disease is a predictor of adverse postprocedural outcome was addressed using the EVENT registry of 7592 unselected patients undergoing PCI with stenting [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Of the 2382 stable EVENT patients, 142 (6 percent) were found to have baseline cTn above the upper limit of normal. Compared with patients with normal cTn, the following findings were noted at hospital discharge:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There was a significantly higher rate of in-hospital death or MI (13.4 versus 5.6 percent). This was attributable in large part to an increase in periprocedural MI.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In multivariable analyses, baseline cTn elevation was an independent predictor of in-hospital death or MI (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% CI 1.2 to 3.8).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There was a trend toward a higher rate of urgent repeat PCI (1.4 versus 0.2 percent)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">LONG-TERM MORTALITY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H956645174"><span class="h2">Mortality at one year</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Myocardial infarction (MI) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) predicts mortality at one year in patients who undergo PCI. A preprocedural elevation in cardiac troponin (cTn) also predicts adverse outcomes. In the EVENT registry discussed in the preceding section, a preprocedural elevation in cTn was associated with a twofold increase in the rate of death or MI at one year, including an increase in the rate of death from 0.4 to 2.4 percent [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1574.html" rel="external">"Periprocedural myonecrosis following percutaneous coronary intervention"</a>.)</p><p>The issue of whether either bleeding or urgent revascularization (both within 30 days) are also associated with late mortality was evaluated in an analysis of 5384 patients from four trials of patients referred for PCI [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Mortality at one year was 3.6 percent in all patients and was significantly higher in those with either bleeding or urgent revascularization at 30 days (14.1 versus 3.3 and 15.4 versus 3.6 percent, respectively). Both major and minor bleeding were associated with late mortality.</p><p>There is no definitive explanation for the association between bleeding and late mortality, but the analysis controlled for factors such as age, risk factors, left ventricular ejection fraction, creatinine level, and presence of multivessel coronary artery disease. The presence of other potential confounders that may be associated with a sicker population cannot be excluded.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H956645180"><span class="h2">Mortality at five years</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is a prevalent opinion, supported in part by evidence from randomized trials, that the primary cause of death in patients who undergo PCI is a complication of coronary heart disease [<a href="#rid20">20-22</a>]. However, a 2014 single center (Mayo Clinic, MN, United States) study found a temporal trend toward a higher frequency of noncardiac deaths [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Among 19,000 patients who underwent the procedure during three time periods (1991 to 1996, 1997 to 2002, and 2003 to 2008), the following findings were noted:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Overall mortality was 37 percent (4.48 per 100 person-years). The unadjusted rate of five-year mortality was slightly higher in the most recent era (17.0, 15.9, and 18.2 percent, respectively).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The incidence of cardiac death at five years fell across the three time periods (9.8, 7.4, and 6.6 percent, respectively), while the incidence of noncardiac death rose (7.1, 8.5, and 11.2 percent). Only 36.8 percent of deaths in the latter era were cardiac. The former was driven by a decline in fatal MI or sudden cardiac death, while the latter was associated with increased noncardiac comorbidities at baseline.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>After adjustment, there was a 50 percent temporal decline in cardiac mortality but no change in noncardiac mortality. </p><p></p><p>We agree with the authors’ interpretation that increased use of secondary preventive strategies is the principal explanation for the fall in long-term cardiac mortality. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1505.html" rel="external">"Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease (secondary prevention) or at very high risk"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h1">CORONARY ARTERY COMPLICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The use of larger guiding catheters and sheaths makes damage to the proximal coronary artery more likely compared with diagnostic coronary arteriography. In addition, the advancement of guidewires and catheters into diseased coronary arteries may lead to vessel injury. Complications include coronary artery dissection, intramural hematoma, coronary artery perforation, and occlusion of branch vessels. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Intramural hematoma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Coronary artery intramural hematoma is defined as an accumulation of blood within the medial space displacing the internal elastic membrane inward and the external elastic membrane outward, with or without identifiable entry and exit points. The following findings were noted in a study of 905 patients undergoing PCI [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>IVUS identified an intramural hematoma in 6.7 percent of procedures; the incidence was higher with angioplasty compared to stenting.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The location was proximal to the lesion in 36 percent, confined to the lesion in 18 percent, and distal to the lesion in 46 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>On angiography, the hematoma had the appearance of a dissection or a new lesion in 60 and 11 percent of cases; no significant abnormality was seen in 29 percent, in whom the diagnosis could only be made by IVUS.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with a hematoma had the same incidence of post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) non-ST-elevation MI as those without a hematoma (26 percent), but a higher incidence of repeat revascularization within one month (6.3 versus 2 percent). Patients undergoing PCI for spontaneous coronary dissection have a higher incidence of intramural hematoma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97665.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous coronary artery dissection", section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Perforation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Coronary artery perforation in the stent era is a rare but potentially catastrophic complication. In a series of over 10,000 PCIs (6836 with stenting) from 1993 to 2001, the risk of perforation was 0.84 percent [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Perforation occurred more often when an atheroablative device or IVUS was used. However, perforation can also occur during stent placement, particularly when the stent is oversized and high deployment or post-dilation pressures are used. Significant cardiac events occurred in 29 of 84 patients with a perforation (35 percent) and included MI in 15, repeat PCI in four, CABG in 11, and death in seven.</p><p>The degree of perforation varies from barely perceptible to severe and a classification scheme based upon angiographic appearance of the perforation has been proposed [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Class I – Intramural crater without extravasation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Class II – pericardial or myocardial blushing (staining)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Class III – perforation ≥1 mm in diameter with contrast streaming or cavity spilling</p><p></p><p>The incidence of complications varies with the severity of the perforation. For class I, II, and III lesions, the respective values were 0, 14, and 50 percent for MI and 8, 13, and 63 percent for tamponade.</p><p>Overall mortality with coronary perforation is about 5 to 10 percent, with the main risk factors being tamponade, requirement for emergency surgery, and the severity of the perforation [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>]. In the above report of 62 patients, for example, deaths occurred only in patients with class III perforations (19 percent mortality) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p>The use of newer hydrophilic guidewires in conjunction with aggressive antiplatelet therapy is anecdotally linked to an increased risk of distal wire perforation.</p><p>Serious perforations require immediate treatment within the cath lab. The first measure is inflation of either a PTCA balloon or perfusion balloon catheter at the site of perforation to stop the flow of blood into the pericardium (giving time for pericardiocentesis, hemodynamic stabilization, and preparation of subsequent therapies), and may also be sufficient to seal off small perforations following a 15-minute inflation. If the perforation has not sealed, and evidence of hemodynamic compromise is seen (eg, hypotension), emergency pericardiocentesis with placement of a pericardial drain should be performed. Reversal of anticoagulation should occur only after access to the pericardial space is secured as blood in the pericardium may clot, making pericardiocentesis difficult.</p><p>Significant distal perforations of small branches by guidewires can be managed by placement of embolization coils or other materials. This maneuver will result in total occlusion of that arterial segment and periprocedural MI.</p><p>The covered stent, produced by attaching a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane to one stent or sandwiching such a layer between two stents, may be the stent of choice for treating coronary artery perforation [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. One report evaluated 11 patients with a coronary rupture that was not treated successfully with prolonged balloon inflation [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Emergency insertion of a covered stent effectively sealed the perforation in all patients. Other patients who received a non-covered stent had a lower success rate and a higher incidence of tamponade and early surgery. During a 14-month follow-up, there were no major cardiac adverse events in the patients receiving a covered stent. </p><p>These stents are available for treatment of perforations that cannot be managed by more conservative measures. The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved the Graftmaster PTFE-covered stent and the Papyrus PTFE-covered stent under a Humanitarian Device Exemption for the treatment of coronary perforation. When bleeding from the perforation site continues, emergent coronary bypass may be required [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>].

In our experience, it is the most common cause of unexpected mortality after diagnostic or interventional cardiac catheterization. Retroperitoneal bleeding is frequently related to artery puncture that is above the inguinal ligament and can be prevented in most cases by careful attention to anatomic landmarks and fluoroscopy of the femoral head prior to needle puncture. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage can also occur with puncture sites below the inguinal ligament, as blood can track along the vascular fascial sheath into the retroperitoneum or rectus sheath. Even with appropriate access position, back wall punctures that exit above the inguinal ligament may result in retroperitoneal bleeding and may not be sealed by manual compression or closure devices. Injudicious advancement of the guidewire or sheath by an inexperienced operator can also traumatize the iliac artery or the lateral circumflex artery and result in bleeding into the retroperitoneal space.</p><p>The event is usually recognized by hemodynamic compromise.

For stable patients, the site for arterial access is individualized. We believe there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of the radial artery in all stable patients.</p><p>Catheterization using the radial, as opposed to the common femoral, artery has the potential to reduce the risk of major access site bleeding due to the fact that the former is smaller and readily compressible. Any intervention that reduces the risk of bleeding could potentially improve outcomes given the observations of increased mortality and ischemic events in patients who bleed at the time of PCI. This is particularly true for patients undergoing catheterization for an acute coronary syndrome. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1573.html" rel="external">"Periprocedural bleeding in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention", section on 'Outcomes after bleeding'</a>.)</p><p>The best evidence supporting better outcomes with radial catheterization comes from a 2016 meta-analysis of 24 trials (n = 22,843), including the four large, contemporary trials of acute coronary syndrome patients: RIVAL [<a href="#rid67">67</a>], MATRIX [<a href="#rid68">68</a>], RIFLE-STEACS [<a href="#rid69">69</a>], and STEMI RADIAL [<a href="#rid70">70,71</a>].

After publication of the meta-analysis, the one-year results of the MATRIX trial were published [<a href="#rid72">72</a>]. There was no difference between the radial and femoral access groups with regard to major adverse cardiovascular events but net adverse clinical events (a composite of non-coronary artery bypass graft-related major bleeding, or major adverse cardiovascular events) were fewer with radial access (15.2 versus 17.2 percent; rate ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.78-0.97).</p><p>There is some evidence that the risk of stroke is lower with a radial as opposed to a femoral artery approach. In a prospective database study of 17,966 patients with stable or unstable coronary artery disease who underwent PCI between 2008 and 2016, the risk of periprocedural stroke was 0.3 percent [<a href="#rid73">73</a>]. In a propensity score matching analysis (n = 8726), the risk was lower (odds ratio 0.33, 95% CI 0.16-0.71) with radial as opposed to transfemoral catheterization.</p><p>In patients for whom a radial artery approach may be used, we assess the palmar arch circulation prior to the procedure. The adequacy of the arch should be documented in the medical record. We also assess the patient for adequate hemostasis and circulation after the procedure and document the results. </p><p>For patients who undergo PCI using radial access, radial artery occlusion is a potential complication that occurs in approximately 5 percent of cases. A potential clinical consequence is the inability to use the radial artery for future access. Perfused hemostasis with non-occlusive radial artery compression, documented with confirmed perfusion of the hand during ipsilateral ulnar compression ("reverse Allen’s test"), has been shown to decrease the risk of this complication. In a study of 3000 patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography (5 French sheath) who were randomly assigned to ulnar compression or standard hemostasis, the primary end point of 30-day radial artery occlusion occurred less often with ulnar compression (3 versus 0.9 percent; p = 0.0001) [<a href="#rid74">74</a>].</p><p>For patients in whom the likelihood of coronary artery bypass graft surgery is high, consideration should be given to using the radial artery from the dominant hand, as the radial artery from the non-dominant hand may be used as a conduit for bypass.

There were no associated in-hospital ischemic complications, probably due to sufficient withdrawal of blood containing the debris prior to the injection of contrast.

As an example, gross hematuria has been reported in up to 2 percent of patients [<a href="#rid76">76</a>]. It should prompt a careful urologic evaluation since organic urinary tract disease, such as a urologic cancer, is a potential source [<a href="#rid76">76</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7208.html" rel="external">"Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults"</a>.)</p><p>The aggressive systemic anticoagulation used in the past led to the need for blood transfusions and/or vascular repair of the arterial vascular site in up to 14 percent of patients [<a href="#rid60">60</a>].

Ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 133 (4.3 percent). Variables independently associated with an increased risk of VT or VF included smoking, lack of preprocedural beta blockers, shorter time from symptom onset to emergency department arrival, initial TIMI flow grade 0, and right coronary artery-related infarct. Patients with VT or VF had higher rates of complications, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation and intubation in the catheterization laboratory but had similar frequencies of major adverse cardiac events in-hospital and at one year.</p><p>Ventricular arrhythmias occurring in the catheterization laboratory during primary PCI may be attributable to the procedure, the MI, or both. The discussion of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with ST-elevation MI who are referred for PCI is found elsewhere.
