         Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin are together referred to as non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). NMSCs are the most commonly diagnosed malignant neoplasms among non-Hispanic White American individuals. However, reliable statistics are difficult to obtain because many patients are treated in the outpatient setting. The National Cancer Institute estimates that approximately three million new cases of NMSC were diagnosed in 2012 [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite their high prevalence, these NMSCs are rarely fatal, as they account for less than 0.1 percent of all patient deaths caused by cancer [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. SCCs are biologically more aggressive, and neglected lesions can be life-threatening due to local extension or metastasis [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. By contrast, BCC is only very rarely life-threatening.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the overwhelming majority of cases, patients with NMSCs can be successfully managed with a variety of simple procedures (eg, cryotherapy, curettage and electrodesiccation, topical and intralesional treatments, or simple surgical excision). When lesions are more advanced, other local therapeutic approaches (eg, Mohs micrographic surgery, more extensive surgical resection or radiation therapy [RT]) can be used to control locoregional disease. The use of systemic therapy is limited to patients with distant metastases or locally advanced disease that cannot be adequately managed with surgery or RT.
        </p>
        <p>
         Systemic treatments option for BCC and SCC of the skin that are not amenable to local therapies are discussed here. The diagnosis and treatment of localized basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas is discussed separately.

         A tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system has been developed for classification of patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell, basal cell, and adnexal carcinomas (except Merkel cell carcinoma) arising in the head and neck  (

        <p>
         The hedgehog signaling pathway can cause basal cell proliferation and tumor growth [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Signaling in this pathway is initiated by the cell surface receptor smoothened homolog (SMO). In adults, this pathway normally is inhibited by another cell surface receptor, the patched homolog 1 (PTCH1). Binding of the hedgehog ligand to PTCH1 prevents this inhibition.
        </p>
        <p>
         Two mechanisms have been identified by which the hedgehog pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of BCC. Mutations of PTCH1 may prevent inhibition of SMO activation of the hedgehog pathway [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ], or mutations of SMO may result in constitutive activation of the pathway [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. (See

Patients were treated with vismodegib at 150 mg daily continuously until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [

At a median follow-up of 18 months, among the 1119 patients with locally advanced disease, the objective response rate for vismodegib was 69 percent (95% CI 66-71 percent), including complete and partial response rates of 33 and 35 percent, respectively. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 23 months in those with locally advanced disease and 22 months in the entire study population. Further data on the efficacy of vismodegib in patients with metastatic BCC in this study are discussed below. (See

         Treatment-associated adverse events lead to discontinuation of therapy in approximately one-third of patients. Grade ≥3 treatment-related toxicities included muscle spasms (7 percent), elevated serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels (2 percent), dysgeusia (5 percent), weight loss (4 percent), alopecia, decreased appetite, and asthenia (3 percent each), and cutaneous SCC (1 percent). Severe, life-threatening cutaneous adverse reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), have also been reported with

         should undergo regular skin surveillance to evaluate for both response and, potentially, treatment resistance. Patients with advanced BCC can develop acquired resistance to vismodegib (ie, the tumor responds to treatment but then regrows). In one study, acquired resistance was observed in 21 percent of patients and occurred at a mean time of approximately 56 weeks [

         For patients who have received prior surgery or RT for SCC, we initiate systemic therapy once patients have appropriately recovered from their prior therapy. Patients who have received surgery should have adequate wound healing and no major postoperative complications, such as bleeding or infection. Patients treated with radiation or chemoradiation must have also adequately recovered from associated treatment-related toxicities.

         For patients with locoregional lymph node involvement that responds to immunotherapy, some UpToDate contributors offer surgical resection of the lymph nodes as well as the primary tumor. However, immunotherapy may result in pseudoprogression of locoregional lymph nodes alone, an immunotherapy-induced phenomenon where disease transiently worsens prior to stabilization or response. When examination or imaging suggests progression in the lymph nodes only, some contributors offer a biopsy to distinguish pseudoprogression from true progression. Those with pseudoprogression may be eligible for resection, whereas those with true progression are not. Alternatively, other contributors offer up to two additional cycles of immunotherapy with repeat imaging (to reassess whether the pseudoprogression evolves into either a treatment response or true disease progression) rather than lymph node biopsy, which may be difficult to interpret pathologically for pseudoprogression.

         The immunosuppression required after allogenic organ transplantation increases the risk of various skin cancers. In this setting, SCC is more common than BCC, in contrast with the distribution of skin cancers in the nontransplant population. SCCs and BCCs that arise in this setting are more aggressive and are more likely to recur after resection. The development of skin cancer in patients with chronic immunosuppression following organ transplantation is discussed separately. (See
