Behavioral couples therapy was developed to treat SUD patients conjointly with committed partners who do not use substances. Twelve-step facilitation and similar interventions are designed to encourage patients to initiate and sustain participation in mutual help groups. Behavioral medical management provides monitoring of compliance with medication and side effects, along with brief counseling on how to reduce substance use, as well as encouragement to attend community mutual help groups.</p><p>Psychotherapies for SUDs are reviewed here. Other psychosocial interventions for SUDs, including screening and brief intervention, mutual help groups, physician health programs, integrated therapies for dual diagnoses, and models enhancing the delivery of SUD care, such as continuing care, are reviewed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14843.html" rel="external">"Screening for unhealthy use of alcohol and other drugs in primary care"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14832.html" rel="external">"Brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol and other drug use: Efficacy, adverse effects, and administration"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/93398.html" rel="external">"Substance use disorders in physicians: Assessment and treatment", section on 'Physician health programs'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14344.html" rel="external">"Treatment of co-occurring anxiety-related disorders and substance use disorders in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16754.html" rel="external">"Continuing care for addiction: Components and efficacy"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89215.html" rel="external">"Continuing care for addiction: Implementation"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7810.html" rel="external">"Alcohol use disorder: Psychosocial management", section on 'Mutual help groups'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Psychosocial treatments for specific SUDs (opioid, alcohol, stimulant, cannabis, and benzodiazepine use disorders), including psychotherapies, are reviewed separately.

Goals include helping patients to have a better understanding of their risk factors for use, more accurate attributions and cognitions, increased self-efficacy (ie, belief in one’s ability to address problems), and more effective coping responses.</p><p>The first task is to identify such cognitions and behaviors and help the patient learn to recognize them and to anticipate when they are likely to occur. The second task is to expand the patient's repertoire of effective coping responses. Other topics that are typically addressed include shoring up motivation, drink/drug refusal skills and assertiveness, communication skills, receiving criticism, giving and receiving compliments, coping with anger and depression, dealing with interpersonal problems, increasing pleasant activities, and managing stress. Cognitive factors that increase risk for relapse, such as attributional and attentional biases, are identified and addressed.</p><p>As an example, a tendency to believe that relapses are always caused by external factors over which one has no control, such as the behavior of others (ie, persistent external attributions), increases risk for relapse. Attentional bias refers to a tendency to notice and orient toward cues associated with substance use (eg, ads for liquor) more quickly than in individuals without an SUD.</p><p>Patients are usually given homework assignments to complete between sessions. At first, such assignments are generally focused on self-monitoring of substance use and related factors, such as craving and exposure to risky situations. As the therapy progresses, homework often involves rehearsing of coping responses that have been identified in sessions.</p><p>CBT may be more appealing to individuals who do not favor the 12-step program’s emphasis on spirituality and group process. Participation in CBT for SUD generally requires participants to have sufficiently intact cognitive functioning to support engagement in treatment sessions and homework assignments. Examining cognitive bias and distortions and participating in exercises designed to increase coping skills may be difficult for individuals with significant cognitive deficits.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2176919251"><span class="h2">Theoretical foundation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CBT is primarily based on social learning theory [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. According to this theoretical perspective, problematic substance use is considered largely a learned behavior (although some people are seen as more susceptible to SUD due to their genetic makeup and other biological factors). Individuals are likely to engage in problematic substance use, including relapse, when they encounter high-risk situations.</p><p>These situations lead to stressful internal states or external circumstances that have been associated with past substance use by the individual and typically stimulate craving. Although some situations are high risk for most individuals (eg, negative affect, interpersonal conflict), there is a fair amount of variation across individuals in which situations are most risky.</p><p>When a high-risk situation is encountered and increases stress or stimulates craving, the likelihood that alcohol or drug use occurs is determined by a combination of motivation, attributions and other cognitions, self-efficacy, and coping ability [<a href="#rid3">3,5</a>]. Individuals are more likely to drink or use drugs if their motivation for behavior change or self-efficacy for mounting a coping behavior is low, or if their coping abilities for that situation are poor. Biased cognitions and attributions that impair judgment and undermine coping efforts can also contribute to increased risk for substance use or relapse. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Someone with an external locus of control (ie, a belief that his behavior is strongly influenced or even caused by other people) might have particular difficulty in refusing offers of alcohol or drugs.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Someone who believes that any use of alcohol or drugs will lead to a full-blown relapse may be more likely to use heavily after a slip.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Someone with an attentional bias will be more likely to notice substance use-related cues in the environment, such as drug use activity and advertisements for alcohol.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3813279877"><span class="h2">Components</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Components of CBT for SUD generally include a combination of:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Psychoeducation – Information on the factors that cause and sustain SUDs and how they can be addressed with CBT.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Functional analysis – A functional analysis is a careful and detailed reconstruction of a recent episode of a patient’s substance use. The functional analysis is used to determine the internal states and external circumstances that preceded the onset of alcohol or drug use in that episode (ie, the antecedents), factors that influenced the course and termination of the episode, and the consequences of the episode. Through an analysis of several episodes of use, the therapist and patient strive to develop an understanding of the patient’s particular set of risky internal states and situations.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Developing coping skills that help patients manage emotions without drugs. As an example, a patient who is likely to relapse when feeling depressed learns to use a combination of exercise and contact with supportive friends to reduce urges to use when depressed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Enhancing drug refusal and problem-solving skills.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Enhancing interpersonal functioning (eg, a person with poor assertiveness skills learns how to respond effectively to offers of alcohol or drugs).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increasing recovery-focused activities. Examples include active participation in mutual help organizations, improving employment status, involvement in service activities that provide a sense of meaning and purpose, and engagement in activities that improve mood and increase pleasure.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3996509364"><span class="h2">Efficacy</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4022330587"><span class="h3">Face-to-face CBT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Meta-analyses have generally concluded that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) produces small positive effects on substance use outcomes in comparison with other interventions [<a href="#rid6">6-9</a>]. A 2009 meta-analytic review of 53 trials of CBT for alcohol or illicit drug use disorders (from 1980 to 2006) with a range of comparison conditions found an overall small positive effect [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Substance use outcomes varied widely across trials. As an estimate of the size of the observed effect, averaged across all trials, 58 percent of patients who received CBT had better substance use outcomes compared with patients who received an alternative intervention or control.</p><p>Moderator analyses found that the positive effects of CBT were larger in studies of treatment for cannabis use disorders, compared with those for alcohol, stimulant, opioid, or polydrug use disorders. Studies with no treatment control conditions yielded large effects, whereas those with active control conditions (eg, treatment as usual, interpersonal therapy, or 12-step facilitation) produced only small effects.</p><p>As an example, a clinical trial randomly assigned 89 men with alcohol use disorders (88 percent with DSM-IV alcohol dependence) to receive motivational interviewing plus CBT (12 sessions) or to motivational interviewing only (4 sessions) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. No differences in the primary alcohol use outcome, drinks per day, were seen between the motivational interviewing plus CBT and motivational interviewing only during the treatment phase or a 12-month follow-up. Both conditions improved to the same degree from baseline to follow-up.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1497993342"><span class="h3">Computer-assisted CBT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A computer-assisted version of CBT (computer-based training for CBT or “CBT4CBT”) has been developed and preliminarily tested [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The program consists of six modules, which are based on a well-regarded CBT manual [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Each module uses a multimedia format; as an example, one includes video depicting actors in a realistic situation placing them at high risk for substance use. Appropriate coping behaviors for the situations are explained and depicted in a subsequent video. These lessons are followed by learning assessments and guides for homework assignments.</p><p>Two clinical trials comparing CBT4CBT plus standard care found efficacy for some outcomes compared with standard care alone [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. As an example, a clinical trial randomly assigned 77 individuals with DSM-IV substance dependence upon their entry into outpatient treatment in a community program to receive standard care or standard care plus biweekly access to computer-based training in CBT [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. During the eight-week treatment period, participants in the CBT4CBT condition submitted fewer urine drug screens that were positive for any type of drug than those in standard care (2.2 versus 4.3).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3209902093"><span class="h2">Administration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CBT can be provided in either individual or group formats; most trials have studied the individual format version. CBT has usually been provided over 12 sessions in clinical trials with a range of 8 to 24 sessions.</p><p>Training for clinicians to provide CBT for SUDs usually requires three- to seven-day trainings in person, followed by remote supervision that makes use of audiotapes of sessions.</p><p>Multiple manuals provide detailed information for clinicians on how to deliver evidence-based versions of CBT [<a href="#rid1">1,2,4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H652405858"><span class="h1">CBT-BASED THERAPIES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other interventions incorporate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) components and principles but differ from CBT. These differences are relatively small in coping skills training [<a href="#rid4">4</a>] and relapse prevention [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Relapse prevention, for example, focuses to a greater extent on reducing the likelihood and severity of relapses in those who had initially achieved abstinence, while CBT is generally used to both initiate and sustain reductions in use or abstinence.</p><p>The community reinforcement approach (CRA) [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>] and combined behavioral intervention (CBI) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>] include a variety of other components to address a wider variety of issues in recovery in addition to CBT principles and components. (See <a class="local">'Community reinforcement approach'</a> below and <a class="local">'Combined behavioral intervention'</a> below.)</p><p>Both interventions are provided in 12 to 24 sessions, which are typically individual. However, both CRA and CBI can include a few couples sessions if the patient is in a committed relationship with someone who does not have an SUD and is willing to participate. Manuals describing how to provide each of these interventions are available [<a href="#rid13">13-15</a>].</p><p>A notable difference between mindfulness-based relapse prevention, on one hand, and CBT, is the emphasis on being able to tolerate negative affect and craving, rather than quickly engaging in coping behaviors designed to eliminate or counteract such feelings. Although most of these interventions are usually delivered via individual sessions, mindfulness-oriented relapse prevention [<a href="#rid16">16</a>] is delivered in a group format. (See <a class="local">'Mindfulness-based relapse prevention'</a> below and <a class="local">'Acceptance and commitment therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H654120904"><span class="h2">Community reinforcement approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Community reinforcement approach (CRA) aims to make abstinence more rewarding than continued use [<a href="#rid13">13,14,17,18</a>]. CRA consists of CBT-based intervention components, counseling focused on developing new recreational activities and healthy social networks, employment counseling, assistance accessing social service, and couples counseling for patients with partners. Some versions have included a social club, which hosts sober parties and other activities on weekends, and substance-specific pharmacotherapy. Contingency management, an intervention reviewed separately, is sometimes incorporated into the program to reinforce abstinence. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14849.html" rel="external">"Substance use disorders: Principles, components, and monitoring during treatment with contingency management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/103550.html" rel="external">"Substance use disorders: Training, implementation, and efficacy of treatment with contingency management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3053799515"><span class="h3">Social services</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Psychotherapy is provided in tandem with social services that help individuals to meet basic needs in the CRA, as it is in other multimodal, evidence-based interventions and in the general provision of mental health care. Social services can be a critical component to achieving treatment success. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The stress of homelessness and associated challenges adhering to health care visits can benefit from attention to housing options.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with food insecurity and hunger will have difficulty focusing on cutting down or abstaining from alcohol. Such patients should be linked to nutrition resources.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4188768390"><span class="h3">Efficacy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A systematic review of four clinical trials (three of participants with DSM-IV alcohol dependence; one of DSM-IV opioid dependence) found that the CRA was more effective compared with usual care in reducing the number of substance use days; results were mixed for the duration of continuous abstinence [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. As an example, a trial of 91 homeless patients with DSM-IV alcohol dependence at a large day shelter were randomly assigned to receive either the CRA or usual care [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. At follow-up assessments over the subsequent year, patients assigned to the CRA experienced reduced alcohol consumption on multiple measures compared with usual care (eg, fewer drinking days per week [at six months, 0.98 versus 2.29 days; at nine months, 1.32 versus 2.89 days]).</p><p>The review found the combination of the CRA and contingency management to be more efficacious compared with the CRA alone.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1481421612"><span class="h2">Combined behavioral intervention</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Combined behavioral intervention (CBI) combines elements of CBT with components from motivational interviewing and 12-step facilitation interventions [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. When possible, a concerned significant other participates in the treatment process. CBI was developed based on the observations that patients with low motivation to change their substance use got little benefit out of CBT, that involvement with mutual help programs and participation of significant others were associated with better substance use outcomes, and that CBT and 12-step interventions were not necessarily incompatible. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16752.html" rel="external">"Substance use disorders: Motivational interviewing"</a>.)</p><p>Only a single randomized clinical trial has been published evaluating the efficacy of CBI. The multisite COMBINE trial examined the effects of several medication and behavioral therapies alone and in combination for the treatment of DSM-IV alcohol dependence [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. One thousand, three hundred, and eight-three patients with 4 to 21 days of abstinence were randomly assigned to receive one of four medication conditions (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9679" href="/d/drug information/9679.html" rel="external">naltrexone</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9218" href="/d/drug information/9218.html" rel="external">acamprosate</a>, their combination, and double placebo). Patients in each of the four medication groups were also randomly assigned to receive a lower intensity medical management intervention or medical management plus CBI. The randomization included a ninth group which received CBI alone without pills.</p><p>The addition of CBI to medication-assisted treatment in the COMBINE trial did not reduce substance use. Across all medication treatment groups, patients assigned to receive CBI plus medical management did not differ compared with patients assigned to medical management without CBI on two primary outcome measures (percent days abstinent, time to first heavy drinking day) at the end of treatment or at 12 months post-treatment.</p><p>Components of CBI have been shown to produce better SUD outcomes compared with existing treatment. A detailed manual is available to facilitate learning and implementation of the intervention [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H47580772"><span class="h2">Mindfulness-based relapse prevention</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mindfulness-based relapse prevention includes the teaching and practice of mindfulness meditation to increase awareness of thoughts, feelings, and the surrounding environment to help patients manage drug cravings and other negative emotional states without needing to use substances [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p>A 2017 meta-analysis of six clinical trials comparing a mindfulness-based intervention with an active control condition (eg, treatment as usual or alternative treatments) in patients with an SUD found small to moderate effects favoring mindfulness-based treatment on days of substance use and negative consequences of use [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].

In couples where one partner has an SUD, the nature of the interactions between partners can influence whether the partner with an SUD abstains or uses. As the SUD worsens, couples tend to stop reinforcing each other for positive behaviors and instead focus only on negative or problematic behaviors.</p><p>As an example, the significant other may berate the person with the SUD when that person drinks or uses drugs but fail to comment positively on a day of abstinence. The person with the SUD may not voice appreciation when the significant other does something pleasing or supportive but instead focuses on a time when he or she felt unjustly accused of alcohol or drug use by that person.

Patients and significant others are taught to conduct functional analyses of any drinking or drug use episodes, and relapse prevention skills are learned and practiced. Behavioral contracting is included, which often addresses the patient’s pledge to be abstinent that day and the significant other’s commitment to offer help.</p><p>There is an emphasis on identifying and decreasing family members’ behaviors that trigger or reward drinking. The significant other learns to reinforce positive behaviors by the identified patient, such as abstinent days, attending self-help meetings, or taking an antidrinking medication such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9379" href="/d/drug information/9379.html" rel="external">disulfiram</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9679" href="/d/drug information/9679.html" rel="external">naltrexone</a>, and to withdraw positive reinforcement when substance use occurs rather than express anger or make threats.

Both treatments were manual-guided, 20-session, abstinence-oriented CBT-based treatments. Follow-ups were done every three months for 18 months after baseline. BCT produced better outcomes on the two primary drinking outcomes (eg, percent days abstinent and percent days heavy drinking) across the 18-month follow-up than the individual CBT condition. For example, percent days heavy drinking in the individual condition hovered between 30 to 35 percent during the post-treatment follow-up, whereas it ranged from 12 to 20 percent in BCT.</p><p>Clinical trials comparing BCT with another type of couples-based treatment for SUD have found mixed results.

The content of counseling varies; however, it typically includes education and may also incorporate elements of cognitive, behavioral, insight-oriented, and/or supportive psychotherapies.</p><p>Counseling in many SUD treatment programs is based on the principles of 12-step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous. The sessions also focus on helping patients avoid situations where they are likely to encounter alcohol or drugs or triggers for their use, plan safe social activities, and continue attendance at mutual help groups between counseling sessions. In many cases, the counselors in these programs are in recovery themselves (ie, they have a history of an SUD and extensive experience maintaining abstinence).</p><p>Some addiction counseling approaches are based on alternatives to 12-step models; for example, some omit the concept of a higher power and, for patients treated for dual diagnoses, provide support for treatment of psychiatric disorders with psychotropic medications.</p><p>Addiction counseling, as delivered in “real world” settings, has not been tested in efficacy trials. Addiction counseling has often served as the treatment-as-usual “control” condition in many trials of structured psychosocial interventions for SUD. There are no meta-analyses or major reviews of addiction counseling. Outcomes of addiction counseling as the “treatment as usual” have varied considerably across trials, usually doing somewhat worse than or as well as the primary intervention studied; in a few trials, it has performed better than the comparison condition.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2089184299"><span class="h2">Individual drug counseling</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Developed for a large multisite cocaine dependence treatment trial sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse in the United States, “individual drug counseling” is a structured, manual-based form of addiction counseling [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].

Addiction is seen as a complex disease that negatively affects the mind, body, and spirit, and severely damages social relationships. The philosophy of this abstinence-oriented approach incorporates two important elements: endorsement of the disease model and the spiritual dimension of recovery.

Topics include relapse prevention tools, having healthy relationships while in recovery, managing anger, development of a drug-free lifestyle with appropriate leisure activities and time for relaxation, addressing shame and guilt over prior behavior, identification and fulfillment of needs, employment and management of money, and working the more advanced steps of 12-step programs.</p><p>At or near the beginning of each session, counselors are instructed to ask how the patient has been doing since the last session and whether there has been any use of alcohol or other drugs. Counselors are encouraged to obtain frequent urine samples during individual drug counseling and discuss the results of the drug testing in each session. If the self-reports or toxicology tests indicate that the patient has used alcohol or other drugs, the patient and counselor discuss what precipitated the episode of use and develop alternative coping methods to avoid further use. In this way, individual drug counseling can resemble cognitive-behavioral therapy-based interventions. If the patient brings up other current problems that are related to addiction, the counselor and patient work together to identify ways of handling the problems that do not involve alcohol or drug use.
