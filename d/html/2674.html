         Accurate staging of rectal cancer is essential for selecting patients who can undergo sphincter-preserving surgery and identifying those who may benefit from neoadjuvant therapy. Clinical staging is usually accomplished by performing a physical examination, colonoscopy (if possible), and an imaging evaluation (computed tomography [CT] scan of the chest and abdomen [with or without pelvis] and either pelvic magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or rectal endoscopic ultrasound [EUS]). The accuracy and comparative performance of these imaging modalities for staging are discussed separately. (See

         For most patients with a new diagnosis of rectal cancer, and especially for those with locoregionally advanced tumors, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is generally preferred over rectal endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for staging evaluation, unless there is a contraindication to MRI (eg, cardiovascular implantable electronic device). However, some patients are evaluated with both MRI and rectal EUS (eg, patients with suspected but unconfirmed internal iliac lymph nodes) because the imaging modalities provide complementary staging information [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. The selection of imaging studies and their performance characteristics for determining tumor (T) and nodal (N) stage are presented in more detail separately  (

         </span>
         For post-treatment surveillance after surgical resection for rectal cancer, rectal EUS may be more accurate than other imaging modalities for early detection of local recurrence. However, the optimal selection criteria for patients who would benefit from including rectal EUS in the surveillance strategy are uncertain. Consensus guidelines from professional societies vary in their approach to surveillance. Guidelines from the United States Multi-Society Task Force include EUS as an alternative to sigmoidoscopy in the testing strategy for patients at higher risk of recurrence [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ], while the National Comprehensive Cancer Network includes EUS as an alternative to flexible sigmoidoscopy for patients with rectal cancer who undergo transanal excision only  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91618" href="/z/d/graphic/91618.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). Surveillance strategies after surgical resection and risk factors for cancer recurrence are discussed separately. (See

         The pretreatment evaluation for patients with a locally recurrent rectal cancer typically includes pelvic MRI. In general, rectal EUS is a less helpful modality than MRI for staging a local recurrence after prior surgical resection [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The accuracy of rectal EUS is somewhat diminished in the post-treatment setting because of postoperative or post-radiation inflammatory soft tissue changes. These changes obscure the mucosal layers of the rectum, making ultrasonographic images more challenging to interpret [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-9
         </a>
         ]. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         However, rectal EUS with sampling of lesions that are suspicious for recurrence may be useful for patients in whom histologic confirmation of recurrence is required. (See

         A promising application is EUS-guided fiducial placement to enhance the precision of radiotherapy. In a study of 20 patients with rectal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant treatment, rectal EUS was used to guide placement of 64 fiducials in the mesorectal fat or into the tumor itself [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. While fiducial placement was successful initially, mesorectal location was associated with higher fiducial retention rates after a median of 17 days compared with intratumoral placement (90 versus 55 percent). (See

         The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines regarding prophylaxis for gastrointestinal procedures do not recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of solid lesions in the lower gastrointestinal tract because the risk of bacteremia is low [

         EUS is performed with an echoendoscope (an endoscope with an ultrasound transducer engineered into its tip). We use a flexible echoendoscope because it facilitates traversing a narrow, strictured lumen and assessing iliac lymph nodes. A rigid echoendoscope may also be used; however, imaging lesions in the proximal rectum or passing through a stricture may be more challenging because the endoscope is not flexible. Whether the use of a rigid echoendoscope limits staging accuracy is unclear [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13-15
         </a>
         ]. Rigid endoscopes are usually less expensive than flexible echoendoscopes; however, rigid endoscopes cannot be used to perform FNA or to examine the upper gastrointestinal tract.

         Interobserver agreement for staging accuracy with rectal EUS has been moderate to good.

         Use of rectal EUS for staging is typically reserved for selected patients (eg, those with suspected but unconfirmed internal iliac lymph nodes or tumors of uncertain stage on radiographic imaging). Whether EUS staging results in improved outcomes for most patients with rectal cancer remains uncertain. In a study including 3408 patients with non-metastatic rectal cancer, preoperative staging with EUS and computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was associated with higher rates of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy compared with CT alone (50 versus 16 percent), while overall survival was not significantly different between groups (60 versus 57 months) [

         EUS-guided FNA may be used in addition to visual inspection to identify lymph node involvement, although studies on the benefit of FNA have been mixed [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,19-22
         </a>
         ]. In a study including 141 patients with rectal cancer, staging with EUS-FNA was associated with lower risk of tumor recurrence compared with radiographic staging alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.72, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.97) [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. EUS-FNA staging likely facilitated selecting patients with locally advanced disease who benefited maximally from preoperative neoadjuvant therapy. However, in an earlier study including 80 patients with nonmetastatic rectal cancer, EUS with FNA did not result in significant changes in management compared with radiographic or EUS imaging alone [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. For some patients, EUS-FNA may not add significantly to EUS alone because perirectal lymph nodes are typically too small to be visualized by EUS unless they contain metastatic disease. Thus, FNA would not be expected to improve accuracy when compared with visual criteria alone (eg, node size, homogeneity, contour). The use of EUS-FNA to evaluate regional lymph nodes in other parts of the intestinal tract is discussed separately. (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2656.html" rel="external">

         For patients with regionally advanced disease (ie, T3 or more advanced lesions) in whom neoadjuvant chemoradiation is planned, confirming malignancy within perirectal nodes with FNA will not impact the treatment plan, and thus, rectal EUS with FNA is less useful for such patients. Other limitations to FNA include that it cannot be performed when node sampling requires passing the needle through the primary tumor because of the risk of false positive results and potential for seeding nodes with malignant cells [

         </span>
         In patients with anterior rectal cancer, rectal EUS can assess the extent of tumor involvement of the mesorectal fascia (MRF, the lateral margin) by predicting the distance of the tumor to the circumferential resection plane after rectal cancer surgery, and this is referred to as the circumferential resection margin (CRM). For posterior or posterolateral tumors, the distance to the CRM cannot be estimated using rectal EUS because neighboring structures that allow assessment of the CRM are lacking. In such cases, the distance to the CRM can be estimated using MRI.
        </p>
        <p>
         The distance from the tumor to the CRM has important prognostic implications and may influence which patients are offered neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. A "positive" CRM, defined variably as a tumor that invades or is in close proximity to the MRF, is a risk factor for local recurrence after surgery. If the MRF is involved or if the tumor extends to a point that is within 1 to 2 mm of the MRF, there is a risk that the CRM will be involved if total mesorectal excision alone (ie without preoperative chemoradiation) is performed. As a result, the treatment strategy for such patients is initial chemoradiotherapy or short-course radiotherapy, with or without additional neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In a study including 152 patients whose preoperative staging suggested either a lymph node-positive T2 tumor or a T3 tumor regardless of lymph node involvement, no patient received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. The estimated CRM was determined using rectal EUS alone (49 percent of patients), rectal EUS plus MRI (41 percent), or MRI alone (10 percent of patients). The CRM was considered "threatened" if the tumor was within 2 mm, and "non-threatened" if it was more than 2 mm from the CRM based upon EUS and/or MRI. If the preoperative staging categorized the CRM as potentially free, then the histologic margin was clear in 92 percent of cases. If the CRM was not assessed or was defined as threatened, it was involved in 33 percent and 44 percent of patients, respectively. Upon histologic review of the resected specimen, the distance from the tumor to the CRM was an important predictor of local recurrence, disease-free survival, and cancer-specific survival on multivariable analysis.

          General principles
         </strong>
         – Accurate staging of rectal cancer is essential for selecting patients who can undergo sphincter-preserving surgery and identifying those who may benefit from neoadjuvant therapy. Staging evaluation includes performing a physical examination, colonoscopy (if possible), and an imaging evaluation (computed tomography of the chest and abdomen [with or without pelvis] and either pelvic magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or rectal endoscopic ultrasound [EUS]). The selection of imaging studies and their performance characteristics for determining tumor (T) and nodal (N) stage are presented separately  (

         – Rectal EUS evaluates the tumor (T) stage of a rectal cancer by determining the depth of invasion of the primary tumor and the nodal (N) stage by determining number of regional lymph nodes that are involved by cancer and by the presence of isolated, non-nodal, perirectal tumor deposits  (

EUS-guided sampling of solid rectal or perirectal lesions is infrequently associated with bleeding or bacteremia, although published data on complications related to use of rectal EUS in this setting are limited.
