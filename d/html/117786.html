The preoccupation with perceived flaws leads to repetitive behaviors (eg, checking their appearance in mirrors), which are usually difficult to control and not pleasurable. BDD is common but underrecognized, causes clinically significant distress and/or psychosocial impairment, and is often associated with suicidal ideation and behavior.</p><p>Patients with BDD may present to mental health professionals as well as other clinicians, such as dermatologists, plastic surgeons, otolaryngologists, primary care clinicians, pediatricians, gynecologists, and dentists. Most patients seek nonpsychiatric cosmetic treatment (most commonly dermatologic and surgical) for their perceived physical defects; this treatment appears to be ineffective for most patients and can be risky for clinicians to provide. By contrast, pharmacotherapy (ie, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9283" href="/d/drug information/9283.html" rel="external">clomipramine</a>) and/or cognitive-behavioral therapy tailored specifically to BDD are often efficacious.</p><p>This topic reviews the general principles of treating BDD. Choosing treatment and the prognosis of BDD are discussed separately, as are the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, assessment, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of BDD.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96504.html" rel="external">"Body dysmorphic disorder: Choosing treatment and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/118989.html" rel="external">"Body dysmorphic disorder: Epidemiology and pathogenesis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14825.html" rel="external">"Body dysmorphic disorder: Clinical features"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96883.html" rel="external">"Body dysmorphic disorder: Assessment, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3057951458"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS OF BODY DYSMORPHIC DISORDER</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is diagnosed in patients who meet each of the following criteria  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef96646" href="/d/graphic/96646.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Preoccupation with at least one nonexistent or slight defect in physical appearance (eg, thinks about the perceived defects for at least one hour per day).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>At some point during the course of the disorder, concerns about appearance lead to repetitive behaviors (eg, mirror checking, excessive grooming, or skin picking) or mental acts (eg, comparing one’s appearance to that of others).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clinically significant distress or psychosocial impairment that results from the appearance concerns.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Appearance preoccupations are not better explained by an eating disorder.</p><p></p><p>Additional information about the diagnosis and clinical features of BDD is discussed separately.

Information about choosing a specific treatment regimen is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96504.html" rel="external">"Body dysmorphic disorder: Choosing treatment and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3167432063"><span class="h2">Approach to the patient</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Before initiating treatment for BDD, it is important to lay some essential groundwork to educate and engage patients, and to establish a therapeutic alliance by expressing empathy and providing hope that evidence-based treatment usually helps [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Most patients have little to no insight regarding their appearance and may doubt whether psychiatric treatment can help them. In addition, some find it difficult to leave their house to see clinicians or participate in videoconferencing if they can see themselves on the screen.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3777503124"><span class="h3">Educate patients about BDD</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients benefit from education about BDD and a rationale for recommended treatment [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. Although many patients are relieved to learn that they have a known and treatable disorder, some may resist the diagnosis because of poor insight.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1744993964"><span class="h3">Focus of treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Address how concerns with appearance cause patients to obsess about their appearance and perform repetitive BDD behaviors/rituals (eg, check mirrors) excessively, which in turn impair psychosocial functioning and cause patients to suffer [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In addition, emphasize how recommended treatment can improve these problems.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1367637589"><span class="h3">Avoid focusing on how the patient looks</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It usually is not helpful to comment on the patient’s looks. Even reassuring comments are often misinterpreted in a negative way. We do not try to convince patients that they look normal (one cannot impose insight), nor do we agree with them that there is something wrong with their appearance [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. Instead, clinicians might say that patients with BDD see themselves very negatively and differently from how other people see them, for reasons that are not well understood. Clinicians can mention that patients tend to overfocus on tiny details of their appearance and have difficulty seeing the “big picture” of how they look. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/118989.html" rel="external">"Body dysmorphic disorder: Epidemiology and pathogenesis", section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2017271468"><span class="h3">Educate patients about effective psychiatric treatments for BDD</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients can benefit from education about cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) and pharmacotherapy, especially the expected benefits, prognosis, and misconceptions that surround these treatments [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. If patients fear that CBT will be too anxiety-provoking, clinicians can reassure patients that CBT exercises will be generated collaboratively by the patient and clinician, and that patients will not be asked to perform CBT exercises that are intolerable.</p><p>It may also be helpful to emphasize that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9283" href="/d/drug information/9283.html" rel="external">clomipramine</a> are usually well tolerated, not addictive, and appear to normalize brain functioning (rather than cause brain damage) [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. Clinicians can manage negative expectations about medications by [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Explaining the desired therapeutic effects when discussing potential side effects (eg, “Response to just one trial of these types of medication occurs in more than one-half to approximately three quarters of patients”). Response rates are even higher in patients who complete the medication trial with good adherence. If the first medication that is tried is not sufficiently helpful, other medications may be effective. It may be helpful to elicit potential benefits that are meaningful and specific to the patient. Explain that it may take time (eg, one to four months) for the benefits to manifest, but that symptoms may start improving sooner than this.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ensuring that patients understand side effects are often transient and usually benign, and the clinician can often minimize them (eg, by switching a medication that causes fatigue to bedtime). In addition, side effects can be reframed as an indication that the medication is having an effect.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Discussing techniques for coping with side effects other than stopping the drug.</p><p></p><p>In addition, it may help to ask patients to try a medication for three to four months, with the understanding that they will be monitored throughout treatment [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. If the medication trial is successful, they can (and should) continue the drug, and if not, then next step treatment will be discussed.</p><p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s warnings about suicidal ideation and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults who are treated with SSRIs should be acknowledged, although the evidence is inadequate to conclusively establish this association. However, studies indicate that in adults aged 18 years and older with BDD, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8465" href="/d/drug information/8465.html" rel="external">fluoxetine</a> protects against worsening of suicidality more than placebo [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], and that suicidality decreases with other SSRIs. In addition, other studies indicate that SSRIs decrease suicidal ideation and behavior in depressed adults, and that the risk of suicidality in depressed children and adolescents is comparable for fluoxetine and placebo [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Thus, it appears that the substantial risk of suicidal ideation and behavior posed by BDD and comorbid disorders such as depression exceeds the small potential risk posed by the use of SSRIs for children, adolescents, and young adults [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14672.html" rel="external">"Effect of antidepressants on suicide risk in adults", section on 'Reduction of existing suicidal ideation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1225.html" rel="external">"Effect of antidepressants on suicide risk in children and adolescents", section on 'Randomized trials'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4221069646"><span class="h3">Individualize treatment for each patient</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment for BDD should be individualized for each patient. Factors to evaluate include [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Severity of illness. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96504.html" rel="external">"Body dysmorphic disorder: Choosing treatment and prognosis", section on 'Mild to moderate illness'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96504.html" rel="external">"Body dysmorphic disorder: Choosing treatment and prognosis", section on 'Severe illness'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of prior treatment for BDD.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Comorbid disorders – Although some comorbid disorders such as unipolar major depression or social anxiety disorder may respond to the same medication used for BDD, other comorbid disorders (eg, bipolar disorder) require different medications. In addition, patients with comorbid substance use disorders are generally not treated with benzodiazepines or other controlled substances.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Medication safety and adverse effects.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient preferences.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pregnancy and lactation status.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age – For children, adolescents, and some older adults, lower initial and maximum medication doses may be efficacious and better tolerated than doses prescribed for the general population of adults with BDD. For children, we generally do not exceed FDA maximum medication doses. In addition, CBT that was developed for adults needs to be adapted for children and adolescents.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1766734457"><span class="h3">Involve family members if clinically appropriate</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We suggest involving the family if it is appropriate and potentially helpful (parental/guardian involvement is required for minors) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Family members often bring patients with BDD for treatment because patients usually manifest impaired functioning, suicidal thoughts and/or behavior, and poor insight into their illness (and thus may resist psychiatric treatment). In addition, the family can support the patient and encourage adherence with the treatment plan, and family members generally benefit from psychoeducation about the illness and its treatment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2698344077"><span class="h3">Use motivational interviewing if needed</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Motivational interviewing modified for BDD may be necessary to engage and retain patients in psychiatric treatment. Patients with BDD may be reluctant to accept psychiatric treatment due to poor insight into their illness, a wish for cosmetic treatment rather than psychiatric treatment, the belief that psychiatric treatment will not be helpful, and discomfort being seen by other people, including the psychiatric clinician. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14612.html" rel="external">"Overview of psychotherapies", section on 'Motivational interviewing'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1625877985"><span class="h2">Monitoring</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>At the beginning of treatment, ill outpatients who are receiving medication are generally seen once every few weeks, and patients receiving CBT are seen weekly or more often. The visit frequency also depends upon clinical urgency. In patients who improve with medication, the frequency of visits can be tapered, with visits every one to two months. Stable remitted patients can eventually be seen once every three to six months. Patients who receive CBT are usually seen at least weekly for approximately six months; following improvement, as-needed “booster sessions” may be helpful to maintain gains.</p><p>We monitor BDD symptoms over time by asking the patient:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What is the total time each day that you think about your appearance?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>How much distress is caused by these thoughts about your appearance?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>How much do concerns about your appearance interfere with daily functioning (eg, work, school, and social)?</p><p></p><p>Clinicians can also ask about total time spent each day performing BDD repetitive behaviors (ie, rituals, compulsions).</p><p>In addition, clinicians should monitor depressive symptoms and suicidal thinking and behavior, which are common in patients with BDD. Options for monitoring depression and suicidality include self-report measures such as the Patient Health Questionnaire – Nine Item (PHQ-9)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307" href="/d/graphic/59307.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) and Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology – Self Report 16 Item (QIDS-SR<sub>16</sub>)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55461" href="/d/graphic/55461.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Information about comorbid psychopathology in BDD and using the PHQ-9 or QIDS-SR<sub>16</sub> to assess depression is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14825.html" rel="external">"Body dysmorphic disorder: Clinical features", section on 'Comorbidity'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14860.html" rel="external">"Using scales to monitor symptoms and treat depression (measurement based care)", section on 'Self-report scales in the public domain'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H622349978"><span class="h2">Discourage cosmetic interventions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with BDD, we suggest that clinicians not perform surgical, dermatological, dental, or other cosmetic treatments because these interventions usually do not help and sometimes worsen BDD symptoms [<a href="#rid2">2,9-12</a>]. This approach is consistent with practice guidelines:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>American Academy of Otolaryngology – A 2017 guideline states that BDD is a contraindication to elective rhinoplasty and that patients seeking surgery should be screened for BDD [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists – A committee opinion states that individuals younger than age 18 who request breast or labia surgery should be screened for BDD and that if the obstetrician-gynecologist suspects an adolescent has BDD, referral to a mental health clinician is appropriate [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. A subsequent opinion on elective female genital cosmetic surgery states that before surgery is considered, patients should be referred and assessed for BDD if indicated (eg, they acknowledge concerns about the appearance of secondary sex characteristics) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p>However, we do not recommend avoiding cosmetic interventions in patients with skin damage due to BDD-related skin picking that requires dermatologic treatment.</p><p>Although most patients with BDD receive cosmetic treatment in an attempt to “fix” their perceived appearance flaws, BDD symptoms respond poorly to cosmetic procedures in the large majority of cases and may even worsen [<a href="#rid9">9,12-14</a>]. In addition, dissatisfaction with the outcome of cosmetic treatment may lead patients to become litigious, threatening, or violent toward clinicians who provide such treatment [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>We suggest that patients presenting for cosmetic treatment be assessed for BDD  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef96647" href="/d/graphic/96647.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In addition to inquiring about BDD’s diagnostic criteria  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef96646" href="/d/graphic/96646.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), it can be helpful to assess patient motivations and expectations for cosmetic treatment; determine whether patients have had past cosmetic treatment with which they have been dissatisfied; ask whether surgeons, dermatologists, dentists, or other clinicians have recommended against cosmetic treatment; and observe the patient’s behavior in the office (eg, making unusual requests for appointment times so as to avoid being seen by other people).</p><p>If BDD is suspected in patients presenting for cosmetic treatment, we suggest:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Explaining to the patient that they may or do have BDD</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Educating patients about BDD</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Conveying concern that cosmetic treatment appears very unlikely to be helpful</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Discussing the potential for pharmacotherapy (eg, SSRIs) and CBT to improve BDD symptoms</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Referring the patient to a mental health clinician who is knowledgeable about BDD</p><p></p><p>If the patient insists upon receiving cosmetic treatment, psychiatric clinicians can recommend delaying it until after the patient has tried psychiatric treatment, which may improve BDD symptoms to the point that the patient no longer desires a cosmetic intervention. However, some patients receive cosmetic treatment regardless of the clinician’s recommendations, in which case efforts should be made to have the patient receive mental health treatment concurrently.</p><p>Additional information about the prognosis and course of illness of BDD following cosmetic procedures is discussed separately.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96883.html" rel="external">"Body dysmorphic disorder: Assessment, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Approach to the patient</strong> – Before initiating treatment for BDD, it is important to engage patients and establish a therapeutic alliance by expressing empathy and providing hope that evidence-based treatment usually helps. Educate patients about BDD and effective psychiatric treatments for the disorder, focus on the patient’s excessive preoccupation and impaired functioning, avoid focusing on how the patient looks, individualize treatment, and involve family members if clinically appropriate. (See <a class="local">'Approach to the patient'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring</strong> – We monitor BDD symptoms over time by asking patients how much time each day they think about their appearance and how much distress is caused by these thoughts. We also ask about the effects of appearance concerns on daily functioning (eg, work and social interactions), the time spent performing BDD rituals (eg, mirror checking), and monitor depressive symptoms, anxiety, and suicidal thinking and behavior. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Discourage cosmetic interventions</strong> – For patients with BDD, clinicians should not perform surgical, dermatological, or other cosmetic treatments. In the large majority of cases, BDD symptoms respond poorly to cosmetic procedures and may even worsen. (See <a class="local">'Discourage cosmetic interventions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Referral</strong> – Patients with BDD are typically referred to mental health clinicians. (See <a class="local">'Referral'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Choosing treatment</strong> – Several effective treatments are available for BDD.
