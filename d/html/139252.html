Affected individuals are heterozygous for a pathogenic variant in the<em> MEN1 </em>gene. Evaluation and management of MEN1 are discussed in detail separately [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2039.html" rel="external">"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Monitoring for MEN1-associated tumors'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2026.html" rel="external">"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H534546425"><span class="h2"><i>MEN1 </i>gene</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The <em>MEN1</em> gene encodes menin, a tumor suppressor associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Menin is a scaffold protein that functions in histone modification and epigenetic gene regulation [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. It is thought to regulate several pathways and processes by altering chromatin structure through the modification of histones. Over 1000 <em>MEN1</em> pathogenic variants that inactivate or disrupt menin function have been detected. Inactivation of menin results in loss of tumor suppression.</p><p>Transmission is autosomal dominant; heterozygosity for a pathogenic variant in the <em>MEN1 </em>gene results, with high penetrance, in MEN1. MEN1 is caused by a de novo pathogenic variant in 10 percent of patients. Thus, a negative family history cannot be used to exclude the diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2037.html" rel="external">"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Genetics", section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2823230003"><span class="h2">How to read the report</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Confirm that the result applies to the tested individual and determine whether testing was performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory (or other nationally certified laboratory); if this is not the case, testing should be repeated in a certified laboratory. This and other caveats are summarized in the checklist  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122437" href="/z/d/graphic/122437.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4258834628"><span class="h2">Disease association</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>MEN1 is characterized by predisposition to tumors of the parathyroid glands, anterior pituitary, and pancreatic islet cells. MEN1 also includes a predisposition to gastrinomas in the duodenum, bronchopulmonary and thymic neuroendocrine tumors, gastric carcinoids, adrenal adenomas (occasionally carcinomas), angiofibromas, lipomas, and other tumors  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53057" href="/z/d/graphic/53057.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132581" href="/z/d/graphic/132581.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Other associated tumors include angiomyolipomas, spinal cord ependymomas, and a two- to threefold increased risk of breast cancer has been reported. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2039.html" rel="external">"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of MEN1 may be suspected on clinical grounds and a genetic diagnosis established by DNA testing that identifies a pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variant in the <em>MEN1 </em>gene. If such an <em>MEN1 </em>variant cannot be identified, the definition of MEN1 allows the diagnosis to be made clinically: as the occurrence of two or more primary MEN1 tumor types (parathyroid, enteropancreatic endocrine, and pituitary tumors), or in family members of a patient with a clinical diagnosis of MEN1, the occurrence of one of the MEN1-associated tumors. Multiple parathyroid tumors causing primary hyperparathyroidism are the most common component of MEN1, occurring in the large majority of patients by age 50 years, and is the initial manifestation of the disorder in most patients. A diagnosis of MEN1 may also be established in individuals found to harbor a pathogenic <em>MEN1</em> variant following genetic testing, but who do not yet manifest any clinical features of the disorder (ie, a genetic diagnosis). This situation most frequently arises following predictive genetic testing of "at risk" family members of an affected MEN1 patient who has an established pathogenic <em>MEN1</em> variant. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1083725706"><span class="h3">Primary hyperparathyroidism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In most cases, multiple parathyroid tumors causing primary hyperparathyroidism are the initial manifestation of MEN1, and they are found in the large majority of patients by age 50 years  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132582" href="/z/d/graphic/132582.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). Most patients are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, and hypercalcemia is detected by biochemical screening. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2039.html" rel="external">"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Primary hyperparathyroidism'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1791168166"><span class="h3">Pituitary adenomas</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common type of pituitary adenoma in MEN1 is a lactotroph adenoma, but somatotroph, corticotroph, gonadotroph, and clinically nonfunctioning adenomas can also occur.

The most common cause of symptomatic disease is the Zollinger-Ellison (gastrinoma) syndrome (ZES), although insulinoma may occur at a young age and can be the first clinical presentation of MEN1. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2039.html" rel="external">"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Pancreatic islet cell/gastrointestinal endocrine tumors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nonfunctioning tumors</strong> – Nonfunctioning pancreatic tumors are the most common pancreatic tumor type in MEN1 and are responsible for considerable morbidity and premature mortality.

The age to initiate monitoring for MEN1 tumors in asymptomatic individuals (eg, children with normal growth) is controversial and should be individualized based on discussion between family and the MEN1 team. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2039.html" rel="external">"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Monitoring for MEN1-associated tumors'</a>.)</p><p>Monitoring consists of the following: </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3027127875"><span class="h4">Clinical assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Annual clinical visits with patient education for symptoms or signs that could be due to MEN1-associated tumors.

Decisions regarding the possible benefits of imaging for thymic and bronchopulmonary neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are more nuanced and should be fully discussed with the patient. If the patient remains tumor free, ongoing annual clinical and biochemical assessment is recommended, while the interval between imaging modalities individualized based on joint discussion between the clinician and patient. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H499551728"><span class="h3">Treatment of MEN1-associated tumors</span></p><p>The treatment of each of the MEN1-associated tumors is outlined in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2026.html" rel="external">"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Management"</a>.) In brief:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Parathyroid tumors</strong> – The indications for parathyroidectomy are similar to those in patients with sporadic adenomas causing primary hyperparathyroidism and include symptomatic hypercalcemia, nephrolithiasis, and evidence of bone disease, such as diminished bone density or fracture. For asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic hyperparathyroidism, surgery or no therapy can be acceptable alternatives, as they are for patients with sporadic hyperparathyroidism. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2026.html" rel="external">"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Management", section on 'Parathyroid tumors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For patients with MEN1 and indications for initial parathyroidectomy, subtotal (three and one-half glands) parathyroidectomy is generally preferred. A cervical thymectomy is also generally performed in this setting. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pituitary adenomas</strong> – Pituitary adenomas in patients with MEN1 are managed in the same way as sporadic pituitary adenomas. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2026.html" rel="external">"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Management", section on 'Pituitary adenomas'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors </strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Zollinger-Ellison syndrome</strong> – Active Zollinger-Ellison syndrome as part of the MEN1 syndrome is treated primarily by proton pump therapy to limit the clinical manifestations and complications of peptic ulcer disease. The role of duodenal-pancreatic surgery to prevent metastatic disease is uncertain and controversial but could prove beneficial and requires further study. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2026.html" rel="external">"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Management", section on 'Pancreatic islet cell/gastrointestinal tumors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Insulinoma</strong> – Surgery is indicated for patients with MEN1 and insulinoma. Because patients with MEN1 often have additional pancreatic tumors that may include other insulinomas, local excision of any tumors in the head of the pancreas plus a distal subtotal pancreatectomy is frequently performed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2026.html" rel="external">"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Management", section on 'Insulinoma'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs)</strong> – Surgery is indicated for patients with MEN1 and nonfunctioning pancreatic NETs ≥2 cm or smaller tumors (1 to 2 cm) considered to be at higher risk of progression (eg, rapid growth on serial imaging or higher-grade tumors). The majority of small nonfunctioning tumors (&lt;1 cm) run an indolent course with low growth rates such that surveillance is often appropriate.

However, if there is a strong clinical suspicion of MEN1 in an individual despite the apparent absence of the familial variant, or even in an asymptomatic person, discussion with the accredited genetics laboratory may be indicated to consider genetic testing by an alternate method as there may be very rare occasions where laboratory methodological issues result in a false-negative test result [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Negative genetic testing if the familial</strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>variant is unknown</strong> –<em> </em>If MEN1 is suspected based on personal or family history and a familial variant has <strong>not</strong> been characterized, then negative testing of <em>MEN1</em> cannot be used to exclude the disorder. Consultation with a genetics expert and the MEN1 team is advised to determine the next steps, which may include a gene panel testing for other genes or more extensive testing of <em>MEN1</em>. Some pathogenic variants, eg, in noncoding regions of/near MEN1, could remain undetected by methodology used in commercial testing laboratories. Similarly, somatic and germline mosaicism has been reported in patients with MEN1 and may not be detected by all methods currently used in commercial assays. Also, genetic variants in the <em>MEN1</em> gene are not responsible for all individuals, or even kindreds, with an MEN1 phenotype. Pathogenic variants in <em>CDKN1B</em> or other CDK inhibitor genes are responsible for a small proportion of patients with MEN1-like phenotypes, sporadic or familial, in the absence of an <em>MEN1</em> pathogenic variant. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2037.html" rel="external">"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Genetics", section on 'Other genes'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Clinical and biochemical assessment and surveillance imaging can also be performed to detect MEN1-related tumors. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring for tumors in MEN1'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2039.html" rel="external">"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Genetic testing'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Variant of uncertain significance (VUS)</strong> – A VUS means the pathogenicity of the variant is inconclusive and the variant has not been determined to be pathogenic or benign. Management is based on personal and family history of MEN1 manifestations. Individuals with a VUS may benefit from consultation with an expert in MEN1 or a genetics expert to assist in determining the pathogenicity of the variant. Where possible, additional steps should be taken to facilitate reclassification of the variant (eg, upgrading to likely pathogenic/pathogenic or downgrading to benign/likely benign status). This may involve a number of additional approaches (eg, genetic testing of additional affected family members, genetic testing of parents) and frequently requires multidisciplinary discussion between clinical and genetic teams in partnership with the patient [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H323935830"><span class="h2">First-degree relatives</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Timing of genetic testing </strong>– MEN1 is autosomal dominant. All first-degree relatives of an individual with a pathogenic variant in<em> MEN1</em> should be offered genetic counseling and, at the appropriate time, DNA testing for the variant irrespective of whether they express any clinical manifestations of MEN1 or remain asymptomatic. The parents of the proband should be offered testing if future childbearing is possible. It is possible that a parent may be affected but undiagnosed. It is also possible that the affected individual has a de novo pathogenic variant and the parent may be unaffected. In addition, somatic and germline mosaicism have been reported in MEN1, which may make interpretation of genetic test results more challenging and may require specialist discussion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2039.html" rel="external">"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Family members in MEN1 kindreds'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Each child of an affected parent has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the <em>MEN1 </em>variant and being at risk for developing MEN1. The optimal age for genetic testing has not been established. Some advocate starting early in childhood (ie, &lt;5 years of age), as clinical manifestations are occasionally reported in young children, while others suggest this can be deferred until a later time point (eg &gt;12 years, or even to the age of majority), thereby allowing the child/young person to be better involved in the decision-making process with regard to genetic testing, or to even make the decision for themselves.
