According to the Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) course, shock is further classified into the following stages [<a href="#rid1">1</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6388.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and classification of shock in children", section on 'Stages of shock'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Compensated shock</strong> – During compensated shock, the body's homeostatic mechanisms rapidly compensate for diminished perfusion, and systolic blood pressure is maintained within the normal range. Heart rate is initially increased. Signs of peripheral vasoconstriction (eg, cool skin, decreased peripheral pulses, and oliguria) can be noted as perfusion becomes further compromised.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypotensive shock</strong> – For patients with hypotensive shock, compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed. The heart rate is markedly elevated, and hypotension develops. Signs and symptoms of organ dysfunction (eg, altered mental status as the result of poor brain perfusion) appear. Systolic blood pressure falls, although children who have lost as much as 30 to 35 percent of circulating blood volume can typically maintain normal systolic blood pressures. Once hypotension develops, the child's condition often deteriorates rapidly to cardiovascular collapse and cardiac arrest.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Irreversible shock </strong>– During this stage, progressive end-organ dysfunction leads to irreversible organ damage and death. Tachycardia may be replaced by bradycardia, and blood pressure becomes very low. The process is often irreversible, despite resuscitative efforts.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these stages of shock, four broad mechanisms of shock are recognized: hypovolemic, distributive, cardiogenic, and obstructive. Each type is characterized by a primary physiologic derangement  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73000" href="/z/d/graphic/73000.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6388.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and classification of shock in children", section on 'Classification'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypovolemic</strong> – Decreased preload caused by volume loss including hemorrhage, gastrointestinal losses, insensible losses (eg, burns), or third spacing</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Distributive</strong> – Decreased vascular resistance due to vasodilation caused by conditions such as sepsis, anaphylaxis, or acute injury to the spinal cord or brain</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cardiogenic</strong> – Decreased cardiac contractility caused by conditions such as primary myocardial injury, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, congenital heart disease with heart failure, sepsis, or poisoning</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Obstructive</strong> – Increased vascular resistance caused by conditions such as congenital heart disease with ductal-dependent lesions (eg, hypoplastic left heart) or acquired obstructive conditions (eg, pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, or massive pulmonary embolism)</p><p></p><p>However, a patient may have more than one type of shock (such as an infant with cardiogenic shock from supraventricular tachycardia who is also hypovolemic because he has been unable to drink, or a child with underlying cardiomyopathy who is septic). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6396.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation of shock in children", section on 'Clinical classification of shock'</a>.)</p><p>An algorithm for identifying the cause of shock is provided  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81356" href="/z/d/graphic/81356.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Recognition of shock and classification based upon clinical findings is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6396.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation of shock in children", section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CLINICAL AND PHYSIOLOGIC TARGETS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Early goals of therapy for shock target improvement of clinical and physiologic signs. Interventions are determined by the degree of illness and response to treatment within the first few hours of care. This approach has been most strongly promoted for children with septic shock. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/85767.html" rel="external">"Septic shock in children in resource-abundant settings: Rapid recognition and initial resuscitation (first hour)", section on 'Resuscitation'</a>.)</p><p>Clinical and physiologic indicators that should be targeted during therapy (with goals in parentheses) include [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><div class="formulaContainer"><div class="formula"><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Blood pressure (systolic pressure at least fifth percentile for age: 60 mmHg &lt;1 month of age, 70 mmHg + [2 x age in years] in children 1 month to 10 years of age, 90 mmHg in children 10 years of age or older)</p></div></div><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Quality of central and peripheral pulses (strong, distal pulses equal to central pulses)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Skin perfusion (warm, with capillary refill &lt;2 seconds)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mental status (normal mental status)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Urine output (≥1 mL/kg per hour once effective circulating volume is restored)</p><p></p><p>Heart rate is an important physiologic indicator of circulatory status. For children with shock, tachycardia is often a compensatory response to poor tissue perfusion. In this situation, a decrease in heart rate with fluid therapy can be a valuable indicator of improved perfusion in response to treatment  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77057" href="/z/d/graphic/77057.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). However, many other factors (ie, fever, drugs, hypoxia, and anxiety) influence heart rate. In addition, an abnormal heart rate may be the direct result of the cause of shock (as with myocarditis or beta blocker ingestion). Although trends in response to treatment should be carefully monitored, specific target goals for heart rate are difficult to define and may not be useful. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6396.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation of shock in children", section on 'Circulation'</a>.)</p><p>The above physiologic indicators can be readily monitored noninvasively during the initial management of shock and, since many children in shock respond well, invasive monitoring can often be avoided. For example, capillary refill time is a valuable initial physiologic parameter that can be evaluated without the need for technology or equipment. Normal capillary refill in children is less than two seconds. Volume depletion or hypotension can delay capillary refill to more than three seconds. Arterial vasodilation in patients with warm shock can cause "flash" capillary refill (&lt;1 second). On the other hand, the usefulness of capillary refill is limited by interobserver variability and by the effect of environmental temperature. Thus, capillary refill should not be used as the sole indicator of compromised systemic perfusion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6387.html" rel="external">"Assessment of systemic perfusion in children"</a>.)</p><p>Noninvasive ultrasonic determination of cardiac index, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, and stroke volume is feasible in healthy children, and age-based normative values have been published [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. When performed by trained and experienced physicians, bedside Doppler ultrasound shows promise as a noninvasive method to guide vasoactive therapy by calculating cardiac output from measurements of blood flow over the pulmonary artery or aorta [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>In addition to the targets listed above, elevation of serum or blood lactate (&gt;4 mmol/L) may help identify the severity of shock at presentation. Although evidence is limited in children, reduction in serum or blood lactate levels has been associated with improved survival in children with sepsis. Rapid determination of blood lactate may be obtained at the bedside. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/85767.html" rel="external">"Septic shock in children in resource-abundant settings: Rapid recognition and initial resuscitation (first hour)", section on 'Approach'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H550899624"><span class="h1">EARLY RECOGNITION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are a number of screening tools that have been studied in order to identify patients at risk for poor outcomes, mainly from septic shock. Rapid recognition of shock can facilitate timely resuscitation, which can reduce mortality. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/85767.html" rel="external">"Septic shock in children in resource-abundant settings: Rapid recognition and initial resuscitation (first hour)", section on 'Rapid recognition'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h1">INITIAL STABILIZATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1699507989"><span class="h2">Approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Successful management of children with shock requires the rapid initiation of aggressive treatment. An approach that targets improvement in specific physiologic and clinical findings can generally be applied to most patients who present with shock, independent of the underlying cause. However, during this initial stabilization, clues to the exact etiology of shock must also be sought to best direct subsequent therapy and quickly identify patients who may be harmed by or not respond to this approach. (See <a class="local">'High-risk conditions'</a> below.)</p><p>For the initial management of children with shock, other than obstructive shock, who are cared for in a setting with critical care capability, we suggest targeting therapy using physiologic and clinical goals including central and peripheral pulses, capillary refill time, mental status, blood pressure, and urine output (see <a class="local">'Clinical and physiologic targets'</a> above):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rapid assessment should quickly determine the presence and presumptive type of shock  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81356" href="/z/d/graphic/81356.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Initial management of hypovolemic, distributive, and cardiogenic shock  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73000" href="/z/d/graphic/73000.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) should focus on fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid solution appropriate to the type of shock and specific pharmacologic therapies, as indicated, once the etiology of shock is identified  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef129655" href="/z/d/graphic/129655.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Volume and rate'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Interventions must be administered in a rapid sequence, with evaluation of physiologic indicators before and after each intervention. The ideal timeline for the initial management of shock in children is uncertain and may be unachievable in clinical practice depending upon patient factors and setting. However, clinicians should work rapidly to reverse shock utilizing all resources at their disposal.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Once physiologic goals have been achieved, indicating that perfusion is improved, the patient should continue to receive supportive treatment and careful monitoring. Achieving a normal blood pressure is essential for the patient who has hypotensive shock.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For children with compensated shock and normal blood pressures, therapeutic endpoints based upon noninvasive indicators are reasonable targets, but they may be unreliable. Skin perfusion can be influenced by room temperature, mental status may be abnormal as the result of a drug ingestion or central nervous system infection, and accurate measurement of urine output requires bladder catheterization.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If obstructive shock is present, it requires immediate recognition and treatment of the underlying cause (eg, tension pneumo- or hemothorax, cardiac tamponade, congenital heart disease with closure of the ductus arteriosus, or pulmonary embolism).

(See <a class="local">'Initial stabilization'</a> above and <a class="local">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fluid resuscitation </strong>– We suggest that children with shock receive isotonic crystalloid (eg, normal <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12796" href="/z/d/drug information/12796.html" rel="external">saline</a> or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="108442" href="/z/d/drug information/108442.html" rel="external">lactated Ringer</a> solution) rather than colloid as the initial fluid therapy because clinical outcomes are similar and crystalloid therapy is more widely available and less expensive (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>).
