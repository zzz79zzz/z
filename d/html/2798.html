         Opioid therapy is the first-line approach for moderate or severe chronic pain in populations with active cancer (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2814.html" rel="external">
          "Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia"
         </a>
         ). However, the comprehensive management of pain in patients with cancer also requires expertise in the use of the nonopioid analgesics, such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen
         </a>
         (also known as paracetamol), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), and a group of drugs referred to as "adjuvant" analgesics or coanalgesics.
        </p>
        <p>
         A stepwise approach to management of cancer pain that includes both opioid and nonopioid drugs is endorsed by several bodies, including the World Health Organization (WHO). Mild pain can initially be managed with non-opioid drugs (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen
         </a>
         or an NSAID) with or without an analgesic adjuvant, while moderate to severe pain, or mild pain that is persistent or increasing despite non-opioid therapy, is best approached with an opioid type drug, with or without a non-opioid drug, and with or without an analgesic adjuvant [
         <a href="#rid1">

          acetaminophen
         </a>
         and NSAIDs have a well-established role in the treatment of cancer pain when used as single agents [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ] In addition, when used in combination with opioids, these agents may provide analgesia that is additive to the opioid regimen, permitting a reduction in the opioid dose, with a consequent lessening of opioid-related side effects.

         has been used as monotherapy for mild pain. It is also a component of a variety of combination opioid products (acetaminophen plus

         ). When used in combination with an opioid to treat postoperative pain, acetaminophen has an opioid-sparing effect. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/133187.html" rel="external">

         The treatment of opioid-naïve patients with moderate or severe cancer pain may be initiated with a combination product that includes an opioid plus

         ) or with a low-dose single-entity opioid. There is insufficient evidence to recommend one of these approaches over the other. If a patient initiates therapy with a single-entity opioid alone and experiences mild residual pain after the dose is adjusted, trial of acetaminophen, administered around-the-clock using fixed scheduled dosing, may be considered, particularly if the patient is very sensitive to opioid side effects.
        </p>

          acetaminophen
         </a>
         is administered around-the-clock, either through the use of a combination product or through coprescription of single-entity acetaminophen, and pain increases, a higher dose of acetaminophen should not be given unless the total daily dose is below the maximum safe dose. Usually, an alternative strategy, typically escalation of the opioid alone, is needed in this situation.

          acetaminophen

         in combination with an opioid in patients with moderate to severe pain is surprisingly limited [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-14
         </a>
         ]. However, most of the randomized trials that suggested no benefit were underpowered, and at least one trial suggests a small but clinically important additive effect in about one-third of patients despite the fact that one-half were taking an NSAID or glucocorticoid [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Nevertheless, a 2017 Cochrane review of three double-blind randomized trials comparing acetaminophen alone with placebo, or acetaminophen in combination with an opioid compared with the same dose of the opioid alone for at least five days’ duration [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,11,12
         </a>
         ] concluded that risk of bias was high in all of these studies, and that there was no high-quality evidence to support or refute the use of acetaminophen in patients with any severity of cancer pain [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. On the other hand, a year 2019 network meta-analysis of therapeutics for chronic cancer pain concluded that the top-ranking drug classes for global efficacy included nonopioid analgesics, such as acetaminophen, as well as NSAIDs and opioids [

         has a more rapid and predictable onset of effect (5 to 10 minutes) and time to peak concentration (15 minutes) in most patients compared with rectal or oral administration (onset 10 to ≥60 minutes). The usual dose of IV acetaminophen for patients over 50 kg is 650 mg every four hours or 1000 mg every six hours, not to exceed 4 g per day.

         should be used for low-weight adults (body weight 33 to 50 kg) and in patients with mild or moderate hepatic insufficiency, chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, or dehydration. Patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance ≤30 mL/min) may receive the usual dose, but not more often than once every six hours. Acetaminophen is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency or severe progressive liver disease.

         </a>
         is exceedingly good, but there is a relatively narrow therapeutic window, and the main toxicity, hepatic injury, is a serious concern and can be life threatening. Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity has been generally associated with doses &gt;4 g/day [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19-21
         </a>
         ]. Although doses up to 4 g/day are generally well tolerated, hepatotoxicity has been reported rarely at this dose limit [

         In the United States, concerns about unintentional overdose have been rising. Given that there are no data to show that taking more than 325 mg of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen
         </a>
         per dose unit provides additional benefit that outweighs the added risks for liver injury, in 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asked drug manufacturers to limit the strength of acetaminophen in prescription combination drug products to 325 mg per dose unit [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. As of January 2014, all prescription combination drug products with more than 325 mg of acetaminophen per tablet have been withdrawn from the market and are no longer available.
        </p>
        <p>
         Government regulators have also suggested that the maximum single dose should be limited to 650 mg, that the maximal total daily dose should be limited to no more than 4 g/day (for five days or less) for adults, and that patients with significant liver disease or heavy alcohol use should be considered to have a relative contraindication to this drug [

         is widely used as an over-the-counter pain and fever medication, and it is often combined with other ingredients, such as cough and cold ingredients. Consumers are often unaware that many such products contain acetaminophen, making it easy to accidentally take too much acetaminophen.

         The NSAIDS are a diverse group of drugs  (

         ) that presumably produce analgesia by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), and thereby reducing production of peripheral and central prostaglandins. There are two main isoforms of COX, a constitutive form (COX-1) that is active in tissues that require prostaglandins for physiologic function, and an inducible form (COX-2) that is produced in the setting of inflammation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Each of the NSAIDs inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2, but with varying selectively for the two isoforms. Drugs that are relatively more selective for COX-2 have analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, but are relatively less likely to produce side effects related to COX-1 inhibition, such as gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. (See

         A number of drugs were specifically developed as relatively selective COX-2 inhibitors in order to reduce the risk of GI toxicity. Studies confirmed that these COX-2 selective drugs had lower rates of GI side effects, ulceration and bleeding, as long as low-dose

        <p>
         Cardiovascular toxicity has been identified in patients treated with any of the NSAIDs, and epidemiologic and other research has suggested that the prothrombotic effect that presumably causes this toxicity is produced by relatively excessive inhibition of the COX-2 enzyme. Mostly as a result of these concerns, two COX-2 selective NSAIDs were taken off the market in the United States, and others have not been approved. Subsequent research has confirmed that there is large drug-specific variation in the risk of cardiovascular toxicity among both the COX-2 selective drugs and the non-selective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors.

         A 2017 Cochrane review included 11 randomized trials comparing different NSAIDS (eight trials) or a step III opioid with or without an NSAID (three trials); there were no trials comparing an NSAID with placebo [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Initially moderate or severe pain was reduced to no worse than mild pain after one or two weeks in four studies (totaling 415 participants), with a range of estimates between 26 and 51 percent in individual studies. All of the studies were at high risk of bias for lack of blinding, incomplete outcomes data, or small size. Common adverse events with NSAIDs were thirst/dry mouth (15 percent), loss of appetite (14 percent), somnolence, and dyspepsia (11 percent each). The authors concluded that there was no high-quality evidence to support or refute the benefit of NSAIDs, either alone or in combination with opioids, for any severity of cancer pain; there was very low-quality evidence that some patients with moderate to severe cancer pain can obtain substantial levels of benefit within one or two weeks.

         Based on clinical observations, NSAIDs may be especially useful in patients with bone pain or pain that is related to grossly inflammatory lesions. They are relatively less useful in patients who have neuropathic pain. (See

        <p>
         However, the utility of NSAIDs for cancer pain is limited by side effects and a "ceiling" dose for analgesia, above which additional dose increments fail to produce more relief.

         Patients who are deemed at high risk for peptic ulcer disease or its complications as a result of advanced age, a history of peptic ulcer disease or prior NSAID gastroduodenopathy, advanced illness or bleeding diathesis, or concurrent corticosteroid use should be considered to have a relative contraindication to use of an NSAID.

         Given the likelihood that all NSAIDs have at least some prothrombotic effects, patients who have a strong history of cardiovascular disease or evidence of cancer-related hypercoagulability (eg, a history of venous thrombosis) also should be considered to have a relative contraindication to NSAID therapy.

         All NSAIDs may cause serious nephrotoxicity, and preexisting renal disease (or strong predisposing factors, such as a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, or low perfusion states such as heart failure) represent contraindications to their use. NSAIDs should be prescribed with caution in patients with hypertension, renal insufficiency, or low renal perfusion states such as heart failure.

         Although epidemiologic studies indicate the existence of substantial differences in risk across specific NSAIDs, there are few adequate comparative trials, and firm conclusions are not possible. Nevertheless, in general, GI risk correlates with anti-inflammatory activity, and those NSAIDs whose analgesic and anti-inflammatory doses are similar (eg,

          celecoxib

        </p>
        <p>
         Pharmacologic approaches to preventing gastroduodenal toxicity include the concurrent use of a gastroprotectant (eg, a proton pump inhibitor [PPI] such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9718" href="/z/d/drug information/9718.html" rel="external">
          omeprazole

         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9657" href="/z/d/drug information/9657.html" rel="external">
          misoprostol
         </a>
         ). A PPI is preferred over other preventive approaches because of their convenience and relatively good safety profile [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. For patients over 60 who are receiving an NSAID, including
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8847" href="/z/d/drug information/8847.html" rel="external">
          celecoxib

         , we routinely coprescribe a PPI.
        </p>
        <p>
         We suggest coadministration of a PPI in patients who need an NSAID and who qualify as having moderate risk for gastrointestinal complications, as suggested in the AGA guidelines. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Gastrointestinal toxicity'

        </p>
        <p>
         At least some data suggest that
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9682" href="/z/d/drug information/9682.html" rel="external">
          naproxen
         </a>
         may have a lower risk of cardiovascular toxicity than other nonselective NSAIDs [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36,37
         </a>
         ]. However, there are conflicting data on this issue. Nevertheless, selection of naproxen is reasonable in a patient who is otherwise eligible for a trial of NSAID therapy if there is a relatively high concern about gastrointestinal or prothrombotic effects. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7968.html" rel="external">
          "NSAIDs: Adverse cardiovascular effects"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Because there is substantial variability in the response of individual patients to the various NSAIDs, the decision to try an NSAID may require several trials to identify the agent with the most favorable risk to benefit ratio. In addition to risk-related factors, there may be other important considerations as specific drugs are considered. For example, a past response to an NSAID may inform current drug selection. Pharmacokinetic considerations may also be important, in that an NSAID that can be given once daily (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9671" href="/z/d/drug information/9671.html" rel="external">
          nabumetone
         </a>
         ) or twice daily (many options) is usually better for fixed schedule, open-ended dosing. Cost and availability considerations may also be relevant considerations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Regardless of the agent chosen, all patients receiving an NSAID should be evaluated periodically for occult fecal blood, changes in blood pressure, and effects on renal or hepatic function.

In addition, for patients who begin therapy with an opioid alone, a trial of fixed-schedule dosing with acetaminophen may be considered in those who have mild residual pain, particularly if the patient is very sensitive to opioid side effects. However, severe liver damage may result from taking too much acetaminophen. When the maximum dose of acetaminophen is reached, an alternative strategy for pain control is needed. (See

         A trial of an NSAID is reasonable for a patient with mild to moderate cancer-related pain and no contraindication to the use of NSAIDs. Relative contraindications include a history of peptic ulcer disease or prior NSAID gastroduodenopathy, a bleeding diathesis, or concurrent corticosteroid use, strong history of cardiovascular disease, evidence of cancer-related hypercoagulability, or preexisting renal disease. Some expert groups endorse testing for
         <em>
          H. pylori

         for patients who are beginning NSAID therapy if they have a history of ulcer complications or a history of ulcer disease (non-bleeding). (See

         The choice of specific drug is empiric. NSAIDs that can be given once or twice daily are preferred  (

         For all patients taking an NSAID, we suggest using the lowest dose possible, and taking each dose with food and/or antacids.

         We suggest coadministration of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) in patients who require an NSAID and are at moderate risk for GI toxicity (
