The acute management, epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of nephrolithiasis in children are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6114.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in children: Acute management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6112.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in children: Epidemiology and risk factors"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6123.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in children: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In children and adolescents with nephrolithiasis, kidney stones recur frequently. This was illustrated in a large case series of 221 children from the Mayo Clinic that demonstrated two-thirds of the patients developed one or more additional stones at a mean follow-up of 59 months [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Other centers have reported a lower but still substantial recurrence rate of approximately 30 percent [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. The incidence of recurrent nephrolithiasis increases if there is an identified underlying metabolic abnormality that contributes to stone formation [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">GOAL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children who present with nephrolithiasis are at risk for recurrent disease. Thus, prevention of recurrent stone disease is a major clinical goal for any child with nephrolithiasis. Our practice of minimizing risk factors by identifying and correcting any metabolic abnormality associated with nephrolithiasis is, we believe, a reasonable approach in preventing recurrent disease in children.</p><p>The rationale for our approach is based upon the following observations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recurrent stone disease frequently occurs in children and adolescents with nephrolithiasis. Children with an underlying metabolic abnormality are more likely to have recurrent stones. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Several case series have demonstrated that over half of the children with nephrolithiasis will have an underlying metabolic abnormality that increases the risk of stone formation [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6112.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in children: Epidemiology and risk factors"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In adults, outcome data demonstrate that medical intervention reduces the rate of recurrent stone disease. Although similar data are not readily available for children, we believe these findings are directly applicable to the prevention of recurrent stones in children. These data in adults are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7373.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Prevention of recurrent kidney stones"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recurrent episodes of nephrolithiasis are associated with pain, school absenteeism, loss of work hours for the parent/caregiver(s), and clinical costs. In addition, there is evidence that recurrent stone disease may have long-term deleterious effects upon kidney function. (See <a class="local">'Outcome'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Additionally, identifying and evaluating a metabolic abnormality may diagnose an underlying genetic cause, which may have specific management implications. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">EVALUATION FOR UNDERLYING RISK FACTORS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Stone analysis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Any stone that is retrieved either through spontaneous passage or through surgical intervention should be sent to a laboratory with expertise in stone analysis to determine the stone composition. Knowing the composition of the stone can help focus the metabolic evaluation and guide therapeutic decisions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6112.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in children: Epidemiology and risk factors"</a> and <a class="local">'Preventive management'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Metabolic evaluation</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2646072536"><span class="h3">General principles</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As discussed above, all children with a kidney stone should be evaluated for underlying metabolic disorders that increase the risk of stone formation. (See <a class="local">'Goal'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6112.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in children: Epidemiology and risk factors", section on 'Overview of risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The metabolic evaluation should be performed while the patient is at home, fully ambulatory (assuming they are ambulatory at baseline), consuming a regular diet, and free of infection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If a stone has been retrieved and analyzed, the evaluation can be focused upon the specific components of the stone. As an example, in a child with calcium oxalate stones, urinary measurement of cystine is not necessary.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If a stone is not retrieved, we perform a complete metabolic evaluation that consists of both serum and urine testing as discussed in the following sections.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Serum tests</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Serum testing includes measurements of:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Complete blood count</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Basic metabolic panel </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Calcium, phosphorus, magnesium</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Uric acid</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Alkaline phosphatase</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If calcium or phosphorus concentrations are abnormal: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Parathyroid hormone</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations</p><p></p><p>Results of these studies may suggest potential etiologies: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypercalcemic or hypophosphatemic – If the patient is hypercalcemic or hypophosphatemic, measurement of serum parathyroid hormone levels is required to assess features of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. For instance, primary hyperparathyroidism could be the cause of hypercalcemia and kidney stones.

However, nephrolithiasis is not generally a presenting finding in these disorders.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Urine tests</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Urine metabolic abnormalities are detected by using the following: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>24-hour urine collection</strong> – Urinary abnormalities are best detected by measurements of urinary solute excretion from 24-hour urine collections  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70589" href="/d/graphic/70589.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Most commercial laboratories can measure all parameters on a single specimen. However, in some laboratories, two or three separate collections may be required if they test for different solutes using separate solutions. As examples, uric acid is measured in an alkaline solution, calcium and oxalate in hydrochloric or nitric acid, and citrate in an acidified solution. Clinicians need to check with the clinical laboratory that will be performing the studies to obtain the correct containers and instructions for collection. (See  <a class="medical medical_patient" href="/d/html/2181.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Collection of a 24-hour urine specimen (Beyond the Basics)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">To adequately assess kidney stone risk factors, 24-hour urine should be analyzed for volume, osmolality, creatinine, calcium, oxalate, uric acid, sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, ammonium, sulfate, and citrate, as well as crystal supersaturation for calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, and uric acid. The measurement of creatinine excretion can help determine the completeness of the 24-hour collection. The normal creatinine excretion rate varies by the ratio of lean body mass to total body mass of the individual, which is usually manifested by the age and sex of the patient. Composite normal 24-hour urinary creatinine excretion values based upon age for White children are listed in table 2  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80322" href="/d/graphic/80322.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Similar data for children of other ethnicities are lacking. Until such data exist, we have continued to use the above parameters in all children to check for completion of a 24-hour urine collection. Under collection can be inferred if the creatinine excretion is below the expected normative range and over collection if the creatinine excretion is above the expected normative range. Similarly, data regarding normal ranges for many urinary analytes related to kidney stone risk are not very robust, so clinical interpretation and judgement are warranted.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Spot urine sample</strong> – In some cases obtaining a 24-hour urine collection is difficult, especially in infants and children who are not toilet trained. As a result, normative values based upon a single urine sample have been developed  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82389" href="/d/graphic/82389.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Of note, in infants and small children, the solute to creatinine ratios are generally higher in random urine samples because of the lower creatinine excretion rates.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Urinalysis</strong> – Although urinalysis is performed during the acute presentation and diagnosis of nephrolithiasis, subsequent urinalysis performed when the patient is back to their normal daily routine may be useful in identifying and/or treating modifiable risk factors:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A high specific gravity or osmolality is indicative of a concentrated urine, which increases solute supersaturation and the risk for stone formation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A low urine pH demonstrates an acidic urine, which decreases the solubility of some solutes, such as uric acid and cystine, but increases solubility of calcium phosphorus.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Crystals detected by examination of the sediment may point towards a specific cause for nephrolithiasis. The presence of hexagonal cystine crystals  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56834" href="/d/graphic/56834.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) is diagnostic of cystinuria, while the presence of phosphate crystals in the urine sediment when the urine pH is above 7  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108401" href="/d/graphic/108401.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) is suggestive of calcium phosphate or struvite calculi.

Infants (one year of age or less) have higher urinary calcium excretion and lower urinary creatinine excretion than older children.

However, normative values by age vary depending on the assay method, and clinicians should be aware of the specific normative reference values for the assay used [<a href="#rid7">7,14-16</a>]. This was illustrated in a prospective study of 30 healthy infants in which the mean oxalate/creatinine ratio was 0.08 mg/mg (0.1 mmol/mmol) when using an enzymatic oxalate assay but was 0.13 mg/mg (0.16 mmol/mmol) when using a chemical-colorimetric method [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Serum tests'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Urine tests – To adequately assess kidney stone risk factors, 24-hour urine should be analyzed for volume, osmolality, creatinine, calcium, oxalate, uric acid, sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, ammonium, sulfate, and citrate, as well as crystal supersaturation for calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, and uric acid. In some cases, obtaining a 24-hour urine collection is difficult, especially in children who are not toilet trained. As a result, normative values based upon a single urine sample have been developed and complement the age-based standard values for a 24-hour urine collection  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70589" href="/d/graphic/70589.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82389" href="/d/graphic/82389.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See <a class="local">'Urine tests'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Urinalysis can provide additional information regarding urinary concentration and acidity and the possible presence of crystals that point to a specific underlying metabolic risk factor for stone formation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preventive management </strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Fluid intake – In all children with nephrolithiasis, high fluid intake is required to reduce the risk of recurrent stones. We use targeted 24-hour urine volumes based upon age along with urine osmolality or specific gravity to determine if the fluid intake is adequate. (See <a class="local">'Fluid intake'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Metabolic interventions – The therapeutic preventive interventions are based upon the underlying metabolic condition as follows for the three most common disorders:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Hypercalciuria – We suggest that children with hypercalciuria be initially managed with dietary measures and not with pharmacologic therapy (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). These measures include a low sodium diet and limiting calcium intake based on the United States Recommended Dietary Allowance for age. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">For children with recurrent calcium stones in whom dietary measures over a three to six month period fail to reduce urinary calcium levels, we suggest adding thiazide diuretic therapy and continue dietary measures versus only nonpharmacologic management (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Hypercalciuria'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Hyperoxaluria – Children with hyperoxaluria should be evaluated to determine the cause. For initial management of children with hyperoxaluria that is not due to primary hyperoxaluria, we suggest due measures to reduce enteric oxalate absorption (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). These include a high fluid intake, oral sodium or potassium carbonate or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="16457" href="/d/drug information/16457.html" rel="external">potassium citrate-citric acid</a> with meals to bind intestinal oxalate, and lowering dietary oxalate intake. Other therapeutic options, such as magnesium and pyrophosphate supplementation or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13152" href="/d/drug information/13152.html" rel="external">cholestyramine</a>, are generally needed in patients with secondary hyperabsorption of oxalate, and not in patients with idiopathic hyperoxaluria. Patients with suspected primary hyperoxaluria should be managed in consultation with an expert in the disorder. (See <a class="local">'Hyperoxaluria and oxalosis'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6141.html" rel="external">"Primary hyperoxaluria", section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Hypocitraturia – In children with hypocitraturia, we suggest enhancing citrate excretion with administration of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="16457" href="/d/drug information/16457.html" rel="external">potassium citrate-citric acid</a> (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Hypocitraturia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring</strong> – Monitoring includes imaging to detect new stone formation or increasing size of previous stones, and laboratory evaluation to assess the response to preventive medical therapy. Kidney ultrasonography is generally used as the imaging modality because of its lower radiation exposure and cost compared with noncontrast helical computed tomography. Ongoing adjustment of the metabolic interventions is based upon the results of laboratory monitoring.
