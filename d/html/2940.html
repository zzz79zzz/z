These anomalies can be caused by genetic abnormalities and/or environmental exposures, although the underlying etiology is often unknown. Congenital anomalies can be isolated or present in a characteristic combination or pattern that may affect one or more organ systems.</p><p>Evaluation of a child with a congenital anomaly includes a comprehensive history and physical examination. This is followed by further testing, as indicated. A general approach to evaluation is presented here. More detailed descriptions are included in the topic reviews of specific disorders. The types, patterns, and causes of congenital anomalies are also discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/110898.html" rel="external">"Congenital anomalies: Epidemiology, types, and patterns"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/110900.html" rel="external">"Congenital anomalies: Causes"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4022715672"><span class="h1">REFERRAL FOR INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Referral to a genetic specialist is suggested for any child that presents with a single major congenital anomaly or a combination of multiple anomalies, whether those are major or minor, since the risk for having a syndrome increases with the number of defects and many syndromes have clear genetic etiologies. In addition, any family history of a specific congenital anomaly or history of miscarriages and/or stillbirths should prompt referral to a geneticist. Other referrals may include plastic surgery for correction of structural limb anomalies (polydactyly, syndactyly) or for craniosynostoses, orthopedics for clubfoot deformities, ophthalmology for microphthalmia, and neurology for microcephaly.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H28"><span class="h1">HISTORY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prenatal history may uncover specific exposures and etiologic factors. The history taken should include medical and obstetric history, such as the duration of gestation, prenatal care, and maternal exposures (eg, alcohol, prescribed or illicit drugs, cigarettes, fevers, illnesses, chemicals, radiation). A history of stillbirths and miscarriages could be related to a balanced chromosomal rearrangement in one of the parents. Results of noninvasive and invasive prenatal testing, including ultrasound examinations, should be obtained. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4984.html" rel="external">"Assessment of the newborn infant", section on 'History'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/110900.html" rel="external">"Congenital anomalies: Causes"</a>.)</p><p>A complete family history and pedigree (ideally four generations) should be obtained to identify medical conditions related to the congenital anomaly or other medical issues that can impact the family's health (ie, multiple cancers, susceptibility to infections, neurodegenerative disorders). The age of the parents is important because the incidence of chromosome aneuploidies is increased in older mothers, and new autosomal dominant pathogenic variants (eg, achondroplasia, neurofibromatosis type 1) are more commonly seen with older fathers due to advanced paternal age. The family should be asked about consanguinity, which may suggest the possibility of autosomal recessive disorders. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/452.html" rel="external">"Congenital cytogenetic abnormalities", section on 'Numeric abnormalities'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/103825.html" rel="external">"Achondroplasia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2939.html" rel="external">"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1): Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>Determining ethnic/racial origin may be helpful because some diseases are more prevalent in certain ethnic/racial groups. As an example, postaxial polydactyly is more frequent in Black people, with a prevalence of 1.3 percent [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. This congenital anomaly can result from an autosomal dominant trait. Polydactyly is linked to a determined set of homeobox genes, transcription factors, and Wnt signaling. A careful family history should be obtained when evaluating a child with polydactyly since penetrance for this trait can be incomplete.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H29"><span class="h1">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A thorough physical examination should be performed. In addition to standard measurements of weight, length, and head circumference, measurements of specific body structures may be helpful. They can be compared with age-, sex-, and population-matched standard measurements [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4984.html" rel="external">"Assessment of the newborn infant", section on 'Physical examination'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2865.html" rel="external">"The pediatric physical examination: General principles and standard measurements", section on 'Physical examination'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2865.html" rel="external">"The pediatric physical examination: General principles and standard measurements", section on 'Standard measurements'</a>.)</p><p>The standard measurements used in clinical genetics include the commonly used head circumference (occipital frontal circumference), height/length, and weight. Arm span and lower segment/upper segment are often obtained in children with short stature and/or suspected skeletal dysplasias and are also used for assessment of persons with connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13551.html" rel="external">"Skeletal dysplasias: Approach to evaluation", section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>Measurements of craniofacial structures can be valuable to confirm suspected clinical findings and help delineation of syndromes. They are often performed by clinical geneticists and can be useful in the same way growth charts are for the pediatrician. In addition, to confirm findings, measurements are done when there is uncertainty about a clinical diagnostic decision. These measurements include ear length, inner canthal distance, outer canthal distance, interpupillary distance, palpebral fissures length, and philtrum length (extends from the nasal septum to the upper vermilion border). Other frequently used measurements include hands, feet, and digits length to assess for brachydactyly or arachnodactyly.</p><p>In newborns and fetuses, the placenta and umbilical cord should also be examined. Two-vessel cord is often associated with structural congenital heart defects. Intrauterine growth retardation can result from a diseased placenta (chromosomal mosaicism in the placenta, vascular abnormalities like thrombi or infarction) that interferes with growth. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4984.html" rel="external">"Assessment of the newborn infant", section on 'Umbilical cord'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2865.html" rel="external">"The pediatric physical examination: General principles and standard measurements"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5393.html" rel="external">"Gross examination of the placenta"</a>.)</p><p>Examination of family members may assist with the evaluation of some abnormalities. One example is the child with holoprosencephaly. One of the parents may have a single incisor or hypotelorism, representing a mild manifestation of the same disorder. Another example is Treacher-Collins syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder in which a parent can have minimal microtia or mild underdevelopment of malar facial structures that may have been missed on previous examinations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2920.html" rel="external">"Overview of craniofacial clefts and holoprosencephaly", section on 'Holoprosencephaly'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2926.html" rel="external">"Syndromes with craniofacial abnormalities", section on 'Treacher Collins syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>The physical exam is a powerful tool for geneticists and clinicians. The following list highlights some of the most important dysmorphic features assessed by the exam in the genetics clinic, which is not all that different than any regular pediatrics exam. Some of the abnormalities listed are paired with examples of common genetic disorders in which those features are encountered.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cranium size and

Testing is performed for specific infectious agents (eg, TORCH infections [toxoplasmosis, other, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes virus], Zika virus) or maternal autoimmune disorders, for example, if findings suggest one of these causes. Diagnostic genetic testing is performed if a specific genetic defect is suspected based upon the initial evaluation. A broader genetic screening tool is used if no specific diagnoses are identified with the history and physical examination.

The majority of children that present with a single or multiple congenital anomalies are studied first for the presence of chromosome abnormalities. Specialized testing is performed if a neurologic presentation includes hypotonia or suspicion of visceromegaly (eg, peroxisomal studies for Zellweger syndrome, serum cholesterol precursors for Smith-Lemli-Opitz, organic acids in urine for glutaric acidemia type I). Exome sequencing has aided significantly in the identification of rare single gene disorders. Exome sequencing, ideally a trio sequencing (patient and both parents), should be used in cases with multiple congenital anomalies with or without intellectual disabilities where there is no identified genetic defect and chromosome microarray studies were normal. Genome sequencing is increasingly used in the clinical setting. This technique allows the sequencing of exons, introns, and regulatory regions and may be suitable to determine copy number variation changes as well. Genome sequencing can therefore provide information obtained by both exome sequencing and chromosome microarray studies.

Use of aCGH has increased the detection yield to 12 to 15 percent compared with conventional chromosome studies that have a detection yield of approximately 5 to 7 percent [<a href="#rid8">8-11</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2893.html" rel="external">"Tools for genetics and genomics: Cytogenetics and molecular genetics"</a>.)</p><p>FISH studies were often used as confirmatory studies after an abnormality (particularly a microdeletion or microduplication) was detected by aCGH. They are widely used in prenatal screening performed on amniotic fluid samples. Traditional chromosome studies are often performed as a second-tier evaluation when an abnormality is detected by aCGH but the specific cause cannot be determined. As an example, aCGH can identify a loss or gain of material. However, in the case of a gain, it may not identify where the gain of material is localized. A gain may be the result of chromosome region duplication, a translocation, an insertion of an extra chromosome piece in a different chromosome, or a marker chromosome (a structurally abnormal chromosome results in a partial trisomy).</p><p>Indications for aCGH include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One or more major anomalies (eg, congenital heart disease)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Three or more minor anomalies</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unexplained intellectual disability with or without dysmorphic features or other anomalies, autism spectrum disorders (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6189.html" rel="external">"Intellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unexplained growth retardation or failure to thrive (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5834.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2864.html" rel="external">"Poor weight gain in children younger than two years in resource-abundant settings: Etiology and evaluation"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Any congenital anomaly and a family history of congenital anomalies and/or multiple miscarriages</p><p></p><p>Some arrays used in clinical medicine include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

WES analyzes the exons or coding regions of approximately 20,000 genes simultaneously using next-generation sequencing techniques. This test is extremely valuable for uncovering changes in Mendelian genes (single genes) responsible for medical disorders. By sequencing the exome of a patient and comparing it with the normal reference sequence, variations in an individual's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence can be identified and related back to the individual's medical concerns in an effort to discover the cause of the medical disorder.</p><p>The analysis and interpretation of WES are rapidly improving. Several factors have played a role in the rapid evolution of WES and the changing capacities of this genetic technology. The ability to identify variants of clinical significance depends upon two modifying variables: the current state of the art of the sequencing technology used as far as the depth of the sequencing (the number of times a region is repetitively sequenced to assure the entire region is examined) and the robustness of the "standard reference." As an example, WES detected causative pathogenic variants in 25 to 27 percent of children with complex malformations and and/or severe developmental disorders in two initial studies [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. A WES reanalysis of the second study of 1133 children with severe undiagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders and/or congenital anomalies, dysmorphic features, abnormal growth, or unusual behavioral phenotypes using improved data and methodologies identified additional causal monogenic defects in a further 182 individuals, bringing the overall diagnostic yield to 40 percent [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. By comparison, in a study of WES in 278 infants in the intensive care unit (ICU) with congenital anomalies, hypotonia, seizures, abnormal growth, feeding difficulties, respiratory failure, and/or metabolic acidosis, a molecular diagnosis was identified in 37 percent [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. In this study, 32 out of 63 cases were correctly diagnosed using trio WES (patient and parents sequencing at the same time) with a 51 percent yield. In 52 to 72 percent of the cases, depending upon the group selected, the care was redirected secondary to the diagnosis.</p><p>An underlying genetic pathogenic variant is still possible, even if nothing is detected on WES. WES is not suitable for the detection of microdeletions or microduplications that can be detected by chromosome microarrays. Whole genome sequencing (WGS), in contrast to WES, may detect larger deletions or duplications, triple repeat expansions, and pathogenic variants in deep intronic regions; regulatory regions that are outside of the coding regions; and untranslated gene regions. However, WGS is a more costly screening tool that has its own limitations. Testing technologies that are mostly used in clinical research include long read sequencing [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. This technique allows detection of complex structural variants not accessible to other sequencing methods.

MRI is best suited to examining brain structures to determine myelination, white matter development, structural anomalies, and migration defects. Head CT scans can be useful for craniosynostosis where enhanced viewing with bone windows can accurately determine premature suture fusion or closing. Radiographs of the entire body, also known as skeletal surveys, are indicated when limb anomalies are present or dwarfism is suspected due to prenatal or postnatal growth restriction.

Size and position of the kidneys can be assessed, along with an evaluation for abnormalities of the ureters, uterine malformations (which may require MRI studies), and testicular position.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H168844496"><span class="h1">ADDITIONAL SUBSPECIALTY REFERRAL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Further subspecialty referrals may be required to evaluate the patient with a genetic defect. One important referral is to ophthalmology to ascertain a number of features that can be seen in multiple genetic disorders, including colobomas of the irides and/or optic nerve (CHARGE association [coloboma, heart defects, atresia choanae, retarded growth and development, genitourinary anomalies, ear abnormalities]), optic nerve atrophy, retinitis pigmentosa (Cockayne syndrome), cataracts (storage disorders such as the mucopolysaccharidoses), lens dislocations (Marfan syndrome), and optic gliomas (neurofibromatosis type 1). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83396.html" rel="external">"DiGeorge (22q11.2 deletion) syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'CHARGE syndrome'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6226.html" rel="external">"Neuropathies associated with hereditary disorders", section on 'Cockayne syndrome'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2932.html" rel="external">"Mucopolysaccharidoses: Complications"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8151.html" rel="external">"Management of Marfan syndrome and related disorders"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2939.html" rel="external">"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1): Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H24473736"><span class="h1">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, "The Basics" and "Beyond the Basics." The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on "patient info" and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Basics topic (see  <a class="medical medical_basics" href="/d/html/82980.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Newborn appearance (The Basics)"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H31"><span class="h1">SUMMARY</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Terminology and etiology</strong> – A congenital anomaly refers to an anatomic structural anomaly present at birth. These defects can be caused by genetic abnormalities and/or environmental exposures (teratogens), although the underlying etiology is often unknown. Specific terms are used to describe congenital anomalies  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57394" href="/d/graphic/57394.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In addition, multiple malformations are often grouped in a recognizable pattern  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75281" href="/d/graphic/75281.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/110900.html" rel="external">"Congenital anomalies: Causes"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/110898.html" rel="external">"Congenital anomalies: Epidemiology, types, and patterns"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – Evaluation of a child with a congenital anomaly includes a comprehensive history and physical examination. This is followed by further testing as indicated. (See <a class="local">'History'</a> above and <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>History</strong> – The prenatal history may uncover specific exposures and etiologic factors. A complete family history (including parental age and consanguinity) and pedigree (four generations, if possible) should be obtained to help uncover genetic causes. Determining ethnic/racial origin may be helpful because some diseases are more prevalent in certain ethnic/racial groups. (See <a class="local">'History'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Physical examination</strong> – A thorough physical examination should be performed. In addition to standard measurements of weight, length, and head circumference, measurements of specific structures may be helpful depending upon the presenting features. The patient is also examined for dysmorphic features. (See <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Laboratory evaluation</strong> – Laboratory evaluation depends in part upon the results of the history and physical examination. Testing is performed for specific infectious agents (eg, TORCH infections [toxoplasmosis, other, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes virus], Zika virus) or maternal autoimmune disorders, for example, if findings suggest one of these causes. Diagnostic genetic testing is performed if a specific genetic defect is suspected based upon the initial evaluation. A broader genetic screening tool (array comparative genomic hybridization [aCGH]) is used followed by whole exome sequencing (WES) or whole genome sequencing (WGS) as needed if no specific diagnoses are identified with the history and physical examination. (See <a class="local">'Laboratory studies'</a> above.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Meyerson MD, Weddington GT.
