All units undergo laboratory testing for selected infectious organisms. Aspects of the donor history and laboratory testing that are used to reduce the risk of complications from blood transfusion are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7949.html" rel="external">"Blood donor screening: Overview of recipient and donor protections"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7950.html" rel="external">"Blood donor screening: Medical history"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7946.html" rel="external">"Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing"</a>.)</p><p>Units of packed RBCs are manufactured by one of the following methods:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Component separation from individual units of whole blood</strong> – The majority of RBC units are manufactured by the routine separation of donated units of whole blood (typical volume, 450 to 500 mL) into various components by centrifugation. There are a number of centrifugation protocols used and methods of plasma extraction. The components typically prepared from whole blood include packed RBCs, plasma, and sometimes platelets. The final volumes and contents of these components are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53854" href="/d/graphic/53854.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>RBC apheresis</strong> – In the United States, 15 to 20 percent of RBC units are collected via apheresis, in which a donor who has a sufficiently high hematocrit is connected to an apheresis device that separates red cells from other blood constituents [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. In the most common procedure, two RBC units are collected at the time of phlebotomy, and the other cellular and plasma constituents are infused back to the donor in the closed apheresis system. Alternatively, a single RBC unit can be collected along with a unit of platelets and/or plasma. There are at least three RBC apheresis systems that differ slightly from each other in their methods of RBC separation and storage solutions. (See <a class="local">'Anticoagulant-preservative (A-P) solutions'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>The number of RBCs in a unit derived from whole blood may vary according to the hemoglobin level of the donor; all units will provide a minimum amount. In contrast, apheresis units are collected in such a way that the target number of RBCs per unit is more standardized. However, both collection methods provide adequate RBCs for transfusion. While the source of RBCs (whole blood-derived versus apheresis) may theoretically affect the post-transfusion hemoglobin increment, it has not been demonstrated to affect clinically important outcomes, as discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Donor and component characteristics potentially affecting recipient outcome'</a> below.) </p><p>In both cases, plastic storage bags permit separation of components while preserving sterility, and preservative solutions are used to prolong the shelf-life. (See <a class="local">'Storage bags'</a> below and <a class="local">'Anticoagulant-preservative (A-P) solutions'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H291800971"><span class="h2">Storage bags</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Blood storage bags made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) became available in the early 1960s. These bags permit the separation of collected blood into red cells, plasma, and platelets, in a closed and sterile environment. The plasticizer used in red cell PVC storage bags in the United States and most other jurisdictions is di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), which is instrumental in preserving the integrity of the red cell membrane during prolonged in vitro storage, probably as a direct result of small amounts of DEHP leaching into the stored RBC unit.</p><p>Although no deleterious effects have been linked to patient exposure to DEHP in transfused RBC units, such exposure from other medical devices has been an ongoing patient safety concern, and this concern has extended to recipients of blood transfusions, especially populations such as neonates, who might be especially vulnerable to potential adverse effects of DEHP or its more toxic metabolites. These concerns have sparked an ongoing attempt to develop a potentially less-toxic plasticizer that can also preserve red cell membrane integrity [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3849575061"><span class="h2">Anticoagulant-preservative (A-P) solutions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A major breakthrough in preserving blood came with the development of the first anticoagulant-preservative (A-P) solution, acid citrate dextrose (ACD), in the early 1940s. This allowed blood to be stored for up to 21 days. Prior to this, red cells could only be stored for brief periods in a citrate-glucose solution. It was not until the 1930s that blood was transfused after storage. The first blood "bank" was established at Cook County Hospital in Chicago in 1937.</p><p>During the ensuing years, significant progress was made in the development of other A-P solutions:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Citrate phosphate dextrose (CPD) – 21-day (three-week) storage</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>CPD-adenine – 35-day (five-week) storage</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Current generation additive solutions – 42-day (six-week) storage</p><p></p><p>These additive solutions improve the RBC shelf-life by maintaining pH and other essential biochemical parameters. A benefit of the extended storage duration is that fewer collections are lost through outdating. However, as noted below, the average storage duration for RBCs is less than three weeks. (See <a class="local">'RBC age/storage duration effect on clinical outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p>In the United States, the current generation of additive solutions are denoted by the terminology AS-1, AS-3, and AS-5, representing slightly different formulations from different manufacturers. In Europe, the solution used is <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a>, adenine, glucose, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9587" href="/d/drug information/9587.html" rel="external">mannitol</a> (SAGM), which is very similar to AS-1. The volume of additive solution is smaller than the volume of plasma removed, resulting in a smaller volume and higher hematocrit than in the original unit of whole blood.</p><p>In modern practice, whole blood is collected into an anticoagulant solution. Subsequently the additive (preservative) solution is added to the manufactured RBC units through an integral bag system shortly after collection and component preparation. This or a similar procedure is used for apheresis-derived RBC units, although the details may vary slightly depending on the apheresis system used.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When CPD-adenine (CPD-A1) is used as the A-P solution, the final volume of the unit is approximately 225 to 350 mL and the hematocrit is approximately 65 to 80 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When one of the AS systems is used, virtually all of the plasma is removed and replaced with approximately 100 mL of storage solution. This results in a final volume of the unit of approximately 300 to 400 mL, and a hematocrit of approximately 55 to 65 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The final hematocrit of apheresis-derived units is approximately 55 to 60 percent, and the volume is targeted to be approximately 175 mL but may be higher.</p><p></p><p>There have been (and continue to be) attempts to further improve the quality of RBC units during and at the end of their 42-day storage period. To this end, a newer additive solution (AS-7) was approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2015 [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>]. However, for commercial reasons, it is not in widespread use in the United States [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>].</p><p>Units that require prolonged storage (eg, due to extremely rare blood type) can be frozen. (See <a class="local">'Frozen red cells'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3048322794"><span class="h2">Pre-storage leukoreduction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Each unit of whole blood or packed RBCs contains approximately two to five billion (2 to 5 x 10<sup>9</sup>) leukocytes (white blood cells [WBCs]), which are collected along with the other cellular elements. These leukocytes are thought to contribute to a number of adverse effects including febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTRs), human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alloimmunization, and transmission of cytomegalovirus (CMV, which resides intracellularly in WBCs), as well as other inflammatory and immunologically mediated events. In rare cases, leukocytes may contribute to transmission of intracellular bacterial organisms. </p><p>Leukoreduction refers to the selective removal of leukocytes by passing the blood through a leukocyte reduction filter, which can achieve a three to four log (99.9 to 99.99 percent) reduction in the leukocyte count of the unit, leaving the final leukocyte count &lt;5 million (&lt;5 x 10<sup>6</sup>; the FDA-required limit) and generally &lt;1 million. This dramatically reduces or in some cases eliminates the risks of adverse events such as FNHTRs, HLA alloimmunization, and CMV transmission [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Certain populations at risk for these complications should routinely receive leukoreduced blood products. This includes the following [<a href="#rid8">8-10</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronically transfused patients</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with previous FNHTRs</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients undergoing cardiac surgery</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>All recipients (or potential recipients) of solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplants</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>All individuals with acute leukemia, and probably individuals with other malignancies</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>CMV seronegative at-risk patients for whom seronegative components are not supplied</p><p></p><p>Clinicians who order transfusions should familiarize themselves with the policies of their jurisdiction and local blood bank regarding leukoreduction, which may involve routine or universal pre-storage leukoreduction, provision of leukoreduced products only to patients in certain hospital wards (eg, bone marrow transplant unit, cardiac surgery suite), or the need to request leukoreduced products for selected individuals. </p><p>Leukoreduction can be performed at the time of blood collection (referred to as pre-storage leukoreduction) or at the time of transfusion (bedside leukoreduction). Pre-storage leukoreduction of RBC units is achieved by use of one of several specialized leukoreduction filters, which can be used at different points in the manufacturing process (eg, for whole blood-derived units, filtration can be done on the whole blood unit or the derived RBC unit; for RBC apheresis collections, filtration can occur during or shortly after collection). The FDA requires that leukoreduced RBC units must not lose more than 15 percent of their starting hemoglobin (RBC) content; the usual loss for most licensed systems is approximately 7 to 8 percent [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>Bedside leukoreduction is not commonly performed. This is because pre-storage leukoreduction is preferable. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pre-storage leukoreduction achieves a greater degree of leukocyte removal.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pre-storage leukoreduction provides greater quality control and standardization; some staff may be unfamiliar with bedside leukoreduction filters and may use them incorrectly.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pre-storage leukoreduction avoids the accumulation of cytokines released by leukocytes into the storage bag. These secreted cytokines may contribute to febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTRs). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7947.html" rel="external">"Immunologic transfusion reactions", section on 'Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rarely, bedside leukoreduction may be associated with hypotensive reactions.</p><p></p><p>Leukoreduction does not interfere with any subsequent modifications (see <a class="local">'Specialized modifications and products'</a> below), and it adds only a small additional cost to each RBC unit. It has been suggested that the cost of leukoreduction is less than the cost of treating the consequences of using non-leukoreduced blood [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. However, the up-front cost is higher.</p><p>If cost considerations allow, leukoreduction would ideally be performed on all cellular components intended for transfusion for all patients. The policy of universal leukoreduction is standard practice in many developed countries, while a minority of other countries (including the United States) have yet to require universal leukoreduction as the standard of care. Nevertheless, many United States blood collectors have implemented universal leukoreduction. The proportion of RBC units that are pre-storage leukoreduced in the United States has been estimated at 85 to 95 percent [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>One issue related to routine pre-storage leukoreduction is that blood from donors with sickle cell trait may block the leukoreduction filters in some instances. The blood bank will typically employ various strategies to reduce the incidence of filter blockage (eg, cooling) and may defer certain donors if there is difficulty filtering their blood after the second failed attempt. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7145.html" rel="external">"Sickle cell trait", section on 'Leukoreduction'</a>.)</p><p>Importantly, leukoreduction is <strong>not </strong>sufficient to prevent transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (ta-GVHD) in susceptible populations, because a small number of viable lymphocytes remain in the unit. These individuals should receive blood that has been irradiated. (See <a class="local">'Irradiation'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1227263164"><span class="h2">Storage/transport temperature</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Regulations require that RBC units be stored under refrigeration at controlled temperatures of 1 to 6°C to maintain the viability of the red cells and to prevent the growth of bacteria.</p><p>When transported between facilities (eg, from a blood collection facility to a hospital or between hospitals), the storage temperature must be maintained at 1 to 10°C. When units are transported from the blood bank to another part of the hospital for transfusion, they should be transported under the same controlled temperature conditions.</p><p>For hospital transfusion services that are accredited by the Association for the Advancement of Blood &amp; Biotherapies (AABB), an AABB Standard requires that each hospital establish and validate procedures to ensure that units eligible for reissue (ie, units that have been issued for a given patient but have not been used and have subsequently been returned to the blood bank) have been maintained at an appropriate temperature while outside of the hospital blood bank (ie, between 1 to 6°C or 1 to 10°C depending on local hospital policy) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>In the United States, there is no FDA requirement for how long an RBC unit can be exposed to uncontrolled temperatures (eg, room temperature &gt;10°C) before being returned to refrigerator storage and subsequently reissued to another patient.</p><p>In some other countries, policies state that RBC units must be discarded if they have been outside of controlled temperature conditions for longer than 30 or 60 minutes on any given occasion, as can occur if the unit is released to the ward for an intended patient but is not transfused and is returned to the hospital blood bank [<a href="#rid15">15-17</a>]. Policies had previously limited the duration outside of controlled temperature conditions for 30 minutes, based on historical data from the 1970s related to red cell quality and concerns about bacterial proliferation in the very uncommon circumstance where the stored RBC unit contains viable organisms [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. However, newer studies have shown that RBC units can be maintained outside controlled temperature conditions for up to 60 minutes without either of these adverse effects, which has led some countries to extend the time to 60 minutes [<a href="#rid15">15-17</a>]. This policy change may reduce wastage of RBC units.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H514204959"><span class="h2">RBC licensure requirements</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the United States, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) regulates the collection of blood and blood components used for transfusion. All blood establishments that collect, manufacture, prepare, store under controlled conditions for further distribution, or process blood and blood products are required to register with the FDA. In addition, a blood establishment must be licensed by the FDA if it intends to distribute blood products across state lines. An FDA license indicates that the facility producing the product meets current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) standards, as is determined by inspection at regular intervals. Most blood collectors and transfusion services also seek accreditation by the AABB by demonstrating conformance with that organization's Blood Bank/Transfusion Services Standards, which are intended to maintain and enhance quality and safety.</p><p>CBER also licenses products such as blood collection containers, additive storage solutions, and cell separation (apheresis) devices. The two criteria used by the FDA to license anticoagulant-preservative (A-P) solutions and blood storage bags have not changed much over the past several decades [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Recovery</strong> – One of the criteria is to measure the 24-hour recovery of autologous, radiolabeled red cells in healthy individuals after different intervals of storage. This is done by radiolabeling an aliquot of RBCs with radioactive chromium 51.

Thus, while the initial concentration of extracellular potassium in an RBC unit is approximately 2 to 5 mEq/L, it rises to levels of 45 to 60 mEq/L at the end of storage. In irradiated RBC units, the potassium concentration is higher on any given day, and the peak level at the end of 42-day storage is approximately 70 to 90 mEq/L [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. Despite this phenomenon, the risk of hyperkalemia from transfusion is rare in adults because the volume of the extracellular component of packed RBCs is small.
