Prostate cancer is a common cancer, and because it is frequently an indolent disease and modern treatments have improved survival, the population of survivors is growing and aging. It is estimated that there were more than 3.5 million males with a history of prostate cancer living in the United States as of January 1, 2022 [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Prostate cancer survivors may be cared for by oncologists, urologists, and/or primary care providers (PCPs). Prostate cancer survivorship care guidelines were published by the American Cancer Society in 2014 [<a href="#rid2">2</a>] and subsequently, relevant primary care issues were reviewed in 2016 [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. This topic will incorporate and update these guidelines with the goal of informing a rational approach to the care of the prostate cancer survivor and their partner. The information provided is targeted at both specialists and PCPs, who are increasingly confronted with managing survivorship issues in patients with a history of cancer. A general overview of cancer survivorship care for primary care and oncology providers is presented elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16613.html" rel="external">"Overview of cancer survivorship care for primary care and oncology providers"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1382672155"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer in American men; one in eight males will be diagnosed during their lifetime [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The average age at diagnosis is 66, and 60 percent of all cases are diagnosed after age 65. Although generally considered a disease of older men, the incidence of prostate cancer has been increasing globally in both adolescents and younger males [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6938.html" rel="external">"Risk factors for prostate cancer", section on 'Age'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2853667912"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO CANCER SURVIVORSHIP</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3679904971"><span class="h2">Definition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The term "cancer survivor" has been used variably in the literature; most commonly, a cancer survivor refers to any person who has been diagnosed with cancer. Therefore, survivorship begins at the time of diagnosis and includes the periods of initial treatment with intent to cure, cancer-free survival, chronic or intermittent disease, and end-of-life care [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].This definition is consistent with those provided by The National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship [<a href="#rid7">7</a>] and the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cancer.gov%2Fpublications%2Fdictionaries%2Fcancer-terms%2Fdef%2Fsurvivor&amp;token=BqRqr5fpGBraGHLK%2FOOP143ThcdLS1gxkzX6%2B0HBLKyELCGo8iZNLrhjAFEZzc4seFPk6%2BRu06QxiKXeyNHY1ek0W6q5r8EG7F2IHXctI88%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=14235" target="_blank">National Cancer Institute</a>, which define a person as a cancer survivor from the moment of a cancer diagnosis through the balance of their life.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2334020171"><span class="h2">General components of survivorship care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The transition from active treatment to post-treatment care is critical to long-term health. A committee established by the Institute of Medicine to examine the range of medical and psychosocial issues faced by cancer survivors recommended the following components of survivorship care [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Surveillance for cancer recurrence or second cancers</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prevention of recurrent and new cancers and of other late effects</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assessment of medical and psychosocial late effects and consequences of cancer and its treatment.

Therefore, it is important for cancer specialists (urologists and medical and/or radiation oncologists) and PCPs to clearly communicate who will take responsibility for the different aspects of cancer surveillance to avoid duplicate prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, and the thresholds for referral back to specialty care. This may be done in the form of a treatment summary (from the treating providers to the PCP) or may be contained in the surveillance portion of a survivorship care plan. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6928.html" rel="external">"Follow-up surveillance after definitive local treatment for prostate cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17020.html" rel="external">"Assuring quality of care for cancer survivors: The survivorship care plan"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3503301779"><span class="h3">General principles guiding follow-up</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clinicians should ensure that appropriate testing is being done to monitor for disease progression/recurrence both during and after treatment. Post-treatment cancer surveillance generally includes periodic PSA testing. If the PSA begins to rise, another PSA should be drawn a month later with explicit instructions to avoid ejaculation or trauma to the perineum (bicycle or motorcycle riding) with 48 hours of the repeat blood test. Confirmation of a rising PSA should prompt referral back to the specialist for further workup and staging. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring for recurrence and/or disease progression'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In addition to routine interval history and physical examination, other aspects of follow-up should include an attention to cardiovascular health, with screening and management strategies that are similar to guidelines for the general population. Males diagnosed with prostate cancer have a greater incidence of cardiovascular disease than age matched males without prostate cancer [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1505.html" rel="external">"Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease (secondary prevention) or at very high risk"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Quality of life surveillance should ideally be performed periodically. This can be done using a validated one page instrument that addresses urinary, sexual, bowel, and vitality domains (eg, <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bidmc.org%2F-%2Fmedia%2Ffiles%2Fbeth-israel-org%2Fcenters-and-departments%2Fcancer-center%2Fprostate-cancer-center%2Fepic-cp.pdf%3Futm_source%3Dbidmc%26utm_medium%3Dvanity%26utm_campaign%3Depic&amp;token=2ieccMn%2BnMZO9Tilgh8fdH2ioIC0nYGiVQF%2B%2F%2FtaGVP9O5BXY3143ZZ8ERA9zSbfXA1%2F8niLB%2B0o2uNfAXLcrjXuaAzWiajAAm2qjHFTHEpp2BE7o6Dwfn%2B7NPxRhA2E7rsbCiXbdyyo8bsqULUgRqkTAQQmP%2BgpUhjz02CgzvZ7FkHMRUD8eR%2F1qjWCstl5&amp;TOPIC_ID=14235" target="_blank">Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice [EPIC-CP</a>]) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Periodic evaluation and management of the patient for sexual dysfunction should also include partner evaluation, if the patient has a partner, and referral to a sexual health clinician if warranted. Screening and assessment of male sexual dysfunction should utilize one of several validated instruments, such as the International Index of Erectile Dysfunction (IIEF,  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef98030" href="/z/d/graphic/98030.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), or the Sexual Health Inventory for Men, also called IIEF-5  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef97456" href="/z/d/graphic/97456.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The subject of screening for sexual dysfunction in male cancer survivors is discussed in detail separately, and a discussion of sexual dysfunction following prostate cancer treatment specifically is presented below. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/100080.html" rel="external">"Overview of sexual dysfunction in male cancer survivors", section on 'Sexual health questionnaires'</a> and <a class="local">'Sexual dysfunction'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In addition to these issues, general guidelines for the follow-up of cancer survivors, including encouragement of a healthy lifestyle, should also be discussed with patients. These include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Dietary modification towards micronutrient-rich and phytochemical-rich vegetables and fruits, low amounts of saturated fat, at least 600 international units of vitamin D daily, and adequate amounts of dietary sources of calcium (ie, not to exceed 1200 mg/day), per American Cancer Society (ACS) Nutrition and Physical Activity guidelines for cancer survivors [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14222.html" rel="external">"The roles of diet, physical activity, and body weight in cancer survivors"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Physical activity/exercise is a vital component to improve or maintain general health as well as to mitigate the side effects of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

Those with physical limitations, including metastatic disease, should be supervised by an exercise physiologist with expertise in treating cancer patients for a personalized exercise prescription [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">These recommendations are also supported by year 2019 evidence-based recommendations from the American College of Sports Medicine in conjunction with the ACS and National Cancer institute that encourage the systematic use of an "exercise prescription" by health care workers and fitness professionals for people living with and beyond cancer [<a href="#rid17">17-19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Although excess consumption of alcohol should be avoided, at least some data from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study support the view that moderate consumption of alcohol (15 to 30 g/day of total alcohol) is safe in males with a diagnosis of prostate cancer [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Fourteen to 15 g of alcohol (0.5 to 0.6 fluid ounces) is equivalent to 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of 80 proof liquor.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Smoking cessation strategies should be encouraged for general health benefits in all men. However, prostate cancer survivors should be advised that smoking is associated with an increased risk of recurrence and mortality after radical prostatectomy [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">These topics are all discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16613.html" rel="external">"Overview of cancer survivorship care for primary care and oncology providers", section on 'Components of posttreatment follow-up'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16613.html" rel="external">"Overview of cancer survivorship care for primary care and oncology providers", section on 'Limitation in alcohol consumption'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14222.html" rel="external">"The roles of diet, physical activity, and body weight in cancer survivors"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3143530135"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF PROSTATE CANCER TREATMENT OPTIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial management of males with newly diagnosed prostate cancer depends on disease extent and an estimation of the risk of disease progression to disseminated, potentially fatal disease. Clinical staging is based on a digital rectal examination by an experienced clinician to assess the extent of disease, the pretreatment serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the Gleason grade group in the initial biopsy  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107132" href="/z/d/graphic/107132.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), and the extent of cancer involvement in the biopsy cores. This information allows the stratification of males into specific risk categories for disease progression. Most clinicians in North America use the risk categories as defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118962" href="/z/d/graphic/118962.html" rel="external">table 4</a>), which have been used in multiple professional society guidelines [<a href="#rid22">22-26</a>], but other risk stratification systems are in use [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6943.html" rel="external">"Localized prostate cancer: Risk stratification and choice of initial treatment", section on 'Risk stratification'</a>.)</p><p>Imaging studies (radionuclide bone scan, computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging) are used selectively to assess for extraprostatic extension, regional adenopathy, or distant metastases, depending on the initial clinical staging and estimate of risk; pretreatment imaging for distant metastases is not routinely recommended for very low- and low-risk disease according to the clinical staging system described above, while it is recommended for more advanced disease. On the basis of imaging, patients can be further classified as having regional (pelvic nodes) or metastatic (distant sites or lymph nodes above the bifurcation) disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16992.html" rel="external">"Initial staging and evaluation of males with newly diagnosed prostate cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H85113912"><span class="h2">Localized disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment decisions for localized prostate cancer are complicated and preference sensitive because of the differences in the specific risks and benefits of the various treatment choices  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef134399" href="/z/d/graphic/134399.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). Patient-clinician shared decision making can facilitate selecting a treatment that best aligns with the patient's personal values, and it is recommended in professional society guidelines. A particularly useful tool can be found on the website <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpatientprioritiescare.org%2F&amp;token=9tpqcWj1mUlRbFo1Ik2iEWjDfoauPCJR4QRfQ0TCsIzkfB0LoAuwnPuGf3vA%2Bxyw&amp;TOPIC_ID=14235" target="_blank">Patient Priorities Care</a>, which was developed to help patients and their clinicians focus on what matters most, and their own health priorities. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6943.html" rel="external">"Localized prostate cancer: Risk stratification and choice of initial treatment", section on 'Importance of shared decision making'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1504011611"><span class="h3">Active surveillance versus watchful waiting</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the older literature, the terms "active surveillance" and "watchful waiting" were often used interchangeably; however, distinctions in current terminology need highlighting. Active surveillance (AS) is an option for males whose prostate cancer is very low-risk or low-risk prostate cancer; the best candidates have disease that is confined to the prostate gland, Gleason grade group 1 or 2  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107132" href="/z/d/graphic/107132.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), low volume tumors, and a PSA &lt;10 ng/mL. AS avoids or postpones immediate therapy but requires careful surveillance. Definitive treatment is then offered if there is evidence that the patient has developed an increased risk for disease progression. AS for low-risk disease can potentially spare males from the toxicities and sequelae associated with immediate definitive treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6922.html" rel="external">"Active surveillance for males with clinically localized prostate cancer", section on 'Rationale for active surveillance'</a>.)</p><p>AS differs from another form of expectant management, "watchful waiting." Whereas AS assumes action will be taken if there is increased risk for disease progression, watchful waiting is based on the premise that males will not benefit from definitive treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer because of limited life expectancy, comorbidity, and the prolonged natural history of prostate cancer [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. For males managed with watchful waiting, the decision is made at the outset to forego definitive treatment and to provide local or systemic treatment to palliate symptoms if disease becomes symptomatic. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6922.html" rel="external">"Active surveillance for males with clinically localized prostate cancer", section on 'Active surveillance versus watchful waiting'</a>.)</p><p>Although males can be potentially spared from the toxicities associated with immediate definitive treatment, AS may still impact quality of life:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Males who are managed with AS have the psychosocial burden of living with an indolent cancer without active treatment.

Stereotactic body RT (SBRT) is a very precise delivery of intense dose radiation given over a short period of time. The energy from standard photon or SBRT is from photons, whereas the energy source for proton RT is from protons. Brachytherapy delivers energy directly to the prostate by radioisotope sources, usually iodine-125 or palladium-103, that are injected into the prostate on either a temporary or permanent basis.

However, taken together, the majority of studies, mainly observational, suggest that ADT increases cardiovascular morbidity and/or mortality, especially in those with pre-existing CVD.

Few prospective studies have been done in which baseline cognitive function is measured and compared with that on ADT at various time points [<a href="#rid94">94</a>].

In our view, shared decision making that considers individual disease characteristics and the values and preferences of the patient is appropriate. A man who was treated for localized prostate cancer in the past and has an undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) may decide that the potential benefits of TRT outweigh the risks. On the other hand, a man who is pursuing active surveillance and is anxious about the potential for disease progression over time may decide that the theoretical risks of TRT outweigh the benefits. In general, for males with advanced/metastatic disease who are receiving ADT, we suggest not pursuing TRT (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>); the goal of ADT in these patents is to achieve castrate levels of serum testosterone.
