In some patients with neuromuscular disease, facilitating adjustment to NIV for chronic use is important, as regular use has been shown to lengthen survival, improve quality of life, and delay the need for tracheostomy [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>While many patients initially have difficulty tolerating NIV, education and addressing reasons for intolerance can improve adherence. Our approach to the adaptation and optimization of NIV in patients with chronic respiratory failure due to neuromuscular and chest wall diseases is reviewed here. The indications for and the practical aspects of NIV initiation in this population are discussed separately. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5121.html" rel="external">"Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Clinical manifestations and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5114.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Patient selection and alternative modes of ventilatory support"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5118.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Practical aspects of initiation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1195657637"><span class="h1">ADAPTATION PHASE AFTER INITIAL TITRATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The aim of chronic NIV is to lower and stabilize daytime arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) and improve sleep quality, oxygenation, and daytime symptoms of hypoventilation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1353537716"><span class="h2">Initial instructions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The adaptation phase, which occurs during the first few weeks after initiation, poses the greatest challenge in gaining patient acceptance of NIV. Using settings discovered during the initial titration trial (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5118.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Practical aspects of initiation", section on 'Initial trial'</a>), patients are instructed to use NIV each night for at least a few hours, or for as long as is possible. Further adjustments are subsequently made during follow-up visits as indicated by symptoms, tolerance, and gas exchange parameters. Selection of interface, ventilator, and initial titration of NIV are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5118.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Practical aspects of initiation"</a>.)</p><p>We encourage patients to attempt adaptation for at least several weeks or months before giving up. Most patients are able to sleep successfully through the night after a few weeks, but some may require months of adaptation. In our experience, adaptation is more likely to be successful when patients begin noticing symptomatic improvement. However, approximately 5 to 10 percent of patients fail to adapt successfully to NIV, usually because of intolerance (eg, mask discomfort or claustrophobia). (See <a class="local">'Symptoms and gas exchange fail to improve'</a> below.)</p><p>In rare circumstances, we use low-dose hypnotics to encourage adaptation. However, they should be used with great caution in this population, and we avoid them in patients with substantial nocturnal or daytime respiratory acidosis with carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) retention (eg, PaCO<sub>2</sub> &gt;50 mm Hg).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2637904321"><span class="h2">Assess symptoms and tolerance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We typically see patients approximately four to six weeks after the initiation of NIV. Assessment at that time should focus on the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hours of nightly use</strong> – This can be evaluated by directly questioning the patient or the patient's bed partner, and/or by obtaining data downloaded from the device itself. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97878.html" rel="external">"Downloading data from positive airway pressure devices in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptoms of hypoventilation</strong> – We ask whether the symptoms of hypoventilation have improved (eg, fatigue, early morning headache or dyspnea, daytime hypersomnolence). Improvements in symptoms should be evident when the patient has successfully adapted and is sleeping for at least four to five hours per night with NIV and when ventilation is sufficient. Daytime heart rate also often slows when NIV has been successful. While the normalization of PaCO<sub>2</sub> is ideal, we place a greater importance on targeting elimination or good control of daytime symptoms.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intolerance or complications</strong> – We ask about intolerance and potential complications of NIV that are interfering with adherence. This includes mask intolerance, nasal dryness or congestion, nasal bridge ulceration, air leaks, and abdominal distension from gastric insufflation. We address these issues before attempting to increase NIV settings. (See <a class="local">'Addressing intolerance and complications'</a> below and <a class="local">'Other complications'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H24532274"><span class="h2">Assess gas exchange</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3872550501"><span class="h3">Timing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We obtain follow-up measurements of oxygenation and CO<sub>2</sub> after a few weeks on NIV when the patient is using the device for at least four hours out of every 24-hour cycle.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1695889670"><span class="h3">Measurement parameters</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>To assesses adequacy of gas exchange and determine whether oxygen supplementation is indicated, we obtain overnight pulse oximetry (peripheral oxygen saturation [SpO<sub>2</sub>]) with or without transcutaneous partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PtcCO<sub>2</sub>) monitoring while the patient is using NIV at home. End-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring (P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>) is not recommended <strong>during</strong> NIV because the variable air leakage from the mask renders tracings unreliable. </p><p>We also assess daytime PaCO<sub>2</sub>. Arterial blood gas (ABG) measurement is most accurate, but venous blood gas (VBG) analysis, PtcCO<sub>2</sub>, or P<sub>ET</sub>CO2 (the latter when not using NIV) are alternatives that can be compared with the pre-NIV baseline measurements. When using VBG analysis, interpretation should be done knowing that the PaCO<sub>2</sub> on VBG analysis is usually 3 to 8 mm Hg higher than that on ABG analysis, and varies considerably, especially when PaCO<sub>2</sub> is severely elevated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16991.html" rel="external">"Venous blood gases and other alternatives to arterial blood gases"</a>.)</p><p>In patients receiving optimal settings, we periodically assess serum bicarbonate. If the bicarbonate level rises, we typically proceed with more detailed gas exchange assessment and possible re-optimization of settings. (See <a class="local">'Worsening symptoms or gas exchange after initial improvement'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4205108326"><span class="h3">Targets</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We aim to achieve the following targets:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients <strong>with</strong> evidence of CO<sub>2 </sub>retention, we target a near-normal daytime PaCO<sub>2</sub> (by a few weeks). However, normalization of PaCO<sub>2</sub> may not be attainable because of the patient's inability to tolerate a high enough inspiratory pressure or duration of NIV, or mechanical factors such as chest wall stiffness or obesity. In such cases, we accept daytime PaCO<sub>2</sub> elevation up to 60 mm Hg (7.98 kPa) as long as symptoms of hypoventilation are well controlled.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients <strong>without</strong> evidence of CO<sub>2</sub> retention, we target maintenance of normocapnia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In all patients, SpO<sub>2</sub> should ideally be ≥90 percent for ≥95 percent of sleep time (five minutes or less with the SpO<sub>2</sub> ≤88 percent during sleep may be acceptable).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We also analyze the tracing for frequent intermittent drops in SpO<sub>2</sub> (ie, "sawtooth" pattern) that could be due to breakthrough sleep-related obstructive events, sustained episodes of desaturation that could be indicative of sleep-disordered breathing, persistent hypoventilation, nonadherence, or comorbidities such as airway or parenchymal disease. </p><p></p><p>If the overnight oximetry shows desaturations, the ABG shows no improvement, and/or obstructive sleep apnea is suspected, we obtain overnight polysomnography and re-titrate NIV, if necessary.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3237495766"><span class="h1">ADDRESSING INTOLERANCE AND COMPLICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Intolerance to NIV is common. Addressing the reasons for intolerance is key for the future success of NIV in patients with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall disorders. Typically, we educate the patient regarding alternative options for interfaces, headgear, humidity, and pressure settings, which enables them to be an active participant in the adjustment period and encourages acceptance. If patients remain intolerant nocturnally, they may still achieve gas exchange benefits if the device is used during the day. Educating patients regarding the alternatives (eg, tracheostomy) may also facilitate motivation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h2">Mask (interface) intolerance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Discomfort from nasal or oronasal masks  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52499" href="/z/d/graphic/52499.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) is the most common problem encountered in patients adapting to NIV (eg, sense of claustrophobia) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>The most common initial interface chosen is a nasal mask. To prevent mask intolerance, we ensure that the nasal mask fit is optimal and that minimal strap tension is used to control air leaking (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5118.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Practical aspects of initiation", section on 'Interface and strap tension'</a>). If mask intolerance is an issue, we perform one or both the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Change the interface:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Perform brief trials with different types of interfaces such as the "memory foam" nasal masks, mini-masks, nasal pillows  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75445" href="/z/d/graphic/75445.html" rel="external">picture 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef119634" href="/z/d/graphic/119634.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>), nose cradles, or custom-fit masks.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Oronasal masks are also an alternative, provided the patient can manipulate the mask themselves (ie, those with adequate upper extremity strength) or has caregivers readily available to remove the mask in the event of an emergency (eg, vomiting, secretion buildup, power failure) to prevent asphyxiation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Oral-only interfaces may be successful in some patients, and can be started during wakefulness. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Further details regarding choosing an interface are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5118.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Practical aspects of initiation", section on 'Interfaces (masks)'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increase mask tolerance by instructing the patient to wear the mask for brief, but progressively longer, periods during nonsleep hours while watching television or participating in another distracting activity.</p><p></p><p>Despite these efforts, a minority of patients may be unable to tolerate the sensation of a foreign body strapped to the face, and alternative options should be discussed with the patient (eg, tracheostomy). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5114.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Patient selection and alternative modes of ventilatory support", section on 'Other options'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Nasal congestion or dryness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Both nasal congestion and dryness occur commonly during NIV, and sometimes in the same patient. These complaints tend to be seasonal (eg, dryness worse during the winter months) and should be treated symptomatically.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nasal dryness</strong> – We treat nasal dryness with the intranasal application of a <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> spray or gel and the use of heated humidification, tubing insulation, or heated tubing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Nasal dryness often responds well to nasal <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> and water-based nasal gels. Nasal gels can be applied in a thin layer along the inside of the nose and can help reduce mucosal discomfort and irritation. We do not use petroleum gels due to the risk of lipid aspiration. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7024.html" rel="external">"Aspiration pneumonia in adults", section on 'Lipoid pneumonia'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In-line heated humidification with heated tubing (used to avoid condensation (see <a class="local">'Condensation'</a> below)) has become standard with most newer devices to reduce the incidence of nasal dryness from NIV [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Both the warmth and increased humidity of air enhance comfort and decrease nasal resistance to airflow, which is particularly helpful for patients with concomitant obstructive sleep apnea [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. However, not all devices have built-in humidifiers. Thus, it behooves the clinician to be aware of the device being used by the patient and the humidification system necessary for that device. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When a humidifier is in place, the heater may be adjusted to increase or decrease the humidity of the incoming air as needed depending on the local environmental conditions, the pressures at which the ventilator is set, and patient preference [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><strong>Pass-over</strong> humidifiers (ie, gas passes over the surface of water) are most often used with pressure-limited ventilators, in order to avoid the drop in pressure that could occur with <strong>pass-through</strong> humidifiers (ie, gas is bubbled through water). The drop in pressure is less concerning for volume-limited devices such that either humidification can be used. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126295.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Practical aspects of initiation", section on 'Ventilator type'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nasal congestion</strong> – We treat nasal congestion with over-the-counter antihistamine or antimuscarinic decongestants. For patients who fail this approach, we use nasal glucocorticoid alone or in combination with decongestants.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1990286292"><span class="h2">Condensation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Condensation inside the tube or mask is known as "rain-out." "Rain-out" is particularly problematic in cold climates where the indoor temperatures are often lower at night or when the heated humidifier is set too high and the room air is cold.</p><p>To address this phenomenon, we typically increase the heat on the heated tubing (if this is available) or reduce the temperature setting of the heated humidifier.</p><p>Heated tubing has significantly decreased the problem of water condensation and is available with several brands of positive airway pressure (PAP) devices. In addition, water chamber and tube temperatures can be linked in an "auto" mode that regulates the humidity based upon the desired setting and the ambient air humidity. If heated tubing is not available and condensation is still noted, the tubing may be insulated with a light-weight cloth, a commercially available tube sleeve made for PAP tubing, or other insulating material created by the patient or caregivers.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Strap-related or nasal bridge ulceration or rash</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Nasal bridge redness or ulceration is caused by excessive pressure on the nasal bridge from a nasal mask due to excessive strap tension. Excessive strap tension usually results from efforts to reduce air leaking around the mask, which may irritate the eyes.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To address this issue, we minimize strap tension and optimize the seal. An adequate seal can be achieved by using foam or rubber "spacers," silicone inserts, or artificial skin to the bridge of the nose (eg, Duoderm, Restore).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>As an alternative, switching to another mask is an option. Suitable alternatives include masks with a foam inner seal, mini-masks, or nasal pillows and nose "cradles"  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75445" href="/z/d/graphic/75445.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). These masks usually have a soft silicone membrane with a hole for the nostrils that seals on the skin around them.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In addition, there are several oronasal masks that fit under the nose and do not rest on the bridge of the nose. However, use of an oronasal mask is limited to those with adequate upper body strength who can use quick release straps in the event that the mask needs to be removed in an emergency (eg, vomiting, secretion buildup, power failure) to prevent asphyxiation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5118.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Practical aspects of initiation", section on 'Interfaces (masks)'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Alternating between different masks in patients who need NIV most or all of the time may allow irritation at one site (eg, bridge of nose or facial skin) to resolve while another contact site (eg, inside the nostril) is used. For this to be effective, the patient needs to be comfortable and the seal good with both interfaces.</p><p></p><p>Some patients develop acneiform skin rashes where the mask contacts the skin. We typically prescribe low-potency corticosteroid creams, oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9393" href="/z/d/drug information/9393.html" rel="external">doxycycline</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9275" href="/z/d/drug information/9275.html" rel="external">clindamycin</a> lotion. Washing the face with a mild soap prior to application of the mask and soft cloth liners that fit between the mask and the skin may also be helpful.</p><p>If the cheek or neck becomes irritated by the strap edges, we place soft cloth strips of fleece or cotton under the straps to help protect the skin and ask patients to wash their face before mask application at night and to wash or wipe down the mask in the morning. In addition, there are several companies that make thin liners with or without Velcro to hold the liners in place to treat this complication.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Air leaking through the mouth</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Leakage of air through the mouth is universal among users of NIV. Some air leaks are small and insignificant and others big enough to impact ventilation and contribute to sleep arousals [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], oxygen desaturations [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], and mouth dryness [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. Air leak may be noticed by the patient and/or determined from data downloaded from the device.

This is a hybrid mode designed to assure target tidal volume (or minute volume) by automatically adjusting pressure support and/or respiratory rate and has been used successfully in patients with neuromuscular disease. The average VAPS-auto expiratory PAP may also be used, which allows for automatic adjustment of the expiratory PAP for ventilator-perceived obstructive events during ventilation.

While many patients initially have difficultly tolerating NIV, most adapt successfully within a few weeks or months. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Four- to six-week assessment and</strong> <strong>goals</strong> – The aim of nocturnal NIV is to improve or eliminate daytime symptoms of hypoventilation, lower and stabilize daytime arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) and improve oxygenation. Using settings discovered during the initial titration trial (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5118.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Practical aspects of initiation", section on 'Initial trial'</a>), patients are instructed to use NIV each night for at least a few hours, or as long as is possible. Four to six weeks later, we evaluate patients for the following (see <a class="local">'Adaptation phase after initial titration'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Symptoms, adherence, tolerance – Symptoms of hypoventilation (eg, fatigue, early morning headache, daytime hypersomnolence), hours of nightly use, and evidence of intolerance or complications. (See <a class="local">'Assess symptoms and tolerance'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Parameters of gas exchange – We typically obtain overnight pulse oximetry and transcutaneous carbon dioxide (tcCO<sub>2</sub>) monitoring while the patient is wearing NIV at home. In hypercapnic patients, we target a near-normal daytime PaCO<sub>2</sub> level but accept a level up to 60 mm Hg (7.98 kPa), provided symptoms of hypoventilation are well controlled. We also assess daytime PaCO<sub>2</sub>, preferably with arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. In normocapnic patients, we target maintenance of normocapnia. For oxygenation, we target a pulse oxygen saturation ≥90 percent for ≥95 percent of sleep time (less than five minutes of peripheral oxygen saturation ≤88 percent may be acceptable) and administer oxygen supplementation if needed. (See <a class="local">'Assess gas exchange'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Managing intolerance</strong> – Addressing the reasons for intolerance is key for the future success of NIV:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with discomfort from the mask (typically a nasal mask), we ensure that mask fit is optimal and that the least strap tension is used to adequately control air leaking. Trials with different types of interfaces (eg, masks with gel or foam seals or nasal pillows) and distraction techniques (eg, wearing NIV while watching television) may also help. (See <a class="local">'Mask (interface) intolerance'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>We treat nasal dryness with nasal <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> or gel and in-line heated humidification. Nasal congestion often responds to an over-the-counter antihistamine or antimuscarinic decongestants. For patients who fail this approach, we suggest nasal glucocorticoids (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Nasal congestion or dryness'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Irritation at the interface contact sites (eg, bridge of the nose, face straps) can be alleviated by local measures (eg, silicone inserts or artificial skin), alternating interfaces (eg, nasal pillows), and avoiding over-tightening of the mask. (See <a class="local">'Strap-related or nasal bridge ulceration or rash'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pressure-limited ventilators can compensate for small leaks by increasing airflow to maintain mask pressure. Leak compensation during volume-limited ventilation requires an upward adjustment in tidal volume. Mouth leaks that interfere with adequate ventilation are decreased by use of a chinstrap or by changing to an oronasal mask. Use of an oronasal mask is limited to those with upper body strength in case quick release straps need to be used for an emergency to prevent asphyxiation or those who have an available caregiver to perform this task. Mouthpiece ventilation is rarely used with or without nasal pledgets in place. (See <a class="local">'Air leaking through the mouth'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Intolerable gastric distention or flatulence is infrequent, but may be treated by reducing inflation pressure or adding oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10264" href="/z/d/drug information/10264.html" rel="external">simethicone</a>, if needed. (See <a class="local">'Gastric insufflation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Additional follow-up</strong> – Most patients have improvements in symptoms and gas exchange within weeks of initiating NIV. (See <a class="local">'Follow-up after adaptation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For those who improve, further adjustments in minute ventilation can be made for optimization of NIV, if necessary. Once optimized, patients can be seen periodically with intermittent nocturnal oximetry with ABG or tcCO<sub>2</sub> and serum bicarbonate. Frequency of follow-up depends on whether patients are starting therapy (every few weeks), stable on therapy (twice yearly), or deteriorating clinically (every few days or weeks). (See <a class="local">'Improved symptoms and gas exchange'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A small proportion of patients fail during the initial few weeks (5 to 10 percent). We typically re-address compliance and intolerance that might explain poor adherence or an air leak. When insufficient ventilation is suspected, we increase the minute ventilation. (See <a class="local">'Symptoms and gas exchange fail to improve'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Worsening gas exchange after initial improvement is often due to deteriorating lung function from disease progression. Other causes include faulty equipment, medication changes, weight gain, or other medical issues that worsen obstructive apneas or hypoventilation during sleep. For those with progressive neuromuscular disease, stability may be restored by increasing minute ventilation and/or extending the total duration of NIV per 24-hour period (eg, adding daytime naps while using NIV, or using NIV while awake). (See <a class="local">'Worsening symptoms or gas exchange after initial improvement'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Invasive ventilatory support</strong> – Long-term invasive mechanical ventilation with tracheostomy is typically declined. However, it may be performed in those who desire it or those with an inability to tolerate NIV or protect their upper airway. Invasive mechanical ventilation may be needed in the short term to support patients with an acute reversible issue (eg, pneumonia).
