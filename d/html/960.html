         In individuals with latent cardiac conditions, participation in athletic activity may provoke a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Athletes engaged in competitive athletics may be particularly prone to sudden cardiac death (SCD) as the result of pressure to perform at a high level. As a result, there is great interest in identification of individuals who may be at risk of SCD and whose risk of SCD may be decreased by implementing appropriate exercise restrictions or proper medical management.

         Athletes may be classified by their age and by the competitive nature of their exercise activity:

          Young athletes
         </strong>
         – Most commonly, the term "young athletes" refers to those in high school and college but applies in general to individuals under age 35 in whom SCD is usually due to a congenital or inherited heart disease (eg, channelopathy, anomalous coronary artery).

         – Adult, or "masters," athletes include individuals 35 years of age and older in whom SCD is most commonly due to coronary artery disease (CAD). These athletes are apparently normal and healthy individuals, although many are greater than 50 years of age. These athletes may also prioritize winning and ignore specific warning symptoms.

         <strong>
          Competitive athletes
         </strong>
         – Competitive athletes engage in organized team or individual sports in which there is regular competition that places a premium on achievement. This definition implies that such individuals may not appreciate symptoms or limitations indicative of underlying CVD nor have the will or judgment to limit their activity in response to symptoms of CVD. This most frequently applies to high school, college, and professional sports, but may apply to certain occupations (eg, military service, firefighters, underwater industrial work, specific roles in law enforcement).

         – Recreational athletes generally participate for health or enjoyment purposes and do not typically have the same pressures to excel compared with competitive athletes. Nonetheless, activity levels in recreational sports may be vigorous, and in some individuals or sports, the difference in intensity of exercise between recreational and competitive athletics may be minimal (eg, mountaineering).

         As with screening for any condition, the primary purpose of screening athletes for cardiac pathology is to identify patients at higher risk of SCD whose prognosis may be improved with an intervention such as exercise modification or specific therapy targeted at the underlying pathology.

         In competitive athletes 34 years or younger, we suggest screening with a complete history, family history, social history, and physical examination rather than no screening. Ideally, this assessment should occur prior to participation and should be performed by a trained clinician. The elements of the history and physical examination related to cardiac screening include:

         Screening with a history and physical examination is consistent with most professional guidelines (eg, American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, European Society of Cardiology [ESC]) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Of note, North American guidelines provide specific historical and examination elements that may be required depending on the location of screening [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In contrast, Denmark does not screen athletes with a history or examination, and the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Academy of Family Physicians guidelines do not recommend an evaluation in patients who are active, asymptomatic, and without CVD risk factors [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Our preference for screening with a history and examination is based on our experience and the prevailing norms in the United States. The evidence on screening with history and physical examination alone is limited to observational studies [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Most screening studies also performed an electrocardiogram (ECG) [
         <a href="#rid7">

         ].

         Additional screening with an ECG prior to participation is controversial, and the authors and editors of this topic have differing approaches to screening:

         Most of the authors and editors of this topic do not perform ECG screening for competitive athletes less than 35 years of age.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         This approach agrees with North American professional guidelines [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,8
         </a>
         ], which do not recommend broad national screening with ECG, echocardiography, or exercise testing. However, one guideline-writing group did not oppose smaller-scale screening programs, provided that they are "well designed and prudently implemented" [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The National Collegiate Athletic Association describes ECG screening as an option for screening that should only be conducted under standards set by North American professional societies [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Our experts who do not endorse ECG screening interpret the evidence on screening as inconclusive regarding its efficacy (eg, low event rates of SCD among competitive athletes, presumed high false negative and false positive rates). In addition, they note that large-scale screening is unattractive for reasons that include prohibitively high expense due to the large number of competitive athletes (eg, difficulties in large-scale implementation, including test interpretation), assignment of responsibility and liability (eg, false negative and false positive screens) to individual clinicians, and questionable ethical standing given the similar rate of SCD in noncompetitive athletes and nonathletes who would not receive screening.

         Some experts, including one contributor to this topic, obtain ECG screening for all competitive athletes less than 35 years of age. These experts repeat screening at least every two years after the initial screen. Thus, the ECG prior to participation is likely the most important evaluation, and after participating in competitive athletics without signs or symptoms of cardiovascular disease, the value of continued screening decreases.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The ESC guidelines, most international federations, and the International Olympic Committee endorse screening with an ECG prior to competitive sport participation for all young athletes [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,10

         ].

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Experts who support routine ECG screening interpret the yield and efficacy of ECG screening to be sufficiently high. In addition, the low cost and wide availability of ECGs make such screening an attractive option.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         While our experts have differing views of the same evidence, there is agreement that the incidence of SCD related to competitive sports is generally low, but may be higher in the presence of specific diseases (eg, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia). The evidence on the yield and efficacy of ECG screening is composed of cross-sectional studies that have conflicting findings:

         In a study that included 22,324 children (62 percent males; mean age 12 years at first screening) who underwent a total of 65,397 annual evaluations (median 2.9 per child), cardiovascular diseases increasing the risk of SCD were identified in 69 children (0.3 percent) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11

         ]. The diseases detected included congenital heart diseases (n = 17), channelopathies (n = 14), cardiomyopathies (n = 15), nonischemic left ventricular scar with ventricular arrhythmias (n = 18), and others (n = 5). Among those who had CVD detected by screening, most were ≥12 years old (n = 63, 91 percent) and were detected by repeat evaluation (n = 44, 64 percent). The estimated cost per diagnosis was 73,312 euros. One child with normal screening studies experienced a cardiac arrest during sports activity and was resuscitated.

         In an observational study that recorded SCD in athletic and nonathletic populations after the advent of screening in 1982, the annual incidence of SCD in athletes decreased from 3.6/100,000 person-years in 1979 to 1980 to 0.4/100,000 person-years in 2003 to 2004 [

         In a study that included 11,168 adolescent athletes (mean age 16.4 years) who underwent comprehensive cardiac screening (including a health questionnaire, physical examination, ECG, and echocardiography), 42 athletes (0.4 percent) were found to have disorders associated with SCD, and 225 (2 percent) were found to have a congenital or valvular abnormality [

A total of six athletes with a previously negative screen suffered SCD within approximately seven years of their initial screening evaluation. Among the eight athletes who suffered SCD, six had normal initial screening results and died from cardiomyopathies. Repeat evaluations were not performed after the initial evaluation.

         The yield and efficacy of ECG screening depends on the population screened, tests used for screening, definition of a cardiac abnormality, and frequency of testing. In general, cardiac abnormalities are detected by screening in approximately 2 to 5 percent of individuals screened, and there is evidence that repeat screening increases the number of cardiac abnormalities detected by threefold:

         Repeat screening with an ECG or exercise stress ECG is controversial.

         Many professional societies provide recommendations on preparticipation screening in older athletes, and there are varying approaches to ECG and exercise treadmill testing. The European guidelines advocate for ECG screening in all athletes prior to competition  (

          17
         </a>
         ]. Some societies advocate for ECG screening in older patients at low ASCVD risk who plan to participate in low- to moderate-intensity exercise and exercise ECG testing in patients with higher age, ASCVD risk, or participation in high-intensity sports [
         <a href="#rid1">

         ]. There are no North American guidelines that recommend repeat screening.
        </p>

         There are few studies that evaluate the effect of screening in athletes 35 years or older. Those who support screening in this age group note the higher incidence of CAD in this population that may increase the risk of SCD, while those who do not support screening note that most competitive athletes in this age group have exercised for many years without adverse cardiovascular effects.

         </strong>
         – In patients 35 to 64 years of age who plan to participate in competitive sports, we suggest screening, at minimum, with a resting ECG (

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Our authors and editors have different approaches to exercise testing in this group of patients. Most contributors to this topic screen with an exercise stress ECG in patients who have a 10-year risk of ASCVD ≥5 percent or who plan to compete in high-intensity sports. In the United States, treadmill stress testing is the most common, while in Europe, bicycle stress testing is more common.

         Another contributor to this topic obtains a resting ECG but does not obtain an exercise stress ECG in older adults.

         – Similar to patients 35 to 64 years of age, our authors and editors have differing approaches; most screen with an exercise stress ECG, while another only screens with a resting ECG.

         – Competitive athletes with a normal screening history, physical examination, ECG, or exercise stress ECG require no further testing and can participate with the knowledge that screening does not completely exclude the presence of conditions that may lead to sudden cardiac death (SCD).
