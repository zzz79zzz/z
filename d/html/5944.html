         Children represent only a small proportion of the hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected population. Nevertheless, a substantial number of children have chronic HCV infection and are at risk for complications. According to one report [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ], there are approximately 115 million infected persons in the world, 11 million of whom are younger than 15 years of age. Eighty million are viremic, of whom 5 million are younger than 15 years of age. It has been estimated that the global health care costs for HCV-infected children and their families are hundreds of millions of dollars annually [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].

         The major issues related to HCV in children will be reviewed here. Perinatal transmission of HCV is discussed separately. (See

         In the United States, antibodies to HCV are present in approximately 0.3 percent of children under 14 years of age and 9 percent of those ages 15 through 24 years [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The prevalence in youth and young adults is increasing, driven by injection drug use, but is still less than in older adults [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. A systematic review reports an overall prevalence of HCV in children of 0.87 percent, ranging from 0.34 percent in Europe to 3.02 percent in Africa [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The frequency of cases that are clinically identified is far lower (5 percent of the expected number), suggesting that screening for and case identification of pediatric HCV are grossly inadequate [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. The proportion of children who are HCV antibody-positive who are also HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA)-positive is not known precisely; based upon studies in adults, it is estimated to be approximately 75 to 80 percent. HCV viremia was detected in 56.8 percent of children in the systematic review [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3675.html" rel="external">
          "Epidemiology and transmission of hepatitis C virus infection"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Of concern, rates of acute HCV infection among young people have been increasing in the United States since 2010, particularly in suburban populations [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8-10
         </a>
         ]. This pattern mirrors the epidemic of prescription opioid and subsequent heroin use in these areas. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3675.html" rel="external">
          "Epidemiology and transmission of hepatitis C virus infection", section on 'Incidence of new infection'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The estimated burden of viremic HCV infection in children ages 1 to 19 years is 3.5 million people (95% CI 3.1-3.9 million) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. The largest numbers of infected children are in countries in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. There have been no recent epidemiologic studies of HCV-infected children in developed countries, but the incidence of new cases has been increasing in the United States, paralleling the opioid epidemic. Since many young women infected by this route are of childbearing age, pediatric cases are expected to increase in parallel.
        </p>
        <p>
         Perinatal transmission is by far the most common source of HCV infection in children, probably accounting for more than 1500 new cases/year in the United States, although many of these cases remain undiagnosed [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. The incidence of HCV vertical transmission is approximately 6 to 7 percent in HCV RNA-positive mothers [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,13,14
         </a>
         ]. The risk of perinatal transmission is further increased to 12 percent for mothers with poorly controlled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3637.html" rel="external">
          "Vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Antiretroviral therapy in HIV/HCV-coinfected women reduces the rate of vertical transmission by HCV-infected women [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. The advent of highly effective direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for HCV has the potential to further reduce the rates of HCV in children if reproductive-aged women with HCV can be identified and treated prior to conception. Screening of pregnant women for HCV is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/446.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Other individuals acquire the infection during adolescence through high-risk behaviors such as intravenous or intranasal drug use and use of shared tattoo equipment. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3675.html" rel="external">

         Because HCV liver disease generally progresses slowly, serious consequences such as cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma are rare during childhood. The following general observations have emerged from natural history studies in children.

         </span>
         Perinatally acquired HCV clears spontaneously by early childhood in at least 20 to 40 percent of individuals [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,16-19
         </a>
         ]. Estimated rates of spontaneous clearance vary, probably because different standards are used to define the infected status at birth. One series suggested spontaneous clearance rates of up to 66 percent by five years of age; the median age at clearance was 12 months [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Infants who acquire HCV after birth (eg, through transfusion) have rates of clearance on the higher end of this range. By contrast, HCV acquired later in life is less likely to clear spontaneously. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Factors associated with disease progression'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         There is also some evidence that the risk of developing chronic infection may be lower in patients presenting with symptomatic acute HCV infection [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21

         In many patients, hepatic fibrosis scores tend to increase with age, suggesting there is slowly progressive histologic injury [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22-26
         </a>
         ]. The development of advanced liver disease is uncommon until more than 30 years after infection in children [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,27
         </a>
         ]. However, progression to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis during childhood occasionally occurs, as described in the following case series:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●

         In a series of 121 treatment-naive children with hepatitis C, 80 percent had some fibrosis [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. This was usually mild, but five patients had bridging fibrosis and two had cirrhosis. The patients with advanced fibrosis tended to be older, suggesting that fibrosis increases with time. Obesity and perhaps other cofactors probably contribute to the severity of the liver disease.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         In a series of 332 children with hepatitis C and persistent viremia, six children progressed to decompensated cirrhosis; the duration of infection before cirrhosis was noted was 2 to 15 years [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. Five of the six children were infected with genotype 1a HCV, and only one was coinfected with HIV.

         In our practice, we have seen a number of children who developed decompensated cirrhosis during adolescence. Three children with decompensated HCV-associated cirrhosis at ages 4, 6, and 11 years have also been reported by other centers [

         Perinatally acquired ("vertical" or "mother-to-child" transmission) HCV infection is the major route of new infections in children in developed countries. The risk of transmitting the virus from an HCV-infected woman to her infant is 6 to 7 percent, with higher rates if the mother has inadequately controlled HIV coinfection [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,13,14
         </a>
         ]. The infants who are infected commonly have elevated serum aminotransferases for a few years that often become normal [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. Twenty to 40 percent of children with perinatally acquired HCV infection clear the virus by early childhood (see
         <a class="local">
          'Spontaneous clearance'
         </a>
         above). Most children who remain viremic after three years of age have chronic hepatitis [

         Perinatal exposure – A child has definite perinatal exposure to HCV if they were born to a pregnant person with active HCV infection, determined by a positive HCV RNA test. Screening is also recommended for children with presumed perinatal exposure to HCV. This includes siblings of children with perinatally acquired HCV (if born to the same mother). It also includes children whose birth mother had a history of intravenous drug use and/or a positive HCV antibody test (but unknown HCV RNA test). The selection of tests for perinatally exposed children depends on the child's age. (See

         Universal screening for childhood HCV infection is not warranted in most communities. This was suggested by a review of 1034 children seen in an urban pediatric hospital; only one child was found to be HCV-positive, although some members of the population screened had risk factors for HCV disease (7 percent of the children's mothers had a history of blood transfusion, and 1.8 percent had a history of intravenous drug use) [

          38

         The treatment of chronic HCV infection has changed dramatically since the development of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) and combination drug regimens. These therapies represent a major milestone in the treatment of HCV in adults, adolescents, and children as young as three years of age and are likely to be available for younger children in the near future. DAA regimens are effective, well tolerated, all oral, and interferon free. Regimen selection may vary by genotype and other patient factors, such as the presence of cirrhosis and treatment history.

         The decision to treat for HCV in children depends upon the child's age, genotype, and regulatory approvals for each age group. Our approach, based on the limited studies in pediatric patients and related drug approvals in United States, is consistent with guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and Infectious Diseases Society of America [

         Special considerations may apply to the rare adolescent who has tried and failed a previous course of treatment (either interferon-based or a DAA regimen), those with advanced cirrhosis, or those with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or HIV coinfection. Although there is little information available about treatment of such patients during adolescence, it would be reasonable to consider the regimens that are recommended for adults with the same characteristics. HIV coinfection is one reason to prioritize a patient for HCV antiviral therapy because of more rapid progression to advanced liver disease in the setting of HIV.

         Patients with active HCV and their families should be counseled about the specific routes of HCV transmission (perinatal transmission and via infected blood) and given advice to reduce the risk of transmission to other individuals  (

         HCV is not spread within households, school, or daycare settings, and children with HCV should not be excluded [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,58,59
         </a>
         ]. Because HCV is transmitted by blood, it may be prudent to avoid sharing razors, toothbrushes, nail clippers, and other implements that may be contaminated with blood of an infected individual. Although HCV can be detected in low levels in saliva [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60
         </a>
         ], the risk of transmission through saliva (eg, via kissing) appears to be minimal. The risk of transmission through a human bite also is probably minimal; it has been the subject of only a few anecdotal case reports [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61
         </a>
         ]. It is not necessary to avoid sharing eating utensils, drinking glasses, or towels.

         For older children and adolescents with HCV, counseling focuses mostly on avoiding high-risk behaviors. Self-tattooing and self-piercing with shared needles are common practices and should be discouraged. Similarly, the risk of transmission is increased with the use of intravenous drugs and/or intranasal cocaine because of sharing of potentially contaminated equipment. They should understand that the risk of sexual transmission of HCV is low, but that barrier methods further reduce the risk and are recommended for patients with multiple partners, sexually transmitted disease, or HIV coinfection [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,62
         </a>
         ]. Sex with multiple partners is a risk factor for HCV infection but may not be directly responsible for transmission. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3675.html" rel="external">
          "Epidemiology and transmission of hepatitis C virus infection", section on 'Sexual transmission'

         Successful treatment of HCV infection eliminates the risk of transmission to others. In particular, mother-to-child transmission of HCV does not occur if the mother has been successfully treated and is not viremic [
         <a href="#rid63">
          63
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, women with HCV should be treated prior to conception. Both female and males treated with a ribavirin-containing regimen and who are sexually active should use reliable contraception during treatment; effective contraception should be continued after completing treatment for nine months for female patients, or six months for male patients [
         <a href="#rid57">

          Epidemiology and natural history

         Age &lt;18 months – Infants who have perinatal exposure to HCV should be tested with an HCV RNA test, ideally between two to six months of age (but not younger than two months of age). Children ages 7 to 17 months who have not been previously tested should have an HCV RNA test done.

          Treatment
         </strong>
         – The development of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) represents a major milestone in the treatment of HCV in adults and is transforming practice in children as new regimens are studied and approved for children. These agents permit effective, well-tolerated, all-oral, interferon-free regimens for most patients. Effective DAA regimens are now available to children ≥3 years, with indications depending on HCV genotype. (See

         – Patients with HCV and their families should be counseled about the specific routes of HCV transmission (perinatal transmission and via infected blood) and given advice to reduce the risk of transmission to other individuals  (

         ). HCV is not spread within households, school, or daycare settings. Patients should avoid alcohol consumption. (See
