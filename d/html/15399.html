Educational status affects long-term health [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Factors associated with positive health outcomes include attending a high-quality preschool, social-emotional status in elementary school, and completion of high school [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Intervention programs offered before five years of age appear to be particularly important predictors of future health status [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Although the diagnosis of learning disorder (LD) usually is made by educators and/or psychologists through psychometric testing, the primary care provider's expertise and unique clinical perspective play a vital role in the identification and evaluation of children with LD.</p><p>The main responsibilities of the primary care provider are to assist in the identification of LD, ensure management of LD, evaluate and address co-occurring conditions (eg, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sleep problems, seizures), and provide care coordination [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Once LD is identified, the primary care provider should discuss the causes and interventions for LD and describe common co-occurring conditions with the family and provide information about LD and co-occurring conditions. (See <a class="local">'Early identification'</a> below and <a class="local">'Medical evaluation'</a> below and <a class="local">'Roles in management'</a> below.)</p><p>Primary care providers who have a longstanding relationship with the child and family may be better able to help the family articulate their concerns than educators or clinicians with whom the family is less familiar, facilitating identification of students with LD. Primary care clinicians also can provide information to the school about psychosocial, cultural, medical, or environmental factors that affect the child's ability to learn, reinforcing the need for formal evaluation by the school [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. After the evaluation is completed, the primary care provider can help the parents interpret the evaluation and negotiate the special education system. The primary care provider also can help the family understand LD and its co-occurring conditions so that they can seek appropriate services. (See <a class="local">'Communicating with the school team'</a> below and <a class="local">'Education and counseling'</a> below.)</p><p>The primary care provider has several secondary roles in the management of children with LD who receive special services at school. These include providing information about and/or referrals to community agencies that provide treatment for the disorder and co-occurring conditions, advocating for the child's rights and needs at school, serving as a mediator between the family and the school team when there are disagreements, and assisting the school team in the delivery of services. (See <a class="local">'Care coordination'</a> below and <a class="local">'Advocacy and support'</a> below and <a class="local">'Intermediary'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H629395108"><span class="h1">EARLY IDENTIFICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Early identification of learning disorders (LDs) is necessary to provide appropriate interventions [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]. Pediatric clinicians should have a low threshold for considering LD in children who are at risk for LD and children who have problems at school, because early recognition and intervention can affect ultimate outcome. The primary care provider is especially critical when the child's learning problems are overlooked by the family and/or school personnel.</p><p>LD should be considered if (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/610.html" rel="external">"Specific learning disorders in children: Clinical features", section on 'Risk factors'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There is parental concern about any school-related problem (eg, behavioral regulation, poor peer interactions, or learning problems in reading (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122327" href="/d/graphic/122327.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), writing (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122328" href="/d/graphic/122328.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), or math (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122330" href="/d/graphic/122330.html" rel="external">table 3</a>))</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The child's report card indicates learning difficulty; the primary care provider can focus on reading, writing, and math skills in particular</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There is a family history of learning problems</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The child has a behavioral/mental health diagnosis</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The child has a history of developmental delay</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The child has a neurologic condition or history of central nervous system insult (eg, seizure disorders, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis complex)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The child has a genetic condition with increased risk for either language-based LDs (eg, Klinefelter syndrome [XXY]) or nonverbal LDs (eg, Turner syndrome [XO])</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The child was born preterm, exposed to alcohol or other substances in utero, or experienced other perinatal complications</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H629395580"><span class="h1">MEDICAL EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Learning disorder (LD) does not usually have a defined medical cause. The goal of the medical evaluation is to identify medical, neurologic, and/or behavioral conditions that may be related to the LD or co-occur with the LD [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H629395587"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The developmental, educational, and learning histories (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76081" href="/d/graphic/76081.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) are the most important aspects of the medical evaluation, particularly if the child has been followed consistently by the primary care provider and the provider is familiar with the child's medical conditions. If the child is known to have a co-occurring condition associated with learning problems, the provider should ask about learning and school problems during regularly scheduled well-child visits [<a href="#rid1">1,9</a>]. It is important to make sure that the child has attended school regularly before initiating an evaluation for LD.</p><p>The chief complaint of the parent or child usually suggests the problem area [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The primary care provider should use standard descriptors to further define the type of learning problem (eg, the time that the learning problem was first identified, any improvement or worsening of the problem over time, factors that improved or aggravated the learning problem). Students with learning problems often have impairments in more than one area, including vision, hearing, motor skills, attention and task completion skills, language skills, and social skills. The pediatric clinician should ask about problems in these areas, in addition to asking about problems in formal learning at school (eg, problems in reading (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122327" href="/d/graphic/122327.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), writing (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122328" href="/d/graphic/122328.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), or math (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122330" href="/d/graphic/122330.html" rel="external">table 3</a>)).</p><p>The child's performance at school can be measured by report cards, teacher comments, parent observations, and history of academic progress over time. The author of this topic review asks the classroom teacher to complete a detailed questionnaire about the student's school performance that includes a narrative description, a summary of academic and behavioral performance as being at or below grade level, and the National Institute for Children's Health Quality Teacher Vanderbilt Assessment Scale. Similar teacher forms are commonly available from local developmental-behavioral pediatrics clinics, or from a neuropsychology clinic, and are used as part of their intake procedure. Completion of these forms can help the primary care clinician identify learning concerns and can prepare the family for referral to specialist care if needed.</p><p>Several other types of questionnaires can be completed by the classroom teacher to provide information about classroom performance and co-occurring conditions [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Examples of these include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The Vanderbilt teacher questionnaire for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (available free of charge through the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nichq.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fresource-file%2FNICHQ_Vanderbilt_Assessment_Scales.pdf&amp;token=CHDGw7UoLfG%2BSrbzPTDTJmijbv3R0Xs3VVh1RoXUIp%2Fsv3HAUkEjO188IBEMMUwb3p1gmYGwulvv3hG2%2B4Fev3%2FOnnBbB1Kasq48t1SqglF7HZWM7G2aNeWZs7mBPjkO&amp;TOPIC_ID=15399" target="_blank">National Institute for Children's Health Quality</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Commercially developed scales available for a fee, including:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Conners 4<sup>th</sup> Edition [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Child Behavior Checklist (2001) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Behavior Assessment System for Children, third edition [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]</p><p></p><p>The medical, family, social, developmental, behavioral, and psychiatric histories should be recorded (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76081" href="/d/graphic/76081.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). The age of attainment of language milestones is particularly important (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58598" href="/d/graphic/58598.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). Past developmental delays can be associated with current learning problems. The likelihood of LD increases if learning failure is associated with certain medical, developmental, and familial factors (eg, prematurity, prenatal exposure to alcohol, family history of LD, poverty). Consideration of these factors also informs the treatment plan [<a href="#rid1">1,9,10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/610.html" rel="external">"Specific learning disorders in children: Clinical features", section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>The child's abilities and strengths should be identified, along with their disabilities. One way to access this information is to ask what activities the child enjoys doing or believes themself to be good at doing. The child's interests and skills are useful in the development of a treatment plan.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H629395594"><span class="h2">Examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although the physical examination of most children with LD is normal, important aspects of the examination include general observations and appearance, growth parameters, examination of the skin and genitalia, assessment of hearing and vision, and neurologic examination (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53481" href="/d/graphic/53481.html" rel="external">table 6</a>). The child's participation in the history-taking and the physical examination provides an opportunity to review their capacity to follow instructions and to use language to answer questions and participate in a conversation.</p><p>Abnormalities on physical examination may suggest a particular neurologic or genetic condition that is associated with learning problems (eg, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis complex, Klinefelter syndrome). However, children with these conditions typically do not present with learning failure as the first sign or symptom.</p><p>Dysmorphic features (ie, major or minor malformations (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82547 graphicRef78729" href="/d/graphic/82547.html" rel="external">table 7A-B</a>)) may suggest a genetic or congenital condition that is associated with learning problems. The incidence of minor malformations is increased among children with LD [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. However, no specific pattern of minor anomalies is pathognomonic for LD [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/110898.html" rel="external">"Congenital anomalies: Epidemiology, types, and patterns", section on 'Malformations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H629395601"><span class="h2">Informal testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pediatric clinician can perform informal testing to review developmental functions and identify specific areas for further testing by incorporating routine questions about specific learning skills, as outlined below (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef140945" href="/d/graphic/140945.html" rel="external">table 8</a>) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Informal testing can also help in assessing basic knowledge and mental status. A formal battery of psychoeducational tests is usually administered by a psychologist or educator, but some primary care providers may use developmental assessment tools to add to the information that they have gathered. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/613.html" rel="external">"Specific learning disorders in children: Evaluation", section on 'Psychometric tests'</a>.)</p><p>Successful learning has many components. When LD is suspected, the primary care provider should focus on the specific learning skills and learning deficits that are characteristic of LD (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120156" href="/d/graphic/120156.html" rel="external">table 9</a>). However, other behaviors or learning difficulties, such as poor attention span or problems socializing, may be the signal for LD and/or may co-occur with the LD.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Structured developmental tasks</strong> – Participation in structured developmental tasks (eg, describing a picture from a book or describing the story line from a series of pictures) can help the pediatric provider look more closely at the child's:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Capacity to focus attention.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Language and memory function (ability to understand, remember, and carry out instructions).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Expressive language skills (ability to use vocabulary and grammar correctly).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pragmatic language skills (use of nonverbal communication skills such as facial expressions, gestures, or changes in tone of voice; ability to carry on a conversation by providing appropriate responses and by showing appropriate turn-taking; being able to sequence sentences into a logical narrative).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Coordination skills.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Capacity for specific tasks of reading (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122327" href="/d/graphic/122327.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), writing (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122328" href="/d/graphic/122328.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), or math (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122330" href="/d/graphic/122330.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Reading and writing skills </strong>– The pediatric provider can incorporate some routine questions about phonologic skills, reading, and language skills during office encounters with young children to assess language and literacy skills. Clues to reading impairment in early childhood are provided in the table (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69787" href="/d/graphic/69787.html" rel="external">table 10</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Phonologic awareness skills</strong> – Preschool and kindergarten children should be able to identify and provide words that rhyme ("Tell me what rhymes with 'mat.'").</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Grade one children should be able to delete the beginning sound of a word ("Say 'fireman' without saying 'man.'"; "If you take away the 'h' sound from 'hat,' what do you get?") and replace the beginning sound of a word with a new letter ("If you take the 't' sound in 'take' and replace it with an 'm,' what do you get?").</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Early phonics skills</strong> – Kindergarten children should be able to identify letters and some of their sounds (sound-symbol relationships or phonics skills). By the end of kindergarten, children should be able to read a list of 10 to 20 sight words. They should know all of the letters of the alphabet and their sounds [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">By the end of grade 1, students should be able to read (decode) novel three- and four-letter words. Phonics is largely mastered by the end of grade 2, with full mastery by the middle of grade 3 [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. In grade 2, children can show phonetic spelling skills, producing phonetically correct words even if the words are spelled incorrectly.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Late phonics skills</strong> – By the end of grade 3, all phonics skills in the English language should be mastered and the child should be able to read (decode) fluently/smoothly. The child should also be able to read with comprehension [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. By the end of grade 3, spelling errors are less and less common in children who are learning successfully.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Language skills</strong> – After age 4, articulation should be 100 percent intelligible. By kindergarten or grade 1, children should speak English fluently and without grammatical errors. Although grammatical errors amongst children exposed to another language at home can occur after this age, especially if exposed to incorrectly spoken English, children exposed to another language at home typically should have mastered English by this age as well. Review of language skills is especially useful because language difficulty typically precedes problems in reading and writing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Inability to demonstrate the language and literacy skills listed above may signal reading/writing disorders (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122327" href="/d/graphic/122327.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122328" href="/d/graphic/122328.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Difficulties with pronunciation across a variety of speech sounds, particularly those that affect intelligibility after age 4, may be a sign of impairment in speech/sound disorder, language impairment, or impairment of phonologic awareness. Such difficulties warrant documentation and monitoring for improvement or resolution. They are known to affect reading and spelling skills. Laborious and slow reading or writing, poor spelling, and/or the need for extra time in reading and/or to take tests may indicate a reading disorder (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54976 graphicRef82083" href="/d/graphic/54976.html" rel="external">table 11A-B</a>). The pediatric clinician should empower the family by teaching them about potential signs of language or reading difficulty.

No single clinician, teacher, or administrator is allowed to determine how services are to be delivered. When conducted successfully, this process allows the school team to consider options for service delivery that are therapeutically and educationally sound and consistent with the school ecology and resources as a whole. However, service delivery decisions are sometimes made according to the availability of services at the school rather than the needs of the student. In such cases, input from the pediatric clinician that reveals an understanding of the student's needs at school can carry significant weight in service delivery decisions at school.</p><p>Schools sometimes appear to make service delivery decisions contingent upon the pediatric clinician's input. Families and even school teams sometimes believe that the pediatric clinician's input is a requirement for the delivery of certain types of services at school (eg, specialized services for a student with ASD or support services for a student with ADHD). However, neither Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act nor the IDEA supports the practice of withholding services until a diagnosis is confirmed or a health care provider's input is received. Schools cannot require the family to use medical insurance benefits to obtain the information that the school needs to make educational service decisions. In addition, although a handicapping condition (ie, a physical or mental impairment that considerably limits one or more major life activities) is a prerequisite for the delivery of services under both Section 504 and the IDEA, it is the functional impairment rather than the diagnosis or condition that determines the services provided [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Functional impairment is evaluated by the school team, not by the pediatric clinician. Schools have great legal latitude in providing services to students who may need them. Education and disability rights laws include many provisions to ensure successful service delivery to students without the input of any outside clinicians. When a medical clinician's input is needed, schools have the option of contracting directly with the clinician to obtain needed diagnostic information. Under the IDEA, schools are not required to provide medical (physician) services in the school setting, but they can be required to pay for a physician's diagnostic services.

The first step is to determine whether the family has a correct understanding of their legal rights and whether the school team has fulfilled the procedural safeguards required by law (eg, under the IDEA, an evaluation has to be made available at public expense and upon parent request; the evaluation has to be completed within 60 calendar days, although there is state-to-state variability [eg, in how school holidays are counted]).

Subsequently, it can be helpful to call a member of the child's school team (eg, special education coordinator, school principal) to learn why the disagreement may have arisen. Sometimes, sharing perspectives between the family and the school team is sufficient to help each party see "eye to eye." At other times, when the family has a valid reason for disagreement, they may need to be referred to advocacy services or other clinicians more experienced in managing differences of opinion (eg, developmental-behavioral pediatrician, child psychologist or psychiatrist who understands the needs of children who require special education services, an advocate or other professional at a <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.parentcenterhub.org%2Frptacs%2F&amp;token=kgWnuLuwd5ywHVQww%2BY9emzSgy31O67NQM3YZsWp7vQGEepnJV%2BVaEmHV7ui0oAB&amp;TOPIC_ID=15399" target="_blank">regional parent technical assistance center</a> (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57599" href="/d/graphic/57599.html" rel="external">table 15</a>)).

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

The main responsibilities of the primary care provider are to assist in the identification of LD, ensure management of LD, evaluate and address co-occurring conditions, and provide care coordination. (See <a class="local">'Role of the primary care provider'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Early identification</strong> – Early identification of LD is necessary to provide appropriate interventions. Pediatric clinicians should have a low threshold for considering LD in children who are at risk for LD and children who have problems at school. When LD is suspected, the primary care provider should focus on the specific learning skills and learning deficits that are characteristic of LD (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120156" href="/d/graphic/120156.html" rel="external">table 9</a>).

The developmental, educational, and learning histories (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76081" href="/d/graphic/76081.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) are the most important aspects of the evaluation. The physical examination is usually normal but should include general observations and appearance, growth parameters, examination of the skin and genitalia, assessment of hearing and vision, and neurologic examination (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53481" href="/d/graphic/53481.html" rel="external">table 6</a>).
