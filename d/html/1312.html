Standardized management protocols have been developed for many patient groups, depending on the anticoagulant they are receiving, but such protocols may be modified to allow for a patient-centric approach that accounts for individual patient characteristics that affect perioperative thromboembolic and bleeding risks. </p><p>Other perioperative management issues are anticoagulant specific. For those taking a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), it takes several days until the anticoagulant effect is reduced and then re-established perioperatively; during the period of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9771" href="/d/drug information/9771.html" rel="external">vitamin K</a> interruption, a short-acting anticoagulant such as low-molecular-weight heparin may be administered in a selected minority of patients to minimize the time patients are not fully anticoagulated during the perioperative period. The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), comprising the factor IIa inhibitor <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8926" href="/d/drug information/8926.html" rel="external">dabigatran</a> and the factor Xa inhibitors <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="85642" href="/d/drug information/85642.html" rel="external">apixaban</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="99275" href="/d/drug information/99275.html" rel="external">edoxaban</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9498" href="/d/drug information/9498.html" rel="external">rivaroxaban</a> have a more rapid onset and offset of action than VKA, making them easier to discontinue and resume perioperatively and, thereby, obviate the need for heparin bridging.</p><p>Our approach to managing ongoing anticoagulation in patients undergoing surgery or an invasive procedure is based on the type of anticoagulant a patient is receiving.

Our approach to perioperative management of anticoagulation aims to minimize these risks and determines management according to anticoagulant-specific characteristics such as key pharmacokinetic properties (elimination half-life, time to peak effect) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Our approach is based (whenever possible) on evidence from randomized controlled trials and well-designed observational studies, although evidence from observational studies is also considered secondarily. In addition, thrombotic and bleeding risks may vary depending on individual circumstances, and data from randomized trials or well-designed observational studies are limited to guide practice for certain patient groups. Thus, our approach discussed herein should be used as clinical guidance and should not substitute for clinician judgment in decisions about perioperative anticoagulant management for individual patients.</p><p>Our approach to decision-making follows a step-wise approach outlined below; this is presented in an interactive format at <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthrombosiscanada.ca%2Ftools%2F%3Fcalc%3DperioperativeAnticoagulantAlgorithm&amp;token=fRNONPyO53NgrUw%2FIAd4o%2F4UEmn%2F5vvjri9Q30vCAC1LYdhQHxa0u1Y%2FBBtz8XepY0InYBBN92k%2Buxjoj%2Bqdq5LidyOkijQPYVojTxykFlI%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=1312" target="_blank">Thrombosis Canada</a>; a similar approach is provided on the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmappp.ipro.org%2F&amp;token=Ig6HeA9ku5WR0LsJHyxs8lnt%2BJlTjNGjCG0e6qN87Sg%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=1312" target="_blank">IPRO-MAPPP</a> website in the United States:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>Estimate bleeding risk</strong> – A higher bleeding risk confers a greater need for perioperative hemostasis and hence a longer period of anticoagulant interruption. Bleeding risk is dominated by the type and urgency of surgery; some patient comorbidities also contribute. On the other hand, a minimal bleeding risk may allow a procedure to proceed without the need for anticoagulant interruption. However, some minimal bleed risk procedure (eg, dental, skin) may require anticoagulant interruption based on individual patient characteristics. (See <a class="local">'Estimating procedural bleeding risk'</a> below and <a class="local">'Deciding whether to interrupt anticoagulation'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>Estimate thromboembolic risk</strong> – The higher the thromboembolic risk, the greater the importance of minimizing the interval without anticoagulation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86930" href="/d/graphic/86930.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). We estimate thromboembolic risk for patients with atrial fibrillation based on age and comorbidities. For those with a recent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), we estimate the risk based on the interval since diagnosis. Estimating thromboembolic risk is important particularly in patients who are receiving a <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9771" href="/d/drug information/9771.html" rel="external">vitamin K</a> antagonist (VKA) such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a>, as this will inform the need for heparin bridging during VKA interruption.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In addition, for patients with a recent (within the previous one to three months) stroke, PE or DVT, in whom the risk of recurrent thromboembolism is markedly increased, we prefer to delay surgery when possible until the risk lessens and is close to baseline. (See <a class="local">'Estimating thromboembolic risk'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Determine the timing of anticoagulant interruption</strong> – The timing of anticoagulant interruption depends on the specific agent the patient is receiving. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">Warfarin</a> requires earlier discontinuation than the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="85642" href="/d/drug information/85642.html" rel="external">apixaban</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8926" href="/d/drug information/8926.html" rel="external">dabigatran</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="99275" href="/d/drug information/99275.html" rel="external">edoxaban</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9498" href="/d/drug information/9498.html" rel="external">rivaroxaban</a>). Additional considerations may be required in individuals with reduced kidney and/or liver function. (See <a class="local">'Timing of anticoagulant interruption'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Step 4:</strong> <strong>Determine whether to use bridging anticoagulation</strong> – For most patients, we do not use bridging anticoagulation (use of a short-acting parenteral agent to reduce the interval without anticoagulation) because it increases bleeding risk without reducing the rate of thromboembolism. However, some patients on <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> with an especially high thromboembolic risk (eg, mechanical heart valve, recent stroke) may benefit from bridging.
