         Acute vaso-occlusive pain is a hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD) and the most common reason for seeking medical attention. After an acute vaso-occlusive pain episode resolves, it is prudent to ensure that appropriate measures have been taken to decrease the likelihood of future vaso-occlusive pain events and to reduce the intensity of chronic pain.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic discusses an approach to using disease-modifying therapies in individuals with SCD, which will help with preventing (or minimizing) vaso-occlusive pain episodes as well as reduce other vaso-occlusive complications, or, in the case of

         , may reduce complications of hemolysis.
        </p>
        <p>
         While these therapies are being presented in the context of preventing vaso-occlusive pain, their importance goes beyond pain prevention to reducing other disease complications and improving quality of life. Thus, they should be part of any comprehensive discussion of care for SCD patients.

         Every individual with SCD should have an established care plan for reducing and managing pain at home that takes into account their (and their family's) needs  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106388" href="/z/d/graphic/106388.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). The plan should be available to the individual and family members, as well as all treating clinicians, including those providing primary care, those in the emergency department, and the hematology team. The plan should instruct the individual how to appropriately manage mild, moderate, and severe pain, with a predefined threshold for the use of opioids and when to contact health care providers.
        </p>
        <p>
         The plan should be available in the medical record, so that all involved can have electronic access to the most current, individualized strategy to manage pain.
        </p>
        <p>
         Several studies have demonstrated that implementation of individualized care plans involving early aggressive treatment of pain has improved outcomes including hospital admissions, lengths of stay, and re-admission rates [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-5
         </a>
         ]. In one such study, a comprehensive SCD plan including access to analgesics lowered emergency department visits for uncomplicated pain by 84 percent [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. In another study, a comprehensive individualized care plan reduced hospital admission rates from 51 percent per year to 39 percent per year (a 24 percent reduction) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Financial savings have also been documented [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Ideally, input from individuals with SCD, families, nurses, emergency department personnel, hospitalists, and hematologists is solicited in the development of an institutional template, to ensure that the plan will be consulted and followed. Pain treatment plans must be tailored to the individual and may vary considerably depending on the daily symptoms, presence of chronic pain, opioid tolerance, medication side effects, and comorbidities such as renal insufficiency [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. The transition from pediatric to adult care is a frequent setting when interruptions in care can occur and can lead to detrimental outcomes; thus, special attention should be paid to the updating of the care plan during this transition. (See

         Pain is the most common complication of SCD and the most common reason for individuals with SCD to seek medical attention [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. The reported prevalence of pain in SCD is highly dependent on the definition of pain (eg, pain that was relieved with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug [NSAID] versus that requiring an opioid) and the setting in which the pain was documented (home versus hospital or emergency department).
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">

         In a 2010 study of almost 200,000 emergency department visits by children and adults with SCD, 67 percent were for pain [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Visits for chest symptoms (pain, shortness of breath, cough) and fever accounted for only 20 and 6 percent, respectively.

         Another study involving 21,112 people with SCD who presented to the hospital or emergency department reported a mean of 2.6 encounters per year (95% CI, 2.5-2.7) [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. This included a mean of 1.5 encounters that resulted in hospitalization and 1.1 for treatment in the emergency department without hospital admission. The age range with the highest health care use was 18 to 30 year olds. Individuals with public health insurance had a higher rate of health care use than individuals with private insurance.
        </p>
        <p>

         </span>
         In a 1991 study of 3578 individuals with SCD (newborns through adulthood), the annual incidence of acute pain episodes was greatest in the 20 to 29 years age group [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Nearly 40 percent of individuals did not seek medical attention for pain, whereas approximately 5 percent of individuals with homozygous sickle cell anemia (Hb SS) had more than three episodes per year, accounting for approximately one-third of the total pain episodes. This may explain the skewed perception of hospital-based clinicians that most people with SCD have frequent pain episodes.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The incidence rate of acute pain episodes cannot be prevented completely. However, certain therapies may be helpful in minimizing the frequency and/or intensity of pain. In the majority of studies, the populations studied included mainly individuals with Hb SS and sickle-beta
         <sup>
          0
         </sup>
         -thalassemia. However, as noted below, the therapies are likely to be effective in individuals with hemoglobin SC disease who have significant vaso-occlusive pain and require a disease-modifying therapy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Which patients require preventive therapy?'

         Preventive therapy with one or more of the agents discussed below is appropriate for any individual with a history of frequent vaso-occlusive pain episodes or infants with hemoglobin SS or Hb S-beta

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The number of pain episodes is somewhat subjective depending on how a pain episode is defined. We generally consider pain episodes to be frequent if they occur more than two to three times a year and are severe enough to require opioid pain medications or treatment at home, emergency department, hospital, or day clinic. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prevalence of pain'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Use of preventive therapy should involve shared decision making with the sickle cell disease expert and the family. Different factors may be important for different patients/families/caregivers:

         has been used for over 25 years in SCD and has a validated track record of safety and efficacy. There are a number of potential toxicities that are usually minor and can be reversible but are often misunderstood by families, at times leading to reduced acceptance. Temporarily decreased fertility, especially in males, may be important in family planning decisions. Non-serious hair loss, changes in fingernail color, and transient, non-severe myelosuppression can be observed. Hydroxyurea dosing may need to be modified to avoid myelosuppression.

         – Allogeneic transplant and modified autologous transplant using gene therapy or gene editing are not in routine use for sickle cell disease. Transplant is a potential curative option and appropriate in some cases; however, agreement is lacking on the indications for stem cell transplantation. Due to the absence of randomized trials of transplantation and a paucity of long-term follow-up data, universal recommendations have not been made. In general, children who have had a stroke, life-threatening acute chest syndrome, acute pain or recurrent major priapism unresponsive to maximum disease-modifying therapy are accepted candidates for HLA matched sibling transplantation, after excluding undiagnosed/untreated asthma and acute psychosocial stressors that may exacerbate pain, including sexual trauma. Hematologists, transplant physicians, and psychologists or psychiatrists should evaluate all transplant candidates to address these potential confounders to severe SCD.

Adults with a chronic-pain phenotype have nerve damage, chronic inflammation, and sometimes central sensitization. They often have allodynia and hyperalgesia complicating therapies and may continue to have chronic pain following hematopoietic stem cell transplant or gene therapy [

        <p>
         Decision-making should include the affected individual, family members and caregivers (for children), and other clinicians involved in the care of the affected individual. After initiation of treatment, it is important to have ongoing objective and patient-reported assessments of the efficacy in reducing vaso-occlusive episodes. If no benefit is obtained, evaluation is warranted to determine the reasons for lack of benefit and the possible role of using a different treatment approach.

         These agents have not been directly compared to each other or to hydroxyurea.

         For other SCD compound heterozygotes such as hemoglobin SC disease (Hb SC), hydroxyurea should be administered on a case-by-case basis weighing the pros and the cons, as the clinical utility of hydroxyurea in these individuals is far less well established. There is also a concern that hydroxyurea may exacerbate the pre-existing hypercoagulable state of individuals with Hb SC disease and/or may increase the risk of hyperviscosity [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47

         Hydroxyurea has the greatest long-term evidence for benefit in reducing acute painful episodes as well as reducing other vaso-occlusive complications of SCD such as acute chest syndrome and in some cases stroke (see

The approach in our center is to provide a handbook for the families to read prior to and during treatment with hydroxyurea therapy. Typically, the benefit of hydroxyurea in reducing pain episodes does not occur for at least three months. Thus, discussion about the benefits and risks of hydroxyurea and the decision about its initiation should occur on an outpatient basis after the acute pain episode has resolved. (See

         As discussed separately, the extensive experience with hydroxyurea over more than three decades does not demonstrate any increased risk of malignancy. Boxed warnings on the product information sheets for these drugs were based on observed associations in individuals with myeloproliferative neoplasms, in whom the baseline risk of malignancy is substantially increased (association, not causation). No increased risk of malignancy has been observed in children and adults with SCD after several decades of clinical use with close monitoring. However, some individuals may have intolerable side effects such as hair loss. Effects on fertility are less clear. (See

         The mechanism of action of hydroxyurea is complex and may involve a number of changes including increased production of fetal hemoglobin, increased nitric oxide, improved red blood cell (RBC) rheology, decreased WBC count, and decreased WBC adhesivity to the vasculature. (See

          Mechanism of action

         – The mechanism by which L-glutamine decreases acute painful episodes is incompletely understood. It is thought to involve reduction of oxidative stress in red blood cells (RBCs) that contain sickle hemoglobin.

          Glutamine

         is a precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), and preclinical studies showed that glutamine treatment of sickle RBCs in vitro lead to reduced sickling, decreased adhesivity to the vasculature, and increased redox potential [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61,62,64

          59,63

         Triggers for pain may be obvious to the patient, family, or both. Reducing these triggers may lessen the frequency and/or severity of acute pain, and many individuals with SCD develop strategies to avoid or minimize these triggers. Common triggers for pain may include cold temperature, dehydration, overexertion, hormonal changes such as onset of menses, and respiratory exposures (tobacco smoke, wind, air pollution, asthma exacerbation) [

          Healthy diet
         </strong>
         – Nutrition is an important factor in the overall well-being of individuals with SCD. Nutritional deficiencies are prevalent in SCD and may be associated with worse pain outcomes, and patients require a proactive approach from the health care system and family.

          Depression and anxiety

         ]. The Pain in Sickle Cell Epidemiology Study, a prospective cohort study in 232 adults with SCD, collected data on health-related quality of life, depression, and anxiety at baseline in daily diaries for up to six months and found high levels of depression (28 percent) and anxiety disorder (7 percent) [
         <a href="#rid88">
          88
         </a>
         ]. Individuals with depression had significantly more days with pain than individuals without depression (71 versus 50 percent, p &lt;0.001). Individuals with anxiety alone had more pain, distress from pain, and interference from pain, and they used opioids more often. Individuals who had both depression and anxiety did not function as well on all eight SF-36 subscales.

         – Insomnia can be a serious problem that may be exacerbated by anxiety and inadequate pain control, and in turn, it may contribute to emotional distress and pain perception. Additional disorders may contribute to insomnia in SCD, including unrecognized sleep-disordered breathing (eg, obstructive sleep apnea, nocturnal hypoventilation) with hypoxia and/or restless legs syndrome [

          —
         </span>
         Among individuals with SCD, a questionnaire-based study found that approximately one-third or more self-medicate with cannabinoids for pain [
         <a href="#rid96">
          96
         </a>
         ]. Our experience suggests that the proportion using cannabinoids for pain may be as high as 50 percent. Trials in non-sickle cell populations suggest that cannabinoids can be effective in some individuals; however, data from randomized trials are lacking for SCD pain. Therefore, it is appropriate to be aware of cannabinoid use in SCD patients and not to label these individuals as drug-seeking merely because they are using cannabinoids for pain prevention.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, we do not recommend cannabinoids for pain prevention in SCD, pending data from randomized trials specific to SCD patients. Individuals using cannabinoids should be followed for potential adverse effects such as effects on neurocognitive function, gastrointestinal symptoms, and broncho-reactive airway disease. CBD has significantly less psychotropic effects compared with tetrahydrocannabinol; thus, it offers a relatively safer alternative to cannabis and a better therapeutic choice.

         ]. Chronic pain in SCD differs from chronic pain in other settings (eg, cancer pain) in that in SCD chronic pain is typically interspersed with episodic and chaotic waxing and waning acute pain. SCD-associated pain is also likely to have a larger component of neuropathic pain, peripheral and central sensitization to pain, and opioid hyperalgesia. The purpose of pain control is to maximize functioning and quality of life over decades, rather than to provide shorter-term palliative care.

         Individuals with SCD may have to navigate a greater number of providers unfamiliar with their condition and may face a higher degree of provider misperceptions about the existence and intensity of pain than individuals with cancer. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Management is individualized according to the causes, intensity, and duration of pain and values and concerns of the individual and their clinician  (

          Opioids
         </strong>
         – Opioid management in individuals with SCD is complex for many reasons. A good therapeutic relationship and input from clinicians with expertise in chronic pain management and the special needs of individuals with SCD is needed, in which opioids can be managed collaboratively with shared decision making. (See
         <a class="local">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The prevalence of opioid use disorder in individuals with SCD is similar to or less common than other populations; however, individuals with SCD who develop an opioid use disorder have special care requirements that must balance the management of the opioid use disorder along with the need for ongoing evaluation and treatment of severe pain, which may have several causes including vaso-occlusive pain and other conditions that require other types of treatments.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         As noted in a communication from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), unique considerations in SCD can change the balance of risks and benefits of opioids, and guidance on opioid use for the general population should not be extrapolated to individuals with SCD; SCD-specific guidance related to treatment of pain is more appropriate [

         Attempts should be made to taper opioids in outpatients once their pain has been controlled and the preventive therapies described above have been maximized.

A multidisciplinary approach is advisable, along with close communication with the patient about the tapering plan.

         – Over one-fourth of adults with SCD require daily opioid therapy. This often impairs the quality of life and is linked to central sensitization, risk of depression, and opioid side effects. In addition, some patients have become tolerant to opioid benefits, and some have developed opioid use disorder, although this is rare. Investigation of alternatives to standard opioids in chronic pain syndromes is a priority.

         A period of regular transfusions may be effective in some individuals to break the cycle of refractory/chronic pain or frequent pain episodes that are not controlled with analgesics or

         </a>
         or as a temporizing measure while the individual is being evaluated for (or treated with) therapies that may take time to become effective. Transfusions are thought to work by lowering the percentage of sickle hemoglobin and preventing vaso-occlusion. Thus, this approach is most likely to be effective in individuals with chronic or frequent vaso-occlusive pain and less likely to be effective in those whose pain is predominantly due to other causes (eg, compression fractures, neuropathic pain).
        </p>
        <p>
         When used for this indication, transfusions may be given for a defined period of time (eg, six months) with close assessment and monitoring to determine whether they are effective. Simple transfusions and phlebotomy may be used to maintain the hemoglobin S below 50 percent.

          Context for prevention

         – Vaso-occlusive pain is the most common reason for individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) to seek medical attention. Pain interferes with quality of life and is challenging to manage. Implementing the best approach to reduce future vaso-occlusive pain events and manage chronic pain requires a good therapeutic relationship with trust and communication. Management often benefits from an individualized care plan to which patients, family members, other caregivers, emergency department personnel, and all other involved clinicians have access. (See

          table 3

         ). It has been demonstrated to improve survival. Many individuals who would benefit are not treated with hydroxyurea, and many who are treated with hydroxyurea are not receiving the optimal dose. (See

         When medical therapy is indicated for vaso-occlusive pain prevention in infants ≥9 months, children adolescents, or adults, we recommend appropriately-dosed hydroxyurea over other disease-modifying therapies (

          Chronic pain evaluation
         </strong>
         – Chronic pain is experienced by a large percentage of individuals with SCD. Not all chronic pain is due to vaso-occlusion, and it is important to identify other causes of pain that may require different therapies, including orthopedic complications (avascular necrosis, compression fractures, arthropathy), menstrual cycle pain, psychiatric disorders, and others. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Chronic pain management
         </strong>
         – Chronic pain in SCD differs from chronic pain in other settings such as cancer pain, in that in SCD, chronic pain is typically interspersed with episodic and chaotic waxing and waning acute pain. Management is individualized according to the causes, intensity, and duration of pain and values and concerns of the individual and their clinician  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106388" href="/z/d/graphic/106388.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). It is important to provide adequate opioids as well as to avoid unnecessary opioid escalation and to taper opioids when appropriate. The prevalence of opioid use disorder is less common than in other populations but brings special considerations related to SCD when it occurs. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Management of chronic pain'
