Expression of the BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase distinguishes Ph+ ALL from other types of ALL and renders this leukemia vulnerable to treatment with a BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which is an essential component of treatment. Remission induction therapy is designed to reduce the initial leukemic burden and achieve a hematologic complete remission and a robust molecular response. This phase of treatment must be followed by post-remission therapy to enable long-term disease control and possible cure.</p><p>This topic will discuss remission induction therapy for Ph+ ALL in adults. </p><p>The following subjects are presented separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Post-remission management of Ph+ ALL in adults.

Once a treatment regimen is selected, it is important to adhere to the published protocol, rather than selecting components from different treatment protocols.</p><p>Broadly speaking, management of Ph+ ALL comprises the following phases of treatment  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63462" href="/d/graphic/63462.html" rel="external">table 2</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Remission induction therapy</strong> – Remission induction therapy reduces the initial leukemic burden with the goals of achieving a hematologic complete remission (CR) and a robust molecular response. Induction regimens vary in intensity and toxicity, so these goals are appropriate for patients of any age and/or fitness level. Achieving a CR reduces disease-associated symptoms, prolongs survival, and, when coupled with effective post-remission management, enables long-term disease control and possible cure. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The essential components of remission induction therapy for Ph+ ALL are discussed below.

Ph+ ALL inevitably recurs unless remission induction therapy is followed by effective post-remission management.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Post-remission management of Ph+ ALL generally includes consolidation therapy (intensive treatment that follows soon after achieving CR) and maintenance therapy (prolonged treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor [TKI], with or without lower-intensity chemotherapy), as discussed separately.

The presence of <em>BCR-ABL1</em> should be confirmed, medical fitness assessed, and a central venous catheter placed. Medical complications (eg, infections, hemorrhage) should be stabilized before beginning induction therapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2250775434"><span class="h2">Clinical/laboratory evaluation</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clinical:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Complications and consequences of leukemia – The patient should be evaluated for complications and consequences of anemia (eg, dyspnea, weakness), neutropenia (eg, infections), and thrombocytopenia (eg, bleeding, bruising). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Comorbid conditions – Clinical manifestations of comorbid illnesses, including heart disease, pulmonary processes, and renal impairment should be evaluated, as they may influence the choice of induction therapy.

(See <a class="local">'CNS evaluation'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Note that if an LP is not performed as part of the pretreatment evaluation, a therapeutic LP to administer prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy should coincide with the start of remission induction therapy, as described below.

If results are not available, bone marrow examination should be performed prior to initiating treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4686.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma", section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) for <em>BCR-ABL1</em> transcript should be performed to establish a baseline value for monitoring MRD. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mutation analysis of <em>BCR-ABL1</em> is not routinely performed at the time of initiation of induction therapy.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2687706201"><span class="h2">Medical fitness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prior to initiating therapy, we assess medical fitness based on performance status, comorbid conditions, and physiologic fitness. Importantly, age, per se, does not determine the level of fitness.</p><p>When considering comorbidities, chronic conditions should be weighted more heavily than temporary conditions caused by complications of the leukemia (eg, infection, heart failure exacerbated by anemia), which may improve with effective induction therapy and can enhance tolerance for subsequent therapy.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Instruments</strong> <strong>for assessing fitness</strong> – We use the following tools to assess medical fitness:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901" href="/d/graphic/72901.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Physiologic fitness (eg, comorbid conditions, activities of daily living, physical performance tests, cognition), as measured by the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65323" href="/d/graphic/65323.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Classification</strong> <strong>of medical fitness </strong>– Following are our suggestions for classifying medical fitness:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Medically-fit: Both ECOG PS 0 to 2 <strong>and </strong>CCI 0 to 2</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Medically-unfit, but not frail: Either ECOG PS ≥3 <strong>or</strong> CCI ≥3</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Frail: Both ECOG: ≥3 <strong>and</strong> CCI ≥3</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">There are no clear distinctions between these categories, and some measures of PS or physiologic fitness can apply to different categories of fitness.

Several days may be needed to obtain results from cytogenetic and/or molecular studies to confirm the diagnosis of Ph+ ALL and exclude other conditions in the differential diagnosis, as discussed above. (See <a class="local">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p>While awaiting pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis of Ph+ ALL, we manage infections, bleeding, hyperuricemia, dehydration, renal dysfunction, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and other complications. We generally begin hydration and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8439" href="/d/drug information/8439.html" rel="external">allopurinol</a> to lessen the risk of hyperuricemia and its complications. If there is extreme leukocytosis (eg, &gt;50,000 white blood cells/microL), we treat with stepwise increases of a glucocorticoid (eg, beginning with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> 25 mg daily) prior to initiation of induction therapy. Some centers routinely administer a glucocorticoid for three days and monitor for tumor lysis syndrome while awaiting confirmation of the diagnosis of Ph+ ALL, but a role for such prephase treatment of ALL in adults has not been firmly established.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H162128802"><span class="h2">Pretreatment management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pretreatment management should include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Central venous access device should be inserted.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Referral to a transplantation team to assess eligibility for HCT and initiate a search for a family or alternate donor.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fertility counseling and preservation.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1589879644"><span class="h1">REMISSION INDUCTION THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The patient with Ph+ ALL should either be referred to a specialty center for care or must be treated by a clinician who has the necessary experience and resources to treat with strict adherence to a contemporary published protocol. Once a treatment regimen is selected, it is important to adhere to the published protocol, rather than selecting components from different treatment protocols. We encourage participation in a clinical trial whenever possible.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3489734762"><span class="h2">Essential components</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is consensus that all remission induction regimens for Ph+ ALL must include: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). (See <a class="local">'A TKI is required'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><strong>plus</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A glucocorticoid <strong>or</strong> chemotherapy.

(See <a class="local">'CNS management'</a> below.)</p><p>Evidence for the roles of the various components of remission induction therapy is discussed in the sections that follow.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3732011601"><span class="h2">TKI</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1520348227"><span class="h3">A TKI is required</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For remission induction therapy of Ph+ ALL, we recommend a regimen that includes a TKI rather than a regimen that does not include a TKI, based on superior response rates and long-term outcomes with little incremental toxicity when a TKI is included. </p><p>No randomized trials have directly compared specific remission induction regimens with or without a TKI. However, inclusion of a TKI in induction therapy is associated with markedly superior outcomes and little incremental toxicity, based on numerous prospective and retrospective studies [<a href="#rid3">3-17</a>]. Compared with historical controls treated with chemotherapy alone [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>], adding a TKI is associated with higher rates of complete remission (CR; eg &gt;90 percent versus 60 to 70 percent), superior long-term overall survival (OS; approximately 50 percent versus ≤20 percent), and a greater likelihood of proceeding to hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) [<a href="#rid3">3,20-24</a>].</p><p>Importantly, a TKI is an essential component of induction therapy for Ph+ ALL, but it alone is not sufficient. Because a TKI alone does not provide a deep enough and/or sustained molecular response, it must be combined with either chemotherapy or a glucocorticoid, as described below. (See <a class="local">'A TKI alone is not sufficient'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2631357448"><span class="h3">Choice of TKI</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>No specific BCR-ABL1 TKI is optimal for all patients with Ph+ ALL. The choice of a TKI is informed by the toxicity profile, comorbid illnesses, ease of administration, availability, and cost. The TKIs have not been compared head-to-head in Ph+ ALL, and different induction regimens have not been specifically tested with each TKI. </p><p>We favor <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8852" href="/d/drug information/8852.html" rel="external">dasatinib</a> because it has an established track record in prospective studies and may have some CNS penetration, it is effective against some<em> BCR-ABL1</em> mutations that do not respond to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">imatinib</a>, and it is generally well-tolerated. However, we consider it acceptable to treat with a different TKI for the following reasons:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Contraindication – For patients with a pleural effusion, pulmonary hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmias, or qualitative platelet disorders, we generally treat with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">imatinib</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9448" href="/d/drug information/9448.html" rel="external">nilotinib</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="87456" href="/d/drug information/87456.html" rel="external">ponatinib</a>. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Not approved – The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8852" href="/d/drug information/8852.html" rel="external">dasatinib</a> for Ph+ ALL, but it is not approved in all countries. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">Imatinib</a>, which is approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for initial treatment of Ph+ ALL, is an acceptable alternative.</p><p></p><p>Individual TKIs have not been compared head-to-head in Ph+ ALL. A meta-analysis and a propensity-matched score analysis showed superiority of ponatinib-based regimens over regimens containing first- or second-generation TKIs, but <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="87456" href="/d/drug information/87456.html" rel="external">ponatinib</a> is associated with substantial cardiovascular toxicity, as described below [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>].

All TKIs are associated with certain early adverse effects, which may include rash, nausea, muscle cramps, edema, diarrhea, or fatigue. Most of these early adverse effects are modest, self-limited, and can be managed with supportive measures. Management of the early adverse effects of TKIs are described separately.
