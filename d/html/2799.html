Anemia can impair the patient's functional status, diminish physiologic reserve, cause potentially disabling fatigue, and it has been linked to a poor prognosis in several malignancies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2802.html" rel="external">"Cancer-related fatigue: Prevalence, screening, and clinical assessment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2813.html" rel="external">"Cancer-related fatigue: Treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7140.html" rel="external">"Causes of anemia in patients with cancer", section on 'WHO and NCI CTCAE gradings of anemia'</a>.)</p><p>Multiple factors can cause or contribute to anemia in patients with malignancy (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7140.html" rel="external">"Causes of anemia in patients with cancer"</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Underlying malignancy</strong> – As can occur with other chronic inflammatory conditions, some cancer patients have anemia that is a consequence of the disease and is unrelated to treatment. This type of anemia is typically mild (ie, hemoglobin [Hb] level &gt;10 g/dL), and the symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from those caused by the underlying malignancy. Occasionally, the anemia may be more severe, impairing functional status, diminishing physiologic reserve, and reducing quality of life. Successful resolution or remission of the underlying malignancy may address this cause of anemia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7149.html" rel="external">"Anemia of chronic disease/anemia of inflammation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cancer treatment</strong> – Anemia is often exacerbated by myelosuppressive cancer treatment, particularly in patients who are undergoing intensive chemotherapy or combined modality treatment with both chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT) [<a href="#rid1">1-5</a>]. Anemia arising in the setting of myelosuppressive cancer treatment may also be a result of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15776.html" rel="external">"Myelodysplastic syndromes/neoplasms (MDS): Management of hematologic complications in lower-risk MDS"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other causes</strong> – In addition to direct effects of the malignancy or its treatment, other causes of anemia may coexist (eg, blood loss; hemolysis; clonal cytopenias; or deficiencies of iron, folate, copper, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9302" href="/z/d/drug information/9302.html" rel="external">vitamin B12</a>). These causes commonly coexist, and should be actively sought and treated appropriately when present, before consideration of ESA use. Determining who is "iron deficient" in the setting of anemia of chronic disease can be challenging. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7150.html" rel="external">"Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7149.html" rel="external">"Anemia of chronic disease/anemia of inflammation", section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7155.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>This topic review will focus primarily on the indications, efficacy, and risks associated with the erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9410" href="/z/d/drug information/9410.html" rel="external">epoetin alfa</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8662" href="/z/d/drug information/8662.html" rel="external">darbepoetin alfa</a>, and biosimilars in anemic patients with nonhematologic malignancies. The issues surrounding the use of ESAs for patients with hematologic malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndromes, are distinct and discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4504.html" rel="external">"Overview of the complications of chronic lymphocytic leukemia", section on 'Chemotherapy-induced anemia'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4531.html" rel="external">"Myelofibrosis (MF): Management of primary MF and secondary MF"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15776.html" rel="external">"Myelodysplastic syndromes/neoplasms (MDS): Management of hematologic complications in lower-risk MDS", section on 'Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">MANAGING ANEMIA IN CANCER PATIENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Eradication of the underlying malignancy and discontinuation of anticancer therapy represents definitive therapy for cancer and cancer treatment-related anemia. However, in many cases, this is not possible. Although successful treatment of the malignancy with combinations of surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy (RT) may, in the long term, improve the hemoglobin (Hb) level, short-term red blood cell (RBC) support may be needed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3550482402"><span class="h2">ESAs versus transfusion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hb levels can be raised with either ESAs or RBC transfusions. The choice between these approaches should be individualized. In general, the following apply:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ESAs</strong> – ESAs are indicated for patients who have mildly to moderately symptomatic chemotherapy-associated anemia who have no other potentially correctable causes of the anemia, an Hb level ≤10 g/dL prior to therapy, and no contraindications to the use of an ESA (eg, prior history of thromboses, surgery, prolonged periods of immobilization or limited activity, or uncontrolled hypertension). Whether ESAs should be restricted to patients being treated with palliative rather than curative intent for their cancer is controversial. (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> below and <a class="local">'Should use be avoided in patients treated with curative intent?'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Transfusion</strong> – We recommend RBC transfusion rather than an ESA for patients whose clinical condition indicates the need for immediate correction of the Hb level (eg, severely symptomatic, cardiopulmonary compromise, and need for a rise in Hb before the two to four weeks or more that it may take for ESAs to take effect), and for patients who have established general risk factors for thromboembolic events or uncontrolled hypertension and thus are poor candidates for ESAs. An algorithm for RBC transfusion decisions in adults is available  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131907" href="/z/d/graphic/131907.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H599921659"><span class="h3">Comparative efficacy and safety</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Transfusion</strong> – RBC transfusions are almost universally successful in raising Hb levels, although they have risks and availability may be limited. Transfusions can often ameliorate the patient's symptoms rapidly and improve health-related quality of life. Exceptions include patients unable to be transfused because of the presence of multiple alloantibodies and those who refuse transfusions based on religious beliefs. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7927.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient who declines blood transfusion"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Risks of RBC transfusion include infection with transfusion-transmitted pathogens, allergic and immune transfusion reactions, volume overload, hyperkalemia, and potential for iron overload with multiple transfusions. The indications and Hb thresholds for RBC transfusions to treat anemia, and accompanying risks and complications, are discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7939.html" rel="external">"Practical aspects of red blood cell transfusion in adults: Storage, processing, modifications, and infusion"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7948.html" rel="external">"Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusion in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The risk of transfusion-transmitted infection (eg, HIV, hepatitis C virus) is lower than when ESAs were originally developed because of improvements in donor screening  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69661" href="/z/d/graphic/69661.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7946.html" rel="external">"Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Each unit of transfused RBCs contains 200 to 250 mg of iron. Since the body has no physiologic mechanism to induce iron loss, a patient requiring 16 to 20 or more units of packed RBCs will have accumulated 4 to 5 g or more of excess body iron and may show signs of iron overload. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7157.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with suspected iron overload", section on 'Transfusional iron overload'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Epoetin and </strong><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8662" href="/z/d/drug information/8662.html" rel="external">darbepoetin</a> – The ESAs epoetin and darbepoetin are equally effective and safe in raising Hb levels and decreasing transfusion requirements in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]. However, use of these agents in patients with cancer has decreased over time because of evolving data linking ESA use to thromboembolic complications, inferior survival, and worse cancer outcomes, particularly when used in patients whose anemia is unrelated to chemotherapy, and in those being treated with curative intent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">While there is general agreement that ESAs are not indicated in anemic cancer patients who are not receiving chemotherapy (with the exception of myelodysplastic syndromes or coexistent renal failure), whether ESAs should be avoided in patients who are receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy with the intent of cure remains controversial. (See <a class="local">'Effect on disease control and survival'</a> below and <a class="local">'Issues related to thromboembolic risk'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Biosimilars of epoetin alfa are available globally. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9410" href="/z/d/drug information/9410.html" rel="external">Epoetin alfa-epbx</a> was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 for the treatment of anemia caused by chronic kidney disease. Other biosimilars are available in Europe and have been used for at least 10 years with no major concerns. (See <a class="local">'Epoetin alfa'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Efficacy and safety outcomes do not appear to differ significantly between patients treated with the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9410" href="/z/d/drug information/9410.html" rel="external">epoetin alfa</a> originator and those treated with a biosimilar, although the bulk of the data are in patients with chronic kidney disease, and the quality of the evidence is low [<a href="#rid9">9-14</a>]. Nevertheless, 2019 updated guidelines on the use of ESAs in patients with cancer-associated anemia from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/American Society of Hematology (ASH) consider biosimilar epoetin alfa to be similar in effectiveness and safety to epoetin alfa [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1387225425"><span class="h3">Other factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition to the potential risks described above, many factors influence the choice of an ESA or a RBC transfusion for a patient with symptomatic anemia, including the following  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78476" href="/z/d/graphic/78476.html" rel="external">table 2</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Timing of response</strong> – Clinical responses to transfusions occur almost immediately, while meaningful responses to ESAs may take weeks to months. Patients with advanced malignancy may have a relatively short life expectancy, and prompt relief of symptoms is important. In these circumstances, transfusion may be particularly appropriate in severely symptomatic patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Factors impacting toxicity risks</strong> – The risk of complications with transfusion and ESAs is impacted by patient factors, including comorbidities and treatments received.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Transfusions are a preferred option for anemic patients with uncontrolled hypertension and for those at increased risk of thromboembolism (eg, prior history of thromboses, surgery, prolonged periods of immobilization or limited activity, administration of chemotherapy agents that increase thrombotic risk [eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8683" href="/z/d/drug information/8683.html" rel="external">bevacizumab</a> and other antiangiogenic agents, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10095" href="/z/d/drug information/10095.html" rel="external">thalidomide</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9822" href="/z/d/drug information/9822.html" rel="external">lenalidomide</a>]).

The relative cost of ESAs versus transfusions [<a href="#rid15">15</a>], along with insurance coverage and blood availability issues [<a href="#rid16">16</a>], may become an important factor in determining which approach will be used.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">CLINICAL USE OF ESAS IN CANCER PATIENTS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2653860944"><span class="h2">Indications</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1020583020"><span class="h3">Minimal requirements</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ESAs are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic anemia in patients with neoplasms that are nonmyeloid in origin when the anemia is due to chemotherapy. Consistent with guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/American Society of Hematology (ASH), cancer patients with anemia should meet all the following criteria before being treated with an ESA:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The anemia should be symptomatic. Correctable causes of the anemia should be ruled out or treated, if present, prior to the use of an ESA.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The patient's anemia should be associated with use of chemotherapy. Current clinical trial evidence, professional society guidelines, and product approval indications do <strong>not</strong> support the use of ESAs for the treatment of anemia due to malignancy in the absence of chemotherapy. Use of ESAs in patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef85832" href="/z/d/graphic/85832.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) to avoid transfusions is an exception to this recommendation.

In addition to providing patients with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medication guide, ASCO/ASH guidelines suggest that the clinician discuss a number of specific issues before prescribing ESAs  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55973" href="/z/d/graphic/55973.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). (See <a class="local">'Efficacy and risks in cancer patients'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia who meet all of the above criteria and who are well informed as to the potential risks, we suggest the use of ESAs, rather than transfusion, as long as they do not have a heightened risk for thromboembolic events (eg, prior history of thromboses, surgery, prolonged periods of immobilization or limited activity) or uncontrolled hypertension. ESAs can also be used for treatment of anemic patients where RBC transfusions cannot be provided safely (volume overload or transfusion reactions), for patients who are averse to RBC transfusions or who do not have ready access to an appropriate facility for transfusion, or when RBC supplies are limited. (See <a class="local">'Other factors'</a> above.)</p><p>We recommend RBC transfusion rather than an ESA for patients whose clinical condition indicates the need for immediate correction of the Hb level, and for patients who have established general risk factors for thromboembolic events or uncontrolled hypertension.</p><p>The data on efficacy and safety of ESAs in patients receiving chemotherapy are described in detail below.

However, results from large clinical trials and meta-analyses support the view that ESAs are not beneficial in this setting and are potentially harmful [<a href="#rid6">6,19-22</a>], as described in the sections below. (See <a class="local">'Efficacy and risks in cancer patients'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients with anemia due to a solid tumor or nonmyeloid hematologic malignancy who are not receiving chemotherapy, we recommend <strong>not</strong> using an ESA to treat the anemia. The use of ESAs for patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and a baseline erythropoietin level ≤500 units/L to avoid transfusions is one exception to this recommendation [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], as is use in patients with concomitant renal failure.

(See <a class="local">'Other factors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>For patients with anemia due to a solid tumor or nonmyeloid hematologic malignancy who are not receiving chemotherapy, we recommend <strong>not</strong> using an ESA (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). Such patients are appropriately transfused according to Hb level, symptoms, and comorbidities. (See <a class="local">'Patients not receiving chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">As exceptions, ESAs can be used for treatment of symptomatic anemic patients not receiving chemotherapy where RBC transfusions cannot be provided safely (volume overload or transfusion reactions), for patients who are averse to or refuse RBC transfusions or who do not have ready access to an appropriate facility for transfusion, when RBC supplies are limited, or in patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome to avoid transfusion. (See <a class="local">'Efficacy and risks in cancer patients'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15776.html" rel="external">"Myelodysplastic syndromes/neoplasms (MDS): Management of hematologic complications in lower-risk MDS", section on 'Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>For patients with chemotherapy-induced symptomatic anemia (Hb &lt;10 g/dL) and a nonhematologic malignancy, we suggest the use of ESAs rather than transfusion as long as there is no contraindication to ESA (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). We do not distinguish between chemotherapy given for curative versus palliative intent; some experts consider ESA treatment only for patients receiving chemotherapy for noncurative intent. (See <a class="local">'Minimal requirements'</a> above and <a class="local">'Should use be avoided in patients treated with curative intent?'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">However, ESAs may also be beneficial for symptomatic patients who need higher Hb levels (eg, coronary artery disease). The decision to use an ESA for a Hb level between 10 and 12 g/dL requires clinical judgment, consideration of the risks/benefits of ESAs, and the patient preferences.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">RBC transfusion is an appropriate alternative if there are contraindications to ESA (risk factors for thromboembolic events, uncontrolled hypertension).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Choice of ESA</strong> – Epoetin, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8662" href="/z/d/drug information/8662.html" rel="external">darbepoetin</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9410" href="/z/d/drug information/9410.html" rel="external">epoetin alfa</a> biosimilars appear to be similarly effective. Darbepoetin may be more convenient than epoetin.
