(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/111.html" rel="external">"Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Approach to the evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112.html" rel="external">"Functional abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Management in primary care"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1066917703"><span class="h1">GOALS OF EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among children, abdominal pain is a frequent, nonspecific symptom that is typically associated with self-limited conditions such as gastroenteritis, constipation, and viral illnesses. The challenge for the clinician is to identify patients with serious causes of abdominal pain that require specific intervention:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute abdomen from appendicitis or bowel obstruction (as can occur from volvulus, intussusception, or adhesions); acute manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, hepatitis, myocarditis, or intra-abdominal mass</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Extra-abdominal infections such as streptococcal pharyngitis, urinary tract infection, or pneumonia</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unusual manifestations of less common diseases such as Hirschsprung disease or primary bacterial peritonitis with nephrotic syndrome</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diabetic ketoacidosis</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The causes of acute abdominal pain in children are summarized in the table with clinical features discussed in detail separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65488" href="/d/graphic/65488.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6454.html" rel="external">"Causes of acute abdominal pain in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The first goal of the evaluation of children with abdominal pain is to identify life-threatening conditions that require emergency interventions. Subsequently, other causes of abdominal pain can often be identified through deliberate evaluation with careful attention to the clinical features of the illness (such as the child's age and sex, history of trauma, pattern of the pain, related symptoms with attention to the time sequence, physical findings based on single or repeated examinations, and selected diagnostic studies)  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57204" href="/d/graphic/57204.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69041" href="/d/graphic/69041.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p>Unavoidably, a small number of patients who may present early in the course of an illness (such as appendicitis) or with subtle and/or atypical signs do not receive the definitive diagnosis on the initial evaluation [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Consequently, repeat examination and reliable follow-up are essential components of the evaluation and management of children with acute abdominal pain.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Key historical variables that may assist in identifying a specific cause of abdominal pain include the patient's age, history of trauma, prior abdominal surgery, fever, vomiting, location, and character of the abdominal pain, and the pattern of symptoms. A gynecologic history (including last menstrual period and sexual activity) should be obtained for pubertal girls.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2012877057"><span class="h3">Age</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Conditions that cause abdominal pain in children may vary with the age of the child  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65488" href="/d/graphic/65488.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>For example, serious etiologies of abdominal pain that present with obstruction and/ or peritonitis according to age include:</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Neonates – Volvulus (as a complication of malrotation) and necrotizing enterocolitis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Two months to two years – Intussusception (invagination of a part of the intestine into itself, causing obstruction), incarcerated hernia, and complications of Hirschsprung disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Children – Appendicitis (most commonly in children &gt;5 years of age) and, less commonly, primary bacterial peritonitis (usually as a complication of nephrotic syndrome) or obstruction due to adhesions from a prior surgery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Adolescents – Appendicitis and, less commonly, obstruction caused by adhesions from previous surgery or inflammation, perforated ulcer, or primary bacterial peritonitis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Among postmenarchal females, serious conditions within the reproductive tract that can cause abdominal pain include ovarian torsion, pelvic inflammatory disease with tubo-ovarian abscess, and ruptured ectopic pregnancy.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Trauma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Abdominal trauma (typically sustained in motor vehicle crashes, auto-pedestrian collisions, or falls) can cause life-threatening injuries (such as solid organ injury or perforated viscus). Typical mechanisms include motor vehicle crashes, falls, and child abuse. However, a history of trauma may not be forthcoming for infants and children who have sustained inflicted injuries. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6553.html" rel="external">"Pediatric blunt abdominal trauma: Initial evaluation and stabilization"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/103420.html" rel="external">"Physical child abuse: Recognition", section on 'Visceral injuries'</a>.)</p><p>Although symptoms of abdominal injury typically occur immediately, they may be delayed with some injuries (such as left shoulder pain from a slowly expanding splenic hematoma, vomiting from obstruction as the result of a duodenal hematoma, or bowel perforation associated with a lap seatbelt injury). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6553.html" rel="external">"Pediatric blunt abdominal trauma: Initial evaluation and stabilization", section on 'Specific injuries'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H966244506"><span class="h3">Infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children with intra- and extra-abdominal infections may present with a primary complaint of abdominal pain. Common conditions that are associated with acute abdominal pain include: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Viral gastroenteritis </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Systemic viral illness </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Streptococcal pharyngitis </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lobar pneumonia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Urinary tract infections</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1086196161"><span class="h3">Exacerbation of chronic condition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute abdominal pain may also represent an exacerbation of a chronic condition. Frequent causes of chronic or recurrent abdominal pain include constipation, functional abdominal pain, gastroesophageal reflux, and dietary intolerance. In one- to three-month-old infants, abdominal pain and fussiness may be signs of colic (although other etiologies should be excluded). Acute abdominal pain may also represent an exacerbation of a chronic condition in older children and adolescents, such as inflammatory bowel disease, abdominal migraine, or gastrointestinal dysmotility.</p><p>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6454.html" rel="external">"Causes of acute abdominal pain in children and adolescents", section on 'Common causes'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Characteristics of abdominal pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Infants and children younger than two years of age with abdominal pain usually cannot describe or localize pain. This limitation leads to both over and under attribution of symptoms to "abdominal pain." Parents/primary caregivers may infer that the child has abdominal pain from symptoms such as drawing the legs up or inconsolability. The preschool child may be able to describe pain and other symptoms, although descriptions may not be consistently reliable. Above five years of age, children can typically characterize the onset, frequency, duration, and location of their symptom.</p><p>Specific diagnoses may be associated with the following characteristic patterns of pain:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Appendicitis – Periumbilical, migrating to the right lower abdomen</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Appendiceal rupture (early), ovarian torsion – Acute, severe, focal</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intussusception – Intermittent, colicky</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Gastroenteritis – Diffuse or vague</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hepatitis and cholecystitis – Right upper quadrant</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Gastritis, gastric ulcer disease – Epigastric</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pancreatitis – Steady periumbilical and/or subxiphoid pain, often radiating to the back</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Renal stone – Flank pain radiating to mid to lower lateral abdomen</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Constipation – Intermittent, often left sided</p><p></p><p>For children with localized peritoneal irritation (as with advanced/complicated appendicitis), pain can be aggravated by movement (such as, coughing, hopping, traveling in the car or walking). In comparison, patients with visceral pain may writhe with discomfort. Improvement in pain after a bout of emesis may occur with conditions localized to the small bowel [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Pain relief after a bowel movement suggests a colonic condition including chronic constipation, or bowel inflammation from a host of causes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Associated symptoms</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fever</strong> – In an observational series describing children evaluated for abdominal pain in outpatient settings, 64 percent had a history of fever [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Patients with appendicitis often have fever, which may be initially low grade. Most children with abdominal pain and fever, however, have infectious etiologies such as gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection, or pharyngitis [<a href="#rid1">1,3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Bacterial infections that may be associated with abdominal pain include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Streptococcal pharyngitis (often with sore throat, headache, and vomiting), although children with viral pharyngitis can also have abdominal pain (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5971.html" rel="external">"Group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis in children and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical features'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Urinary tract infections (sometimes with vomiting or, less often, diarrhea in younger children) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5990.html" rel="external">"Urinary tract infections in infants and children older than one month: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lower lobe pneumonia (usually with respiratory symptoms such as tachypnea or cough, but without abdominal tenderness on examination) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5986.html" rel="external">"Community-acquired pneumonia in children: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pelvic inflammatory disease (in postmenarchal, sexually active females) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7581.html" rel="external">"Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical features'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vomiting</strong> – Vomiting is frequently reported among children with abdominal pain. In the previously noted series, 42 percent of patients had a history of vomiting [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Children with vomiting and abdominal pain (particularly in the absence of diarrhea) should be carefully evaluated for life-threatening conditions such as bowel obstruction or appendicitis with peritonitis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Volvulus must be excluded as the cause of bilious emesis and apparent abdominal pain in a neonate (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6477.html" rel="external">"Intestinal malrotation in children", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>With intussusception, vomiting (initially nonbilious, but often becoming bilious as the obstruction progresses) may occur following episodes of pain (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5898.html" rel="external">"Intussusception in children", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Small bowel obstruction may develop as the result of many conditions, including postoperative or postinflammatory adhesions.
