The irAEs result from damage that occurs due to immune activation and inflammation induced by these drugs and can affect nearly every organ system.</p><p>This class of drugs works by blocking inhibitory molecules on T cells, antigen-presenting cells, and tumors, thus allowing an enhanced endogenous T-cell-mediated immune response to cancer. The efficacy of ICIs was first demonstrated in metastatic melanoma, but many indications have since been approved, including non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and other advanced malignancies (see specific disease-related topic reviews). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/99637.html" rel="external">"Principles of cancer immunotherapy", section on 'Checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15863.html" rel="external">"Systemic treatment of metastatic melanoma lacking a BRAF mutation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90312.html" rel="external">"Initial management of advanced non-small cell lung cancer lacking a driver mutation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2984.html" rel="external">"Systemic therapy of advanced clear cell renal carcinoma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4765.html" rel="external">"Treatment of relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma", section on 'Targeted chemotherapy and immunotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>The rheumatologic complications of ICIs and their management will be reviewed here. The range of irAEs with non-rheumatologic manifestations (eg, colitis, endocrine disease, and others) and rheumatic disorders occurring due to other types of cancer treatment are described in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/96368.html" rel="external">"Toxicities associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5615.html" rel="external">"Malignancy and rheumatic disorders", section on 'Rheumatic disorders associated with treatments for malignant disease'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2855374222"><span class="h1">IMMUNE CHECKPOINT INHIBITOR MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The several approved immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) target different sets of regulatory interactions. Normally, when a T cell is activated, multiple mechanisms control the level of activation both centrally and peripherally [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Two main interactions that control T-cell activation are cytotoxic lymphocyte antigen protein 4 (CTLA-4, also called CD152) on T cells binding with CD80/86 (also called B7-1 and B7-2) on antigen-presenting cells, and programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) binding to programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1, also known as B7-H1) or programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2 [B7-H2]) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/99637.html" rel="external">"Principles of cancer immunotherapy"</a>). By blocking these inhibitory pathways, checkpoint inhibitors allow for increased activation of T cells and a greater immune response against tumors.</p><p>The first approved ICI, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16084" href="/z/d/drug information/16084.html" rel="external">ipilimumab</a>, blocks the binding of CTLA-4 to its ligands CD80/86. Subsequent ICIs have targeted PD-1 (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="96957" href="/z/d/drug information/96957.html" rel="external">pembrolizumab</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="98764" href="/z/d/drug information/98764.html" rel="external">nivolumab</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="119172" href="/z/d/drug information/119172.html" rel="external">cemiplimab</a>) or PD-L1 (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="108314" href="/z/d/drug information/108314.html" rel="external">atezolizumab</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="112481" href="/z/d/drug information/112481.html" rel="external">avelumab</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="112994" href="/z/d/drug information/112994.html" rel="external">durvalumab</a>)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115900" href="/z/d/graphic/115900.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/99637.html" rel="external">"Principles of cancer immunotherapy", section on 'Checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3841094854"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS OF RHEUMATOLOGIC COMPLICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can lead to off-target tissue damage known as immune-related adverse events (irAEs) due to nonspecific activation of T cells. Clinical manifestations of irAEs are diverse with respect to the organ systems involved, severity, and temporal relationship to ICI therapy [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>The specific immune pathways that are relevant for the pathogenesis of particular irAEs are still under investigation. There are no published correlative data for the pathogenesis of rheumatologic irAEs, but there are some data from other types of irAEs. In colitis, levels of interleukin (IL) 17 were correlated with more severe disease, suggesting a role for this cytokine and the T-helper 17 (Th17) cell response in pathogenesis. Histology from multiple affected organs has shown diverse inflammatory infiltrates [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>The immune checkpoints targeted by ICIs are relevant for classic rheumatologic diseases, suggesting a possible overlap in mechanism. As an example, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8526" href="/z/d/drug information/8526.html" rel="external">abatacept</a>, a fusion protein of the extracellular domain of cytotoxic lymphocyte antigen protein 4 (CTLA-4) and the Fc portion of immunoglobulin (Ig)G, has been an effective treatment for inflammatory arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and psoriatic arthritis. Its mechanism can be thought of as the converse of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16084" href="/z/d/drug information/16084.html" rel="external">ipilimumab</a> in that it blocks the activating interaction between CD28 and CD80/86, rather than blocking the inhibitory interaction.</p><p>CTLA-4 and other immune checkpoint molecules have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren's disease [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) may be important to RA pathogenesis, as indicated by some mouse and human studies [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H580950061"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Rheumatologic immune-related adverse events (irAEs) have been less consistently reported in the published literature than other types of irAEs. The most common symptom is arthralgia, which has generally been described in approximately 10 to 15 percent of patients, followed by myalgia and sicca complex, both occurring with a similar frequency as arthralgia [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. However, estimates vary substantially; a 2017 systematic review found reported frequencies from 1 to 43 percent for arthralgia and 2 to 20 percent for myalgia [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The development of symptoms of an inflammatory systemic autoimmune disease, such as inflammatory arthritis, myositis, Sjögren's disease, or vasculitis, that may require referral to a rheumatologist is much less common, occurring in approximately 3.5 to 6.6 percent of patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. The known or suspected rheumatologic irAEs include inflammatory arthritis, sicca syndrome, inflammatory myopathy, vasculitis (including giant cell [temporal] arteritis [GCA], antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, and single-organ vasculitis), polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), eosinophilic fasciitis, sarcoidosis, digital ischemia, and systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) [<a href="#rid8">8,10-25</a>]. Though subacute cutaneous lupus and lupus nephritis have been described in the setting of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, there have not been reports of systemic lupus erythematosus-like disease [<a href="#rid22">22,26</a>].</p><p>In a pharmacovigilance study of irAEs, arthritis, myositis, and sicca syndrome were over-reported in patients treated with ICI combination therapy as compared with monotherapy and were more frequently reported in anti-programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) monotherapy as compared with anti-cytotoxic lymphocyte antigen protein 4 (CTLA-4) monotherapy [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p>Among those with preexisting autoimmune diseases, flares of disease or development of symptoms of another autoimmune disease may occur in up to 71 percent of such patients and require rheumatologic management [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Preexisting rheumatologic disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Reasons for the variation and sometimes very low frequency of reports are not entirely clear but may be related to a lack of recognition of musculoskeletal symptoms by treating providers or the fact that rheumatologic irAEs are rarely life-threatening and are thus not often graded as severe.</p><p>How commonly arthralgia actually represents a true inflammatory arthritis is also unclear. In oncology clinical trials, including those using ICIs, there are multiple ways in which a given clinical finding or symptom can be coded for data collection (eg, joint effusion, arthralgia, arthritis), making it difficult to identify a true association. For other rheumatologic irAEs, epidemiologic data are even more limited. Dry mouth or dry eyes were reported in 3 to 24 percent of patients in those trials, while myalgia was present in 2 to 21 percent [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Myositis and vasculitis were not consistently reported in the published clinical trials, and most information concerning these entities is from case reports.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H197358105"><span class="h1">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical spectrum of rheumatologic immune-related adverse events (irAEs) with exposure to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) ranges widely, with presentations mirroring many classic rheumatologic diseases, although some characteristic features may be lacking, depending upon the syndrome and individual patient. It is common for patients with rheumatologic irAEs to have other non-rheumatologic irAEs; thus, obtaining a detailed history and performing a thorough physical examination are important, regardless of the presentation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/96368.html" rel="external">"Toxicities associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors"</a>.)</p><p>In patients with one of these syndromes, the severity of the irAE, future plans for cancer therapy, status of the tumor response to ICIs, and patient and oncologist preference must all be considered in deciding on treatment for rheumatologic irAEs. We discuss treatment options with both the patient and referring oncologist before determining the specific plan of action.</p><p>The clinical need and the relative risks and benefits of rheumatologic and oncologic treatment options influence the management approach. As examples, certain medications like <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8541" href="/z/d/drug information/8541.html" rel="external">hydroxychloroquine</a> or low-dose glucocorticoids may be used concurrently with ICI therapy and may be beneficial in patients with mild arthritis, while use of others, particularly those that interfere with T-cell function or the biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) that may be needed in patients with severe inflammatory arthritis, have not often been used concurrently with ICIs, although there are reports of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10208" href="/z/d/drug information/10208.html" rel="external">tocilizumab</a> and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor use in patients actively receiving ICIs [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>]. Close consultation with the patient's oncologist is important in deciding whether to continue or discontinue ICI therapy and the most appropriate interventions in a given patient.</p><p>Treatment approaches are based upon case reports and case series, but clinical trials have not been performed to compare treatment options. Our approaches are similar to those proposed by professional societies  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116832" href="/z/d/graphic/116832.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid31">31,32</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1584415326"><span class="h1">INFLAMMATORY ARTHRITIS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3230708120"><span class="h2">Clinical manifestations and diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Inflammatory arthritis, with joint pain, tenderness, swelling, and warmth, has been the most commonly reported rheumatologic immune-related adverse event (irAE) [<a href="#rid10">10,12,21,22,33</a>]. The arthritis can develop at almost any time during immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, from two weeks to over a year from ICI initiation [<a href="#rid10">10,12,21</a>]. Symptoms and findings can be protracted in some patients. Several different clinical presentations of inflammatory arthritis with different patterns of joint involvement and ranging from mild to severe have been reported [<a href="#rid12">12,21,34</a>]; joint damage with erosions can occur within months of developing symptoms in a subset of patients [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. These presentations have included:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Small-joint polyarthritis, sometimes in a pattern similar to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [<a href="#rid10">10,12,21,33</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Larger joint oligoarthritis with or without inflammatory back pain, including a pattern similar to reactive arthritis (ie, a large-joint, lower-extremity predominant arthritis with sterile urethritis and conjunctivitis) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>New-onset psoriatic arthritis, which has been reported in a patient on <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="98764" href="/z/d/drug information/98764.html" rel="external">nivolumab</a> with a family history of psoriasis, though no personal history [<a href="#rid10">10,23</a>]</p><p></p><p>Data from initial studies suggested that the pattern of arthritis may vary by the type of ICI exposure. Patients treated with anti-programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) or anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) monotherapy are more likely to have initial small joint involvement and inflammatory arthritis as their only irAE. By contrast, patients who have received combination ICI therapy with cytotoxic lymphocyte antigen protein 4 (CTLA-4) and PD-1 inhibition are more likely to present with knee arthritis, to have had another irAE, and to have reactive arthritis-like disease [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis is primarily made clinically, based upon the history and physical examination of a new-onset arthritis following the initiation of an ICI. A detailed history should be obtained to help determine if any features of arthritis or potentially associated features like skin psoriasis were present before the ICI was started. An inflammatory arthritis should be present on physical examination, and the pattern of involvement should be characterized. In patients without preceding symptoms and the absence of features to suggest a classic form of inflammatory arthritis, a diagnosis of ICI-induced arthritis can be made.</p><p>Laboratory studies can be helpful but are not critical for diagnosis. Most patients have been seronegative for rheumatoid factor (RF) and cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), but a group of seropositive patients has also been reported [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) may be present, although the utility of these markers to identify inflammatory arthritis is compromised by the comorbid malignancy, which may also affect the ESR and CRP.</p><p>Plain radiographs of affected joints should be obtained at the time of the initial evaluation for arthritis but are less sensitive for early changes, as in other forms of inflammatory arthritis; however, these also serve as a baseline for comparison with later studies. Imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound has shown synovitis, tenosynovitis, enthesitis, enthesophytes, and bony erosive disease [<a href="#rid11">11,12,35</a>]. These findings may be helpful in distinguishing inflammation and synovitis from noninflammatory pain in patients in whom that determination remains uncertain.</p><p>Other conditions that may mimic ICI-related inflammatory arthritis should be included in the differential diagnosis. These conditions and a fuller review of their respective diagnoses and differential diagnoses are discussed in detail separately and include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unrelated or coincidental presentations of a rheumatic disease with inflammatory arthritis (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1821.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult with polyarticular pain"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7504.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Paraneoplastic syndromes (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5615.html" rel="external">"Malignancy and rheumatic disorders", section on 'Paraneoplastic rheumatic manifestations'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Polyarthralgia due to medications or to fibromyalgia/central pain sensitization (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5624.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5625.html" rel="external">"Differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bony metastasis causing erosive joint change, which should be suspected if there is a joint with disproportionate erosive disease or a joint that does not improve with therapy when the rest of the arthritis is improving</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2859988928"><span class="h2">Treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The approach to treatment of inflammatory arthritis occurring as an irAE is based upon case reports, case series, and personal experience, with modifications of the usual treatment approaches that would be taken, in the absence of ICI therapy, for these and similar conditions. Treatment should be individualized based upon the clinical findings and severity of the symptoms and findings related to the arthritis, as well as the need to optimize antineoplastic therapy; treatment recommendations and decisions should be made in close collaboration with the patient's oncologist. (See <a class="local">'General principles of evaluation and management'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1651867449"><span class="h3">Initial treatment of mild arthritis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with mild forms of arthritis (without significant functional compromise), we suggest a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) or low-dose glucocorticoids.

Many have been successfully managed with glucocorticoids or other treatments, but some have required discontinuation, usually temporarily, of their ICI. The response to immunotherapy and the risk of autoimmune disease exacerbation and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients with a range of non-rheumatologic autoimmune disorders are described in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/96368.html" rel="external">"Toxicities associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors", section on 'Pre-existing autoimmune disease'</a>.)</p><p>A 2018 systematic review of multiple case reports, case series, and observational studies identified 123 patients (from 49 publications) with autoimmune diseases who were treated with ICIs, of whom 92 (75 percent) experienced exacerbation of preexisting autoimmune disease, irAEs, or both [<a href="#rid67">67</a>]. Patients with rheumatic disease represented about 60 to 65 percent of all patients as well as those with irAEs. Fewer adverse events were seen in patients being treated with immunosuppressive therapy at the time ICIs were started, and only 16 percent required further immunosuppressive therapies other than glucocorticoids for management of these occurrences. Half of the patients did not require ICI discontinuation, but three patients died. Of 20 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) described, 10 experienced disease exacerbation and eight a de novo irAE. Among 28 patients with psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis, 22 had an exacerbation of the disease, while seven had a de novo irAE. More accurate estimates of risks and outcomes will require data from additional large cohorts, especially given the inclusion of many patients in this series from case reports and small series selected for reporting.</p><p>Common themes emerge from several retrospective studies that have evaluated the use of ICIs in those with preexisting autoimmune disease:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Frequency of flares</strong> – In studies including a variety of autoimmune diseases, 30 to 50 percent of patients experienced disease flare following exposure to an ICI [<a href="#rid28">28,65,66,68</a>].

In another study of 112 patients with autoimmune disease treated with ICI therapy, the median tumor progression-free survival was shorter in patients already receiving immunosuppressive agents when ICIs were also initiated (4 versus 12 months); these findings were unlike those in most studies of new-onset irAE in patients without preexisting autoimmune disease and associated concurrent immunosuppressive therapy but similar to observations for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer being treated with ≥10 mg daily of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> for lung cancer-associated symptoms at the start of ICI therapy [<a href="#rid49">49</a>].

Precise epidemiology is unknown, but inflammatory arthritis appears to be the most common clinical presentation seen by rheumatologists. It is also common for patients with rheumatologic irAEs to have other non-rheumatologic irAEs. (See <a class="local">'Immune checkpoint inhibitor mechanism of action'</a> above and <a class="local">'Pathogenesis of rheumatologic complications'</a> above and <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with a rheumatologic irAE, the severity of the irAE, future plans for cancer therapy, status of the tumor response to ICIs, the relative risks and benefits of rheumatologic and oncologic treatment options, and patient and oncologist preference must all be considered in determining the management approach. (See <a class="local">'General principles of evaluation and management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inflammatory arthritis can develop at almost any time during ICI therapy, and several different patterns of joint involvement and disease ranging from mild to severe have been reported; rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies are often absent. (See <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with inflammatory arthritis secondary to ICI therapy, our initial approach to treatment is based upon the severity of symptoms (see <a class="local">'Treatment'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For most patients with mild arthritis (without significant functional compromise), we suggest a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) rather than glucocorticoids (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). ICI therapy is usually continued in such patients. Oral NSAIDs (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9682" href="/z/d/drug information/9682.html" rel="external">naproxen</a> 375 to 500 mg twice daily, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8547" href="/z/d/drug information/8547.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a> 600 to 800 mg three times daily) are typically used. As an alternative, particularly in patients in whom NSAIDs should be avoided or a more rapid response is desired than expected with an NSAID, we prefer <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> (initially 10 to 20 mg daily). In patients with only a few joints involved, we administer intraarticular glucocorticoid injections in affected joints, if feasible, which may reduce the need for other interventions. (See <a class="local">'Initial treatment of mild arthritis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with moderate or severe arthritis involving of multiple joints, we suggest moderate- to high-dose oral glucocorticoids (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>).

The ICI is sometimes held temporarily until the prednisone can be tapered to lower doses (eg, below 20 mg daily of prednisone or equivalent) and the patient is doing well. (See <a class="local">'Initial treatment of moderate or severe arthritis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with inflammatory arthritis secondary to ICI therapy that does not respond to initial therapy, our approach is as follows:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with persistent mild to moderate inflammatory arthritis who cannot be weaned to a low dose (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> less than 7.5 to 10 mg daily) or entirely off glucocorticoids, we suggest a conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9963" href="/z/d/drug information/9963.html" rel="external">sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ), <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8541" href="/z/d/drug information/8541.html" rel="external">hydroxychloroquine</a> (HCQ), or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/z/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a> (MTX) as used in RA (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). The decisions of whether the ICI can or should be held needs to be made on an individual basis together with the treating oncologist, especially in cases where glucocorticoids cannot be tapered. (See <a class="local">'Unable to adequately taper glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Our preference for selected patients with severe arthritis who are refractory to glucocorticoid therapy or unable to wean to low-dose glucocorticoids (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> less than 7.5 to 10 mg daily) is to use a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10208" href="/z/d/drug information/10208.html" rel="external">Tocilizumab</a> and other agents have also been used in such patients.
