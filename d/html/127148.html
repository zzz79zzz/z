         This monograph discusses the implications of genetic test results for the glucose-6-phospate dehydrogenase (
         <em>
          G6PD
         </em>
         ) gene, which may be obtained during the genetic evaluation of various red blood cell (RBC) or nonhematologic disorders. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment in the decision to test or the care of the tested individual.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most individuals with G6PD deficiency come to medical attention following an episode of hemolysis and biochemical testing that shows reduced enzyme activity. The indications for testing and the choice of test are discussed separately [

         Variants in the
         <em>
          G6PD
         </em>
         gene that cause G6PD deficiency (reduced G6PD enzyme activity) are referred to as pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants (depending on certainty) or disease-causing variants  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122646" href="/z/d/graphic/122646.html" rel="external">

         ) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Affected individuals are predisposed to develop hemolytic anemia, which may be severe, upon exposure to a number of medications and other substances. (See
         <a class="local">
          'G6PD variants'
         </a>

         </span>
         Variants for which the likelihood of hemolysis is unclear may be termed variants of uncertain significance (VUS). A VUS can be reclassified when new information about its effect on G6PD activity becomes available. A variant initially classified as a VUS should be reevaluated periodically.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Variants that are clearly not associated with hemolysis may not be reported (or may be reported as negative, benign, or likely benign).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Some genetic tests (sequencing, deletion/duplication analysis) evaluate the entire gene sequence; others only test for selected variants. If the individual has a variant not detected by the assay, they may receive a false-negative result. Thus, negative testing does not eliminate the possibility of G6PD deficiency in an individual with an appropriate clinical presentation, reduced G6PD enzyme activity, or a positive family history.
        </p>
        <p>
         If there are questions or concerns about a genetic test report or variant classification, a hematologist or genetics expert should be consulted. (See

         G6PD deficiency is a common genetic disorder. Its prevalence is greatest in individuals with ancestry from regions where malaria is or was endemic  (

         Clinically apparent disease may be more commonly appreciated in males than females because females typically have normal G6PD function in a subset of their RBCs, and some females may have clinically milder disease or less severe deficiency on biochemical testing. (See

         Hemolysis may be symptomatic with fatigue, tachycardia, dark urine, and jaundice, or there may be an asymptomatic drop in the hemoglobin or an increased reticulocyte count. Children with favism (hemolysis after eating fava beans) may be quite ill with pallor, jaundice, abdominal pain, and fever [

        <p>
         Laboratory evidence of hemolysis includes anemia, reticulocytosis, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and bilirubin, and low or absent haptoglobin  (

         Biochemical testing is usually the first test used to identify G6PD deficiency. In individuals who present with initial genetic test results, it is useful to verify G6PD deficiency with a quantitative enzyme assay, as depicted in the algorithm  (

          algorithm 1

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Results of biochemical testing are usually available in one to two days. Rapid-turnaround point-of-care tests are under investigation. (See

         Biochemical testing is most important in individuals who have had a hemolytic episode and/or who anticipate the need to alter their medical care (eg, use a different antibiotic) or diet.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some individuals may omit biochemical testing if it would confer an undue burden and/or if they are unlikely to require a change in medical care or diet based on the result. Individuals who omit biochemical testing initially may need to undergo testing at a later date if they require a known oxidant drug. In the absence of a confirmatory test, avoidance of substances known to trigger hemolysis seems prudent.
        </p>
        <p>
         Discordance between genetic and biochemical results is not expected when genetic testing is performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory, but biochemical testing may be falsely negative in some settings  (

         During an acute hemolytic episode, if most of the G6PD-deficient cells have hemolyzed, only red blood cells (RBCs) and reticulocytes with higher G6PD activity may remain. This is most likely in women (who are usually heterozygous) and individuals of African ancestry (who usually have A

         Rare exceptions may include use of a potentially life-saving medication, especially in an individual with a mild variant that is likely to produce transient hemolysis. (See
