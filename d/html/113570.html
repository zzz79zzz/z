This is similar to the adult algorithm, with a focus on limiting intubation attempts, re-establishing oxygenation and ventilation between attempts, and in cannot-intubate-cannot-ventilate scenarios, waking the patient, obtaining invasive access, or employing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. However, the pediatric algorithm does have some additional specifications, including transfer to a pediatric tertiary care center if feasible in an anticipated difficult pediatric airway, earlier use of a supraglottic airway to establish oxygenation after a failed intubation attempt, and ensuring adequate depth of anesthesia and ruling out laryngospasm when mask ventilation is difficult.</p><p>In 2024 the European Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) and the British Journal of Anesthesia (BJA) published joint guidelines for airway management in neonates and infants [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. These guidelines provide recommendations for airway management in all patients under one year of age, whether difficulty with airway management is anticipated or not. Many of the ESAIC/BJA recommendations are discussed in further detail below, with a summary of the recommendations provided in a table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef143951" href="/d/graphic/143951.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2933149264"><span class="h1">AIRWAY ASSESSMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients undergoing anesthesia should have a complete history and anesthesia-directed physical examination, including assessment of features that may impact airway management. One goal of this evaluation is to predict the degree of difficulty with mask ventilation and endotracheal intubation. Factors that predispose the patient to aspiration during anesthesia should be identified (eg, pyloric stenosis, bowel obstruction). Finally, physiologic factors that may predispose the patient to rapid desaturation or cardiovascular decompensation during airway management should be identified. The plan for airway management follows from this assessment.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Airway history </strong>–<strong> </strong>Prior anesthesia records should be reviewed, especially in children with a history of difficulty with airway management, and for children with syndromes associated with craniofacial abnormalities.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Craniofacial syndromes </strong>– The abnormalities associated with some syndromes worsen with age (eg, Treacher-Collins syndrome, Apert syndrome, and mucopolysaccharidoses), such that previously successful airway management techniques may become more difficult or impossible as the child grows [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Children with bilateral microtia have a high risk of difficult intubation, especially when associated with other facial abnormalities [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].

Micrognathia can be subtle and easy to miss in infants  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116089" href="/d/graphic/116089.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Acquired conditions can impact the airway and may be rapidly progressive.

Examples include laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy requiring visualization of vocal cord movement, gastrointestinal endoscopy, radiologic procedures (eg, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), and minor diagnostic procedures. Dual channel nasal cannulae that allow simultaneous oxygen delivery and capnography during spontaneous ventilation are available. For very short procedures, such as myringotomy and tympanostomy tube placement, deep inhalation anesthesia by facemask may be used.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H163136373"><span class="h4">Supraglottic airway</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>SGAs (eg, laryngeal mask airway [LMA], i-gel, air-Q) are available in sizes that may be used for neonates as small as 2 kg  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116402" href="/d/graphic/116402.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). An SGA can be used as the elective airway device throughout the anesthetic, as a conduit for endotracheal intubation, or as a rescue device when mask ventilation or endotracheal intubation is difficult. An SGA can also be used temporarily after inhalation induction and before endotracheal intubation, to free the clinician's hands for IV catheter placement [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. SGAs may be used with spontaneous or controlled ventilation [<a href="#rid9">9</a>], and with or without neuromuscular blocking agents. The choice between use of an SGA and an ETT for airway management is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Supraglottic airway versus endotracheal tube'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/98733.html" rel="external">"Supraglottic devices (including laryngeal mask airways) for airway management for anesthesia in adults", section on 'Routine laryngeal mask airway'</a>.)</p><p>SGAs do not definitively secure the airway, and may fail at initial placement or later during maintenance of anesthesia, due to leak, obstruction, laryngospasm, or excessive coughing or bucking [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. However, SGA failure is rare in both children and adults, and slightly less likely in children, with reported failure rates of 0.85 percent in children aged six months to eight years [<a href="#rid10">10</a>], and 1.1 percent in adults [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. In a retrospective, single-institution database study of 11,910 children who underwent anesthesia with an LMA, risk factors for LMA failure included prolonged surgical duration (with increasing risk for each 30 minutes of duration); ear, nose, and throat procedures; inpatient admission status; airway abnormalities; and room-to-room transport with the LMA in place (eg, from anesthesia induction room to procedure room) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. LMA failure was defined as abandonment of the LMA and subsequent endotracheal intubation.</p><p>SGAs have been used in select brief (&lt;1 hour) laparoscopic surgeries (such as inguinal herniorrhaphy) and procedures in the prone position (such as perirectal abscess drainage) [<a href="#rid12">12-14</a>]. We use SGAs electively for both short laparoscopic and prone surgeries if no risk factors for difficult airway management are anticipated and if we will have access to the airway throughout the procedure. For laparoscopic surgery, in practice this means that we usually use SGAs only for lower abdominal or pelvic procedures.</p><p>For prone surgeries, we prove the ability to mask ventilate prior to SGA placement, whether the SGA is initially placed in the prone or supine position. The technique for prone SGA placement for an older child with IV access is similar to the technique used in adults; the patient is assisted in lying prone on the operating table in a comfortable position with the head turned to the side, after which the patient is preoxygenated and anesthesia is induced. The technique for induction of anesthesia in this setting is described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/98733.html" rel="external">"Supraglottic devices (including laryngeal mask airways) for airway management for anesthesia in adults", section on 'Prone position'</a>.)</p><p>Younger children may undergo induction of anesthesia and SGA placement in the supine position, then turned prone with the head turned to the side.</p><p>SGAs appear as rescue devices in multiple guidelines and algorithms for management of the difficult airway (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/117124.html" rel="external">"Management of the difficult airway for pediatric anesthesia"</a>). They may also be used for temporary airway rescue following inadvertent extubation during more complicated prone procedures, such as spine surgery. In these instances, the SGA provides an avenue for oxygenation and ventilation while airway equipment is prepared and the patient repositioned for reintubation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1068699519"><span class="h4">Endotracheal tube</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An ETT provides a secure, sealed airway.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2078238409"><span class="h5">Cuffed versus uncuffed endotracheal tubes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ETTs for small children are available both with and without an inflatable tracheal cuff. We suggest the use of cuffed ETTs for routine intubation for children of all ages during anesthesia. The literature comparing the use of cuffed and uncuffed ETTs for anesthesia is limited [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>Advantages to the use of cuffed ETTs in children may include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A smaller sized cuffed tube may be used for a given child, compared with the size uncuffed tube that would be used. The cuff is inflated as needed, limited to 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O cuff pressure, to form a seal with the tracheal wall and improve efficiency of mechanical ventilation. Conversely, uncuffed ETTs do not have a mechanism for adjusting airway seal, which may result in poor fit and unacceptable airway leak, and more frequent need for replacement with a different size immediately after intubation. Therefore, use of cuffed ETTs may prevent some complications resulting from multiple intubation attempts [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. In one multicenter study including 2246 children &lt;5 years of age who underwent endotracheal intubation for anesthesia, reintubation was required for incorrect sizing (too large or too small) in 30.8 percent of children who were randomly assigned to uncuffed ETTs, compared with 2.1 percent of those who were randomly assigned to cuffed ETTs [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].

This may be due to a decreased need for repeat intubations or because cuffed ETTs place less pressure on the narrowest glottic and subglottic structures than uncuffed ETT. An uncuffed ETT contacts the trachea at the glottic opening (the smallest transverse diameter of the airway), and the cricoid ring (the narrowest non-distensible portion) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].

The formula for choosing an uncuffed ETT is 4 + (age in years/4), and for cuffed tubes is 3.5 + (age in years/4). When the age is an odd number, the tube size should be rounded down from the calculated number. As an example, for a five year old, the calculated size for a cuffed ETT would be 4.75, so a 4.5 ETT should be used. Children younger than six to eight months often require a 3.0, rather than 3.5, cuffed ETT  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef112121" href="/d/graphic/112121.html" rel="external">table 5</a>).</p><p>The smallest cuffed ETTs available have an inner diameter of 3.0 mm  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef112121" href="/d/graphic/112121.html" rel="external">table 5</a>).

A correctly sized ETT will have an audible air leak at, or close to, 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O airway pressure. Absence of a leak indicates that the ETT is too large, and replacement with a smaller size should be considered. With an uncuffed ETT, a large leak at low airway pressures is an indication that the ETT is too small, and it should be replaced with the next larger size. With a cuffed ETT, for most surgical procedures the cuff should be inflated until a leak first becomes audible at 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O airway pressure. If excessive intra-cuff pressure is required to achieve this seal (&gt;20 cm H2O intra-cuff pressure, as measured by manometer), the ETT should be replaced with a larger size.</p><p>The decision to replace an ETT for a different size should be individualized, depending on patient factors (eg, high risk of aspiration, difficult ETT placement) and the clinical setting (eg, length of procedure, need for positive pressure ventilation). In certain circumstances, the risk of removing and replacing the ETT may be greater than the risk of leaving the poorly-sized ETT in place. Additionally, when mechanical ventilation will likely require higher airway pressures, such as with laparoscopic or intrathoracic surgery, or in patients with poor lung compliance, additional air may have to be added to the cuff to maintain a seal at airway pressures greater than 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. For these patients, the risks of postoperative tracheal edema must be weighed against adequate intraoperative ventilation, and an appropriate airway leak determined on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3311654014"><span class="h5">Microcuff pediatric endotracheal tube</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Microcuff pediatric ETT is specifically designed for use in children.

Since they sit above the glottis, SGAs should not be used for children with subglottic airway obstruction or tracheomalacia. We usually avoid SGAs for procedures expected to last more than three hours, and in procedures in which access to the airway for troubleshooting or endotracheal intubation is limited.</p><p>The following issues are of particular concern in children:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient age </strong>–<strong> </strong>The use of SGAs in very young children is debated among anesthesiologists. Some UpToDate contributors avoid SGAs in children younger than one year of age, while others (including the authors of this topic) use SGAs in these children when access to the airway will be possible throughout the anesthetic. SGAs may not seat well in infants and tend to become dislodged. Infants desaturate quickly, and there is less time to react to problems with the airway device. Therefore, with younger patients, one must be able to rapidly troubleshoot the SGA with repositioning or removal for mask ventilation and endotracheal intubation. If patient positioning or surgical site limits airway access, an ETT may be more appropriate.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">There is little literature comparing the success of airway management with SGAs in infants versus older children.

The majority of children have anatomy which is favorable for airway management [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Endotracheal intubation in children is therefore usually performed with direct laryngoscopy (DL), by which the laryngoscope is used to create a view of the glottis with direct line of sight. DL is the fastest and simplest intubation technique to prepare for and to perform. Advanced indirect intubation techniques that make use of distal cameras are useful when patient anatomy or clinical conditions make DL difficult or impossible. Such devices should be prepared in advance if difficulty with DL is expected and should be immediately available for all airway management episodes in case of unanticipated difficulty. However, with indirect techniques, an excellent view of the glottic opening does not always translate to easy delivery of the ETT into the trachea.

For cuffed ETTs, the optimal depth can be calculated using the formula (3 X internal diameter in mm + 1.5 cm) to reflect the fact that a cuffed tube 0.5 mm smaller is typically placed, compared with the uncuffed tube that would be used. For example, in a two year old, a 4.0 mm cuffed ETT should be taped at 13.5 cm at the lip. In neonates and small children in particular, the distance between the vocal cords and carina is very short, and it may be difficult to accurately estimate correct tube placement based on patient size. Therefore, in these patients the ETT should be advanced so that the entire cuff is just past the vocal cords during direct laryngoscopy.</p><p>Bilateral breath sounds and a normal end-tidal carbon dioxide<sub> </sub>trace should be confirmed, and the ETT securely taped. Bilateral breath sounds should also be confirmed after any change in patient position, especially in infants and young children, who are at greater risk of the ETT tip migrating into the pharynx or main stem bronchus.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H661120513"><span class="h1">EMERGENCE AND EXTUBATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Airway devices (ie, endotracheal tubes [ETTs] and supraglottic airways [SGAs]) should only be removed when the patient is either deeply anesthetized or fully awake, to avoid emergence laryngospasm, which may occur from airway stimulation during light planes of anesthesia. Other considerations, such as risk for aspiration, risk for airway obstruction, reactive airway disease, length of procedure, and desire to avoid coughing on emergence, may influence the decision on timing of airway device removal.

(See <a class="local">'Supraglottic airway versus endotracheal tube'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">We suggest the use of cuffed rather than uncuffed endotracheal tubes for routine intubation for children of all ages during anesthesia. (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>) Cuffed tubes are more likely to result in placement of a correctly sized tube on the first attempt and provide better tidal volumes and less leakage during ventilation without causing an increase in acute postextubation respiratory complications (ie, postextubation stridor and/or sore throat).

SGAs may reduce the incidence of PRAEs (eg, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, postoperative stridor) in children, compared with ETTs, but the effect of the choice of airway device on the risk of PRAEs in small infants is unclear.
