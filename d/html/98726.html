         The hand is a vital structure for a multitude of motor tasks, and the forearm contributes a great deal to the hand's versatility. The forearm allows the hand to interact with objects remote from the body and enables it to pronate and supinate, capabilities that are essential for many activities of daily living as well as technical skills such as those required for music and sports. The forearm also plays an important role in protecting the head and torso from trauma, which explains in part why fractures of the forearm are among the most common.
        </p>
        <p>
         Given the many important roles of the forearm, it is no surprise that forearm fractures can result in considerable disability, especially if treated improperly. The epidemiology, clinical anatomy, assessment, diagnosis, and nonoperative management of midshaft fractures of the radius and ulna in adults, including those associated with forearm instability (Galeazzi, Monteggia, and Essex-Lopresti injuries), are reviewed here. Distal and proximal forearm fractures in adults and pediatric forearm fractures at all locations are discussed separately:

         Although forearm fractures are relatively common, studies of the epidemiology of diaphyseal fractures of the forearm are scant. The incidence of diaphyseal fracture of the radius, ulna, or both is reported to be approximately 1 to 10 per 10,000 persons per year, although rates vary by age and sex. Studies show a bimodal distribution with the highest incidence among young males aged 10 to 20 years (10:10,000) and females over age 60 (5:10,000) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. Diaphyseal forearm fractures occur far less frequently than distal forearm fractures overall [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ] but are relatively common among snowboarders (0.04 per 1000 person-days) and skiers (0.003 per 1000 person-days) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Risk factors for diaphyseal forearm fractures include sports participation, postmenopausal status, osteoporosis, and frequent walking on icy surfaces [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Football and wrestling are the highest-risk sports with 0.48 and 0.21 midshaft forearm fractures per 10,000 high school athletic exposures, respectively, in one study [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. A large (n = 695,000), 20-year cohort study from Sweden reported an increased risk of forearm fracture (hazard ratio [HR] 1.11, 95% CI 1.06-1.15) among highly active individuals compared with the average population [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. While postmenopausal status increases the risk for both distal and midshaft forearm fractures, it increases the risk for distal fractures far more (nearly an order of magnitude in some studies) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Galeazzi fractures (radial midshaft fractures with distal radioulnar joint [DRUJ] instability) account for 7 percent of all forearm fractures. Of all fractures involving only the radial shaft, one in four is a true Galeazzi injury. The less common but often missed Monteggia fracture-dislocation (fracture of the proximal third of the ulnar shaft with dislocation of the radial head) comprises 1 to 2 percent of all forearm fractures and is more common in children [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Essex-Lopresti injuries (radial head fracture with disruption of the interosseous membrane and DRUJ) account for approximately 1 percent of all radial head fractures [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. (See

        <p>
         Although statistics vary widely, midshaft forearm fractures commonly occur in association with one or more concomitant injuries, particularly if high-energy trauma is involved. The wide range of statistics concerning associated injuries is likely due to the patient populations studied and other institution-specific factors as well as variation in the definition of associated injury. Studies report 33 to 82 percent of midshaft radius and ulna fracture cases are isolated injuries, while up to 50 percent involve multisystem trauma [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13854.html" rel="external">
          "Initial management of trauma in adults"

        </p>
        <p>
         Concomitant fractures of the lower extremity (eg, tibial plateau, fibula, patella, femur) or ipsi- or contralateral upper extremity (eg, humeral shaft, proximal humerus, glenoid) occur in approximately 16 to 26 percent of diaphyseal forearm fracture cases [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. The most frequently associated non-musculoskeletal injuries are reported to be closed-head and peripheral nerve injuries [

         The anatomy of the forearm is complex. Only important considerations relevant to diaphyseal forearm fractures are presented here.
        </p>
        <p>
         The radius and ulna are joined by three major groups of ligamentous structures, forming a ring:

         Triangular fibrocartilage complex including the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ)  (

         Annular ligament  (

          figure 3
         </a>
         ) with the adjacent proximal radioulnar joint (PRUJ)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99715" href="/z/d/graphic/99715.html" rel="external">
          figure 4
         </a>

         )
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         These structures maintain bony alignment and stability while allowing pronation and supination [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,12
         </a>
         ]. Like any ring, the forearm develops instability when fracture or disruption of two or more components occurs.
        </p>
        <p>
         The proximal ulna consists of the olecranon and coronoid, which form the trochlear notch that articulates with the humerus  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66874" href="/z/d/graphic/66874.html" rel="external">
          figure 5
         </a>
         ). The ulnar diaphysis has minimal curvature and lies in a subcutaneous position on the posteromedial forearm. The ulnar head serves as an insertion point for the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80101" href="/z/d/graphic/80101.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         and
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63443" href="/z/d/graphic/63443.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). The radius is notable for its round head, which articulates with the humeral capitellum and rotates within the annular ligament during pronosupination  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66874" href="/z/d/graphic/66874.html" rel="external">
          figure 5
         </a>
         ). The radial shaft has a bowed architecture that allows it to rotate around the ulnar shaft; loss of this bowed shape results in decreased range of motion with pronation and/or supination [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. The distal radius broadens to a large metaphysis, creating a stable articulating surface for the scaphoid and lunate. The radius has a nutrient artery foramen on its volar surface approximately 9 cm distal to the radial head that can sometimes be mistaken for a fracture line [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Most muscles of the forearm can be classified into two groups: flexors of the wrist and fingers  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99697" href="/z/d/graphic/99697.html" rel="external">
          figure 6

         and
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99681" href="/z/d/graphic/99681.html" rel="external">
          figure 9
         </a>
         ) and extensors of the wrist and fingers  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99703" href="/z/d/graphic/99703.html" rel="external">
          figure 10
         </a>
         and
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99704" href="/z/d/graphic/99704.html" rel="external">

          figure 12
         </a>
         ). The flexors lie on the anterior forearm, while the extensors lie on the posterior forearm. All anterior forearm muscles are innervated by the median nerve or its branch, the anterior interosseous nerve  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99716" href="/z/d/graphic/99716.html" rel="external">
          figure 13
         </a>
         ), with the exception of flexor carpi ulnaris and the medial half of flexor digitorum profundus, both of which receive innervation via the ulnar nerve  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99702" href="/z/d/graphic/99702.html" rel="external">
          figure 14

         and
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99717" href="/z/d/graphic/99717.html" rel="external">
          figure 15
         </a>
         ). All posterior forearm muscles are innervated by the radial nerve or its branch, the posterior interosseous nerve  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99718" href="/z/d/graphic/99718.html" rel="external">
          figure 16

          figure 17
         </a>
         ). Several additional forearm muscles include an elbow flexor (brachioradialis), an elbow extensor (anconeus), pronators (pronator teres, pronator quadratus), the supinator, and a thumb abductor (abductor pollicis longus).
        </p>
        <p>
         The blood supply to the forearm arises mainly from the brachial artery, which crosses from the medial upper arm into the antecubital fossa, where it divides into multiple branches  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99701" href="/z/d/graphic/99701.html" rel="external">
          figure 18
         </a>
         ). The ulnar and radial arteries are the principal branches, and both travel through the anterior forearm. The anterior and posterior interosseous arteries arise from the brachial artery via the common interosseous artery in the antecubital fossa. They travel adjacent to their corresponding nerve along the anterior and posterior aspects of the interosseous membrane. Displaced fractures of the radial or ulnar diaphysis can injure these deep neurovascular structures [

         The bimodal distribution of midshaft forearm fractures reflects the two primary mechanisms of injury [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,7
         </a>
         ]. High-energy trauma (eg, motor vehicle collisions, sports injuries, falls from a height) accounts for the large number of forearm fractures among young males with normal bone density. Low-energy trauma, primarily falls from standing, accounts for the large number of fractures among postmenopausal females, attributable to their decreased bone mineral density.

         Specific fracture patterns often result from particular mechanisms:

         The patient with a midshaft forearm fracture typically complains of pain, and possibly deformity, at the site immediately following trauma [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. The mechanism involves either low energy (eg, ground-level fall, especially in older adults) or relatively high energy (eg, motor vehicle accident, collision during a sporting event, fall from a height). It is often difficult for the patient to recall details about the mechanism. Therefore, it is important to assess possible associated injuries at the wrist, elbow, and elsewhere, depending on the circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
         In some cases, history provided by the patient or perhaps a witness may reveal important details that assist the clinician. As an example, a fall onto an extended wrist and pronated forearm makes a Galeazzi-type fracture more likely, and the clinician must pay particular attention to ruling out instability of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) in such cases. The mechanisms of injury associated with particular midshaft forearm fractures are described above. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Mechanism of injury'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Soft tissue trauma in the affected extremity is common but varies widely in severity depending upon the mechanism and patient. Such injuries may include skin lacerations, superficial and deep muscle contusions, and contusions or lacerations of tendons or neurovascular structures. Crush injuries and gunshot wounds are associated with extensive soft tissue injury, frequently including neurovascular disruption, and are often significantly contaminated. Any patient with suspected or apparent concomitant injuries of the head, spine, torso, or lower extremities following trauma should be thoroughly assessed. Severe injuries associated with forearm fractures are seen most often following motor vehicle collisions and may include closed-head injuries, peripheral nerve injuries, and concomitant fractures of the upper and lower extremities [

         </span>
         Physical examination begins with visual inspection, which may reveal swelling and an obvious deformity, suggesting a displaced fracture, or a wound overlying the fracture site (ie, open fracture) requiring immediate surgical evaluation. Palpation reveals focal tenderness at the fracture site and possibly deformity. Palpation should be performed gently.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whenever a fracture or dislocation involving the forearm is suspected, the wrist and elbow joints should be evaluated looking for any concomitant fracture, dislocation, or other signs of injury, followed by examination of the shoulder and other extremities. Range of motion may be limited due to pain, and testing should be performed gently, judiciously, and only if there are no obvious signs of displaced fracture or dislocation. If tolerated by the patient, stability of the DRUJ may be evaluated by holding the distal radius steady while alternately applying dorsal and palmar stress to the distal ulna [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Motion may be compared with the uninjured forearm.
        </p>
        <p>
         Maneuvers to elicit crepitus may cause further soft tissue damage and should be avoided. Probing open fractures should be avoided to prevent further contaminating the wound. Severe pain and a tense muscle compartment at the fracture site raise suspicion for an acute compartment syndrome, which is a surgical emergency and must be investigated promptly. (See

         Serial neurovascular examinations are essential in the patient with a midshaft ulna or radius fracture given the possibility of nerve and vascular injury from direct (laceration, crush injury) or indirect (acute compartment syndrome) mechanisms. The clinician should inquire about radiating pain, paresthesias, numbness, or weakness in the affected limb. Though not common, acute nerve injury most often involves the radial or median nerves [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17-19

         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Numbness and tingling along the palmar aspect of the radial side of the hand, including the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger, suggest injury to the median nerve  (

          figure 13

         ), while similar symptoms along the posterior forearm and dorsal aspect of the radial side of the hand suggest radial nerve injury  (

         More discrete motor deficits may indicate injury to the anterior or posterior interosseous nerves. These nerves are at particular risk of injury whenever the interosseous membrane is disrupted, as can occur with combined radius and ulna fractures and many Monteggia fractures.

         While any forearm fracture can be described using the American Orthopedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA) classification system, in the clinical setting, this system typically is not used. The Galeazzi, Monteggia, and Essex-Lopresti fractures have their own description schemes, which are described below.

         A Galeazzi fracture is defined as a radial midshaft fracture associated with instability of the DRUJ  (

          image 2
         </a>
         ). Studies of Galeazzi fracture outcomes suggest that an important demarcation for these injuries lies 7.5 cm from the distal radial articular surface. Fractures distal to this point (ie, closer to the wrist) are labeled type I and are more commonly associated with significant DRUJ instability. Fractures proximal to this point (ie, further from the wrist) are labeled type II. Galeazzi type I fractures often require more extensive surgical reconstruction of the DRUJ. Another more basic distinction for Galeazzi fractures is simple (reduction of the radius restores alignment of the DRUJ) versus complex (DRUJ cannot be realigned even with reduction of the radial shaft fracture) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,21,22
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         When a radial midshaft fracture is associated with a fracture of the distal ulnar physis or epiphysis, with or without DRUJ instability, this is termed a Galeazzi-equivalent fracture. The Galeazzi-equivalent fracture pattern occurs in children and skeletally immature adolescents due to the relative weakness of the physis compared with the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and may be associated with subsequent ulnar growth arrest.

        <p>
         The comminution, angulation, and intra-articular extension of the radial head fracture vary, and the radial head itself may or may not be dislocated from its capitellar articulation [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. The interosseous membrane rupture includes the central band at a minimum but typically involves the entire length of the membrane. The DRUJ injury typically involves a tear of the TFCC and disruption of the ligaments of the DRUJ. Though rare, bony injury of the DRUJ, including ulnar head fracture, has been reported as an Essex-Lopresti equivalent [
         <a href="#rid25">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Prompt diagnosis is the primary challenge with Essex-Lopresti injuries. Early diagnosis depends on the clinician being aware of the injury pattern and evaluating for instability of the interosseous membrane and DRUJ whenever a radial head fracture is identified. Essex-Lopresti injuries are often missed acutely [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,16
         </a>
         ]. In one small case series, only 25 percent were diagnosed at initial presentation [

          26
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         When an Essex-Lopresti injury is suspected based on the history and physical examination, but radiographs are inconclusive, either ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed to evaluate the interosseous membrane and DRUJ. Ultrasound may show disruption of the central band fibers with or without surrounding hematoma. A sensitive and specific sonographic sign is dynamic herniation of muscle tissue through the interosseous space when manual pressure is applied to the muscles beneath the transducer [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. When patients with a history of forearm fracture present with chronic forearm instability, the interosseous membrane and DRUJ should be evaluated with ultrasound or MRI depending on local resources and surgeon preference [

          30

         ). When radial head dislocation occurs, the radial head usually displaces in the same direction as the ulnar fracture apex (most commonly anterior). In rare cases, radial head dislocation may be delayed by days, weeks, or even years after the fracture, further complicating the diagnosis of Monteggia lesions [

         For the diagnosis of distal radius fractures, bedside ultrasound is both sensitive (94 to 97 percent) and specific (86 to 99 percent) when compared with plain radiographs [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32-35

        </p>
        <p>
         Based on the limited evidence available and the authors' clinical experience, it is reasonable for experienced musculoskeletal ultrasonographers to use ultrasound as an adjunct to plain radiographs in the evaluation of suspected diaphyseal forearm fractures and associated soft tissue injuries. Ultrasound may be useful in the prehospital setting (eg, sporting venues) to screen for fracture and guide initial care [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36

         To perform the scan, the patient is positioned with their forearm resting on a table or upright (ie, vertical or perpendicular to the floor) with the elbow on a table and the forearm supinated to the extent tolerated by the patient. Finger traps  (

          picture 1
         </a>
         ) can be used to suspend the forearm, if available. The sonographer scans the radial and ulnar diaphyses in both the long and short axes, moving from proximal to distal (or vice versa). At a minimum, each bone should be examined along the length of its dorsal and volar aspects. Special attention should be given to any disruption in the cortex, periosteal thickening, or hematoma around a bone.
        </p>
        <p>
         If a fracture is identified, the degree of angulation and displacement (if any) should be estimated. Nutrient foramina are normally present in the radius and ulna and must not be mistaken for a fracture. In addition, the elbow and wrist should be evaluated for osseous alignment, intra-articular effusion, and ligamentous integrity. (See

         Skilled musculoskeletal sonographers may use ultrasound to identify soft tissue defects suggesting disruption of the DRUJ, interosseous membrane, or proximal radioulnar joint. These findings can help to expedite appropriate referral or additional imaging.

         Emergency (ie, immediate) orthopedic consultation is necessary for open fractures or signs of arterial compromise or acute compartment syndrome. The accompanying table summarizes the urgent indications and timing for orthopedic consultation according to the injuries sustained and specific fracture types  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef101314" href="/z/d/graphic/101314.html" rel="external">

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Neurologic symptoms or deficits in the absence of vascular compromise do not require emergency intervention but should be documented and, whenever possible, discussed promptly with an orthopedic consultant. In such cases, close follow-up within one to three days is warranted to monitor neurologic status, but definitive care of the fracture typically proceeds based on the fracture pattern rather than the nerve injury. It is best to obtain specialist consultation if the clinician is uncertain about the severity of injury or has limited experience with fracture assessment.
        </p>
        <p>
         The large majority of midshaft fractures of the forearm require orthopedic consultation. The main exception is an uncomplicated "nightstick" fractures of the ulna with little to no displacement or angulation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100230" href="/z/d/graphic/100230.html" rel="external">

          7,15,39
         </a>
         ]. Many midshaft forearm fractures are unstable and, even when placed in a cast, are prone to displacement from the rotational and linear forces exerted by the many muscles that insert on the forearm. These fractures require surgical fixation to avoid poor alignment and possibly nonunion. Even minor deformity of the radius or ulna can cause significant impairment of pronation or supination and disability. In addition, given the high-energy trauma involved in many forearm fractures, significant soft tissue injury is common, and this alone often warrants orthopedic consultation.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are instances when diaphyseal forearm fractures can be treated nonoperatively by a clinician with experience treating fractures, which may not require orthopedic consultation. Such cases primarily include simple, isolated, nondisplaced fractures of the ulnar shaft ("nightstick" fractures). Nondisplaced, non-angulated, both-bone forearm fractures may be treated nonoperatively, but these are rare in adults [

         <a href="#rid41">
          41

         ]. Our preferred method of reduction involves placing the patient's affected arm in finger traps  (

          picture 1

         ) while the brachium is secured with a strap or weights. This setup allows for ready manipulation of the forearm and rapid splinting once reduction is achieved.
        </p>
        <p>
         After satisfactory alignment is achieved, the fractured arm is placed in a long-arm posterior splint with the elbow at 90 degrees and the wrist in neutral (ie, without supination or pronation) and slight extension for 7 to 10 days [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,15
         </a>

         <a href="#rid7">
          7,42
         </a>
         ]. Circumferential casts should generally not be placed until at least 72 hours after the injury to minimize the risk of compromised circulation should additional swelling develop within the cast. The cast/splint should extend from the deltoid insertion on the proximal humerus to the dorsum of the metacarpophalangeal joints.

         After the initial 7- to 10-day period of immobilization, the cast or splint is removed, and radiographs are repeated to confirm fracture stability. If repeat radiographs are satisfactory, the patient is placed in a functional forearm brace for four to six more weeks [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. The functional brace, which is generally custom-made to fit the patient, allows full flexion and extension at the elbow and wrist and full pronation and supination of the forearm  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101316" href="/z/d/graphic/101316.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>
         ). Early motion minimizes elbow and wrist stiffness following immobilization [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         According to a systematic review of four randomized but methodologically limited trials involving 237 patients, evidence is insufficient to recommend functional bracing over long-arm casting for the management of isolated diaphyseal ulna ("nightstick") fractures [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. In our practice, for the majority of patients, we prefer to immobilize the extremity in a long-arm posterior splint for 7 to 10 days followed by transition to a functional brace with the assistance of an occupational therapist. Other experienced clinicians avoid elbow immobilization and proceed directly to a functional brace supported with a sling as needed for comfort. Available evidence and the general consensus among experts is that prolonged elbow immobilization (beyond 7 to 10 days) likely leads to greater harms (increased stiffness, decreased work capacity, and prolonged recovery) than benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
         In cases where the ulnar fracture fragments are 10 to 50 percent displaced (and stability is more of a concern) and with less compliant patients, we delay functional bracing for an additional two to three weeks and are more likely to consider long-arm casting or orthopedic referral in lieu of the functional brace. In the authors' experience, off-the-shelf functional braces from several manufacturers have produced good functional outcomes and greater patient satisfaction than traditional casting.

         Radiographic confirmation of proper alignment and healing should be obtained at one week and then every two to four weeks until healing is complete (roughly eight weeks total).

         Orthopedic evaluation for open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) is recommended as soon as possible, but within one to two weeks is reasonable for all apparently isolated radial shaft fractures  (

Long clinical experience demonstrates the difficulty in ruling out distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability, which may be evident only intraoperatively despite a negative computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and may even occur days to weeks after the initial injury and despite adequate casting [

         A Galeazzi fracture is defined as a radial midshaft fracture associated with instability of the DRUJ  (

         ). The severity of these injuries is not always obvious from the appearance of plain films, as DRUJ instability often is not detectable except arthroscopically, and in some cases does not manifest until days or weeks following the injury. However, case series of Galeazzi fracture patients with medical contraindications to surgery demonstrate a high rate of late-onset DRUJ instability and the severe consequences of permanent misalignment [

         Nondisplaced, non-angulated both-bone fractures may be treated initially in a well-molded bivalved long-arm cast with the wrist in a functional position, the forearm neutral, and the elbow at 90 degrees of flexion. The cast must cover from the distal palmar crease to the deltoid tuberosity to prevent forearm supination and pronation. A loop of wire or plastic should be incorporated into the radial (medial) aspect of the forearm portion of the cast just distal to the fracture site  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101323" href="/z/d/graphic/101323.html" rel="external">
          picture 4

        </p>
        <p>
         In-cast radiographs are re-evaluated weekly for the first month to monitor for displacement and angulation. The development of any displacement or angulation requires surgical referral. A standard long-arm cast replaces the bivalved cast at two weeks and is again replaced with a new long-arm cast at four weeks to maintain a snug fit for effective immobilization (casts often become loose as soft-tissue swelling resolves and muscle atrophy develops). After one month, radiographs are obtained every two weeks and the cast replaced every four weeks until healing is complete (generally requires 12 to 16 weeks). Active range of motion of the fingers and shoulder is encouraged, and physical therapy is necessary once the cast is removed to regain function of the elbow, forearm, and wrist [

         The potential for complications with midshaft forearm fractures sustained from high-energy trauma is relatively high. With all midshaft forearm fractures, poor anatomic alignment (especially loss of radial bow) with secondary lost range of motion is a significant concern. Another important concern is chronic forearm instability due to disruption of two or more components of the forearm ring [

          56

         <a href="#rid57">

         Rates of nonunion with diaphyseal forearm fractures range from 2 to 10 percent [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. Fewer than 10 percent of patients require hardware removal after ORIF, usually due to persistent pain. Re-fracture rates are approximately 18 percent after such hardware removal. Therefore, many experts suggest that hardware removal be delayed 12 to 18 months, if possible, and that the extremity be splinted for an additional four to six weeks after removal [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7

        <p>
         Myositis ossificans (heterotopic ossification of adjacent soft tissue) may be related to the injury, the additional trauma of surgery, or both and is especially problematic when it causes synostosis of the proximal or distal radial-ulnar joint.
        </p>
        <p>
         Joint stiffness can be a major complication, especially if treatment involved prolonged immobilization of the elbow or wrist, and may require extensive physical or occupational therapy. Uncommon-to-rare complications of midshaft forearm fractures include complex regional pain syndrome and osteomyelitis. (See

         As would be expected, fractures sustained from lower-energy trauma, such as simple "nightstick" fractures, are associated with fewer complications. Nonunion or malunion with poor anatomic alignment and lost range of motion are the primary complications seen in patients treated nonoperatively. Thromboembolic complications are rare [

         Rehabilitation typically begins once a cast is no longer needed or immediately following surgical fixation. The major goals of rehabilitation are to help the patient regain pain-free function, full range of motion, and full strength in the injured extremity. Fine neuromotor control is generally regained with little difficulty.
        </p>
        <p>
         Decisions concerning return to work or sport are based in part on the severity of injury and the presence of any complications. As rehabilitation can begin immediately following surgical fixation, athletes and heavy laborers often choose surgical fixation since it will speed their return to play and work. The sport and work demands of the patient must be considered in both the design of the rehabilitation program and the criteria for returning to activity. Return to work or sport requiring heavy or repetitive upper extremity loading typically requires 12 to 16 weeks of healing and rehabilitation. Return to work that places few demands on the upper extremity typically requires 8 to 12 weeks. As with any fracture, the time needed for recovery can vary widely depending on the injury, activity demands, and individual rates of healing.
        </p>
        <p>
         As rehabilitation progresses, it is reasonable to gradually resume former activity levels, beginning with light duty at work or noncontact sports practices (mainly conditioning) [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Before being permitted to begin full participation at work or sport, the patient must demonstrate sufficient strength and dexterity to complete all required physical tasks. We suggest that an athlete's return to sport be supervised by an athletic trainer whenever possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         Data on rates of return to sport in adults after diaphyseal forearm fracture are limited. A case-control study of 36 professional American football players who underwent open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) for such injury reported a high rate of return to sport (33 of 36 returned at an average of 152.1 +/- 129.8 days), but long-term follow up showed that careers were shortened by one year and athletes played an average of two fewer games per season compared with matched controls [

          Epidemiology
         </strong>
         – Midshaft forearm fractures involving the radius, ulna, or both bones are relatively common and potentially debilitating. These injuries occur from low-energy trauma (eg, fall from standing), most often in postmenopausal females, or high-energy trauma (eg, motor vehicle collision), most often in young males. Forearm fractures sustained from high-energy trauma are often associated with additional, potentially life-threatening injuries, and such patients must be carefully evaluated. (See

         <strong>
          Clinical presentation
         </strong>
         – Patients typically complain of pain, and may manifest bony deformity, at the site immediately following trauma. Associated soft tissue injury in the affected extremity is common but varies widely in severity depending upon the mechanism (more common with high-energy trauma and crush injuries) and patient. Such injuries may include skin lacerations, superficial and deep muscle contusions, and contusions or lacerations of tendons or neurovascular structures. Therefore, the injured extremity must be closely inspected and mobility of the wrist and elbow assessed as pain allows. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical presentation and examination'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Neurovascular assessment
         </strong>
         – Serial neurovascular examinations are essential in the patient given the possibility of nerve and vascular injury from direct (laceration, crush injury) or indirect (acute compartment syndrome) mechanisms. Inquire about radiating pain, paresthesias, numbness, or weakness in the affected limb. Though not common, acute nerve injury most often involves the radial and median nerves; ulnar nerve injury is rare. Numbness and tingling along the palmar aspect of the radial side of the hand, including the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger, suggest median nerve injury  (

          figure 13

         ), while similar symptoms along the posterior forearm and volar aspect of the radial side of the hand suggest radial nerve injury  (

          Diagnostic imaging
         </strong>
         – In most cases of midshaft forearm fracture, anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs showing the entire length of the radius and ulna are diagnostic. Because the radius and ulna overlap on the lateral view, additional oblique views may improve assessment. Dedicated views of the wrist and elbow are usually obtained to rule out concomitant injuries. Radiographs should be evaluated for adequacy and the fractures themselves for displacement, shortening (especially in cases of both-bone fracture  (

          Treatment
         </strong>
         – Standard initial treatment, consisting of rest, ice, elevation, immobilization, and appropriate analgesia, is provided to all patients with a midshaft forearm fracture. The method of immobilization for each type of fracture is described in the text. Definitive care is generally provided by the orthopedic surgeon to whom the patient is referred. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial treatment and follow-up'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Complications
         </strong>
         – The potential for complications with midshaft forearm fractures sustained from high-energy trauma is relatively high. Poor anatomic alignment (especially loss of radial bow) with diminished mobility is a significant concern. Minimizing this risk is a major reason for surgical treatment. Additional important potential complications include the following (see
         <a class="local">

          Return to work and sport
         </strong>
         – Return to work or sport requiring heavy or repetitive upper extremity loading typically requires 12 to 16 weeks of healing and rehabilitation. Return to work that places few demands on the upper extremity typically requires 8 to 12 weeks. As with any fracture, the time needed for recovery can vary widely depending on the injury, activity demands, and individual rates of healing. (See
