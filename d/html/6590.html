Resort towns in the Western United States alone attract over 30 million visitors annually, generally to sleeping elevations of 2000 to 3000 m (6560 to 9840 feet). Many more millions visit cities at these elevations, including several large cities in South America and Asia situated above 3000 m (9840 feet) (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50199" href="/z/d/graphic/50199.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Most of these destinations can be reached within a day using modern means of transportation. Many of these mountain travelers are children.</p><p>Rapid ascents to high altitude place the unacclimatized child at risk for developing high-altitude illness (HAI). Clinicians working in mountainous areas must familiarize themselves with the presentation and management of HAI in children, while all health care workers who advise travelers need to understand the best prevention strategies and treatment options. The clinician advising families with children on wilderness and high-altitude trips should offer an organized pre-trip evaluation that evaluates individual risk factors, provides recommendations for measures to prevent HAI, and determines whether prophylactic medication is appropriate [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].

This form of hypoxia is termed hypobaric hypoxia, and it represents the initial cause of high-altitude illness (HAI). The physiology of HAI is discussed in more detail separately.

Patients with sickle cell trait may become symptomatic from splenic sequestration or infarct at altitudes over 2500 m (8200 feet) [<a href="#rid21">21-23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Asthma</strong> – Asthmatic patients may find that their symptoms improve because of a relative lack of allergens at high altitudes.

One author suggests that children who are able to play and run without shortness of breath at home are unlikely to have problems lower than 3650 m (11,972 feet) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Supplemental oxygen may enable these children to travel to altitudes between 2000 to 3000 m (6560 to 9840 feet) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. (See <a class="local">'High-altitude pulmonary edema'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/183.html" rel="external">"High-altitude pulmonary edema", section on 'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cardiac lesions with increased pulmonary artery blood flow</strong> – Infants and children with cardiac lesions involving an increase in pulmonary blood flow or pulmonary hypertension also are at increased risk for HAPE. Isolated absence of the right pulmonary artery has been associated with development of HAPE at relatively low altitudes [<a href="#rid10">10,29</a>]. Thus, these patients should avoid exposure to high altitude. Children with other cardiac defects that increase pulmonary flow, such as atrial and ventricular septal defects and patent ductus arteriosus, may be at increased risk for HAPE as well [<a href="#rid25">25,30</a>]. (See <a class="local">'High-altitude pulmonary edema'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/183.html" rel="external">"High-altitude pulmonary edema", section on 'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">On the other hand, although an association has been reported between patent foramen ovale (PFO) and HAPE, causality is not established, and PFO is not considered a contraindication to high altitude exposure [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Down syndrome</strong> – Children with trisomy 21 have increased pulmonary vascular reactivity and a higher risk of pulmonary hypertension in addition to an increased risk of congenital cardiac defects.

The risk of AMS depends upon individual susceptibility, the elevation reached, and the rate of ascent. Thus, while AMS is uncommon below 2000 m (6560 feet), it is quite common (approximately 25 percent incidence in adults and children) at sleeping elevations between 2000 and 3000 m (6560 to 9840 feet), where some cities and the majority of ski resorts in the Western United States are located (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63999" href="/z/d/graphic/63999.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50199" href="/z/d/graphic/50199.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid33">33-36</a>]. In most instances, pediatric high-altitude illness (HAI) can be prevented with appropriate precautions or treated before serious illness, such as high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) or high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), occurs.</p><p>At higher altitudes, small observational studies initially suggested that AMS may occur more frequently in children and adolescents than in adults with ascent in a few hours from sea level to at elevations above 3500 m [<a href="#rid33">33,37,38</a>]. However, larger studies have found either the same incidence as adults or less:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In one observational study that evaluated the impact of fast ascent among families with 157 children ascending 3450 m in 2.5 hours, AMS in children was lower (30 percent), compared with adolescents (37 percent) and adults (45 percent) [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. In addition, familial clustering was consistent and explained 25 to 50 percent of variability, the first evidence of hereditary influence for AMS.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a separate study of 48 children who underwent the same rapid ascent profile, AMS incidence was 25 percent at 6 hours, 21 percent at 18 hours, and 8 percent at 42 hours; all AMS was mild, and none required descent [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A third study took 118 children ages 6 to 16 in 2.5 hours to 3450 m in the Alps and found only a 6 percent incidence of AMS at 40 hours, confirming the rapid resolution of AMS without treatment [<a href="#rid41">41</a>].</p><p></p><p>Thus, the overall risk of AMS appears to be the same or less in children compared with adults, and as in adults, slower ascent rates reduce illness.</p><p>The epidemiology of AMS in adults is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/182.html" rel="external">"Acute mountain sickness and high-altitude cerebral edema", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Acute mountain sickness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>AMS and HACE are generally considered to represent two points along a single spectrum of disease, with the same underlying pathophysiology. Although some aspects of this pathophysiology remain unclear, the concept that AMS/HACE represents a continuum, and that AMS can progress to fatal HACE, fits with clinical experience and is helpful for management. However, especially in young children and infants, recognition of AMS is hampered by the difficulty in recognizing symptoms (eg, headache) in a nonverbal child. Certain pediatric patients (eg, infants under six weeks of age, children with congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis, or Down syndrome) also have a greater susceptibility for life-threatening disease. (See <a class="local">'Recommendations for children with pre-existing illnesses'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Clinical manifestations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Signs of AMS in young children are nonspecific and include decreased playfulness, pallor, fussiness, poor sleep, vomiting, and decreased appetite [<a href="#rid27">27,34,35</a>].</p><p>In older children and adolescents, signs of HAI are similar to adults; the most common symptom is headache, which may be accompanied or followed by shortness of breath, dizziness, poor sleep, anorexia, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. The presentation and diagnosis of AMS in adults is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/182.html" rel="external">"Acute mountain sickness and high-altitude cerebral edema", section on 'Presentation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The onset of AMS is usually delayed for 6 to 12 hours following arrival at high altitude but can occur as rapidly as 1 to 2 hours or as late as 24 hours [<a href="#rid42">42,43</a>]. If there is no further ascent, symptoms are often most severe after the first night, generally resolve in one day with rest (eg. no skiing or hiking), and do not recur at the same altitude. AMS may reappear upon ascent to higher altitudes. On occasion, symptoms of AMS may persist for days despite no further ascent. In such cases, descent is required if there is no improvement with standard treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/182.html" rel="external">"Acute mountain sickness and high-altitude cerebral edema", section on 'AMS treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Supplemental oxygen may be used to support the clinical diagnosis of AMS. Providing 2 to 4 L/minute of oxygen by nasal cannula for 15 to 20 minutes prior to other interventions should markedly improve headache and other symptoms, as does a brief excursion to a lower altitude, especially in younger children.</p><p>The onset of symptoms more than two days after arrival at a given altitude, absence of headache, dyspnea at rest, and failure to improve rapidly with supplemental oxygen should prompt the clinician to search for an alternative diagnosis. No radiographic or laboratory testing is typically required unless the diagnosis of AMS is unclear. Other etiologies to consider include carbon monoxide poisoning, migraine, dehydration, exhaustion, hyponatremia, viral syndrome, and bacterial infection (eg, pneumonia or otitis), and occult trauma such as corneal abrasion. In young children, AMS is a diagnosis of exclusion.</p><p>AMS alone does <strong>not</strong> cause an elevation in body temperature and an appropriate evaluation for fever based upon age and immunization status is warranted in febrile children at altitude. AMS is often a diagnosis of exclusion in this group. The clinician should pay close attention to the child's signs and response to oxygen, and when in doubt should err on the side of a longer observation period before attributing symptoms to a condition other than AMS.

Ascent above 2500 m (8200 feet) may be associated with HAI in children. However, most healthy children do well <strong>without</strong> any serious effects at altitudes less than 3500 m (11,480 feet). (See <a class="local">'High-altitude illness in children'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk factors for HAI</strong> – Children at particular risk for serious HAI include the following (see <a class="local">'Risk factors'</a> above and <a class="local">'High-altitude cerebral edema'</a> above and <a class="local">'High-altitude pulmonary hypertension'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Infants under six weeks of age</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Infants up to one year of age with a history of oxygen requirement or pulmonary hypertension, including premature infants</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Children who live at very high altitude and undergo a temporary descent</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Children with Down syndrome, congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis or neuromuscular problems compromising ventilation</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute mountain sickness (AMS)</strong> </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Clinical manifestations </strong>– Clinical manifestations of AMS are nonspecific in young children and infants and include decreased playfulness, pallor, fussiness, poor sleep, vomiting, and decreased appetite (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66807" href="/z/d/graphic/66807.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). A high index of suspicion is required for detection. (See <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Symptoms of AMS in older children and adolescents are similar to what is seen in adults. The most common symptom is headache, which may be accompanied or followed by shortness of breath, dizziness, poor sleep, anorexia, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/182.html" rel="external">"Acute mountain sickness and high-altitude cerebral edema", section on 'Presentation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Diagnosis </strong>– The diagnosis of AMS relies on typical clinical manifestations that occur within 24 hours of arrival at high altitude without evidence of another cause (eg, otitis media, pneumonia, or viral illness). AMS is a diagnosis of exclusion in preverbal children. Improvement of symptoms after administration of supplemental oxygen (eg, 2 to 4 L/minute by nasal cannula for 15 to 20 minutes) or a brief descent supports the diagnosis of AMS if no other cause is found. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Treatment </strong>– Children with AMS are treated based upon symptom severity following the same principles as in adults (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76719" href="/z/d/graphic/76719.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See <a class="local">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE)</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Clinical manifestations </strong>– Although rare in young children, HAPE presents as increasing respiratory distress over one to two days, but may develop more precipitously. In some young children and infants, primary signs may not include tachypnea, but oxygen saturation will always be low relative to normal values at that altitude (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef98575" href="/z/d/graphic/98575.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). Symptoms of HAPE in older children and adolescents are similar to those in adults: dyspnea, tachypnea, rales, and cough productive of frothy, rusty sputum. (See <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Diagnosis </strong>– The diagnosis of HAPE relies on typical clinical manifestations that present one to two days after high-altitude exposure without evidence of another cause (eg, pneumonia). If performed, chest radiographs show diffuse interstitial changes consistent with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Treatment </strong>– Children with HAPE warrant immediate supplemental oxygen, descent or both. In emergency settings without the option of oxygen or descent, pharmacotherapy with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12643" href="/z/d/drug information/12643.html" rel="external">nifedipine</a> (≥50 kg) or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12603" href="/z/d/drug information/12603.html" rel="external">amlodipine</a> (&lt;50 kg or &lt;17 years old) may be effective (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76719" href="/z/d/graphic/76719.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See <a class="local">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevention of AMS and HAPE</strong> – Acclimatization and slow ascent are the most effective ways to avoid AMS and HAPE in otherwise healthy children. (See <a class="local">'Prevention and pharmacologic prophylaxis'</a> above and <a class="local">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Healthy children should ascend to very high altitudes (over 3500 m [11,480 feet]) slowly and only if rapid descent is possible in the event of problems. (See <a class="local">'Recommendations for ascent'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Travel advice for parents</strong> – Healthy children generally tolerate travel to altitude well and rarely experience any serious HAI. The clinician should advise parents that resort communities generally have health care providers with expertise in altitude-related problems who are excellent sources for parents and children if they feel their child might be experiencing HAI.
