The multipotent hematopoietic stem cells required for this procedure are usually obtained from the bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood of a related or unrelated donor. The hematopoietic products used for transplantation have a mixture of very primitive stem cells and more mature committed progenitor cells; these two levels of maturation of hematopoietic cells cannot be distinguished morphologically. </p><p>The term "hematopoietic cell transplantation" (HCT) will be used throughout this review as a general term to cover transplantation of hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells from any source (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood). Otherwise, the source of such cells will be specified (eg, autologous peripheral blood stem/progenitor cell transplantation). The peripheral blood hematopoietic product will be termed PBPC (peripheral blood progenitor cells) recognizing that stem cells must be present for long-term hematopoietic engraftment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3537.html" rel="external">"Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT): Sources of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells"</a>.)</p><p>Given there is the potential for harm, it is critical that the donor evaluation determine both that the collection procedure is safe for the donor and the recipient. This is particularly important as advances in transplantation have resulted in an increase in allowable patient age into the seventh decade, which increases the likelihood that potential sibling donors will be older and have co-morbidities that could affect the health of either the donor or the recipient. Infants may also serve as donors for their siblings, but require detailed plans for their safety.</p><p>This topic will review the evaluation of a potential donor that has been identified as an appropriate match for a transplant recipient. The general issues involved in donor selection for allogeneic HCT and the use of umbilical cord blood for transplantation are discussed separately. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3535.html" rel="external">"Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3531.html" rel="external">"Collection and storage of umbilical cord blood for hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16563.html" rel="external">"Selection of an umbilical cord blood graft for hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96032.html" rel="external">"HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation", section on 'Donor selection for haploidentical HCT'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10299521"><span class="h1">CANDIDACY FOR DONATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10299529"><span class="h2">Donor guidelines</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the United States, unrelated donors are evaluated to comply with guidelines and regulations from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Joint Commission (TJC), the Association for the Advancement of Blood and Biotherapies (AABB; formerly the American Association of Blood Banks), the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP), and the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT) guidelines and regulations. Guidelines for donor health are available on the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fbethematch.org%2Fsupport-the-cause%2Fdonate-bone-marrow%2Fjoin-the-marrow-registry%2Fmedical-guidelines%2F&amp;token=xOUuVNxX3vV6QdDe7l%2B6ts94yqU2cIwTnXlc8P%2Bj42eEGycMKYFDBznJuqYZEKpZ4QV9Fldbg06vwHZbGN8cQT41iFZPPJBiXyMsUWOKVro0sJN4r1k%2FT3xz7sTLujLk&amp;TOPIC_ID=96033" target="_blank">BeTheMatch website</a>. This set of guidelines is somewhat more restrictive than standard requirements for related donor transplantation. For instance, donors older than 60 years may be acceptable for related donor transplantation but are excluded by the NMDP. At times, if the risk is considered acceptable, related donors with autoimmune diseases, diabetes related complications, and other medical issues may be used within families but are excluded for unrelated donors.</p><p>Donors are assessed for medical suitability and donor eligibility. Medical suitability pertains specifically to assessing potential risks to the donor from the donation process and the possibility of transmitting an inherited or acquired condition. Donor eligibility refers specifically to an FDA required assessment for the increased risk for transmission of relevant communicable diseases. The evaluation for medical suitability and donor eligibility includes a physical examination, directed medical history, a review of available medical records, infectious disease testing, and additional testing that may be warranted by virtue of any underlying pre-existent conditions. Risk of transmission of infectious or other diseases does not necessarily disqualify a donor; however, the recipient must be informed of the potential risk. The stringent prohibition of donors at risk of transmitting certain communicable diseases may be waived if use of the donor is determined to be in the best interest of the patient.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10299535"><span class="h2">Assessing for risks to the recipient</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The donor evaluation process includes a<strong> </strong>physical exam and comprehensive health assessment including screening for intravenous (IV) drug use, history of blood transfusions, pregnancies, abortions, tattoos, immunizations, and travel history. A standardized questionnaire (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aabb.org%2Ftm%2Fquestionnaires%2FPages%2Fdefault.aspx&amp;token=Zhk3SsDNzGEOSDTcBVv9fZQu%2BjsFBbrX2yVBN%2BN1XiCupTUkbRX3OdeZNnHurXOaZGIob2biCut7wJjfqzkHFA%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=96033" target="_blank">Donor History Questionnaires [DHQ] and medications lists from the AABB website</a>) is used as a checklist to avoid missing critical information related to donor eligibility [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. This questionnaire was developed by an AABB task force to comply with requirements of the FDA, FACT, and the NMDP. We also perform the following tests:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Complete blood count with white cell differential, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes are included in the screening of all donors.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A standard panel of infectious disease markers includes HIV, HTLV-1 and HTLV-II, West Nile virus, hepatitis A and B serologies, as well as hepatitis B and C viral load. Chagas disease, syphilis, and CMV serology are required, mirroring the FDA requirements for normal blood donors (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56453" href="/d/graphic/56453.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Donors who have antibodies to hepatitis B or C are eligible to donate. If polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing demonstrates viremia, donors may be acceptable for family member donation depending on the serology of the recipient and the ability to receive effective antiviral therapy. Viremic donors are not acceptable donors for unrelated recipients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the donor has had high-risk behavior associated with HIV, HHV8 testing should be conducted. Donors with confirmed HIV are unable to donate. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3752.html" rel="external">"Acute and early HIV infection: Pathogenesis and epidemiology", section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Serum pregnancy testing is required for all female donors less than 55 years unless the donor is postmenopausal or is surgically infertile. Marrow donation in the second trimester is thought to be safe; however, it is limited to donation for related donors if the transplantation is considered to be urgent. Pregnant donors cannot receive <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8446" href="/d/drug information/8446.html" rel="external">filgrastim</a>, because the risk to the fetus has not been determined. Pregnant donors are disqualified from donating to unrelated recipients until after delivery. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Testing with chest radiography, urinalysis, or electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed if there are underlying problems that may warrant evaluation, for instance a history of coronary disease, arrhythmias, or heavy smoking.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hemoglobin electrophoresis may be performed in potential donors who have relatives with a hemoglobinopathy (eg, thalassemia, sickle cell) or if there is suspicion that the donor is a carrier. Neither sickle cell trait nor thalassemia minor is a risk for the recipient.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We inquire about travel history and residence to assess for exposure to malaria, Zika virus, and other infections. There is no specific testing for vCJD (variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), but donors meeting residence requirements in Europe are still considered ineligible (although rarely disqualified). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7950.html" rel="external">"Blood donor screening: Medical history", section on 'CJD and vCJD deferral criteria'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis or ulcerative colitis may be transmitted to the recipient.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Occasionally, the donor may be found to have abnormal hematologic parameters that may warrant marrow examination to determine eligibility. These are not absolute contraindications to donation but must be assessed in the context of the indication for transplantation, donor availability, and risk to the recipient.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10299541"><span class="h2">Informed consent</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All donors must be fully informed of the risks and benefits of donation and sign appropriate consent forms indicating that they understand the risks and that they have been informed of alternative procedures. In order to avoid a conflict of interest and potential coercion, the donor evaluators are separate from the transplantation team. More subtle coercion on the part of family members is difficult to prevent and requires a private evaluation with the donor and the provision of a safe mechanism to refuse donation. For donors &lt;18 years old, private evaluation may not be advised or possible; in those instances, evaluation with a pediatric social worker or other professional may be useful. The transplant clinicians may request either peripheral blood progenitor cells or bone marrow, and the donor must be aware they can refuse either one or both of the procedures.</p><p>Additional information regarding informed decision making and effective communication is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15076.html" rel="external">"Informed procedural consent"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10299547"><span class="h2">Assessing for risks to the donor from the collection process</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells can be obtained from the donor either via direct needle aspiration of the posterior iliac crests (bone marrow donation) or by mobilizing cells from the marrow into the blood where they can be collected via leukapheresis (peripheral blood progenitor cell [PBPC] donation). Approximately 5 percent of the donor's stem cells are collected. These cells have the capacity for self-renewal and replace themselves in weeks to months, leaving the donor with a full complement of hematopoietic stem cells. There is often a period of discomfort that either precedes donation, as in the case of PBPC, or follows donation if marrow is collected. In both cases, donors return to fully normal performance over the course of days to weeks after the donation.</p><p>Details regarding bone marrow harvest and PBPC mobilization are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3537.html" rel="external">"Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT): Sources of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3421300912"><span class="h3">Psychological effects</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Psychological testing has determined that donation is considered altruistic and desirable for most donors; however, some family member donors feel compelled to donate by pressure from relatives. They at times feel neglected since the family's energy is directed towards the patient. But both related and unrelated donors feel a satisfaction and pride in their role, although it may be tempered by guilt and a particular sense of personal responsibility complicating their grief if the recipient relapses or dies [<a href="#rid2">2-6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10299553"><span class="h3">Bone marrow donation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bone marrow donation is performed under general or regional anesthesia and is therefore subject to risks associated with these forms of anesthesia. Obese donors may have an increased risk of pain, hematoma formation, venous thromboembolism, and anesthesia risk.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3421301174"><span class="h4">Preoperative assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Preoperative evaluation should specifically include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An assessment of the posterior iliac crests (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78950" href="/d/graphic/78950.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) to determine their accessibility, especially in obese donors. Donors with a history of low back problems should have an assessment of this area to be sure the marrow collection does not exacerbate a pre-existing condition. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7782.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of low back pain in adults", section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An assessment of underlying health issues such as coronary artery disease, diabetes, sleep apnea, or hypertension to evaluate the risk and provide appropriate management during and after the collection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4816.html" rel="external">"Preoperative medical evaluation of the healthy adult patient"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6616.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An assessment of the airway to predict the degree of difficulty with mask ventilation and endotracheal intubation using standard devices. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91218.html" rel="external">"Airway management for induction of general anesthesia", section on 'Airway assessment'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>All donors are informed not to ingest potential bone marrow suppressive agents, such as alcohol or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a>, for at least 14 days before donation and to avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8547" href="/d/drug information/8547.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9682" href="/d/drug information/9682.html" rel="external">naproxen</a> sodium for 24 hours prior to donation. Any donor with a hemoglobin of &lt;13 g/dL should take iron supplements for one month prior to and after marrow donation, if feasible. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7148.html" rel="external">"Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults", section on 'Oral iron'</a>.)</p><p>In the past, autologous blood was sometimes collected prior to donation in case transfusion was needed, but several studies have demonstrated that transfusion is rarely required [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>]. Other reasons for avoiding autologous blood donation are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7930.html" rel="external">"Surgical blood conservation: Preoperative autologous blood donation", section on 'Reasons for declining use'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10299559"><span class="h4">Bone marrow collection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bone marrow collection is performed in the operating room under sterile conditions. Multiple aspirates of the posterior iliac crests are performed under general or regional anesthesia using a large bore needle. Additional bone marrow can be obtained from the anterior iliac crest; however, the amounts available are relatively limited and this site is rarely used. </p><p>The volume of collection is determined by the size of the recipient and may also be influenced by the nature of subsequent processing prior to infusion. For non T cell depleted transplants, this typically amounts to 10 mL/kg of recipient weight. For T cell depletion protocols, 15 to 20 mL/kg of recipient weight may be utilized. A maximum of 1500 mL is typically collected, but that is dependent on the donor's size.</p><p>Donors are asked to refrain from heavy lifting and high impact exercises (eg, jogging, aerobic dancing) for approximately six weeks to allow the iliac crest to heal. The use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is avoided because of the heightened risk of bleeding. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3421301257"><span class="h4">Complications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bone marrow harvest is frequently complicated by mild to moderate back or hip pain, fatigue, and transient changes in peripheral blood cell counts. Donors typically require iron replacement and analgesia after the collection. Serious complications of bone marrow harvest are extremely rare and involve mechanical injury, complications of anesthesia, infection, and bleeding [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>The National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) has kept careful records of the volunteer donors who have undergone bone marrow collection. In the first 9245 harvests, 125 donors (1.35 percent) experienced a serious medical complication [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Of these, complications thought to be directly related to the procedure resulted in mechanical injury to tissue, bone, or nerve (n = 69), anesthetic complications (n = 45), infection (n = 1), and a grand mal seizure (n = 1). The median time to recovery following donation for this population that experienced a serious medical complication was 10 months, but 67 experienced prolonged recovery time. Subsequent studies have shown similarly low risks of complications, with faster recovery in peripheral blood stem cell donors than in bone marrow donors [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collection'</a> below.)</p><p>Data regarding less serious, but common, symptoms associated with donation were collected by the NMDP regarding 2505 harvests with the following results [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pain was the most common acute symptom. On day 2 after donation, patients reported back and/or hip pain (82 percent), throat pain (33 percent), or headache (17 percent). The pain was mild (grade 1) in the majority and resolved in over 80 percent by one month, and by one year the percent of patients with pain (&lt;10 percent) was similar to that seen prior to the procedure. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fatigue was the second most common symptom. On day 2, mild to moderate fatigue was reported in 59 percent of donors but resolved by one month in the majority (95 percent). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other less common side effects were site reaction, insomnia, nausea, dizziness, and anorexia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Immediately after donation, most donors experienced an approximately 3 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin. Hemoglobin remained slightly decreased at one month post-donation, but returned to baseline by one year. In addition, there was an immediate slight increase in white blood cell count (median 9.7 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L, interquartile range 7.6 to 12.7) and decrease in platelet count (median 214 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L, interquartile range 179 to 252) that returned to baseline by one month post-donation. For donors where there is adequate time, collection of one to two autologous red blood cell units can be accomplished. Other blood products, including red blood cell infusions, are rarely required and should be avoided unless absolutely indicated.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Median time to full recovery was approximately three weeks.

The expected risks to minor bone marrow donors are similar to those experienced by adult donors. (See <a class="local">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p>A study of 313 minor bone marrow donors identified pain requiring the use of medication as the most common complication of donation occurring in 50 percent of donors [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Older age was the only factor associated with greater risk of pain. Children aged four to eight years had a 3.3 times greater risk of pain compared with those less than four years, and those aged greater than eight years had a fivefold higher risk. The most frequent complications of anesthesia were vomiting (12 percent), sore throat (7 percent), hypotension (6 percent), tachycardia (4 percent), and bradycardia (0.6 percent). In a multivariate logistic regression model, only donor/recipient weight ratio &lt;0.75 was associated with increased risk of cardiac complications, presumably due to the volume of marrow collected relative to donor size. Donor/recipient weight ratio &lt;0.75 was also associated with greater risk of post-donation anemia. </p><p>Peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) donation presents unique challenges to minor donors. The expected complications of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in children are similar to those experienced by adult donors, though pain is less frequently reported by minor donors [<a href="#rid14">14,29</a>]. Central venous access is required by most donors younger than 12 years of age, and the donor is placed under conscious sedation or general anesthesia [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Serious complications of central line placement in donors appear to be uncommon, occurring in less than 2 percent of donors in some series [<a href="#rid14">14,27</a>]. Younger, smaller donors are at greater risk for exposure to blood products due to the need to prime the apheresis circuit with blood products in children who weigh less than 20 kg [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. The larger the weight discrepancy between the donor and recipient, the greater the expected number of days of collection. More than half of the children required greater than one day of collection in a European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) study of 140 minor PBPC donors [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Toxicity of PBPC donation'</a> above.)</p><p>There is no direct medical benefit to minor donors. The potential benefits are all expected to be psychosocial. There are few studies of the psychosocial effects of donation on minor donors.

There is evidence to support that both donor and non-donor siblings experience stress related to their sibling's transplant. </p><p>A prospective longitudinal study of the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of pediatric sibling donors found that approximately 20 percent of children who served as a stem cell donor for their sibling reported poor HRQoL at each of the time points assessed (pre-donation, four weeks following, and one year after donation); this was more prominent in the younger donors and differed from the parental report of the donor's HRQoL (which was likely to be higher) [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. The study could not determine causality and other factors (eg, having a sick sibling) may have contributed to the reported HRQoL measures.

If the recipient is undergoing transplantation for an inherited condition, the potential donor must be adequately screened for the same disease or genetic carrier status in certain conditions. In some situations it is acceptable to use a donor who is a genetic carrier of the disease for which the transplant is being performed. There are no widely accepted guidelines for choosing a donor among equally HLA-compatible siblings who are unaffected by the recipient's underlying disease.
