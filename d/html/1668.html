The consequences of CPP deposition include acute inflammatory arthritis, inflammatory and degenerative chronic arthropathies, and radiographic cartilage calcification and constitute the spectrum of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of CPPD disease are discussed here. The pathogenesis and etiology of this disorder and the treatment of CPPD diseases are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1665.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis and etiology of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1671.html" rel="external">"Treatment of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H272267074"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The term calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) refers to the presence of calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals as detected by microscopy or imaging. The term "CPPD disease" indicates the presence of symptomatic arthritis. Chondrocalcinosis refers to radiographic calcification in hyaline and/or fibrocartilage  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54821" href="/d/graphic/54821.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). It is commonly present in patients with CPPD disease but is neither absolutely specific for CPPD nor universal among affected patients.</p><p>The names used in the past to describe CPPD disease included terms such as pseudogout, chondrocalcinosis, and pyrophosphate arthropathy. Adding the prefix "pseudo" was intended to highlight similarities between various manifestations of CPPD disease and other common rheumatic diseases [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) consensus panel suggested alternative terminology that has been widely adopted in the subsequent literature. We will place primary emphasis here on the use of EULAR task force terminology [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Traditional older names (in parentheses below) relate to the nomenclature proposed by the EULAR task force [<a href="#rid4">4</a>] as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Asymptomatic CPPD disease ("asymptomatic CPPD") (see <a class="local">'Asymptomatic CPPD disease'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute CPP crystal arthritis ("pseudogout") (see <a class="local">'Acute CPP crystal arthritis'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis ("pseudo-rheumatoid arthritis [RA]") (see <a class="local">'Chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Osteoarthritis (OA) with CPPD, with or without superimposed acute attacks ("pseudo-OA") (see <a class="local">'Osteoarthritis with CPPD'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Severe joint degeneration (pseudo-neuropathic joint disease) (see <a class="local">'Severe joint degeneration'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Spinal involvement</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H56278115"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease has been estimated to affect 4 to 7 percent of the adult populations of Europe and the United States [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>], especially among persons of advanced age. However, an estimate of the prevalence of clinically significant CPPD disease has been more difficult to attain, in large part because the available prevalence estimates have relied primarily upon radiographically detected cartilage calcification rather than clinical evaluation.</p><p>The average age at diagnosis of CPPD disease in one study was 72 years [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Radiographic surveys have demonstrated an age-related increase in the prevalence of cartilage calcification [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. This was illustrated in a report that supplemented radiographs of the knees with radiographs of the hands, wrists, and pelvis [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The prevalence of radiographic CPPD according to age, among 100 consecutive patients admitted to an acute geriatric unit, was:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>65 to 74 years – 15 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>75 to 84 years – 36 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>&gt;84 years – Almost 50 percent</p><p></p><p>The sex distribution of CPPD disease has differed among large series [<a href="#rid3">3,9,10</a>], but no major sex predominance appears likely.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is considerable diversity in the patterns of joint disease among patients with symptoms related to calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease. Older nomenclature and the newer terms proposed by the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) consensus panel are described above. (See <a class="local">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Asymptomatic CPPD disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many patients who have chondrocalcinosis on radiographs are asymptomatic. However, patients with apparent asymptomatic CPPD disease may be found to have manifestations of an arthritic disorder upon close questioning. As an example, in one series of older patients with radiographic but ostensibly asymptomatic CPPD disease, a higher frequency of wrist complaints and knee deformity were reported by questionnaire and detected by examination, respectively, than in a control group of similar age but without radiographic chondrocalcinosis [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Acute CPP crystal arthritis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis is characterized by self-limited acute or subacute attacks of arthritis involving only one or several extremity joints [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The traditional term "pseudogout" underlines the usually close resemblance of these attacks to those of urate gout in the accompanying symptoms and signs of severe acute inflammation (intense pain, redness, warmth, swelling, and joint disability) and in the occasional occurrence of synchronous inflammation of several adjacent joints (cluster attacks) or, conversely, petite attacks (which are minimally painful episodes of joint warmth and swelling).</p><p>The knee is affected in over 50 percent of all acute attacks of acute CPP crystal arthritis, while the first metatarsophalangeal joint is the most frequently affected in urate gout. Other joints typically affected in acute CPP crystal arthritis include wrists, shoulders, ankles, feet, and elbows. Initial episodes of acute CPP crystal arthritis may persist longer before remitting than the one or two weeks commonly encountered in urate gout, and an upper-extremity site of inflammation (wrist, elbow, shoulder) for a first attack should raise suspicion for acute CPP crystal arthritis [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. These episodes are typically self limited, and they usually last days to weeks.</p><p>A review of 50 cases of acute CPP crystal arthritis, many of which were polyarticular attacks, described low-grade fevers in 50 percent and frequently elevated sedimentation rates [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. In some cases, systemic features accompanying polyarticular acute CPP crystal arthritis are quite prominent and may suggest pyogenic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and/or systemic sepsis. (See <a class="local">'Chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis'</a> below.)</p><p>Rarely, and usually after several acute arthritic flares, palpable and visible masses of CPP crystals, resembling gouty tophi, accumulate in synovium and adjacent joint structures and may lead to locally destructive and compressive symptoms.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1612472706"><span class="h2">Chronic CPP crystal arthritis</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The term "pseudo-rheumatoid arthritis" (pseudo-RA) was applied to a nonerosive, inflammatory arthritis in which CPP crystals were demonstrable in joint fluid [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. This presentation of CPPD disease resembles RA in several respects, including the presence of significant morning stiffness, fatigue, synovial thickening, localized edema, and restricted joint motion due either to active inflammation or to flexion contracture. The relative frequency of chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis is not known.</p><p>Typically, the chronic inflammatory arthritis of CPPD disease involves multiple joints, frequently involving peripheral joints of the upper and lower extremities, including the wrists and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, as well as the knees and elbows, in a symmetric or nearly symmetric pattern. Articular inflammation may last up to several months, and inflammation in affected joints tends to wax and wane independently of one another, in distinction to RA, where synchronous flare and remission are more typical. These episodes are typically self-limited, usually lasting from days to weeks.</p><p>Older patients may have prominent systemic features during an acute polyarticular attack, such as leukocytosis, fever, and mental confusion, closely mimicking systemic sepsis [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. In such patients, the delirium is reported to resolve with resolution of the acute flare.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Osteoarthritis with CPPD</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Osteoarthritis (OA) with CPPD is a more common and often unrecognized form of symptomatic CPPD disease; for example, 20 percent of unselected patients examined at total knee joint replacement for OA showed CPP crystals in synovial fluid samples [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Approximately 50 percent of patients with symptomatic CPPD disease show progressive joint degeneration, usually involving multiple joints. This pattern of disease has historically been referred to as "pseudo-OA" because of its resemblance to OA occurring in the absence of CPPD. In approximately one-half of such patients, episodes of acute inflammatory arthritis typical of pseudogout punctuate the course. In the remainder, joint degeneration proceeds by a process more typical of classical OA. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/105723.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of osteoarthritis"</a>.)</p><p>The most commonly affected joints in this form of CPPD disease are the knees, followed by the wrists, MCP joints, hips, shoulders, elbows, and spine. Although a symmetric pattern of joint involvement is frequent, unilateral or more severe degenerative change on one side is not unusual. Findings on clinical examination of individual joints do not typically differ from those observed in OA, which include asymmetric bony enlargement, tenderness, effusions, crepitus, and restricted joint motion. Patients with OA with CPPD may also exhibit contractures of involved joints.</p><p>The arthritic process of CPPD may occur in joints typically involved in OA, such as the interphalangeal joints of the hands, the first carpometacarpal joints, the knees, or the first metatarsophalangeal joints. An etiologic or accelerating role for CPPD in joint degeneration seems likely when radiographic calcification is present early in the course of degeneration, particularly if the degenerative changes also involve joints atypical for OA (wrists, MCP joints, elbows, and shoulders) in the absence of a preceding history of joint trauma or of vocational or avocational stress.</p><p>As cartilage is lost during the course of progressive joint degeneration, previously apparent cartilage calcification may become increasingly difficult or impossible to detect radiographically, thereby obscuring the diagnosis. (See <a class="local">'Imaging findings'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Severe joint degeneration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A number of reports have documented CPPD in association with severe joint degeneration which closely resembles neuropathic arthropathy [<a href="#rid14">14-16</a>]. Neuropathic arthropathy is characterized by severe joint degeneration and disruption occurring in the course of neurologic disorders leading to joint denervation; the affected joint is often called a Charcot joint. Underlying disorders associated with Charcot joints include diabetes mellitus (most common), tabes dorsalis, and syringomyelia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5608.html" rel="external">"Diabetic neuroarthropathy"</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to neuropathic arthropathy, neurologic function is typically normal in severe joint degeneration associated with CPPD, prompting use of the term "pseudo-neuropathic joint disease" for this relationship, although an underlying neurologic impairment (typically tabes dorsalis) has, in some instances, been demonstrated [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Spinal involvement (including crowned dens syndrome)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CPPD in and about the spine has been associated with a number of clinical manifestations, including spine stiffness, sometimes associated with bony ankylosis, which can resemble the spinal changes of ankylosing spondylitis or diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH). Such symptoms have been most commonly encountered in familial CPPD disease [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. In addition, crystal deposition in the ligamentum flavum at the cervical spine level or in the posterior longitudinal ligament at lower levels of the spine may lead to spinal cord compression syndromes or to symptoms either of acute nerve compression or of chronic spinal stenosis [<a href="#rid18">18-20</a>].</p><p>The crowned dens syndrome (CDS) is a rare, but important to recognize, syndrome characterized by severe acute or recurrent axial neck pain, neck and shoulder girdle stiffness, and associated fever; elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and CPPD demonstrable on computed tomography (CT) in and around the atlanto-axial articulation)  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef94325" href="/d/graphic/94325.html" rel="external">image 2</a>) [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. The importance of identification of the crystal deposition basis of CDS lies both in the resemblance of its symptoms and signs to those of polymyalgia rheumatica, giant cell arteritis, or, less frequently, meningitis, cervical discitis, or inflammatory spondyloarthritis; and in the usually favorable response of CDS clinical features to treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9293" href="/d/drug information/9293.html" rel="external">colchicine</a>. The diagnosis of CDS is made based on clinical presentation and imaging alone. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> below and <a class="local">'Classification criteria'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Other manifestations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CPPD in bursae, ligaments, and tendons may be sufficient to cause local nerve compression, as in the carpal tunnel [<a href="#rid23">23</a>], as well as tissue damage.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h1">SYNOVIAL FLUID FINDINGS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The total synovial fluid leukocyte concentration during an episode of acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis can vary between 10,000 and 150,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, with a neutrophilic predominance, based on the author's experience.</p><p>The most helpful finding on synovial fluid analysis in calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease is the presence of positively birefringent CPP crystals by compensated polarized light microscopy. In inflamed joints during an attack of acute CPP crystal arthritis, phagocytosed crystals within polymorphonuclear leukocytes are virtually always present  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55730" href="/d/graphic/55730.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>), but extracellular CPP crystals are equally important for diagnosis.</p><p>CPP crystals differ from the needle-shaped, strongly and negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals in acute gouty arthritis  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74417" href="/d/graphic/74417.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>); CPP crystals are more difficult to detect than monosodium urate crystals because they are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Smaller (0.5 to 10 microns)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Weakly positively birefringent or not birefringent at all</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>More polymorphic with rod-shaped and rhomboidal forms</p><p></p><p>Patients with CPP crystals in a synovial fluid sample may also have the simultaneous presence of monosodium urate crystals. The coexistence of urate and CPP crystals in a single effusion is neither uncommon nor unexpected, given the observed frequencies of hyperuricemia (20 percent) and gout (approximately 5 percent) among patients with CPPD disease [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h1">IMAGING FINDINGS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Imaging evidence for calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) has traditionally relied upon conventional radiography, which reveals findings of cartilage calcification (see <a class="local">'Cartilage calcification (chondrocalcinosis)'</a> below). Degenerative changes in the joint are also frequently present, and certain radiographic findings in particular joints are characteristic of CPPD disease in those locations (see <a class="local">'Degenerative changes'</a> below and <a class="local">'Other radiographic features in specific joints'</a> below). Ultrasonographic findings that correlate with radiographic features of CPPD disease have also been described (see <a class="local">'Ultrasonographic findings'</a> below). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a less sensitive imaging modality for documenting CPPD than conventional radiography, ultrasonography, or CT. Dual-energy CT (DECT) is very effective at identifying gout crystal deposits, but the literature still lacks strong evidence for its ability to conclusively identify calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h2">Plain film radiography</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h3">Cartilage calcification (chondrocalcinosis)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Radiographic evidence of CPPD is the defining feature of this finding. CPPD typically appears as punctate and linear radiodensities in articular cartilage (fibrocartilage and/or hyaline cartilage)  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54821" href="/d/graphic/54821.html" rel="external">image 1</a>) and, with lesser frequency, in ligaments, tendons, synovia, bursae, and joint capsules. Although deposits of basic calcium phosphate crystals may occasionally cause confusion, such deposits are usually faint and are irregularly contoured.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cartilage – Among affected fibrocartilages in CPPD disease are the menisci of the knee (usually bilaterally), the symphysis pubis, the triangular fibrocartilage of the wrist joints, and the glenoid and acetabular labra. CPP deposits in hyaline cartilage frequently appear as radiopaque lines paralleling the surface of the underlying bone.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Joints – Larger joints, such as the knee, wrist, elbow, shoulder, and hip, are most frequently involved in CPPD disease, but almost any diarthrodial joint may be affected radiographically. Articular capsule or synovial calcification is often fainter and more diffuse than cartilage calcification.</p><p></p><p>Linear calcifications involving the Achilles tendon or plantar fascia are often seen in CPPD disease [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h3">Degenerative changes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CPPD is often associated with degenerative changes in joints, even in the absence of radiographic cartilage calcification. Characteristic degenerative changes in CPPD disease include typical features of osteoarthritis (OA), including subchondral cysts, osteophyte formation, and bone and cartilage fragmentation.</p><p>CPPD disease may also underlie the occurrence of radiographic features of OA in joints not commonly affected by primary OA.

In addition, trauma, surgery, or severe medical illness may provoke acute attacks in both of these crystal-induced disorders. Despite these similarities, the joints most commonly involved in an acute episode differ between gout and acute CPP crystal arthritis. The knee is affected in over 50 percent of all acute attacks of pseudogout, whereas the first metatarsophalangeal joint is more frequently involved in gout. The distinction between these conditions is made based upon identification of crystals under polarizing light microscopy that are characteristic of one or the other condition.

These conditions can usually be distinguished from acute CPP crystal arthritis by synovial fluid analysis and joint radiography, although the presence of CPP crystals in joint fluid does <strong>not</strong> exclude infection. Thus, Gram stain, as well as joint fluid and blood cultures, is generally necessary to exclude an infectious etiology.

In chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis, the multiple inflamed joints typically flare independently of one another, unlike in RA, where multiple joints usually flare and improve in parallel. Radiographic changes in chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis are more typical of osteoarthritis (OA) than RA, despite the pattern of clinical joint involvement suggestive of the latter disorder (see <a class="local">'Imaging findings'</a> above). The diagnostic approach to adults with polyarticular joint pain is presented in detail elsewhere.

Generally, the identification of CPP crystals and radiographic changes typical of CPPD disease will help distinguish the disorders. However, to further complicate the picture, symptomatic CPPD disease has been noted to occur as a late complication in patients with RA [<a href="#rid47">47</a>], and RA was noted to be more common in patients with CPPD disease than in age-matched controls without CPPD disease in one retrospective study [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. It is important to distinguish between the coexistence of RA and CPPD disease and the expression of one masquerading as the other because of the substantial difference in management between these conditions.

In addition to the atypical distribution, other features on examination that should alert the clinician to possible CPPD disease include contractures of involved joints and valgus deformities of the knees.

Unlike pseudo-neuropathic joint disease, true neuropathic arthropathy is characterized by loss of joint position sensation and sometimes by loss of other sensory function, such as pain and temperature sensation. Disorders associated with neuropathic arthropathy (Charcot joint) include diabetes mellitus (most common), tabes dorsalis, syringomyelia, and spinal cord injuries, and their presence should increase suspicion of this condition. The presence of CPP crystals, by contrast, is consistent with pseudo-neuropathic joint disease instead.

(See <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Post-diagnostic evaluation for associated diseases</strong> – Patients with a diagnosis of CPPD disease may also have one of a number of associated disorders, including hemochromatosis, hyperparathyroidism, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatasia, and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65287" href="/d/graphic/65287.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Given these disease associations, patients diagnosed with CPPD, even if asymptomatic and especially if less than 50 years of age, should undergo the following serum screening studies: calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, iron, and transferrin. (See <a class="local">'Post-diagnostic evaluation for associated diseases'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis </strong>– The differential diagnosis of CPPD disease is broad and differs for each of the potential clinical presentations. Major considerations include gout and septic arthritis, RA, and OA.
