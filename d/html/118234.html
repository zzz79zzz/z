Many randomized trials have attempted to improve results through the addition of chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT), both before and after surgery. RT has emerged as an important component of therapy for rectal cancer because of the higher rate of local failure following resection as compared with colon cancer. For patients treated initially with resection, a four-month course of adjuvant chemotherapy is typically added to postoperative chemoradiotherapy (to total six months of adjuvant therapy), and the available evidence is that this is associated with a significant survival benefit [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2529.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma in patients not receiving neoadjuvant therapy", section on 'Contribution of adjuvant chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>More recently, focus has shifted to preoperative (neoadjuvant) application of fluoropyrimidine-containing chemoradiotherapy or short-course "Swedish-style" RT alone, which is now a preferred approach at many institutions for patients with nonbulky transmural (T3/4)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438" href="/z/d/graphic/111438.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) or node-positive tumors and for those with a positive or threatened mesorectal resection margin. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2468.html" rel="external">"Neoadjuvant therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma", section on 'Indications for neoadjuvant treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Many patients who undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or short-course RT are offered a four-month period of systemic chemotherapy, which is typically administered after resection. However, practice is variable because there is a paucity of direct evidence to support the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Nevertheless, at least in the United States, most oncologists recommend adjuvant chemotherapy in this setting, and the majority of patients receive it [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Furthermore, the optimal regimen (ie, an oxaliplatin-containing regimen versus a fluoropyrimidine alone) is debated, particularly in patients who had a complete pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy.</p><p>Postoperative (adjuvant) therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma in patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or short-course RT will be reviewed here. Neoadjuvant treatment approaches for rectal adenocarcinoma, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients who have not received neoadjuvant therapy, the preoperative staging evaluation for rectal cancer, the surgical management of rectal adenocarcinoma, treatment of locally advanced unresectable or locally recurrent disease, management of rectal squamous cell cancers (which are treated similarly to anal cancers, with definitive chemoradiotherapy), and posttreatment follow-up are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2468.html" rel="external">"Neoadjuvant therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2529.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma in patients not receiving neoadjuvant therapy"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2496.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2522.html" rel="external">"Pretreatment local staging evaluation for rectal cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17127.html" rel="external">"Radical resection of rectal cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15311.html" rel="external">"Surgical treatment of rectal cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2528.html" rel="external">"Treatment of locally recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/123063.html" rel="external">"Treatment of anal cancer", section on 'Rectal squamous cell cancers'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2493.html" rel="external">"Post-treatment surveillance after colorectal cancer treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1115022335"><span class="h1">BENEFIT OF POSTOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1530446305"><span class="h2">Following neoadjuvant short-course RT or long-course chemoradiotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Following resection, we suggest that all patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or short-course radiation therapy (RT) alone for locally advanced (T3/4 or node-positive  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438" href="/z/d/graphic/111438.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)) nonmetastatic rectal cancer receive four months of adjuvant chemotherapy, regardless of the pathologic findings at the time of resection.</p><p>This recommendation is in keeping with consensus-based guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. However, practice is variable, and at some institutions, patients who had a pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy are not routinely offered postoperative chemotherapy, given their overall favorable outcomes.</p><p>The evidence used to support adjuvant chemotherapy following neoadjuvant short-course RT or chemoradiotherapy and resection is mainly an extrapolation of the proven benefit of postoperative adjuvant therapy with RT and chemotherapy, which was the standard of care in the era before preoperative combined modality therapy. As an example, a Cochrane review of adjuvant chemotherapy in resectable rectal cancer concluded that fluorouracil-based chemotherapy significantly reduced the risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.76-0.91) and disease recurrence (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.68-0.83) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, in only 1 of the 20 included randomized trials was preoperative chemoradiotherapy administered to all patients [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2529.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma in patients not receiving neoadjuvant therapy"</a>.)</p><p>The benefit of postoperative chemotherapy following preoperative chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer has been directly addressed in four randomized phase III trials, all of which are flawed, and a meta-analysis of all four trials. In our view and that of others, the available data from these four trials are insufficient to conclude that there is no benefit for postoperative chemotherapy in this setting [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In addition, data on the benefit of an oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy regimen are also available from the randomized phase II ADORE trial.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Phase III</strong> <strong>Trials</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trial 22921, patients who had received preoperative RT with or without chemotherapy underwent a second randomization to four cycles of postoperative bolus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/z/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a> plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9548" href="/z/d/drug information/9548.html" rel="external">leucovorin</a> or to no further therapy [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The addition of chemotherapy, either before or after surgery, significantly improved local control. However, in the latest update, there was no evidence that adjuvant chemotherapy improved 10-year overall survival (51.8 versus 48.4 percent, HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77-1.09) or disease-free survival (47 versus 43.7 percent, HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77-1.08) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The rate of adherence to postoperative chemotherapy was 43 percent, indicating that the evaluation of the efficacy of postoperative chemotherapy was inadequate due to failure to adhere to the protocol as written.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">An unplanned subgroup analysis limited to the 785 patients who underwent complete (R0) resection and who had no evidence of metastatic disease at surgery (ie, node negative) revealed that the addition of postoperative chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival in those whose tumors were downstaged to postresection pathologic (yp) stage T0-2 disease but not stage ypT3-4 disease [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. However, the interaction between the tumor downstaging effect of preoperative therapy and the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy disappeared at later follow-up of this study [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A prospective, randomized, cooperative Italian study reported results of 655 patients treated postoperatively with six cycles of bolus leucovorin-modulated <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/z/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a> compared with observation alone after preoperative chemoradiotherapy [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. There was no advantage for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, either in terms of recurrence rate or overall survival (at five years, 69 versus 70 percent, respectively, with and without adjuvant chemotherapy). Even when the analysis was restricted to patients who had persistent node-positive disease at the time of surgery (ie, ypN+), overall survival rates were not substantially better with adjuvant chemotherapy (five-year overall survival 52 versus 51 percent). Notably, 28 percent of the patients randomized to adjuvant chemotherapy never received it; thus, the evaluation of the efficacy of postoperative chemotherapy was inadequate due to failure to adhere to the protocol as written.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The Dutch colorectal PROCTOR/SCRIPT trials were multicenter prospective trials in which patients with stage II or III rectal cancer who underwent short-course RT or chemotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision were randomly assigned to observation versus postoperative <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/z/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a>/<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9548" href="/z/d/drug information/9548.html" rel="external">leucovorin</a> (PROCTOR, n = 177), or observation versus postoperative <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8839" href="/z/d/drug information/8839.html" rel="external">capecitabine</a> (SCRIPT, n = 292) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Unfortunately, the trials did not reach their full accrual. In a combined analysis of both trials, at a median follow-up of five years, overall survival was not significantly different between groups that did and did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy (five-year overall survival 80 percent with chemotherapy and 79 percent with observation).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">In a later analysis, the persistence of perineural invasion, extramural vascular invasion, and tumor budding in the surgical specimen were all associated with significantly worse overall survival, but no factor, either alone or in combination, predicted a beneficial effect of adjuvant chemotherapy [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The United Kingdom phase III Chronicle trial compared 18 weeks of postoperative <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8839" href="/z/d/drug information/8839.html" rel="external">capecitabine</a>/<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10180" href="/z/d/drug information/10180.html" rel="external">oxaliplatin</a> with no adjuvant treatment in patients undergoing surgery after neoadjuvant fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy; unfortunately, the study was closed prematurely due to poor accrual, enrolling only 113 of the estimated 800 patients needed to demonstrate an absolute improvement in disease-free survival from 40 to 50 percent [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Three-year disease-free survival was higher in the group randomized to capecitabine/oxaliplatin, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (78 versus 71 percent, HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.38-1.69). Overall survival was similar in both groups. Because of the compromised sample size, the evaluation of the efficacy of postoperative chemotherapy was not definitive.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Meta-analysis</strong> – A meta-analysis of individual patient data from all four of these trials concluded that fluorouracil-based chemotherapy did not improve overall survival (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81-1.17), disease-free survival (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77-1.07), or distant recurrences [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. However, inexplicably, in subgroup analysis, patients with a tumor 10 to 15 cm above the anal verge had significantly better disease-free survival with adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40-0.85) and fewer distant recurrences (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40-0.94).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>The ADORE trial</strong> – Direct evidence for the benefit of an oxaliplatin-containing adjuvant regimen in patients with resected rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was provided by the randomized phase II ADORE trial in which 321 patients with curatively resected rectal cancer after neoadjuvant fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy and yp stage II (ypT3-4N0) or III (ypT0-4N1-2) disease were randomly assigned to four months of monthly bolus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/z/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a>/<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9548" href="/z/d/drug information/9548.html" rel="external">leucovorin</a> (fluorouracil 380 mg/m<sup>2</sup> plus leucovorin 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> daily on days 1 to 5 every 28 days) or FOLFOX [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The randomization took place postoperatively, so there was less dropout after surgery than has been seen in other trials.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">At a median follow-up of 74 months, the FOLFOX group had a significantly higher six-year disease-free survival rate (68 versus 57 percent, HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.93), although treatment-related toxicity was also higher, and the improvement in six-year overall survival was modest and not statistically significant (78 versus 76 percent, HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.45-1.19) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3749286570"><span class="h3">Can response to neoadjuvant therapy predict benefit?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We suggest that all patients undergoing preoperative long-course chemoradiotherapy or short-course RT receive postoperative chemotherapy, even if they have a pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant therapy. This approach is consistent with guidelines from the NCCN.</p><p>Retrospective series, registry reports, and at least one systematic review report excellent outcomes in patients who achieve a pathologic complete response after preoperative therapy for rectal cancer [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>]. These data prompted questions about whether the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy represents overtreatment in this group, and they also have raised questions about whether radical surgery can be avoided in those who appear to have a complete clinical response following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2468.html" rel="external">"Neoadjuvant therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma", section on 'Avoidance of radical surgery'</a>.)</p><p>However, other data, all from retrospective studies, support benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy in this subgroup [<a href="#rid21">21-25</a>]. As an example, three separate observational cohort studies using the National Cancer Database to evaluate the association between adjuvant chemotherapy and overall survival among patients with a complete pathologic response following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery (ie, ypT0N0 disease) concluded that adjuvant chemotherapy does improve survival in this favorable subgroup [<a href="#rid22">22-24</a>]. In all three studies, patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy were matched by propensity score to those undergoing postresection observation only. However, in two of the analyses, the magnitude of purported benefit from chemotherapy seemed inexplicably high and could have represented an overestimation of treatment benefit [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. Furthermore, approximately 70 percent of the patients in each of these two cohorts did not receive any adjuvant chemotherapy, which is more than double the rate of nontreatment in older patients with rectal cancer following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database study [<a href="#rid26">26</a>], suggesting that patients and their clinicians were highly selective in making the decision to pursue or not pursue adjuvant chemotherapy.</p><p>Still other data suggest that there may in fact be greater benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in <strong>nonresponders</strong>:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An analysis of data from five European trials of preoperative chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer concluded that the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy was minimal for "responders" (ie, ypT0N0 disease) as compared with "nonresponders" (ie, ypT3N1 disease)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111447" href="/z/d/graphic/111447.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. However, only two of the included trials (EORTC 22921 and the Italian trial [<a href="#rid5">5,9</a>]) actually randomly assigned patients to receive or not receive adjuvant chemotherapy; in the German Rectal Cancer Study Group and French Fédération Francophone de Cancérologie Digestive (FFCD) 9203 trials [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>], all patients received adjuvant chemotherapy, while in the fifth trial, patients received adjuvant chemotherapy at the discretion of the treating clinician [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].
