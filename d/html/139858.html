In many jurisdictions, reporting substance exposure to CPS and, if a separate report is required, law enforcement is also required. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6604.html" rel="external">"Child abuse: Social and medicolegal issues", section on 'Reporting suspected abuse'</a>.)</p><p>Child health and/or safety concerns prompting toxicological testing for a SEC should be well documented in the medical record including [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Documentation of SEC reporting to CPS and, if separate reporting is required, law enforcement</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Positive toxicological test results with interpretation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Notification of primary caregivers/legal guardian and CPS of positive toxicology test results</p><p></p><p>The healthcare professional should retain a copy of all legal documents received (including warrants for legal blood draws or subpoenas for toxicological test results). Chain of custody procedures should be followed for any evidentiary specimen collection, such as legal blood draws, based on local jurisdictional policies and procedures. Any necessary interventions performed at the bedside if the caregiver was suspected to be impaired should be well documented. </p><p>Detection of any substance at any level on toxicological testing performed for a suspected SEC warrants thorough scrutiny and careful expert interpretation (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/130622.html" rel="external">"The substance-exposed child: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Interpretation of results'</a>). Reporting substance exposures to CPS has historically been subject to variability, and limited evidence suggests that illicit drug exposures are more commonly reported compared with other types of exposures such as prescription drug, ethanol, and over-the-counter drug exposures [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. </p><p>Neither healthcare professionals nor child welfare agency professionals should rely solely on a positive or negative toxicology test to determine substance exposure. Test results should be interpreted within the broader context of home environment and caregiver safety [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. Concerns for co-occurring physical, sexual, emotional abuse or neglect victimization should also be reported to CPS and/or law enforcement as required by regional reporting statutes. A toxicology resource <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cotoxguide.org%2F&amp;token=Rti1NBSWdX%2F%2FH%2FlCKGrzlFhkWSCFIkQjSZSjwPmdCPRa8RgA2extAkN8zumGDO7x&amp;TOPIC_ID=139858" target="_blank">guide</a> provides additional information for healthcare professionals, social work, and the multidisciplinary child abuse team to utilize when communicating to child welfare investigators about clinical toxidromes, testing methods, and result interpretation [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>Healthcare professional perceptions of the home environment, particularly if caregivers report substance use or provide details regarding the substance ingested, may inappropriately dissuade reporting, particularly in cases of marijuana exposures traditionally perceived as lower risk compared with other illicit substances and also legal in some jurisdictions. Marijuana has been associated with child maltreatment risk [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. Regardless of legality or jurisdiction, the healthcare professional should determine impact to the child, specifically whether marijuana use is impeding caregiving, by assessing when and where caregivers are using marijuana, location and supervision of the children when this is happening, safe storage of any edible products, and reason for use [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. </p><p>Reporting to CPS may be appropriate even in jurisdictions where marijuana is legal to fully ascertain child safety risk. For example, exposure to psychoactive substances like illicit marijuana recreationally used by caregivers may result in harmful toxicity symptoms for the child and reflects risk of harm to the child, particularly if caregivers engage in poly-substance use. This situation may only be ascertained during a CPS investigation, and caregivers may need referrals to substance use disorder treatment services that can be facilitated by child welfare involvement. Reporting therefore provides an opportunity to intervene on behalf of the child potentially at risk [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Fear of punitive repercussions should not dissuade healthcare professionals from reporting. While circumstances may suggest that substance exposure occurred unintentionally, further assessment by CPS and/or law enforcement personnel is typically necessary outside of the healthcare encounter to determine whether jurisdictional criteria for supervisory neglect are met.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3377565170"><span class="h2">Providing family support</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Families affected by substance use commonly face multiple other psychosocial adversities (mental illness, poverty, and family violence) that must be comprehensively addressed to ensure a healthy and nurturing environment for a child [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Social work and clinical assessment of factors contributory to caregiver substance use is paramount, with implementation of appropriate, responsive, community-based intervention programming and family supports to promote child health and safety. Thus, referrals for mental health assessments, trauma-focused therapy, and/or other community-based supportive programming should be facilitated during the SEC evaluation [<a href="#rid2">2,14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1858850014"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Terminology </strong>– The "substance-exposed child" (SEC, also called the "drug-endangered child") refers to infants and children harmed or at risk of harm due to exposure to harmful drugs or other substances and/or an unsafe home environment related to parent or caregiver substance use.
