The incidence of endometrial carcinoma (EC) is increasing in resource-abundant countries due to increased obesity and longer life expectancy.</p><p>The standard initial treatment of EC is hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and assessment of retroperitoneal lymph nodes. This is an acceptable option for the majority of patients with EC, most of whom are postmenopausal. However, younger patients may desire fertility-sparing treatment options. For patients who are candidates for fertility preservation, the most common approach is progestin therapy and deferral of surgical staging until after completion of childbearing. Use of this approach is limited to patients with low-risk disease, and with fertility preservation the risk of recurrent or persistent disease is higher than with hysterectomy.</p><p>Fertility preservation in patients with EC is reviewed here. Related topics are discussed in detail separately, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Overview (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16917.html" rel="external">"Overview of resectable endometrial carcinoma"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Histopathology and pathogenesis (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3192.html" rel="external">"Endometrial cancer: Pathology and classification"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Epidemiology and risk factors (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3249.html" rel="external">"Endometrial carcinoma: Epidemiology, risk factors, and prevention"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clinical features, diagnosis, and screening for high-risk patients (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16924.html" rel="external">"Endometrial carcinoma: Clinical features, diagnosis, prognosis, and screening"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Staging and surgical treatment (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3251.html" rel="external">"Endometrial carcinoma: Staging and surgical treatment"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adjuvant therapy (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16917.html" rel="external">"Overview of resectable endometrial carcinoma", section on 'Role of adjuvant therapy'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2963525716"><span class="h1">INCIDENCE IN REPRODUCTIVE-AGE PATIENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The majority of patients with EC are postmenopausal, but many young people also develop this disease.</p><p>The average age of diagnosis of uterine cancer in the United States is 63 years old [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The frequency of new cases diagnosed in patients ages 55 to 64 years, 35 to 44 years, and 20 to 34 years were 33.5, 4.9, and 1.5 percent, respectively.</p><p>Studies of EC incidence in young patients include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A review of over 50,000 patients with uterine cancer from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database reported that 4 percent were younger than 40 years of age [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A tumor registry review over an 18-year period calculated a 4.5 percent incidence of EC in patients ages 40 or younger [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2014726472"><span class="h1">RISKS OF FERTILITY PRESERVATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients undergoing fertility-preserving treatment of EC, the major concerns, apart from oncologic efficacy, which is covered below, include whether an undetected advanced endometrial cancer is present. Even in patients with clinical stage I disease, there is a moderate risk of extrauterine disease with grade &gt;1 tumors. There is also a risk of an undetected synchronous ovarian cancer, and the lack of a tumor specimen may limit detection of Lynch syndrome.</p><p>The risk of a synchronous ovarian cancer may be as high as 25 percent in young patients, though the data to inform risk are sparse. For example, in one study of 102 patients younger than 45 years of age with EC who were presumed early stage, 26 patients (25 percent) had a coexisting ovarian malignancy upon surgical staging [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Nearly half of these patients had well-differentiated tumors with less than 50 percent myometrial invasion, suggesting that lower risk endometrial cancer does not preclude a coexisting ovarian malignancy. A study of premenopausal patients 45 years of age or younger with endometrioid endometrial cancer reported an incidence of coexisting malignant ovarian neoplasm of 4 percent [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>Young patients who are diagnosed with EC may have Lynch syndrome as the underlying etiology of their cancer. Patients with EC should undergo molecular screening for Lynch syndrome when feasible [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Lynch syndrome is an inherited autosomal dominant genetic mutation in mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Patients with Lynch syndrome are at an increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, and ovarian cancer. Fertility-sparing therapy may limit the identification of patients with Lynch syndrome since molecular screening of tumor specimens is another important way patients with Lynch syndrome are identified.

Patients should be counseled to consider the strength of their desire for future childbearing versus the additional oncologic risks. This discussion should be documented in the medical record. (See <a class="local">'Risks of fertility preservation'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients should be counseled preoperatively regarding their potential future reproductive outcomes. Some data suggest that appropriate preoperative counseling for patients with gynecologic malignancies and fertility-sparing surgery are associated with a decreased risk of posttreatment regret [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2833776612"><span class="h2">Pretreatment evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pretreatment evaluation consists of clinical determination of stage and grade as well as evaluation for a synchronous primary malignancy. The pretreatment evaluation for patients considering fertility-sparing therapy includes: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Medical history.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Physical examination to assess uterus (size, mobility) and for metastatic disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Endometrial sampling.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pelvic and abdominal imaging – In our practice, we order a transvaginal ultrasound (to assess uterus and adnexa) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess depth of myometrial invasion.</p><p></p><p>The general pretreatment evaluation of patients with EC is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16924.html" rel="external">"Endometrial carcinoma: Clinical features, diagnosis, prognosis, and screening", section on 'Clinical findings'</a>.)</p><p>Endometrial sampling is a key part of the evaluation to determine histology and grade. For patients who desire fertility-sparing treatment for EC, we suggest endometrial sampling by dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) rather than by office endometrial biopsy alone. Office endometrial biopsy is an effective method for diagnosing EC (sensitivity, 99.6 percent in postmenopausal and 91 percent in premenopausal patients with the Pipelle device in a meta-analysis of 39 studies [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]), but some observational data suggest that D&amp;C is associated with a better diagnostic performance for grade of disease and a lower rate of residual disease on subsequent hysterectomy. This may be because office endometrial biopsy is less effective at sampling focal rather than global lesions; thus, areas of pathology may be missed. In patients who desire fertility preservation, the detection of grade 2 disease or higher is of the utmost importance. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3232.html" rel="external">"Overview of the evaluation of the endometrium for malignant or premalignant disease", section on 'Endometrial sampling procedures'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnostic performance of D&amp;C compared with office endometrial biopsy was illustrated in a retrospective study (n = 490) of patients with a preoperative grade 1 EC who underwent hysterectomy and found that final pathology was upgraded in significantly more patients with an initial office endometrial biopsy compared with D&amp;C (17.4 versus 8.7 percent) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In addition, fewer patients in the office biopsy group had no residual tumor at hysterectomy (3.7 versus 14.8 percent), but the study did not report tests of statistical significance for this outcome. High-risk histologies (eg, serous, clear cell) were identified after hysterectomy in approximately 1 percent of patients in each sampling method group.</p><p>After confirming low-grade endometrioid EC with D&amp;C, pelvic imaging should be performed to evaluate for myometrial invasion. In our practice, we use MRI for this evaluation. MRI is an effective modality for detection of myometrial invasion. As an example, in one study (n = 101), MRI detected myometrial invasion and cervical invasion with a sensitivity of 89 and specificity of 100 percent [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In another study (n = 65), for detection of superficial myometrial invasion, MRI had both a sensitivity and specificity of 74 percent [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>Studies have been inconsistent regarding whether MRI is superior to ultrasound in detecting myometrial invasion [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]; however, MRI is generally recognized as the preferred imaging modality for endometrial cancer in part because it can also be used to assess locoregional disease spread [<a href="#rid14">14-18</a>], including cervical extension and deep myometrial invasion [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. MRI has been demonstrated to be superior to computed tomography (CT) in that regard [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. A finding on MRI of enlarged lymph nodes and those with central necrosis should be considered suspicious for metastatic disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1949049226"><span class="h1">FERTILITY-SPARING THERAPY OPTIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Progestin therapy is the mainstay of fertility preservation in EC. Other types of medications, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or aromatase inhibitors, have been proposed, but there are few data regarding their efficacy [<a href="#rid21">21-23</a>]. Hysteroscopic resection of the endometrium prior to progestin therapy has been reported, but further studies are needed to determine its safety, efficacy, and feasibility before recommending it as a front-line treatment option [<a href="#rid18">18,24,25</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2963525734"><span class="h2">Progestin therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several different types of progestins, doses, and regimens may be used for treatment of EC. Progestins are typically given orally (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9600" href="/z/d/drug information/9600.html" rel="external">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> [MPA], <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9603" href="/z/d/drug information/9603.html" rel="external">megestrol acetate</a> [MA]) or via an intrauterine device (IUD). Historically, the most commonly used oral agents have been MPA or MA [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>]. There are few high-quality data to establish the optimal type of progestin, route of administration, or dose.</p><p>The data regarding the efficacy and toxicity of progestin therapy are limited. Available data include a prospective, multicenter phase II study; meta-analyses of observational studies (mostly retrospective); a large national database study; and small series or case reports [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Outcomes relative to hysterectomy are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3223.html" rel="external">"Treatment of low-risk endometrial cancer", section on 'Efficacy relative to surgery'</a>.)</p><p>Studies have included different doses, agents, and regimens. Most of the studies have evaluated oral progestins, and there are no studies that directly compare oral progestins with a progestin-releasing IUD for EC. Another limitation is that many studies include both patients with EC and those with endometrial hyperplasia. In addition, definitions of response, progression, and recurrence and the duration of follow-up vary across studies. The data supporting the choice of route of administration, agent, and dose are reviewed in detail below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3062661483"><span class="h3">Oral agents</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The two oral progestins used for treatment of EC are MPA or MA. There are no high-quality data regarding whether one is more effective than the other, and observational data show conflicting results. In addition, various doses have been used. The lowest doses that have been reported to be effective are: MPA (10 mg) and MA (160 mg).</p><p>Oral progestins should be administered daily based on evidence that continuous treatment is more effective than cyclic (eg, a cycle of dosing for two weeks, then no medication for two weeks) [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>].</p><p>The data regarding oral progestin agents for fertility-sparing therapy for EC are mainly from meta-analyses of observational data, case series, and case reports.

Persistent or progressive disease was found in 25 percent of subjects.

The regression rate was 76 percent, and recurrence after regression occurred in 41 percent. Following treatment, stage II or higher endometrial cancer was diagnosed in 1.8 percent of patients. Of note, 3.6 percent of patients were diagnosed with ovarian cancer after treatment, but it was unclear whether these were primary ovarian cancers or ovarian metastases of endometrial cancer.

In patients with EC, there was a 56 percent complete response rate (defined as the absence of any hyperplastic or cancerous lesions) and a 32 percent partial response rate (defined as a residual lesion with degeneration and atrophy of endometrial glands). Recurrences occurred in 47 percent of patients between 7 and 36 months. Two participants had severe adverse reactions (one weight gain, one liver dysfunction).
