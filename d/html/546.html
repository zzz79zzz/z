In some children, respiratory viral infection will induce transient and episodic wheezing episodes, while, in others, wheezing with respiratory viruses will also influence future development of asthma. The heterogeneity in early childhood wheezing phenotypes introduces clinical challenges for treatment. The optimal management of acute episodes of virus-induced wheezing in infants and preschool children has yet to be determined [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Instituting or escalating asthma therapies, such as inhaled glucocorticoids, leukotriene modifiers, and bronchodilators, can be effective in controlling viral-induced wheezing symptoms in some patients. However, treatment decisions in children with wheezing episodes require an understanding of the risk factors for severe exacerbations and recurrent wheezing in young children. Therapeutic trials comparing variable recurrent wheezing phenotypes are ongoing and will be an important application of precision medicine to determine optimal medication treatments for children with recurrent virus-induced wheezing. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13585.html" rel="external">"Wheezing phenotypes and prediction of asthma in young children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/572.html" rel="external">"Risk factors for asthma"</a>.)</p><p>This topic reviews the treatment of young children with recurrent virus-induced wheezing, defined as a minimum of three to four wheezing exacerbations a year [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Guidelines from the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>] and National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee (NAEPPCC) [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>] provide recommendations for children based upon age and the frequency of viral episodes. Our approach is generally consistent with these guidelines. Treatment of bronchiolitis in infants and virus-induced asthma exacerbations in children and adults are discussed separately. The mechanisms by which viral respiratory infections cause wheezing and asthma exacerbations and the influence of viral infection on both the development and perpetuation of asthma are also discussed separately.

Nebulized hypertonic <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> in combination with a SABA is typically not used, because it has not consistently shown a significant advantage over SABA treatment alone.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inhaled short-acting beta agonists </strong>– Inhaled SABAs (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9396" href="/z/d/drug information/9396.html" rel="external">albuterol</a>/salbutamol, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10215" href="/z/d/drug information/10215.html" rel="external">levalbuterol</a>/levosalbutamol) are often first-line therapy for treatment of virus-induced wheezing. However, response to treatment can differ given the heterogeneity of diseases presenting as early childhood wheezing. In children with recurrent wheezing, SABAs are effective rescue treatments for the quick relief of symptoms  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59229" href="/z/d/graphic/59229.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). SABAs have not been shown to improve clinical outcomes, decrease the rate of hospital admission, or decrease the duration of hospitalization in children with bronchiolitis or acute cough [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. The use of SABAs for acute symptoms and treatment of acute exacerbations in children with asthma is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/558.html" rel="external">"Beta agonists in asthma: Acute administration and prophylactic use"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5743.html" rel="external">"Asthma in children younger than 12 years: Quick-relief (rescue) treatment for acute symptoms"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5740.html" rel="external">"Acute asthma exacerbations in children younger than 12 years: Emergency department management", section on 'Inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonists'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6020.html" rel="external">"Bronchiolitis in infants and children: Treatment, outcome, and prevention"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypertonic </strong><strong>saline</strong><strong> –</strong> Nebulized hypertonic <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> combined with a SABA has been studied but is not used routinely, because it does not have a clear benefit over SABA alone in patients with acute virus-induced wheezing. Limited data suggest that inhaled hypertonic saline in combination with a SABA may be effective in treating young children with acute episodes of virus-induced wheezing. The use of inhaled hypertonic saline for the treatment of LRT disease is based upon the hypothesis that viral infection, particularly with rhinovirus, leads to dehydration of the airway surface liquid and impaired mucus clearance [<a href="#rid8">8-10</a>]. Several randomized trials have reported decreased rates of hospital admission and decreased length of hospital stay in infants and children with acute bronchiolitis or acute virus-induced wheezing treated with inhaled hypertonic saline in addition to SABAs compared with SABAs alone, but other trials have not detected a significant difference between these treatments [<a href="#rid11">11-15</a>]. In addition, the studies with positive findings often excluded children with a history of prior wheezing and/or bronchiolitis, limiting the ability to draw conclusions about this therapy in children with recurrent wheezing episodes. Further study with randomized, controlled trials is needed before this treatment can be recommended for clinical use in young children with recurrent wheeze. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6020.html" rel="external">"Bronchiolitis in infants and children: Treatment, outcome, and prevention"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3701880552"><span class="h2">Antiinflammatory therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In children ≤4 years of age with recurrent virus-induced wheezing who have developed LRT symptoms in the setting of a viral infection, we suggest limiting treatment with systemic glucocorticoids to those who have a history of severe or refractory disease. This includes children who have a history of severe virus-induced wheezing exacerbations requiring hospitalization or emergency department (ED) visits, have not responded to intermittent high-dose inhaled glucocorticoid therapy previously, or have significant asthma risk factors and are on daily controller therapy. We typically do not use inhaled glucocorticoids, leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs; <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9539" href="/z/d/drug information/9539.html" rel="external">montelukast</a>), or macrolide antibiotics in young children with recurrent virus-induced wheezing who are symptomatic due to an acute viral infection, because they have not been shown to be effective in most patients.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Oral glucocorticoids</strong> – The data are mixed regarding the use of oral glucocorticoids to treat virus-induced wheezing in preschoolers, in part due to the heterogeneity of studies and outcomes measured, as well as the heterogeneity of diseases leasing to wheezing in preschool children [<a href="#rid16">16-22</a>]. Overall, this approach does not appear to be effective in most patients with preschool wheezing. Systemic glucocorticoids may be beneficial in subgroups of patients (eg, those with recurrent episodes of virus-induced wheezing, atopic features, and/or family history of asthma) with severe symptoms that have required hospitalization or frequent emergency department (ED) visits or those who have failed other approaches such as intermittent high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Several randomized trials have been conducted that vary in terms of clinical setting, dose of glucocorticoid administered, and patient population studied. Overall, oral glucocorticoids do not appear to reduce the need for hospital admission, but they may modestly shorten hospital length of stay and may reduce the need for SABA rescue therapy [<a href="#rid17">17-21</a>]. One study that compared the length of hospital stay in wheezing children 24 to 72 months of age (mean age 41 months) who were started on a three-day course of oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9808" href="/z/d/drug information/9808.html" rel="external">prednisolone</a> in the ED reported a decreased hospital stay in children requiring admission for greater than seven hours [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. A prior study in younger children (mean age 26 months) with fewer asthma risk factors that did not detect a significant difference in duration of hospitalization in those treated with a five-day course of prednisolone compared with those who were not [<a href="#rid18">18,21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Results from one subgroup analysis suggest that the response to systemic glucocorticoids during wheezing episodes requiring hospitalization may differ based upon the type of virus detected [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Another subgroup analysis in a multicenter trial noted lack of benefit of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9808" href="/z/d/drug information/9808.html" rel="external">prednisolone</a> treatment in children at high risk for atopic asthma (history of ≥4 wheezing episodes and a parent with asthma or clinician-diagnosed eczema) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Additional studies are necessary to better define the characteristics of children who wheeze severely but intermittently and do or do not respond to oral glucocorticoid therapy. How glucocorticoid responsiveness relates to preschool children who will outgrow their asthma-like symptoms and those who will have asthma diagnosed later also needs to be studied.

In one randomized trial of 276 preschool children with recurrent wheezing, there was no difference in the proportion of symptom-free days in those treated with a combination SABA and high-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9068" href="/z/d/drug information/9068.html" rel="external">beclomethasone</a> as needed for symptoms compared with a SABA alone (64.9 versus 61 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Similarly, there was no difference in symptom-free days (83 versus 82 percent, respectively) in another trial of 411 infants who were treated with a two-week course of low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9167" href="/z/d/drug information/9167.html" rel="external">budesonide</a> or placebo started after a three-day episode of wheezing. The use of inhaled glucocorticoid therapy, started the first day of viral symptoms, for the <strong>prevention</strong> of LRT symptoms is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Intermittent preventive therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Leukotriene receptor antagonists</strong> – A couple of randomized trials have examined the intermittent use of an LTRA, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9539" href="/z/d/drug information/9539.html" rel="external">montelukast</a>, to treat acute LRT symptoms in preschool children with recurrent wheezing [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. Overall, these studies do not favor the use of intermittent LTRAs for acute wheezing episodes in young children. The first trial, which included both those treated at the onset of an upper respiratory tract infection (URI) and those treated for asthma symptoms, found a lower rate of unscheduled health care utilization for asthma in those treated with montelukast compared with placebo (odds ratio [OR] 0.65, 95% CI 0.47-0.89) but no significant differences in hospitalizations or rescue medication use [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The other trial, which randomly assigned 1358 children to intermittent montelukast or placebo at the onset of any subsequent wheezing episode over a 12-month period, did not find a difference between the groups in the frequency of unscheduled medical visits for wheezing episodes [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Antibiotics</strong> – The potential utility of macrolides as immunomodulatory therapy in the treatment of recurrent wheezing/asthma has been widely debated given their antiinflammatory properties and antimicrobial effects against <em>Mycoplasma</em> pneumonia and <em>Chlamydia</em> pneumonia. One randomized trial provided some evidence for the early use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9041" href="/z/d/drug information/9041.html" rel="external">azithromycin</a> to shorten the duration of episodes of recurrent wheeze in young children. In a this trial, 72 children one to three years of age with recurrent asthma-like symptoms were randomly assigned to oral azithromycin (10 mg/kg once daily for three days) or placebo for each episode of asthma-like symptoms lasting at least three days [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Treatment with azithromycin significantly decreased the duration of the episode by 63 percent, with a mean episode duration of 3.4 days in those treated with azithromycin compared with 7.7 days in those who received placebo. A greater response was seen with earlier initiation of treatment (83 percent if azithromycin was initiated before day 6 of symptoms versus 36 percent if initiated after day 6). Adverse event rates were similar in the two groups. Patterns of bacterial resistance after treatment were not investigated. However, further study is needed prior to recommending widespread use of azithromycin for this indication.

These studies are difficult to compare because of differences in dose of inhaled glucocorticoid used, timing of when the medication is started in relation to the URI, and primary outcome measured [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. However, overall, these studies suggest that <strong>intermittent</strong> <strong>high-dose</strong> inhaled glucocorticoids  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68517" href="/z/d/graphic/68517.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), started at the onset of a URI and continued for up to 10 days, may decrease asthma-type symptoms and rescue oral glucocorticoid use in preschool children with virus-associated wheezing who are not on daily inhaled glucocorticoid therapy. This approach may be particularly effective in patients with asthma risk factors. There may be slight deficits in growth in some children, although the data are limited. Growth in children who are prescribed this approach should be carefully monitored. It is unclear if intermittent high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids are effective if started after the onset of wheezing in the setting of a URI. <strong>Intermittent</strong> use of <strong>standard</strong> (low to medium) doses of inhaled glucocorticoids  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68517" href="/z/d/graphic/68517.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) does not appear to be effective in this population, particularly when started after the onset of lower respiratory tract (LRT) symptoms.

Two of these studies showed a reduced requirement for oral glucocorticoids (risk ratio [RR] 0.53, 95% CI 0.27-1.04), and all showed modest decreases in symptom scores.

Prevention strategies include antiviral therapies and therapies to modulate the inflammatory response to viruses. Efforts to develop antiviral agents for rhinoviruses, the most common cause of virus-induced wheezing illness, are technically challenging due to the many rhinovirus subtypes and are not available at this time.

Although palivizumab is not indicated for treatment of bronchiolitis in the acute setting, it may be useful in the prevention of subsequent recurrent wheezing in young children, particularly preterm infants.
