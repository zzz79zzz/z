         Although infection is the most likely cause of ill appearance among neonates and young infants, a number of other clinical conditions have similar manifestations  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). After initial stabilization, a careful history and physical examination can often identify key findings that provide the underlying cause  (

         Fever is commonly present in ill-appearing young infants with an infectious cause. However, ill-appearing young infants with normal or low core temperatures (eg, rectal temperature &lt;36.5°C [97.7°F]) may also have serious infections. For example, in a retrospective study of over 3500 young infants discharged with a primary diagnosis of hypothermia, 5.6 percent had bacteremia, 2.4 percent had a urinary tract infection (UTI), and 0.2 percent had herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. In addition, many infants with pertussis are afebrile [

          Infant botulism
         </strong>
         – Infants develop botulism from the ingestion of
         <em>
          Clostridium botulinum
         </em>
         spores (air-borne, soil-borne, or from food), rather than preformed botulinum toxin. The toxin, which impairs impulses at the neuromuscular junction by blocking acetylcholine release, is then produced by organisms that colonize the infant's gastrointestinal tract. The disease is more common among breast-fed infants. Symptoms initially include hypotonia, constipation, and poor feeding, and progress to respiratory failure. The diagnosis of infant botulism should be suspected in any infant with acute onset of weak suck, ptosis, decreased activity, or constipation. A presumptive diagnosis should be made based upon the clinical presentation and electromyography while confirmatory stool studies are pending. The diagnosis and treatment of infant botulism are discussed in greater detail separately. (See

Infected infants may present with a fulminant illness characterized by signs of decreased cardiac output, including hypotension, poor pulses, and decreased perfusion. Malignant arrhythmias are common. Evidence of viral myocarditis has been described in association with BRUEs and sudden infant death beyond the neonatal period as well. (See

         – If there is no intervention, the intermediate phase evolves with progression and persistence of hyperbilirubinemia. The infant can be febrile, lethargic with a poor suck, or irritable and jittery with a strong suck. The cry can be shrill, and the infant is difficult to console. Mild to moderate hypertonia develops, beginning with backward arching of the neck (retrocollis) and trunk (opisthotonos) with stimulation. An emergency exchange transfusion at this stage might prevent permanent bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction.

         Arrhythmias, of which supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is the most common, may go unrecognized. Initial signs are nonspecific and the infant typically tolerates the rapid heart rate for many hours or days before clinical deterioration. Episodes of SVT are usually paroxysmal and characterized by abrupt onset and termination. The heart rate is typically 220 to 280 beats per minute (bpm) and on electrocardiogram (ECG), patients exhibiting SVT have no beat-to-beat variability and little variability in rate, and the QRS interval is typically narrow (&lt;80 msec). If SVT is persistent, the infant eventually develops congestive heart failure. Management of tachycardia in infants is provided in the algorithm  (

         In infants, severe bradycardia can be due to both sinus and atrioventricular (AV) node dysfunction. This most commonly results from hypoxemia, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis, although intrinsic conduction defects may also be causes. In severe bradycardia, cardiac output is insufficient, leading to poor systemic perfusion, shock, and ultimately cardiorespiratory arrest. Children who have bradycardia with poor perfusion or shock require immediate medical management  (

         Infants with cyanotic or obstructive heart disease, who are dependent on blood flow through the ductus arteriosus for pulmonary or systemic circulation, develop severe symptoms as the ductus closes over the first few days to weeks after birth  (

         ). Depending upon the specific cardiac lesion and the delay in seeking care, infants may present with some combination of poor feeding, poor weight gain, respiratory distress, cyanosis, shock, acidosis, and congestive heart failure. Obstructive lesions manifested as respiratory distress, shock, and cyanosis may mimic sepsis. (See

         Kawasaki disease (KD) is rare among young infants. However, in this age group, the presentation is frequently incomplete or atypical. As a result, patients are at increased risk for coronary artery aneurysms, primarily because of delay in treatment. The diagnosis should be considered in any child under age six months with five or more consecutive days of unexplained fever. (See

Echocardiogram (ECHO) should be performed in these patients. In addition, all infants less than six months with seven or more days of unexplained fever (even without KD signs) warrant laboratory testing and ECHO based on the lab results. The demonstration of coronary artery aneurysms on ECHO may be seen in up to 10 percent of children who never meet criteria for KD. (See

         Hypoglycemia is defined as a plasma glucose concentration low enough to cause signs and symptoms of brain dysfunction (neuroglycopenia). Because the response to hypoglycemia occurs across a range of plasma glucose concentrations and signs of hypoglycemia are not reliably identifiable, especially in young infants, hypoglycemia cannot be defined as a single plasma glucose concentration. However, the threshold for obtaining diagnostic data (often referred to as the "critical sample") and for confirming a diagnosis of hypoglycemia in infants outside of the neonatal transition period is 50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L). The immediate management of an ill-appearing infant with hypoglycemia is provided in the table  (

         Infants with acute hyponatremia (developed over a period of less than 48 hours) are more likely to be symptomatic and are at risk for complications as there has not been sufficient time for cerebral adaption to occur. Symptoms also are dependent on the severity of hyponatremia. In infants, severe hyponatremia (serum sodium &lt;125 mEq/L) usually occurs as the result of water intoxication (intake of excessive amounts of free water; commonly due to improper mixing of infant formula), excessive renal losses (such as with CAH), or excessive gastrointestinal losses. Occasionally, infants with cystic fibrosis may present with hyponatremic dehydration. (See

         Causes of hypernatremia (serum sodium 150 mEq/L or more) include sodium poisoning, excessive loss of free water (as can occur with arginine vasopressin deficiency or resistance [previously called central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, respectively]), or loss of water in excess of sodium losses. Severe hypernatremic dehydration has been reported in association with breastfeeding difficulties. Lethargy, irritability, seizures, and/or coma may occur with hypernatremia. Initial treatment consists of fluid resuscitation of hypovolemic shock followed by careful replacement of the free water deficit (see

         Hypothermia (core body temperature below 35°C [95°F]) frequently occurs in young infants because they are prone to heat loss due to their high body surface to mass ratio and because they lack compensatory mechanisms, such as shivering, to respond to cold stress. Instead, they rely on intense peripheral vasoconstriction to maintain core temperature. A precise measurement of core body temperature is needed to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.

        <p>
         Hypothermia may be due to environmental exposure or secondary to serious medical illness  (

          table 13
         </a>
         ). Hypothermia due to medical illness is typically mild (core body temperature 32 to 35°C [90 to 95°F]). However, in ill-appearing young infants, a core temperature &lt;36.5°C (97.7°F) may also be a sign of a severe infection. (See

         The majority of patients with Hirschsprung disease (HD) are diagnosed in the neonatal period. The diagnosis can be suggested by a delay in passage of the first meconium (greater than 48 hours of age). By 48 hours of life, 100 percent of normal full-term neonates will pass meconium. By contrast, 50 to 90 percent of infants with HD will fail to pass meconium within the first 48 hours of life.

A firm, discrete inguinal mass, which may extend to the scrotum or labia majora, can be palpated in the groin. The mass usually is tender and often is surrounded by edema with erythema of the overlying skin. The testicle may appear dark blue because of venous congestion caused by pressure on the spermatic cord.

         Malrotation develops as a result of an arrest of normal rotation of the embryonic gut. Abnormal mobility of the small bowel, as the result of a narrow mesenteric base, allows the mesentery to twist. Volvulus occurs when small bowel twists around the superior mesenteric artery, causing vascular compromise to large portions of the midgut  (

         ). This leads to ischemia and necrosis of the bowel that can quickly become irreversible. Vomiting, which is almost always bilious (green), occurs in &gt;90 percent of newborns with volvulus and is by far the most common presenting symptom of malrotation in infancy. Abdominal distension and tenderness are typically also present on physical examination. (See

         Meconium ileus is a disorder of the neonate caused by the obstruction of the small intestines at the level of the terminal ileum with inspissated meconium and is the most common presenting finding in young infants with cystic fibrosis. The widespread use of prenatal carrier testing and prenatal detection of meconium ileus by ultrasound enables clinicians to counsel patients and plan proactive management of this complication of cystic fibrosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Infants with meconium ileus generally present during the first three days of life with abdominal distension and failure to pass meconium, with or without vomiting. Affected infants are initially stabilized with nasogastric decompression and correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. An abdominal plain film should be performed to look for evidence of dilated bowel loops, perforation, calcifications, or other abnormalities  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100556" href="/z/d/graphic/100556.html" rel="external">
          image 2
         </a>
         ). If there is no evidence of perforation, hyperosmotic contrast enema radiography is performed to confirm the diagnosis, using a water-soluble agent. In patients with meconium ileus, the contrast radiograph typically reveals a small-caliber colon (microcolon of disuse) and meconium pellets in the terminal ileum. The ileum proximal to the obstruction is dilated  (

         ). The hyperosmolar contrast often breaks up the meconium mass and clears the obstruction. However, approximately one-half of infants with meconium ileus have complications that require surgical intervention. (See

Abdominal findings consist of bilious emesis, abdominal pain and distension, and rectal bleeding.

         Patients typically come to medical attention at three to six weeks of age with a complaint of progressively worsening projectile, nonbilious emesis. Patients with significant hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis and dehydration may appear listless and cachectic. However, a heightened clinical awareness and the liberal use of ultrasound to establish the diagnosis has led to early diagnosis and better outcomes. Thus, the classic presentation with a prolonged duration of vomiting and emaciation accompanied by a palpable mass in the right-upper quadrant and a hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis on blood chemistries is less common.

         Initial investigations should include a blood ethanol level and a rapid urine drug screen, preferably close in time to initial presentation. When obtaining such tests, the clinician should primarily test for poisons that are consistent with the patient's symptoms (eg, testing for ethanol, opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, marijuana, and antihistamines in young infants who are lethargic and for cocaine or amphetamines in infants with seizures). If a screening test (eg, enzyme-mediated immunoassay for drugs of abuse) is positive, then a more definitive test should be performed to confirm and quantify the amount of substance present (eg, gas chromatography/mass spectrophotometry).

         However, negative results do not exclude drug overdose. Studies beyond the typical rapid drugs of abuse screens may also be warranted.

         . The clinical diagnosis of prenatal opioid exposure is based upon a history (or suspected history) of maternal opioid use disorder, positive maternal or infant urine toxicology screening for opioids, and/or neonatal findings that are consistent with NAS. Management of NAS is discussed separately. (See

          Terminology
         </strong>
         – Ill appearance in a young infant refers to abnormalities in one or more components of the pediatric assessment triangle (appearance, circulation, and breathing). (See

          Differential diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Although infection is the most likely cause of ill appearance in young infants &lt;90 days of age, a number of other clinical conditions have similar manifestations  (

          Targeted evaluation
         </strong>
         – After initial stabilization and provision of empiric therapy as needed, a targeted evaluation based upon a detailed history and physical examination frequently identifies the underlying condition and guides definitive therapy. (See
