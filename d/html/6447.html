(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5927.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with anemia"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H412737901"><span class="h1">BACKGROUND</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The development of pallor can be acute and associated with a life-threatening illness, or it can be chronic and subtle, occasionally first noted by someone who sees the child less often than the parents or caregivers. The onset of pallor can provoke anxiety for caregivers who are familiar with the descriptions of the presentation of leukemia in childhood. In some instances, only reassurance may be needed, as in the case of a light complexioned or fair-skinned, non-anemic child. In other instances, pallor may occur in patients with nonhematologic conditions such as shock, anaphylaxis, respiratory failure, or hypoglycemia. Even if there is a hematologic cause for the pallor, it often is a temporary condition readily amenable to therapy. However, pallor can portend a serious disease, and when onset is acute, it can herald a true pediatric emergency for which rapid diagnosis and treatment are needed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Any condition that decreases the concentration of hemoglobin or alters the distribution of blood away from the body's surface may present as pallor  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65774" href="/z/d/graphic/65774.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Clinically, pallor caused by anemia usually can be appreciated when the hemoglobin concentration is below 8 to 9 g/dL (4.96 to 5.56 mmol/L), although the complexion of the child and the rapidity of onset may influence this value.</p><p>The concentration of hemoglobin in the blood can be lowered by three basic mechanisms:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decreased erythrocyte production</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased erythrocyte destruction</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Blood loss</p><p></p><p>Anemias may also be classified by the size of the red blood cell: microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic. The most common causes of anemia seen in the emergency department (ED) are iron deficiency, infection, and blood loss, but several less common diseases remain important considerations.</p><p>Nonhematologic causes of pallor include complexion ("fair skin"), hypoperfusion from shock, respiratory distress, hypoglycemia, skin edema, and pheochromocytoma.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Life-threatening causes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The conditions that are life-threatening and cause pallor can be divided into nonhematologic and hematologic causes  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65774" href="/z/d/graphic/65774.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">Nonhematologic</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pallor may be associated with respiratory failure, poor tissue perfusion (shock), and hypoglycemia. Etiologies for shock include sepsis, hypovolemia, traumatic brain or spinal cord injury, heart failure, arrhythmia, or anaphylaxis. These conditions require recognition and intervention prior to knowing the results of hematologic studies  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef129655" href="/z/d/graphic/129655.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Severe blood loss</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Massive hemorrhage (eg, severe trauma) is accompanied by signs of hypovolemic shock and is considered an emergency. Rapid fluid resuscitation is required to reverse the hemodynamic abnormalities. The initial hemoglobin and indices are typically normal due to lack of equilibration. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6389.html" rel="external">"Hypovolemic shock in children in resource-abundant settings: Initial evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Autoimmune hemolytic anemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pallor caused by autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is usually acute in onset and may be associated with severe anemia. On physical examination, the child with AIHA often will be pale and jaundiced. Tachycardia is typically present, as is a systolic flow murmur, reflecting a high-output anemic state. However, cardiovascular compromise (eg, congestive failure) is uncommon unless the hemoglobin concentration is &lt;5 g/dL (3.10 mmol/L). The liver and spleen may be palpable, but the presence of massive organomegaly or lymph node enlargement should suggest another disorder such as malignancy (eg, leukemia, lymphoma) or infection (eg, HIV, malaria, tuberculosis). </p><p>The presence of only a moderate anemia (6 to 8 g/dL [3.72 to 4.96 mmol/L]) at diagnosis should not detract from consideration of this disease as a hematologic emergency because brisk hemolysis may result in a sudden, additional fall in the hemoglobin level that could be life-threatening. It is usually characterized by a positive direct anti-globulin test (DAT or direct Coomb test) and an increased reticulocyte count. Spherocytes are commonly seen in the peripheral smear  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70611" href="/z/d/graphic/70611.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5934.html" rel="external">"Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) in children: Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>The etiology and treatment of AIHA in children is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5932.html" rel="external">"Overview of hemolytic anemias in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/107301.html" rel="external">"Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) in children: Treatment and outcome"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Sickle cell disease with splenic sequestration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The sequestration episodes of sickle cell disease (SCD) and related hemoglobin disorders (SC disease, S-beta (0) thalassemia, S-beta (+) thalassemia) result from acute pooling of red cells and plasma in the spleen.</p><p>The sudden and severe anemia and the hypovolemia associated with this complication constitute a true hematologic emergency and, if untreated, may rapidly lead to death. The presence of increased pallor and acute enlargement of the spleen in a patient with SCD should prompt immediate investigation of a possible sequestration crisis.</p><p>Although this complication rarely occurs in children with homozygous sickle cell disease (SS) or S-beta (0) thalassemia after the age of five years, sequestration crises may occur much later in children with milder forms of SCD such as SC or S-beta (+) thalassemia, in which early splenic infarction is uncommon. Additionally, patients with SS or S-beta (0) thalassemia started on disease modifying therapy at a young age (ie, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13367" href="/z/d/drug information/13367.html" rel="external">hydroxyurea</a> or chronic red cell transfusions) could have persistence of splenic tissue and remain at risk for splenic sequestration after the age of five years. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7119.html" rel="external">"Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease", section on 'Splenic sequestration crisis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The red blood cell destruction in both of these processes is secondary to fibrin deposition resulting in microangiopathic hemolysis with schistocytes, helmet cells, and RBC fragments on the peripheral blood smear  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70851" href="/z/d/graphic/70851.html" rel="external">picture 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50715" href="/z/d/graphic/50715.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). Thrombocytopenia and uremia may lower the hemoglobin concentration even further by causing bleeding, impaired red cell production, shortened red cell survival, and increased plasma volume. In some instances, the anemia may be moderately severe when the uremia is only mild and thrombocytopenia is absent, leaving doubt about the correct diagnosis. In more typical cases, however, the diagnosis is readily apparent from the findings of oliguria, central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities, increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and thrombocytopenia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6081.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) hemolytic uremic syndrome in children", section on 'Typical course'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1338.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of immune TTP"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In DIC, abnormal fibrin deposition within small blood vessels results in mechanical injury to the erythrocytes. Thrombocytopenia and clotting abnormalities, which often herald the onset of DIC, also may contribute to the anemia by causing diffuse bleeding. The main diagnostic findings are red cell fragments in the peripheral blood smear  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70851" href="/z/d/graphic/70851.html" rel="external">picture 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50715" href="/z/d/graphic/50715.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>), platelet and clotting abnormalities typical of a consumptive coagulopathy, and the clinical features of a disease such as septic shock, which is associated with DIC. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5915.html" rel="external">"Disseminated intravascular coagulation in infants and children", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5915.html" rel="external">"Disseminated intravascular coagulation in infants and children", section on 'Laboratory findings'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Malignancy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hypoplastic anemia can be the presenting symptom of childhood malignancies. The pallor can be severe, and although all three cell lines of the bone marrow usually are affected, anemia may be the only notable hematologic abnormality. The diagnosis can be suspected from the presence of other symptoms or findings such as lymphadenopathy, bruising, limb pain, gum bleeding, or an abdominal mass. Malignancies that can present with anemia include leukemias, lymphomas, and other solid tumors that infiltrate the bone marrow (eg, neuroblastoma). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6244.html" rel="external">"Overview of the clinical presentation and diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5187.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging evaluation of neuroblastoma", section on 'Presenting symptoms'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Common hematologic conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The common hematologic conditions that result in pallor can be divided into decreased RBC production, increased RBC destruction, and blood loss  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65774" href="/z/d/graphic/65774.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Decreased RBC production</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Iron deficiency anemia</strong> – Anemia from iron deficiency is usually seen in the first two years of life, at which time the dietary iron content is often insufficient to meet the demands of the rapidly increasing red cell mass. It is the most common hematologic disorder in childhood, affecting approximately 5 to 10 percent of young children. The typical presentation of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is an otherwise asymptomatic, well-nourished infant or child who has a mild to moderate microcytic, hypochromic anemia  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64267" href="/z/d/graphic/64267.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>). Much less frequent are infants with severe anemia, who present with lethargy, pallor, irritability, cardiomegaly, poor feeding, and tachypnea. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5925.html" rel="external">"Iron deficiency in infants and children &lt;12 years: Screening, prevention, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical manifestations of iron deficiency anemia'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For infants presenting with a mild microcytic anemia and a presumptive diagnosis of IDA, a therapeutic trial of iron is the most cost-effective strategy. In children older than two years of age, dietary causes of iron deficiency are less likely, and other causes of anemia (eg, chronic blood loss, chronic disease, celiac disease) need to be considered. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5925.html" rel="external">"Iron deficiency in infants and children &lt;12 years: Screening, prevention, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Evaluation for suspected iron deficiency anemia'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Aplastic episodes in patients with a hemolytic anemia</strong> – Patients with inherited hemolytic anemias such as spherocytosis or SCD may develop red cell aplasia, usually in association with parvovirus B19 infection. Decreased red cell production in the face of ongoing hemolysis causes an exacerbation of the anemia. The usually elevated reticulocyte count falls to inappropriately low levels, often less than 1 percent. Although the platelets and white cells are generally unaffected, they may be mildly decreased. Red cell transfusions are appropriate if the anemia is associated with cardiovascular signs or symptoms or if continuing reticulocytopenia indicates that the anemia is likely to become severe before the usual spontaneous recovery after three to seven days. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8272.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of parvovirus B19 infection", section on 'Transient aplastic crisis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Transient aplastic episodes in patients with immunocompromise and parvovirus infection</strong> – Patients with an immunodeficiency from either a congenital immune disorder or acquired immune dysfunction in the setting of chemotherapy for malignancy, immunosuppression post-transplant or HIV infection can experience a parvovirus B19 related aplastic episode from an inability to clear the parvovirus infection with resultant persistent reticulocytopenia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8272.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of parvovirus B19 infection", section on 'Transient aplastic crisis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lead poisoning</strong> – Lead poisoning reduces heme synthesis, but significant anemia is unusual unless blood lead levels are markedly elevated. Iron deficiency is common in children with increased lead levels and usually accounts for the microcytic anemia found in these patients. If a concomitant hematologic disorder cannot be found in the anemic patient with plumbism, particular care should be given to the possibility of severe lead intoxication. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6491.html" rel="external">"Childhood lead poisoning: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Hematologic'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anemia of inflammation</strong> – Occasionally, pallor is the only presenting finding of a serious systemic inflammatory disorder. Chronic inflammatory diseases are often accompanied by a normocytic or microcytic anemia that is multifactorial related to abnormal iron homeostasis, impaired erythropoiesis, and a blunted erythropoietin response (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7149.html" rel="external">"Anemia of chronic disease/anemia of inflammation", section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Inflammation increases hepcidin production, which is a negative regulator of iron, decreasing iron absorption in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract; as well as sequestration of macrophage iron, which results in iron restricted erythropoiesis. Laboratory results in anemia of inflammation demonstrate a reduced serum iron and low total iron-binding capacity with a normal to high ferritin. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7149.html" rel="external">"Anemia of chronic disease/anemia of inflammation", section on 'Iron studies'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h3">Increased RBC destruction</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sickle cell syndromes</strong> – Patients with sickle cell disease have a baseline hemolytic anemia and pallor. Acute accentuation of the pallor can result from an aplastic crisis, increased hemolysis, or acute pooling of red cells in the spleen. (See <a class="local">'Sickle cell disease with splenic sequestration'</a> above and <a class="local">'Decreased RBC production'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hereditary spherocytosis</strong> – Patients with hereditary spherocytosis, the most common of the red cell membrane disorders, typically present with anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly. Hemolysis can be worsened in the setting of an acute febrile illness. However, the degree of anemia is extremely variable and may be absent, mild, moderate, or severe to the point of threatening life.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Because hereditary spherocytosis often is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, a family history of anemia, splenomegaly, splenectomy, or cholecystectomy may be helpful. However, a particularly severe form of spherocytosis occurs as an autosomal recessive disorder, and some children with more typical disease lack an informative family history. Consequently, the diagnosis should not be dismissed in the absence of other affected family members, in that only 75 percent will have a family history. The red cell morphology often permits the diagnosis of spherocytosis to be made from the peripheral smear  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70611" href="/z/d/graphic/70611.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7079.html" rel="external">"Hereditary spherocytosis", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h3">Chronic blood loss</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although sudden, massive hemorrhage usually is accompanied by signs of hypovolemic shock, the repeated loss of smaller amounts of blood may be associated with few findings other than pallor. The finding of iron deficiency anemia despite normal dietary iron intake or iron supplementation may be a clue to the presence of chronic blood loss from the GI tract (eg, Meckel diverticulum, peptic ulcer, variceal bleeding), heavy menstrual bleeding in females, or within the lungs (eg, pulmonary hemosiderosis).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h2">Other conditions that cause pallor</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Decreased red blood cell production</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Acquired aplastic anemia</strong> – The clinical presentation of aplastic anemia (AA) is variable and includes symptoms and signs related to cytopenia in each of the three cell lineages including fatigue, pallor, and cardiovascular complaints caused by progressive anemia; hemorrhagic manifestations secondary to thrombocytopenia; and/or fever, mucosal ulcerations, and bacterial infections resulting from neutropenia. A diagnosis of AA is suggested by the presence of pancytopenia with absolute reticulocytopenia, suggestive of bone marrow failure. The condition is often idiopathic but has been associated with exposure to certain drugs and chemicals (<a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13145" href="/z/d/drug information/13145.html" rel="external">chloramphenicol</a>, benzene, pesticides), radiation, and viral infections (especially hepatitis). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5923.html" rel="external">"Treatment of acquired aplastic anemia in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC)</strong> – TEC is a condition often associated with a recent viral illness, and it is characterized by moderate to severe anemia caused by diminished red cell production. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) usually is normal at the time of diagnosis. The white cell count is normal or moderately decreased; the platelet count is normal.
