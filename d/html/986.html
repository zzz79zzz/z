Victims can be young and apparently healthy, and while many of these deaths are unexplained, a substantial number harbor underlying previously undiagnosed cardiovascular disease. As a result, there is great interest in early identification of at-risk individuals for whom appropriate activity restrictions can be implemented to minimize the risk of SCD.</p><p>The majority of SCD events in athletes are due to malignant arrhythmias, usually sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). In individuals with certain cardiac disorders (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, etc), athletics may increase the likelihood of VT/VF in two ways:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In certain susceptible individuals (ie, with inherited arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy), prolonged exercise training may induce adaptive changes in cardiac structure (eg, interstitial fibrosis, disruption of normal myocardial architecture, dilation of right and left ventricle) that may create pathologic arrhythmogenic substrate. This worsening of the phenotype has not been observed in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The immediate physiologic demands of intense athletics (eg, mechanical strain, increased myocardial oxygen consumption, hemodynamic overload, catecholamine release, electrolyte imbalance) may trigger malignant arrhythmias in susceptible individuals with underlying cardiac abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>The potential for SCD associated with athletic activity generates two questions:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>How should individuals be identified prior to initiating athletic activity?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What restrictions (if any) should be placed upon individuals with known cardiovascular disease to minimize the SCD risk?</p><p></p><p>Answers to these questions are complicated and controversial and often based on limited clinical data and thus expert opinion. Answers vary based upon three factors:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The age of the individual</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The nature of the activity (ie, competitive versus recreational athletics)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The type of underlying heart disease</p><p></p><p>This topic will review the major etiologies of SCD in athletes and recommendations for participation in sports in the presence of various cardiac abnormalities. The broader range of arrhythmias and conduction disturbances common in athletes, including treatment and return to participation following treatment, are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/991.html" rel="external">"Athletes with arrhythmias: Electrocardiographic abnormalities and conduction disturbances"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/990.html" rel="external">"Athletes with arrhythmias: Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113533.html" rel="external">"Athletes with arrhythmias: Treatment and returning to athletic participation"</a>.)</p><p>The recommended approaches to preparticipation screening of athletes are also presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/960.html" rel="external">"Screening to prevent sudden cardiac death in competitive athletes"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4052084331"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although definitions vary from study to study, it is important to define the populations of athletes as well as the level of competition in which the athletes are engaged.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Young athletes</strong> – Most commonly, "young athletes" refers to those in high school and college but applies in general to individuals under age 35 in whom SCD is usually due to a variety of congenital heart diseases.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Masters athletes</strong> – Adult, or "masters," athletes include individuals ≥35 years of age in whom SCD is most commonly associated with coronary heart disease. Such sports programs primarily include apparently normal and healthy individuals ≥35 years of age, although many participants are greater than 50 up to 80 years or more of age.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Competitive/elite athletes</strong> – Competitive/elite athletes engage in organized team or individual sports in which there is regular competition, placing a premium on achievement. This definition implies that individuals are regularly engaged in high-level training and competition and may not have the will or the judgment to limit their activity. This most frequently applies to high school, college, and professional sports.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Recreational athletes</strong> – Recreational athletes generally participate for health and/or enjoyment purposes and do not typically have the same pressures to excel. Activity levels may still be vigorous, and the distinction from competitive athletics may be elusive in the individual case. However, defining recreational athletics separately permits the development of guidelines for noncompetitive athletes with cardiovascular disease.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10177261"><span class="h1">COMPETITIVE VERSUS RECREATIONAL ATHLETICS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The literature on SCD during exertion has largely focused on competitive athletics. However, some recreational athletics can be as vigorous as competitive sport, so recreational activity limitations are also important in individuals with one of the cardiovascular diseases commonly associated with SCD [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. While the incidence of SCD appears to be higher in competitive versus recreational athletes, the total number of SCDs is actually greater in recreational athletes, due to the sheer numbers of persons engaging in recreational activity and the less stringent rules for preparticipation evaluation in the latter [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The balance between the risks and benefits of athletic activity depends upon several factors, including baseline fitness level, the nature and intensity of athletic activity, the presence and extent of cardiac disease, and the psychologic and physical benefit from sport.</p><p>For patients with a congenital disorder, with either structural or arrhythmic substrate, the possible increased risk associated with participation in athletic activity generally requires some restriction on athletic activity. However, it must be acknowledged that these restrictions are usually based on expert opinion and not controlled studies. Historically, patients with known genetic disorders that may predispose to SCD (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, Marfan syndrome, long QT syndrome) have been advised to avoid exercise activities with the following characteristics:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>"Burst" exertion, involving rapid acceleration and deceleration, as is common in sprints, basketball, tennis, and soccer. Activities with stable energy expenditure, such as jogging, biking on level terrain, and lap swimming are preferred.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Extreme environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, and altitude) that impact blood volume and electrolytes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Systematic and progressive training load focused on achieving higher levels of conditioning and excellence.</p><p></p><p>However, paternalistic guidance has been changed to a contemporary approach for a shared decision-making process, which involves the athlete in the discussion of risk and benefit. Patients with unusual or high-risk clinical features may require greater restriction. These features include a history of syncope or presyncope (especially during exertion), prior arrhythmic episodes, or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). However, for most other individuals, including those with stable coronary heart disease, the overall benefits of regular exercise far outweigh the risks. A prudent and gradually progressive exercise program is therefore appropriate in most cases [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1510.html" rel="external">"Exercise and fitness in the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2786.html" rel="external">"The benefits and risks of aerobic exercise"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2208287342"><span class="h1">OUR APPROACH TO PARTICIPATION IN ATHLETICS (AND SPORT ACTIVITY IN GENERAL)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our approach to participation in sport activity, either recreationally or competitively, is in general agreement with that of the American Heart Association [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Physically active asymptomatic individuals without known cardiovascular disease</strong> – These individuals may continue their usual moderate or vigorous exercise and progress gradually as tolerated. Those who develop signs or symptoms of cardiovascular disease should discontinue exercise and seek guidance from a medical professional before resuming exercise of any intensity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Physically active asymptomatic individuals with known cardiovascular disease</strong> – Those who have been medically evaluated within 12 months may continue a moderate-intensity exercise program unless they develop signs or symptoms, which requires immediate cessation of exercise and medical reassessment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Physically inactive individuals without known cardiovascular disease</strong> – These persons may begin light- to moderate-intensity exercise without medical guidance and, provided they remain asymptomatic, progress gradually in intensity as recommended by current American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Physically inactive individuals with known cardiovascular disease or signs/symptoms that are suggestive cardiovascular disease</strong> – Such patients should seek medical guidance before starting an exercise program, regardless of the intensity.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">INCIDENCE OF SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is widely acknowledged that SCD is one of the leading medical causes of death in athletes, although its exact incidence remains controversial. The best available evidence, together with a close examination of reporting methods for case identification and population definitions, suggests that an overall incidence of between 1:50,000 and 1:100,000 per year in young competitive athletes is a reasonable estimate based on existing information from retrospective cohort studies and prospective observational and cross-sectional studies [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>]. This rate is notably higher in older adults, closer to 1:7000 healthy adult athletes per year [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Incidence data are imprecise since most are derived from retrospective analyses, and incidence varies depending upon the intensity of exercise, the athletic population considered, the time period of observation, and whether the definition of athletic SCD encompasses SCD outside of sport/exercise [<a href="#rid6">6-10</a>]. Use of media reports or catastrophic insurance claims as the primary method for case identification has been demonstrated to underestimate (by approximately 50 percent) the risk of SCD in athletes [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Male athletes are consistently found to be at greater risk, and there appears to be a disproportionately higher risk among male African American athletes.</p><p>Using data from the Rescue Registry cardiac arrest database, which contains data from all out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrests (SCA, which includes deaths and resuscitated arrests) attended by paramedics in the province of Ontario, Canada, investigators retrospectively reviewed the incidence of SCA between 2009 and 2014 among an estimated 350,000 competitive athletes ages 12 to 45 years (in total 2.1 million athlete-years) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Among the 3825 out-of-hospital SCA presumed to be cardiac in nature that occurred over the six years, 74 were identified as occurring during or within one hour of sports activities (16 during competitive sports, 58 during recreational sports). Although the overall rate of SCA in athletes was 0.76 per 100,000 athlete-years, 44 percent survived to hospital discharge, leading to an overall rate of SCD of 0.42 per 100,000 athlete-years. The incidence rate was somewhat higher among athletes ages 12 to 17 years (SCA rate 1.17 per 100,000 athlete-years; SCD rate 0.65 per 100,000 athlete-years) but still lower than prior SCD estimates of 1:50,000 athletes per year.</p><p>The magnitude of the problem and the challenges inherent in screening are illustrated in reports of arrhythmic events associated with major endurance sporting events [<a href="#rid8">8,11</a>]. As an example, in a study examining SCD in 215,413 marathon runners participating in one of two marathons over a 19-year period, the following findings were noted [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>SCD occurred in four individuals during or immediately following the marathon, an incidence of approximately 1 in 50,000. This is substantially lower than the annual risk of premature death in the general population.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>None of the four subjects had prior cardiac symptoms.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Two of the four had completed several previous marathons.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Three of the four had coronary artery disease on autopsy, although none had a previous infarction.</p><p></p><p>Although the incidence of SCD among marathon runners is low (one death per 215,000 hours), it is higher than for other types of exercise, such as noncompetitive jogging (one death per 396,000 hours), cross-country skiing (one death per 607,000 hours), or general, noncompetitive exercise (one death per 375,000 hours) [<a href="#rid12">12-15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGY OF SUDDEN DEATH</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Structural heart disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>SCD in athletes often occurs in the presence of structural heart disease, although the underlying disorder is usually undetected until the presenting arrhythmic event. Structural heart disease can increase the risk for SCD by one or more of the following mechanisms:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>By far the most frequent mechanisms are ventricular tachyarrhythmias, which are commonly due to reentrant arrhythmias that develop in abnormal myocardium and/or areas of fibrotic replacement of myocardial tissue.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other rare but possible mechanisms include bradyarrhythmia or asystole due to extension of the pathologic process into the conduction system, causing complete heart block without a reliable escape focus.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Syncope, in addition to arrhythmic causes, may result from outflow tract obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis, as well as from cyanosis during exercise in the setting of certain congenital lesions with right-to-left shunts.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dissection of the great vessels, as in patients with Marfan syndrome.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Athletes &lt;35 years of age</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several large series have evaluated SCD in athletes less than 35 years of age [<a href="#rid6">6,16-24</a>] . In most cases, structural heart disease was present, although more contemporary data suggest more sudden arrhythmic death with a structural normal heart [<a href="#rid2">2,22</a>]. When present, the most common structural heart diseases include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), anomalous origin of a coronary artery, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC, which commonly also affects the left ventricle), myocarditis, and coronary atherosclerosis, albeit with some variation among the different series.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among 1435 young competitive athletes from a United States registry in whom cardiovascular disease was evident on postmortem examination following SCD, HCM (36 percent) and anomalous origin of a coronary artery accounted for more than half of the cases [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. A separate study showed that among 51 middle school athletes, anomalous origins of a coronary artery accounted for one-third of cases of sudden cardiac arrest and death [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. However, among 55 college and professional athletes, cardiomyopathies (hypertrophic, arrhythmogenic, dilated, noncompaction, or restrictive) accounted for nearly half of cases.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a cohort of over six million military recruits in the United States (mean age 19, range 17 to 35), among whom 126 nontraumatic sudden deaths occurred (including 108 [86 percent] related to exercise), anomalous origin of a coronary artery (33 percent), myocarditis (20 percent), coronary atherosclerosis (16 percent), and HCM (13 percent) accounted for over three-quarters of the structural abnormalities [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a series from the United Kingdom Regional Registry of 357 consecutive athletes with SCD between 1994 and 2014 (mean age 29 years), sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS), likely including undiagnosed primary electrical disease, was the most prevalent cause of death (42 percent) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Myocardial disease was detected in 40 percent of cases, including idiopathic left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and/or fibrosis (16 percent), ARVC (13 percent), and HCM (6 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A different distribution was noted in a series of 49 athletes under age 35 with SCD from northern Italy [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. In this series, ARVC (22 percent) was the most common abnormality, followed by coronary atherosclerosis (18 percent) and anomalous origin of a coronary artery (12 percent).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Athletes ≥35 years of age</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In contrast to these series in young subjects, among those ≥35 years of age (so-called masters athletes), coronary artery disease is the predominant cause of SCD during exercise [<a href="#rid23">23,26</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Coronary artery disease'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Primary electrical disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>SCD during athletics also occurs in the absence of structural heart disease, a situation termed primary electrical disease. Series of patients with SCD have shown an increasing number with normal autopsies, although there is concern that cardiac abnormalities may have been missed. A number of inherited arrhythmic syndromes predispose individuals to SCD, and the heart is usually structurally normal in these patients. Examples include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Long QT syndrome (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1036.html" rel="external">"Congenital long QT syndrome: Epidemiology and clinical manifestations"</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Brugada syndrome (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106759.html" rel="external">"Brugada syndrome: Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and evaluation"</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/916.html" rel="external">"Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia"</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Short QT syndrome (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16697.html" rel="external">"Short QT syndrome"</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Early repolarization syndrome (see <a class="local">'Early repolarization syndrome'</a> below)</p><p></p><p>In addition, in individuals with structurally normal hearts, arrhythmic events may be precipitated by trauma or occur as sporadic/idiopathic phenomena, such as commotio cordis, in which SCD results from being struck in the precordium with a projectile object such as a baseball, hockey puck, or fist.

The guidelines include the option for selective participation in recreational and competitive athletic activity in patients with HCM who have a low-risk profile (ie, without any risk factors that would place them at high risk for SCD), provided that they undergo periodic evaluation. The 2020 ESC guidelines confirm that patients with high-risk markers should not participate in competitive athletics. The 2020 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) HCM guidelines allow for a shared decision-making approach for patients with HCM, in which the clinician and the athlete share discussion of the potential risks and benefits of exercise [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p>Activity advice in patients with HCM has been based largely on expert opinion given limited data. Some moderate-intensity and many low-intensity recreational activities were generally considered to be safe when performed in moderation, including biking, doubles tennis, swimming laps, golf, and skating, and should be considered on a case-by-case basis [<a href="#rid31">31,33</a>]. Lifting weights with weight-training machines may be safe, but intense static (isometric) activity were discouraged because of the possible induction of a Valsalva maneuver and exacerbation of an LV outflow tract gradient.</p><p>HCM is a relatively common disease, occurring in approximately 1 out of 500 individuals in the general population. In most athletes with SCD due to HCM, the diagnosis of HCM was not previously established. Patients with HCM who are at the highest risk of SCD are those with prior sudden cardiac arrest. In addition, those with unexplained syncope, massive hypertrophy (maximum LV wall thickness &gt;30 mm), family history of SCD due to HCM, significant LV outflow tract obstruction (gradient &gt;50 mmHg), nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias observed on electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, including exercise-related VT, apical aneurysms, and extensive scarring on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging are at increased risk [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Moreover, age is a relevant determinant, with adolescent and young athletes being at higher risk than adult patients. Among patients with HCM, stratification as advised by the AHA and the ESC can identify patients at high and relatively low risk for SCD; however, zero risk does not exist and even patients defined as low risk have a small but nontrivial risk of SCD [<a href="#rid34">34-36</a>].

In a cohort of 88 Italian athletes with HCM who were advised to discontinue training and competition (77 who were low risk by the ESC algorithm, 67 who were low risk by the AHA algorithm), 61 patients stopped exercising, but 27 continued to exercise against clinician advice [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Over an average follow-up of seven years, 1.3 percent of patients per year developed symptoms (syncope, palpitations), and only one cardiac arrest occurred (in a detrained patient and not during exercise), with no significant difference in the event rates between the sedentary and exercising groups.

Chronic ischemia is considered responsible for myocardial fibrosis representing the ultimate substrate for induction of tachyarrhythmias during exercise.</p><p>Patients with congenital coronary anomalies may present with syncope or presyncope, especially with exercise and with angina in a limited proportion of cases. Unfortunately, SCD is often the first clinical symptom. This was illustrated in a report of 18 patients with an anomalous coronary artery origin, only six of whom had a preceding history of angina and/or syncope [<a href="#rid45">45</a>].

However, it is likely that the risk of a cardiac event during exercise increases with the presence of increasingly severe CAD, type of lesion (soft plaques are at higher risk of rupture), LV dysfunction, and ventricular arrhythmias, as well as with the intensity of the competitive sport and the individual's effort. As a result, risk assessment should involve a full evaluation of cardiac status in individual patients.</p><p>Athletes with CAD are considered to be at low risk if <strong>all</strong> of the following are true [<a href="#rid66">66</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>LV ejection fraction ≥50 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Normal exercise tolerance for age. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1510.html" rel="external">"Exercise and fitness in the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease", section on 'Benefits of fitness'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>No inducible ischemia with exercise testing. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1548.html" rel="external">"Prognostic features of stress testing in patients with known or suspected coronary disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>No sustained or nonsustained VT during exercise testing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>No hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis (ie, no stenosis ≥70 percent in a major coronary artery and no stenosis ≥50 percent in the left main coronary artery) if coronary artery tomography or coronary angiography is performed. Patients who have had successful revascularization of prior stenosis are also considered to be at low risk.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10177151"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Competitive versus recreational athletics</strong> – The balance between the risks and benefits of athletic activity depends upon several factors, including baseline fitness level, the nature and intensity of athletic activity, the presence and extent of cardiac disease, and the psychologic and physical benefit from sport. Although there are exceptions, for most individuals, the overall benefits of regular exercise far outweigh the risks. (See <a class="local">'Competitive versus recreational athletics'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Incidence of sudden cardiac death</strong> – The incidence of SCD among young athletes is actually quite low, estimated to be between 1:50,000 and 1:100,000 young athletes per year. This rate is notably higher in older adults, closer to 1:7000 healthy adult athletes per year. (See <a class="local">'Incidence of sudden cardiac death'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Etiology and pathophysiology of sudden death</strong> – The potential etiologies of SCD include certain structural heart diseases, inherited arrhythmia syndromes, and coronary heart disease; the exact distribution of etiologies varies according to age and geography. (See <a class="local">'Etiology of sudden death'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/974.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Activity restriction</strong> – Some level of activity restriction  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105651" href="/z/d/graphic/105651.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) is recommended for nearly all individuals with underlying heart disease. The precise restrictions vary depending on the underlying disease process and other comorbidities. (See <a class="local">'Structural abnormalities associated with SCD'</a> above and <a class="local">'Inherited arrhythmia syndromes'</a> above and <a class="local">'Coronary artery disease'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Maron BJ, Chaitman BR, Ackerman MJ, et al.
