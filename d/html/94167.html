Dame Cecily Saunders, founder of the hospice and palliative care movements, recognized these four distinct yet intertwined domains in defining the concept of “total pain” in the 1960s, a holistic and enduring framework to guide the care of seriously ill persons [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>The relationship between spirituality and health has gained increased attention in the United States and elsewhere. Spirituality (which includes religious and existential aspects of care) is one of eight specific domains of quality within palliative care, endorsed by the National Consensus Project (NCP) for Quality Palliative Care and international palliative care organizations [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. However, spirituality has historically been one of the least studied and addressed domains within the care of the seriously ill [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. A growing body of literature supports the notion that spiritual care is an important patient need in palliative care, that spiritual distress is a significant component of overall distress in palliative care patients, and that patients’ spirituality affects health care decision-making and health care outcomes, including coping, quality of life, and pain management.</p><p>This topic will review the available evidence linking spirituality and palliative care outcomes. An overview of spirituality in palliative care, which includes how to address spirituality with patients, methods of spiritual assessment, taking of a spiritual history, and approaches to spiritual distress, is addressed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2198.html" rel="external">"Overview of spirituality in palliative care"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H88594268"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Spirituality</strong> is multidimensional and highly variable in its individual and/or communal experiences and expressions. It is often understood as encompassing the relationship to and experience of transcendence [<a href="#rid7">7</a>] or sense of peace, purpose, and interconnectedness, including beliefs about the meaning of life [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Because of the need to standardize a definition for spirituality in palliative care, a group of interdisciplinary experts in palliative and spiritual care produced a consensus definition of spirituality as the aspect of humanity that refers to the way individuals seek and express meaning and purpose, and the way they experience their connectedness to the moment, to self, to others, to nature, and to the significant or sacred [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Spirituality may include religion and other worldviews but encompasses far more general ways in which these experiences are expressed, including through the arts, relationships with nature and others, and, for some, through the concept of secular humanism, the latter of which emphasizes reason, scientific inquiry, individual freedom and responsibility, human values, compassion, and the needs for tolerance and cooperation [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Religion</strong> is a structure through which a person or group of persons expresses spirituality within a community. A religious community is one that is organized around common beliefs, attitudes, practices, traditions, and relationships [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22162301"><span class="h1">SPIRITUAL DOMAINS AS FUNCTIONAL STATES AND AS OUTCOMES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Religion and spirituality [<a href="#rid12">12</a>] play a multidimensional role for patients and families in the setting of serious illness. The most frequently explored spirituality domains in palliative care include the importance of spirituality, spiritual experience, positive and negative religious/spiritual coping, the spiritual needs of patients and caregivers, religiousness (eg, religion, religious affiliation), and spiritual/religious practices. These religious/spiritual domains have been found to relate to a variety of patient and family outcomes, such as medical decision-making and quality of life for patients/caregivers [<a href="#rid5">5,6,13-36</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Influence of spirituality and religiousness on outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p>Evaluating research exploring the impact of spirituality on outcomes in palliative care requires a framework of specific spiritual domains being assessed (independent predictors) as well as the outcomes being examined (dependent variables). Spiritual predictor variables generally include spiritual functional states such as religious coping or spiritual practices. Dependent variables can include a variety of outcomes that are hypothesized to be influenced by such spiritual predictors, eg, quality of life, medical decision-making at the end of life. Outcomes may also include specific spiritual dependent variables, such as spiritual wellbeing, a domain of patient quality of life (often conceptualized as multidimensional, with domains including meaning, peace, and faith [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]), or the outcome of spiritual distress (sometimes termed “spiritual pain”). Although spiritual outcome variables can be conceptualized as outcome predictors (eg, examining the relationship of spiritual wellbeing or distress to medical decision-making), care should be taken in outcomes research to clearly define the conceptual model, such as when examining spiritual wellbeing as a predictor of patient quality of life, given the conceptual overlap between these constructs [<a href="#rid11">11,37</a>].</p><p>In addition to considering the diversity of spiritual variables and their relationships to outcomes in serious illness, there are many potential persons influencing patient and family outcomes (the patients themselves, family, their faith community, and medical caregivers) that need to be considered in research examining the link between spirituality and outcomes in palliative care patients (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef104559" href="/d/graphic/104559.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H88597759"><span class="h1">MEASURING SPIRITUALITY AND RELIGIOUSNESS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are a variety of tools for measuring patient spirituality and religiousness. One of the most comprehensive tools for general health research is the Multidimensional Measures of Religiousness and Spirituality (MMRS), which was developed by an expert panel working group convened by the Fetzer Institute and the National Institute on Aging [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. The tool identifies 12 domains of spirituality/religiousness, with scales for each domain, including measures of spiritual experiences such as the Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale [<a href="#rid39">39</a>] and the forgiveness scale [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. As highlighted by the MMRS, spirituality/religiousness are multidimensional constructs. In general, spirituality and religiousness are conceptualized as separate, though often highly related, dimensions, commensurate with the aforementioned definitions of these terms. Measures of spiritual dimensions generally refer to an individual’s search for or experience of spirituality (eg, meaning, purpose, connection to God or higher power). By contrast, religious dimensions in general refer to communally structured forms of spirituality, such as attendance of religious services. A systematic review of spirituality measures provides guidance regarding each scale’s validation, cross-cultural applicability, and dimensions of spirituality examined [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H88596399"><span class="h1">INFLUENCE OF SPIRITUALITY AND RELIGIOUSNESS ON OUTCOMES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients’ spirituality and religiousness can influence health care decision-making and health care outcomes including coping, quality of life, and pain management.<sup> </sup></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H88596558"><span class="h2">Religiousness and health care decision-making</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A growing body of literature supports the view that religion affects health care decision-making, particularly at the end of life [<a href="#rid33">33,34</a>]. Several studies have shown that religious factors, including religiousness [<a href="#rid6">6,35</a>] and religious beliefs about specific end-of-life treatment preferences [<a href="#rid36">36,41</a>], are associated with reduced acceptance of the terminal nature of illness and preferences for more aggressive medical interventions at the end of life.</p><p>To our knowledge, there are few prospective studies that link patient religious domains to the types of medical care received at the end of life:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The Coping with Cancer I study, a multisite, prospective cohort study of 345 advanced cancer patients, found that patients exhibiting high levels of positive religious coping at baseline received more aggressive interventions in the last week of life (eg, care in an intensive care unit [ICU], resuscitation) even after controlling for confounding factors including race and other coping characteristics [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. Additional results from this study are presented below. (See <a class="local">'Medical team interventions and outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>On the other hand, a secondary analysis of a randomized trial that evaluated the influence of physician communication style on patient resuscitation preferences found no significant association between intensity of patient religiosity and preference for resuscitation at the end of life [<a href="#rid43">43</a>].</p><p></p><p>Differences in religious beliefs may explain some of the reported health care disparities in end-of-life medical care. Studies show that race and ethnicity are associated with different levels of endorsement of religiousness and religious beliefs about care [<a href="#rid6">6,35,36,44</a>] and religious coping [<a href="#rid35">35</a>], factors that are also associated with preferences for aggressive end-of-life interventions [<a href="#rid35">35,36,45</a>] and advance care planning [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. However, to our knowledge, there are no prospective studies that provide a link between race/ethnicity and religiousness/spirituality, to care received at the end of life, and especially to the patient-centered outcome of goal attainment in end-of-life medical care (eg, place of death and end-of-life medical care consistent with patient goals/treatment preferences).</p><p>The Religious Beliefs in EOL Medical Care (RBEC) scale was developed for use in patients with advanced cancer and measures religious beliefs regarding end-of-life care [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. The seven-item scale assesses the influence of four concepts (God’s sovereignty, sanctification through suffering, sanctity of life, and miracles) on preferences for end-of-life care in general, with one question regarding do-not-resuscitate orders. In this validation study, most patients (87 percent) reported at least some endorsement of one or more of the RBEC items. In adjusted models, increasing RBEC scale endorsement was associated with reduced acceptance of the terminal nature of illness. The study was performed among 275 racial/ethnically diverse patients recruited from cancer centers across the United States. However, limitations include those relevant to a United States setting, most notably the population being predominantly Christian. Furthermore, the wording of the items is specific to cancer, limiting its applicability to other diseases and hence requiring wording adaptation and additional validation to have utility in other settings.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22162325"><span class="h2">Impact of spirituality/religion on quality-of-life outcomes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most of the outcomes research in spirituality and palliative care has focused on the influence of religion, spirituality, and spiritual wellbeing on patient quality of life and its subdomains (eg, psychological, social, physical, spiritual wellbeing). The available data suggest that palliative care patients with higher levels of spirituality have better quality of life and that supporting spiritual wellbeing is useful, especially as patients approach the end of life. The impact of formal spiritual care interventions or palliative care interventions that have a spiritual or religious component on measures of quality of life is less certain, but available studies suggest their association with improved quality of life outcomes among palliative patient populations.</p><p>Spirituality is associated with an improved quality of life for those with chronic and serious illness [<a href="#rid46">46</a>], which appears to hold true regardless of life expectancy [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. The vast majority (although not all [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]) studies involving palliative care populations demonstrate significant, positive associations between measures of patient spirituality and quality of life [<a href="#rid19">19,22,28,31,39,49-62</a>]. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In one trial of 103 patients with advanced cancer, spiritual wellbeing (measured by a Linear Analogue Self-Assessment scale) was strongly associated with overall quality of life, mental wellbeing, physical wellbeing, emotional wellbeing, and social wellbeing [<a href="#rid54">54</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A systematic review of the association between spiritual wellbeing and quality of life in 36 studies (32 cross-sectional, 4 longitudinal) of patients with cancer found that the majority of studies found a positive association between spiritual wellbeing and quality of life, but the impact was stronger for emotional and functional than for physical dimensions of quality of life [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. Of the 18 studies that examined the faith factor of spiritual wellbeing, most (but not all [<a href="#rid63">63</a>]) concluded that faith was positively associated with quality of life, even after controlling for demographic and clinical variables.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In other studies, spiritual wellbeing has been associated with lower levels of depression, better quality of life near death, and protection against end-of-life despair and desire for hastened death in patients with cancer [<a href="#rid62">62,64,65</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Three meta-analyses examining the relationship between spirituality/religiousness and physical, mental, and social health encompassed 1341 effects drawn from more than 44,000 patients with cancer [<a href="#rid59">59-61</a>]. The results suggest that each of the evaluated patient-reported health domains was significantly, albeit modestly, related to overall religiousness/spirituality (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107772" href="/d/graphic/107772.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among patients living with HIV disease, spiritual wellbeing was positively related to quality of life, social support, and effective coping strategies and negatively related to perceived stress, uncertainty, and emotion-focused coping [<a href="#rid52">52</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Similarly, among patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, spiritual beliefs and existential wellbeing correlate positively with health-related quality of life [<a href="#rid53">53,66</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Studies in a variety of palliative care populations have also demonstrated negative associations of spirituality measures with measures of psychological distress, including depression [<a href="#rid19">19,22,50,62</a>], anxiety [<a href="#rid19">19</a>], and hopelessness [<a href="#rid49">49</a>], and that patients with chronic illness, patients with cancer, or those who are older adults who experience spiritual distress are at risk for poorer health outcomes, including worse physical health, worse quality of life, and greater depression [<a href="#rid67">67-69</a>]. Patients who report longstanding spiritual or religious struggles were at greater risk of disability [<a href="#rid70">70</a>], higher indices of pain and fatigue, and more difficulties with daily physical functioning [<a href="#rid67">67</a>]. Although more limited data are available, spiritual distress may also predict a greater mortality risk, even when controlling for demographic, physical health, and mental health factors [<a href="#rid67">67</a>].</p><p></p><p>These studies examining associates of measures of spirituality are limited by key weaknesses, including predominantly cross-sectional designs, inadequate adjustment for potential confounding factors (such as social class), and potential for conceptual overlap between the measures of spirituality and quality of life.</p><p>Few studies have examined specific patient spiritual practices (eg, prayer, meditation, reading of sacred texts, sacred rituals [eg, communion]) and their relationship to quality of life outcomes in the setting of advanced illness, particularly among patients with spiritual struggles. While two small single-arm mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention studies suggest that mind-body meditation is associated with modest positive improvements in psychological and spiritual quality of life for patients [<a href="#rid71">71,72</a>], the results of two randomized trials in palliative care populations have been mixed (see <a class="local">'Specific interventions'</a> below):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One randomized study [<a href="#rid73">73</a>] showed no evidence of improvements in quality of life with MBSR alone, compared with usual care, but found quality of life benefits when MBSR was combined with massage.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>On the other hand, a second randomized trial [<a href="#rid74">74</a>] found no quality of life benefits with MBSR compared with usual care.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H797268257"><span class="h3">Impact of spiritual needs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although studies suggest that patients with advanced illness frequently have spiritual needs (eg, seeking meaning, needing forgiveness) [<a href="#rid20">20,29,75</a>], few data are available to describe the relationship between spiritual needs and overall quality of life. One study among patients with advanced cancer (with 86 percent having one or more spiritual concerns) showed that higher levels of spiritual concerns (including spiritual struggles [feeling abandoned by God] or spiritual seeking [seeking forgiveness, thinking about what gives meaning in life]) had worse psychological and overall quality of life [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Similarly, another study of 727 racially/ethnically and religiously diverse patients seen in oncology clinics found that spiritual needs were present for 79 percent and that greater spiritual needs were associated with less satisfaction with care and lower perceptions of the quality of care [<a href="#rid75">75</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H342772165"><span class="h3">Impact of religiousness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In contrast to spirituality, studies examining religiousness and its associations with patient quality of life are few, and they have not demonstrated consistent associations with patient quality of life:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a report of 53 patients with end-stage kidney disease treated with hemodialysis, greater perception of religiosity correlated with an increased perception of social support and quality of life and less negative perception of illness effects and depression [<a href="#rid76">76</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Multiple studies have examined positive and negative religious coping, often assessed using Pargament’s validated RCOPE tool [<a href="#rid77">77</a>], as predictors of patient quality of life. Positive religious coping has had inconsistent associations with improved quality of life in the setting of advanced illness; while some studies indicate a positive association with quality of life [<a href="#rid28">28</a>], many report no association [<a href="#rid6">6,26,78,79</a>]. By contrast, negative religious coping has been consistently found to be associated with decrements in patient quality of life [<a href="#rid6">6,26,78-80</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22162337"><span class="h2">Family spiritual domains and outcomes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Data exploring spiritual domains and outcomes among caregivers are limited, though the available data suggest that spirituality/religion plays an important role in caregiver wellbeing. Spiritual pain appears to be frequent among caregivers of patients with serious illness and is associated with poorer caregiver quality of life, though the data are scant and limited by such factors as the frequent use of cross-sectional designs.</p><p>There are few studies exploring the relationship of family caregiver spiritual domains and outcomes in the context of a loved one’s serious illness [<a href="#rid15">15,27,81,82</a>].

A survey-based study of 339 physicians and nurses examining predictors of spiritual care provision to advanced cancer patients found that spiritual care training was the main predictor of spiritual care provision (adjusted odds ratio [OR] for physicians = 11.20, 95% CI 1.24-101; and adjusted OR for nurses = 7.22, 95% CI 1.91-27.30, respectively). Notably, most oncology physicians (88 percent) and nurses (86 percent) reported that they received no spiritual care training [<a href="#rid84">84</a>].

Spirituality (which includes religious and existential aspects of care) is one of eight specific domains of quality within palliative care, endorsed by the National Consensus Project (NCP) for Quality Palliative Care and other palliative care organizations, but it is one of the least studied and addressed domains within the care of the seriously ill. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Spirituality and religiousness are distinct yet related entities. Spirituality has been broadly defined in terms of the ways individuals “seek and express meaning and purpose, and the way they experience their connectedness to the moment, to self, to others, to nature, and to the significant or sacred.” Spirituality may include religion and other worldviews but encompasses far more general ways in which these experiences are expressed. By contrast, religion represents the communal structures and expressions of spirituality that are shared by a group of people.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A growing body of literature supports the notion that a patient’s spirituality/religiousness affects health care decision-making and health care outcomes, including coping and quality of life:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Religious factors (eg, religious coping, religiousness, and religious beliefs about care) are associated with a greater preference for and (in the case of positive religious coping) actual receipt of aggressive medical care at life’s end. Furthermore, religiousness and religious beliefs about care are more commonly endorsed among certain racial/ethnic groups, which may account for some of the observed racial/ethnic disparities in end-of-life care. (See <a class="local">'Religiousness and health care decision-making'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The available data support the view that palliative care patients with higher levels of spirituality have better quality of life and that supporting spiritual wellbeing is useful, especially as patients approach the end of life. Studies examining religiousness and its associations with patient quality of life are few, and they have not demonstrated consistent associations between positive religious coping and improved patient quality of life. By contrast, negative religious coping has been consistently found to be associated with decrements in patient quality of life. (See <a class="local">'Impact of spirituality/religion on quality-of-life outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The spiritual practices of caregivers and families can influence both patient and caregiver outcomes (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef104559" href="/d/graphic/104559.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Although the number of studies exploring spiritual domains and outcomes among caregivers is limited, the available data suggest that spirituality/religion plays an important role in caregiver wellbeing. Spiritual pain appears to be frequent among caregivers of patients with serious illness and is associated with poorer caregiver quality of life.

Specific spiritual interventions (eg, dignity therapy, meaning-based psychotherapy) demonstrate modest improvements in quality of life outcomes. Many studies of palliative care interventions have included a spiritual component as a key domain, with these studies variably demonstrating benefits to patient quality of life and care quality, though it is unclear to what degree the spiritual component of these interventions contributed to those outcomes. Finally, data informing mind-body interventions for patients are few and thus far have not consistently demonstrated benefits to patient wellbeing; whereas among caregivers, the available data suggest that mindfulness-based interventions have modest benefits to caregiver quality of life.
