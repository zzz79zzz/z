         Although metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is unlikely to be cured, meaningful improvements in survival have been seen, coincident with the introduction of newer systemic therapies [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. Median overall survival approaches two years, although this can range from a few months to many years, dependent on molecular subtype and treatments received [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. As greater knowledge is generated regarding the specific molecular alterations associated with individual breast cancers, it will be of paramount importance to distinguish the differences between the multitudes of prognostic factors likely expressed versus the few predictive factors that will help select specific therapy(s).
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic reviews prognostic and predictive factors for patients with MBC. A further discussion of prognostic and predictive factors utilized in primary breast cancer (for patients with non-metastatic disease) is covered separately. (See

         By definition, a
         <strong>
          prognostic
         </strong>
         factor is capable of providing information on clinical outcome at the time of diagnosis, or at various times during the patient’s course with metastatic disease, independent of therapy. Such markers are usually indicators of rate of growth, sites of invasion, and tumor burden [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. By contrast, a
         <strong>
          predictive
         </strong>
         factor is capable of providing information on the likelihood of response to a given therapeutic modality. Such markers are either within the target of the treatment, the surrounding stroma, or serve as modulators or epiphenomena related to expression and/or function of the target. Although they can be separately classified, several factors in breast cancer are both prognostic and predictive (eg, the presence of over-expression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2).

         The most useful prognostic factors are clinically based. While quantification of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) are also prognostic, their role in the clinical management of patients with MBC is not clear and requires further elucidation.

         Relapse-free interval of ≥2 years from primary breast cancer is more favorable than a shorter time to relapse [

         Patients with metastases involving the chest wall, bones, or lymph nodes may have prolonged progression-free survival (PFS), while those with hepatic and/or lymphangitic pulmonary disease tend to have shorter PFS and overall survival (OS) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8,11
         </a>
         ]. Patients with symptomatic lymphangitic lung metastases, bone marrow replacement with associated cytopenias, leptomeningeal carcinomatous, or significant liver metastases with associated liver dysfunction are described as having visceral crisis [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12

         Patients with hormone receptor positivity generally have a more favorable prognosis, and patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors for both estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) have significantly longer survival than single hormone receptor-positive tumors (ER-positive/PR-negative or ER-negative/PR-positive) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Patients with either human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression or triple (ER, PR, HER2)-negative MBC have a shorter median survival, in particular, in the era without targeted therapy (eg, anti-HER2 therapy) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,14,15
         </a>

         Other adverse prognostic features include significant weight loss, poor performance status (

         CTCs appear to be of prognostic value for patients with MBC. However, their role to guide management of these patients is not well defined. Therefore, we do not recommend routinely assessing for CTCs in these patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         The presence of CTCs (typically defined as ≥5/7.5 mL whole blood) in the peripheral blood of women with breast cancer has been associated with a poorer prognosis in patients with MBC (versus undetectable or &lt;5 cells/7.5 mL whole blood) [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18-25
         </a>
         ]. This was shown in a pooled analysis of over 1900 patients who participated in 1 of 20 studies in MBC, all of whom underwent quantification for CTCs [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. The main findings were as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Compared with patients without elevated CTCs, those with elevated CTCs at baseline (47 percent) had shortened PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.92, 95% CI 1.73-2.14) and OS (HR 2.78, 95% CI 2.42-3.19).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Patients with increasing CTCs three to five weeks after the start of a new line of therapy had worse PFS (HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.48-2.32) and OS (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.68-3.03) compared with those whose CTCs did not rise. A similar association between rising CTCs and survival outcomes was noted at weeks 6 to 8.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, the role of CTCs to guide treatment decisions for women with MBC was prospectively evaluated in the SWOG 0500 trial [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. For this trial, 595 women with MBC who underwent chemotherapy had evaluation for CTCs at baseline and then after one cycle. Women whose CTCs remained elevated after the first cycle of therapy were randomly assigned to either continue their initial treatment plan or to change of chemotherapy. The main findings of this trial are as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Of 126 women with persistently elevated CTCs after their first cycle of chemotherapy, changing to an alternate regimen had no difference in OS compared with continuation of the initial regimen (median 12.5 versus 10.7 months, respectively).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         There is an overall prognostic value of elevated CTCs. The median OS was 35, 23, and 13 months in those without a baseline elevation of CTCs, those who had a decline in their CTCs after the first cycle (but elevated CTCs at baseline), and those with persistently elevated CTCs, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In summary, these studies support the prognostic value of CTCs. However, their role in the monitoring of patients remains controversial. We agree with the 2015 American Society of Clinical Oncology expert panel update, which concluded that measurement of CTCs should not be used to influence treatment decisions in metastatic disease at this time [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27

         A significant proportion of MBC patients have fragments of tumor DNA that are potentially detectable and able to be analyzed circulating in blood. ctDNA assays at present, however, do not have a validated clinical role in breast cancer.

         Evidence suggests that early dynamic changes in ctDNA relative to treatment may predict PFS outcomes to

         <a href="#rid28">
          28

         ]. The investigators utilized plasma samples from baseline with detectable phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (
         <em>
          PIK3CA
         </em>
         ) mutation in ctDNA with matched plasma samples after two weeks of treatment and found a quantitative amount above the median on palbociclib, and fulvestrant had an inferior PFS compared with those below the median on day 15 (HR 3.94, 95% CI 1.61-9.64). A separate study suggests that patients with high levels in both ctDNA and CTCs have a more than 17-fold increase in risk of death compared with patients with low levels of each [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25

         While the Oncotype Dx 21-gene recurrence score (RS) and Predictor Analysis of Microarray 50 (PAM50) intrinsic subtype have an established prognostic and predictive role in non-metastatic breast cancer, early evidence suggests that they may be useful in the metastatic disease as well. However, we await further data before recommending their use in this setting, particularly to address if there is any predictive capacity to the assays in selection of optimal therapy for MBC. Use in non-metastatic breast cancer is discussed elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/782.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In a retrospective analysis of 821 tumor samples from postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive MBC, intrinsic subtype as determined by the PAM50 assay was the strongest prognostic factor, with a luminal A subtype correlating with improved progression-free and overall survival (OS) relative to other subtypes [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. Progression-free and overall survival were as follows, respectively, according to subtype: luminal A, 16.9 and 45 months; luminal B, 11 and 37 months; HER2-enriched, 4.7 and 16 months; and basal-like, 4.1 and 23 months.
        </p>
        <p>
         Similarly, the Recurrence Score (RS by Oncotype DX) has shown promising results in the metastatic setting, though prospective randomized data are still needed [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. In a registry study of 101 MBC patients, RS was associated with time to tumor progression and OS, and on multivariate analysis was independently prognostic for these outcomes among the 69 patients who had hormone-positive, HER2-negative disease.

         An attempt should be made to biopsy the tumor of all patients with MBC in order to re-examine the status of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Data suggest that discordance of these markers between the primary and MBC may be clinically meaningful, with discordance rates of approximately 13 and 30 percent for ER and PR, respectively, and ranging from 3 to 5 percent for HER2 [

         Understanding the molecular drivers of cancer progression and metastases is an area of ongoing and active research, predominantly driven by the goal of identifying specific genomic aberrations that may ultimately result in individualized cancer treatment. In addition to likely providing prognostic information, the value of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify and predict candidates for specific mutation-driven treatment holds promise but is not yet ready for routine clinical use.

         Various platforms for NGS of breast cancers are now commercially available. However, the clinician should be clear why the test might be ordered. There are several potential reasons:

         Another example includes the METABRIC study, which produced an integrated analysis of copy number and gene expression using profiles from 2000 breast tumors [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. The study discovered 10 novel subgroups (integrated clusters) with individual prognostic effect. However, as the samples were predominantly of early-stage breast tumors, it is not clear whether there is the same prognostic capacity in the metastatic setting. Furthermore, the ability to tailor individual treatments (in either early or advanced stage) with associated improved outcomes was not assessed in the study.
        </p>
        <p>
         Trials suggest that the use of molecularly targeted agents outside their indications does not necessarily improve outcomes relative to standard of care in heavily pretreated patients with breast cancer. One trial, known as the SAFIR01 trial, aimed to define the proportion of patients in which a targeted therapy could be offered based on the results of the genomic analyses [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. This trial enrolled 423 patients with MBC, in which biopsies were obtainable in 407. A defined and targetable genomic alteration was identified in 195 (46 percent) patients. However, only 55 patients (13 percent) received personalized therapy on the basis of genomic analyses; of these patients, four had an objective response, and an additional nine patients had no evidence of disease progression for 16 weeks or longer.
        </p>
        <p>
         Similarly, in the randomized phase II SHIVA trial, among 741 patients with cancer, 293 had a targetable molecular alteration, and 195 were randomly assigned to a molecularly targeted agent or treatment at clinician's choice [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. Of these, 40 patients had breast cancer. Among all treated patients, the median PFS was 2.3 months with targeted therapy and 2.0 months in the control group.
        </p>
        <p>
         Taken together, these data suggest that actionable alterations can be identified in a proportion of metastatic breast cancers. However, further evaluation on the predictive ability of these NGS findings is required before they are used in routine clinical practice. In addition, we do not recommend that NGS evaluation be part of standard of care at this time because there is little or no evidence that just because a targeted therapy works in one cancer that it will work in the same manner in another, even if the molecular target is present in both tumor types.
        </p>
        <p>
         An expert panel has produced a guidance document to rank DNA alterations into tiers of evidence for clinical utility for selecting breast cancer patients for targeted therapies according to ESCAT [

         Although metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is unlikely to be cured, meaningful improvements in survival have been seen, coincident with the introduction of newer systemic therapies. Median overall survival (OS) approaches two years, although this can range from a few months to many years. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'
         </a>
         above.)

         Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) have predictive value for patients with MBC. Because the expression of these receptors may differ between metastatic and primary breast cancer, a repeat biopsy should be obtained in women with MBC. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Tests done on metastatic tissue'
         </a>

         Tumor markers, including CA 15-3 and CA 27.29, can sometimes correlate with clinical or radiologically defined disease burden. In other patients, they may be useful markers of disease when conventional clinical examination and radiological monitoring is either difficult or infrequent. While prognostic, they do not hold predictive value for selection of and response to treatment. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Serum tumor markers'
         </a>
         above.)

         The presence and serial rise of circulating tumor cells (CTCs, typically defined as ≥5/7.5 mL whole blood) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the peripheral blood of women with breast cancer has been associated with a poorer prognosis in patients with MBC. However at present, measurement of CTCs or ctDNA should not be used to influence treatment decisions in metastatic disease. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Circulating tumor cells'
         </a>
         above.)

         Understanding the molecular drivers of cancer progression and metastases is an area of ongoing and active research. While possibly prognostic, the value of next-generation sequencing to predict candidates for specific mutation-driven treatment is not yet ready for routine clinical use (see
         <a class="local">
          'Next-generation sequencing of breast tumors'
         </a>
         above). They should only be considered and used for enrollment onto clinical research trials and programs.
