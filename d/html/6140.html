         Growth impairment is a common problem in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Several factors may contribute, including inadequate nutrition, metabolic acidosis, renal osteodystrophy, and insensitivity to the action of growth hormone (GH) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Management to prevent and correct growth impairment due to CKD includes supportive measures that correct amenable complications of CKD (eg, poor nutrition and metabolic acidosis) and kidney replacement therapy (KRT), particularly kidney transplantation. However, despite these interventions, poor growth persists in a significant proportion of children with CKD, including kidney allograft recipients. In children who have persistent growth impairment,

         therapy (rhGH) is an effective and well-tolerated intervention that improves growth.

        <p>
         The use of rhGH in children with CKD, including efficacy, indications, and dosing will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, risk factors, evaluation, and overall management of growth impairment in children with CKD are discussed separately. (See

         Experimental and clinical evidence demonstrate that growth hormone (GH) insensitivity associated with CKD can be overcome by supraphysiologic doses of exogenous GH [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8-11
         </a>
         ]. The administration of exogenous pharmacologic doses of GH results in increased circulating levels of total and free insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) as the relative increase in IGF-1 production is greater than the increase in inhibitory IGF-binding proteins, which raises the rate of longitudinal growth.

         Limited data from patients with CKD also suggest that GH therapy improved bone metabolism. In a small study of 10 prepubertal patients with CKD,

         (rhGH) therapy in children with CKD is "normalization" of final height. There is some debate concerning how this goal is defined. The most commonly used definitions are either:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>

         <a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13422.html" rel="external">
          calculator 4

         Attainment of a normal population-related final height (ie, &gt;3
         <sup>
          rd

         percentile or a Z-score &gt;-1.88)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the former goal is certainly desirable for the individual patient, the latter approach may be economically more acceptable in view of the high cost of rhGH therapy. In our practice, the minimal therapeutic goal is a height greater than the third percentile of the general population.

         It is important to monitor the growth of all children with CKD. When there is a reduction of growth velocity below normal values based on age and sex, an evaluation should be performed to identify and correct any amenable risk factors that contribute to growth impairment, such as inadequate nutrition or metabolic acidosis [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2

          Persistent growth impairment
         </strong>
         – This is generally defined as growth delay that persists for &gt;3 months in infants and &gt;6 months in older children. As discussed below, different thresholds are used to define growth impairment for this criterion. We generally prefer early initiation of therapy (ie, when the child's height for age is between the 3

         and 10

         The optimal timing for starting rhGH therapy is uncertain. In particular, there is debate as to whether therapy should be started at an early stage when the child first shows signs of growth delay or if it should be used only once the child meets strict criteria for growth failure. In general, beginning treatment at a younger age (before six years of age) and early in the course of CKD leads to a better response to rhGH, which is more likely to result in normal or near-normal adult height.
        </p>
        <p>
         We generally prefer a liberal approach, initiating rhGH when the child’s height for age is between the 3

         ]. In addition, there is some evidence that the practice of starting rhGH at an earlier stage might be more cost-effective than initiating rhGH therapy at an older age, when growth failure has become evident and higher absolute rhGH doses are required to account for the higher body weight [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Support for this approach is based on data from the North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies (NAPRTCS) and clinical trials that demonstrated children who meet the definition of growth failure (height Z-score &lt;-1.88) before starting rhGH did not achieve sufficient catch-up growth to obtain normal adult height [

         Although it might be assumed that most children with CKD who are shorter than their peers wish to be taller, the advantages and disadvantages of rhGH therapy must be discussed with the patient and their family/caregivers. In addition to reviewing the benefits and potential side effects of rhGH as outlined in this topic, counseling should include a frank discussion of the burdens of receiving daily subcutaneous injections for many years. These considerations are of particular importance for immobilized patients and those with syndromic kidney diseases [
         <a href="#rid13">

         The recommended dose of rhGH for children with CKD is 0.045 to 0.05 mg/kg body weight per day given once daily (typically in the evening) via subcutaneous injection. This corresponds to a daily dose of approximately 4 international units (IU) per m

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In a meta-analysis of three clinical trials (150 children), a rhGH dose of 4 IU per m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         per day resulted in better growth velocity compared with a lower dose of 2 IU per m
         <sup>

         per day (mean difference of 1.18 cm per year) [

        <p>
         The dose of rhGH used for treating children with CKD-related growth failure is greater than what is typically used for treating children with GH deficiency. This is consistent with the current understanding that CKD causes GH insensitivity. As a result, children with CKD require a higher therapeutic dose rather than simply replacement dosing as is used in children with GH deficiency. (See

         Based on the available data, treatment-associated adverse events are rare in children with CKD receiving rhGH therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a study from the North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies (NAPRTCS) registry, the frequency of rhGH-related adverse events over a 6.5-year period was evaluated in 2333 patients who had current or prior use of rhGH therapy compared with 8533 patients who never received rhGH [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. There were no differences between the two groups in the incidence of malignancy, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, avascular necrosis, glucose intolerance, pancreatitis, progressive deterioration of kidney function, acute allograft rejection, or fluid retention. The incidence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension was similar in both groups (0.2 versus 0.1 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         In an observational study of 1670 children with a variety of kidney diseases, there were 15 cases (0.9 percent) of intracranial hypertension [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19

         ]. However, all 15 children were using other medications that could predispose to intracranial hypertension.

         In a retrospective subsequent study from NAPRTCS, there did not appear to be an increased risk of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease in children who received rhGH during dialysis or post-transplant [

         Most patients treated with rhGH therapy maintain normal glucose tolerance; however, there are rare reports of development of T2DM in children with CKD that appeared to be temporally related to starting rhGH therapy [

         Measurement of total IGF-I levels is not informative in children with CKD because free IGF-1 levels decrease with decreasing glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This issue is discussed in greater detail separately. (See

         The optimal duration of rhGH remains uncertain. Although clinical studies have shown that the growth response is greatest in the first two years of therapy, growth velocity is persistently greater than baseline in years three through five of therapy.

         The efficacy of rhGH is supported by randomized clinical trials and observational studies showing that rhGH improves growth parameters in children with CKD [

         In a meta-analysis of seven trials including 287 children with CKD, rhGH therapy improved height velocity compared with placebo (mean difference +3.9 cm over first year, 95% CI 3.3-4.4 cm) [

          Catch0up growth

         – Based on the available data, rhGH appears to be associated with catch-up growth in children with CKD in all three subcategories, including patients who have not initiated KRT, those on dialysis, and kidney transplant recipients [
         <a href="#rid16">

Of the 134 allograft recipients who received rhGH therapy, 25 percent achieved catch-up growth. In all groups, the highest catch-up growth was seen in patients who were prepubertal (defined as Tanner stage I or II) prior to initiating treatment.

          Growth during puberty
         </strong>
         – Data are limited on the effect of rhGH during puberty in patients with CKD. Addressing this question is challenging since several factors impact the pubertal growth spurt in patients with CKD. In general, the pubertal growth spurt occurs later and is considerably shorter in patients with CKD compared with children without CKD [

         Although the response to rhGH is reduced compared with that seen in children with CKD that do not require KRT, rhGH still is beneficial in patients undergoing dialysis treatment [

          39,41,42

         Observational studies of children undergoing dialysis reported a mean increase of growth velocity of 2.6 to 3.5 cm per year during the first year of administration of rhGH over the baseline rate before the initiation of therapy [

         Successful kidney transplantation reverses the uremic milieu and should theoretically permit normal growth hormone (GH) secretion and function [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. Persistent growth failure in this setting is primarily a result of reduced graft function and glucocorticoid therapy. If catch-up growth cannot be achieved by using a glucocorticoid-sparing regimen, we suggest initiating rhGH therapy, particularly in children with suboptimal graft function (GFR &lt;50 mL/min per 1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         ), in whom spontaneous catch-up growth is unlikely to occur [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48,49
         </a>
         ]. rhGH is usually prescribed only after the first year post-transplant, because spontaneous growth should be monitored for at least 12 months after kidney transplantation. Of note, rhGH is not approved for use in pediatric kidney allograft recipients by European or North American drug regulatory agencies.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials including 401 pediatric kidney transplant recipients, children receiving rhGH therapy had higher growth velocity compared with the control group after one year (mean standardized height difference of 0.68, 95% CI 0.25-1.11) [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>
         ]. The mean difference in growth expressed as change in height Z-score between the rhGH and control groups was 0.52 (95% CI 0.37-0.68). There was no apparent between-group difference in rates of rejection rate between the two groups (17 versus 10 percent, risk ratio 1.56, 95% CI 0.97-2.53). The study did not detect a difference in GFR between the two groups.
        </p>
        <p>
         Additional evidence supporting the benefit of rhGH in growth-delayed kidney allograft recipients was provided by a retrospective NAPRTCS study that compared the outcome of 513 pediatric kidney allograft recipients who received rhGH with 2263 transplant patients who were not treated with rhGH [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. The rhGH-treated group had improved growth with a mean cumulative increase in height of 3.6 cm over five years compared with controls, which resulted in higher mean final adult height Z-scores (-1.8 versus -2.6).
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Although there had been concerns about a possible link between rhGH and an increase in the risk of acute rejection [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         An important limitation of the available data is that most studies were conducted in an earlier era when transplant recipients commonly received immunosuppressive regimens that included glucocorticoids. Thus, the findings in these studies may not be generalizable to the contemporary era wherein glucocorticoid-sparing regimens are generally preferred for posttransplant immunosuppression. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6128.html" rel="external">

         Taken together, these data suggest that rhGH is effective and safe for use in growth-delayed pediatric kidney allograft recipients despite the lack of approval by drug regulatory agencies in this population.

          Rationale for treatment
         </strong>
         – Growth impairment is a common problem in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although the mechanisms underlying growth impairment are not completely understood, clinical and experimental evidence demonstrate that disturbances of growth hormone (GH) metabolism and its main mediator, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) play key roles.

         (rhGH) therapy is to attain normal or near-normal adult height as expected for the child's genetic height potential (based on midparental height). The minimal therapeutic aim should be a height &gt;3

          Criteria for starting therapy
         </strong>
         – We recommend rhGH in children with CKD who meet
         <strong>
          all
         </strong>
         of the following criteria (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">

         </span>
         The child has persistent growth impairment (ie, persisting for &gt;3 months in infants and &gt;6 months in older children). Different thresholds are used to define growth impairment for this criterion, as discussed below.

         All other modifiable factors for growth impairment have been addressed, including inadequate nutrition, metabolic acidosis, fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, and osteodystrophy. (See

         <strong>
          Timing
         </strong>
         – We suggest starting rhGH at an early stage (ie, when the child’s height for age is between the 3
         <sup>
          rd
         </sup>
         and 10
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         percentiles or height velocity is &lt;25
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         percentile) rather than waiting until the child meets formal definitions of short stature or growth failure (ie, height or height velocity for age &lt;3
         <sup>
          rd
         </sup>
         percentile) (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). In general, intervention at a younger age (before six years of age) and early in the course of CKD leads to a better response to rhGH, which is more likely to result in a normal or near-normal adult height. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Dosing
         </strong>
         – For treatment of CKD-related growth impairment, rhGH therapy is given at an initial daily dose of 0.045 to 0.05 mg/kg via subcutaneous injection once daily, typically in the evening. The dose should be readjusted every three to four months to account for weight gain. (See

         <strong>
          Monitoring
         </strong>

          Treatment response

         – An adequate growth response is defined as a growth velocity that is &gt;2 cm/year over the baseline rate prior to rhGH therapy. In patients who fail to have an adequate response, evaluation consists of assessments of patient compliance, correct dosing, and whether there are contributing factors to growth impairment. (See
