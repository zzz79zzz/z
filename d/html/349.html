Treatment, prognosis, and disposition are largely determined by the size and location of all the partial and full thickness burns. Differentiating between superficial (first-degree)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55928" href="/d/graphic/55928.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86904" href="/d/graphic/86904.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) and partial-thickness (second-degree) burns  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75398" href="/d/graphic/75398.html" rel="external">picture 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef126232" href="/d/graphic/126232.html" rel="external">picture 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57851" href="/d/graphic/57851.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>) is a key part of the evaluation.</p><p>The major metabolic derangements associated with severe burns rarely occur with minor burns. However, it is important for clinicians treating burns to be able to classify them accurately in order to ensure appropriate therapy. Accurate classification is not always possible initially and may require up to three weeks [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>].</p><p>The classification of burns, including burn depth and size, is discussed in detail separately. Note that the traditional classification of burns as first (superficial thickness), second (partial thickness), or third degree (full thickness) has been replaced by a system reflecting the need for surgical intervention (although some United States insurance companies still require mention of the traditional scheme). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/819.html" rel="external">"Assessment and classification of burn injury", section on 'Classification by depth'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/819.html" rel="external">"Assessment and classification of burn injury", section on 'Extent of burn injury'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Criteria for minor burns and specialty referral</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Minor burns are defined by the American Burn Association as follows: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Partial-thickness burns &lt;10 percent TBSA in patients 10 to 50 years old</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Partial-thickness burns &lt;5 percent TBSA in patients under 10 or over 50 years old</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Full-thickness burns &lt;2 percent TBSA in any patient without other injury</p><p></p><p>To be considered minor, burns must also generally meet the following criteria:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Isolated injury (ie, no suspicion of inhalation or high-voltage injury) </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Does not involve face, hands, perineum, or feet </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Does not cross major joints</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is not circumferential</p><p></p><p>A more in-depth description of burn classification is described in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57124" href="/d/graphic/57124.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1294022907"><span class="h3">Hand and foot burns</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hand and foot burns are generally not considered minor because inadequate management can result in serious disability. However, not all hand or foot burns are equal, and it is prudent to discuss with a burn specialist whether particular burns can be managed as an outpatient or should be transferred. Most clinicians err on the side of caution when treating hand burns, and refer them to a burn center if there is any doubt about the severity of the injury  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74855" href="/d/graphic/74855.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). Aggressive therapy, including early range of motion exercises, stretching, and referral to a knowledgeable occupational therapist, may be needed. If initially thought to be minor, hand burns can be treated in an outpatient setting, provided careful follow-up is arranged to look for signs of infection or conversion to a deeper burn. (See <a class="local">'Follow-up care'</a> below.) </p><p>Typically, most isolated, partial-thickness burns of the hands or feet can be treated as outpatients and do not require transfer. Debridement, education about proper wound care, and follow up within a week at a burn center are usually sufficient. Joint involvement alone also does not necessarily constitute a severe injury. Immediate transfer to a burn center is necessary if full-thickness burns are present AND motion is impaired or there is concern for compartment syndrome or similar injury (eg, full-thickness circumferential wounds or need for escharotomies). Intangible factors such as pain control, resource availability, and ability to perform dressings at home must be considered when deciding on the appropriate disposition for a burn patient.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H840124335"><span class="h3">Patients with comorbidities</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Burns classified as minor but sustained by patients with comorbid illness that may increase risks of complications, such as diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, immunosuppression, delayed presentation with cellulitis, and patients at extremes of age (&lt;5 years old and &gt;60 years old) should be followed more closely and may warrant referral to a burn center.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1449132465"><span class="h2">Burns suspicious for physical abuse</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Burns that are characterized as minor may have resulted from inflicted on vulnerable patients, particularly children.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/103420.html" rel="external">"Physical child abuse: Recognition", section on 'Intentional burns'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3007.html" rel="external">"Elder abuse, self-neglect, and related phenomena", section on 'Risk factors'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">TREATMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Initial treatment of isolated, minor thermal injuries consists mainly of removing clothing and debris, cooling, simple cleansing, appropriate skin dressing, pain management and tetanus prophylaxis. Management is described in detail below.</p><p>Clinicians should consider possible associated injuries (eg, internal injury, inhalational toxins such as carbon monoxide) before assuming that trauma is minor.  </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1479760"><span class="h2">Cooling</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>After any clothing, jewelry (eg, rings), and nonadherent debris is removed, burn wounds can be cooled with room-temperature or cool tap water to provide some pain relief and limit tissue injury. Cool running or still water is applied until pain diminishes but should not be applied for longer than approximately five minutes to avoid macerating the wound. Alternatively, the wound may be covered with wet gauze or towels, which can decrease pain without immersing the wound and may be kept on the wound for as long as 30 minutes, until dressings are applied.</p><p>Direct application of ice or iced water should be avoided as this can increase pain and burn depth. Applying water or saline-soaked gauze, cooled to around 12°C (55°F), is one effective means of cooling [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. In the clinic, this can be done by mixing one part refrigerated <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> with one part room temperature saline. Patients, particularly small children, should be carefully monitored for hypothermia when cooling burns that cover more than 10 percent of the total body surface area (TBSA) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1924985624"><span class="h2">Pain management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For small burn injuries, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alone or in combination with opioids, are often sufficient for analgesia [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Analgesia for children with significant or painful burns is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14989.html" rel="external">"Management of burn wound pain and itching"</a>.)</p><p>Initially, analgesics should be administered around the clock, giving additional "rescue" medication before dressing changes and increased physical activity [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. Elevation of lower and upper extremity burns above the level of the heart can reduce pain and swelling for several days following the injury. Applying gauze soaked in cool water to a wound for up to 30 minutes is a suitable technique for reducing pain soon after the burn is sustained.</p><p>Pain management needs usually decline markedly once wound epithelization has occurred. However, analgesia requirements can actually increase if rescue medications are inadequate. Patients with larger or recently sustained burns can present with significant pain and may require intravenous (IV) opioids for initial analgesia.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Cleaning</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Burn wounds should be cleaned. Although some clinicians use skin disinfectants (eg, povidone-iodine), these cleansers can inhibit the healing process and we discourage using them. [<a href="#rid9">9</a>] Instead, we suggest washing minor burn wounds using only mild soap and tap water, an approach supported by a growing number of burn centers [<a href="#rid3">3,4,10-12</a>]. Patients should be instructed to wash their burns daily with mild soap and water during dressing changes. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9244" href="/d/drug information/9244.html" rel="external">Chlorhexidine</a> wash (without alcohol) is also effective for cleaning burn wounds.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Debridement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Sloughed or necrotic skin, including <strong>ruptured</strong> blisters, should be debrided before applying a dressing  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102887" href="/d/graphic/102887.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>). Necrotic blister skin remnants may increase the risk of infection and limit the contact of topical antimicrobial agents to the burn wound. Extensive debridement is rarely necessary and may often be deferred until the initial follow-up visit (see <a class="local">'Follow-up care'</a> below). This additional time enables the clinician to assess the full extent of the injury more accurately and allows the patient to overcome the anxiety and pain associated with the immediate injury. Wound debridement for superficial and deep burns is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/114176.html" rel="external">"Treatment of superficial burns requiring hospital admission", section on 'Cleansing and debridement'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/114178.html" rel="external">"Treatment of deep burns"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Blisters</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Blisters may develop with superficial or deep partial-thickness burns. Ruptured blisters should be debrided (ie, remove the entire blister and all loose skin so that no necrotic epidermis remains). However, small intact blisters &lt;2 cm in diameter may be left alone.</p><p>In general, we believe needle aspiration of intact blisters should be avoided, as this increases the risk of infection. However, the management of clean, intact burn blisters remains a subject of debate. The management of burn blisters is reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/114176.html" rel="external">"Treatment of superficial burns requiring hospital admission", section on 'Burn blisters'</a>.)</p><p>Blisters lasting for several weeks without resorption indicate a possible underlying deep partial- or full-thickness burn, necessitating referral to a burn center or surgeon with expertise managing burns [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Chemoprophylaxis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Significant burn wound surfaces are prone to rapid bacterial colonization with the potential for invasive infection. However, superficial burns (eg, sunburns) and superficial partial-thickness burns rarely develop such infections and do <strong>not</strong> require a topical antimicrobial agent [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Application of non-perfumed moisturizing cream is typically all that is required for superficial burns. A topical antibiotic should only be applied to partial- or full-thickness burns. Systemic prophylactic antibiotics are <strong>not</strong> indicated to prevent infection in patients with any acute burn, regardless of size or location [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6624.html" rel="external">"Sunburn", section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p>Some clinicians choose to apply aloe vera or a basic topical antibiotic such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9052" href="/d/drug information/9052.html" rel="external">bacitracin</a> to superficial burns. Both are inexpensive, and aloe vera provides some antibacterial activity, but there is no clear evidence demonstrating improved outcomes in superficial burns with such treatment. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9890" href="/d/drug information/9890.html" rel="external">Silver sulfadiazine</a> (SSD) has been commonly used for prophylaxis against infection for more extensive partial-thickness burns; however, treatment with SSD may slow wound healing and increase the frequency of dressing changes, resulting in increased pain. Modern hydrocolloid and silver impregnated dressings may be superior to SSD, while honey, an ancient wound remedy, also appears to be an effective treatment [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>]. Topical antibiotics are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13509.html" rel="external">"Topical agents and dressings for local burn wound care", section on 'Antimicrobial agents'</a>.)</p><p>There is <strong>no</strong> role for topical steroids in the initial treatment of minor burns, as this may increase the risk of infection and impair healing.</p><p>Tetanus immunization should be updated, particularly for any burns deeper than superficial-thickness. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9983" href="/d/drug information/9983.html" rel="external">Tetanus immune globulin</a> should be given to patients who have not received a complete primary immunization [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3897.html" rel="external">"Tetanus-diphtheria toxoid vaccination in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Dressings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Superficial burns do not require dressings. Although partial- and full-thickness burns are generally dressed, some relatively minor burns may be treated without dressings. As an example, it is often preferable to manage smaller burns of the face or hand (not involving fingers) without dressings; treatment consists of gentle cleansing with a mild soap followed by the application of a topical agent two to three times per day. (See <a class="local">'Chemoprophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p>This approach may improve the appearance of facial burns and helps to prevent joint stiffness with hand burns by allowing for range of motion exercises. However, this approach may be impractical for infants, children, young active adults, and those at risk for wound contamination [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Burns involving fingers or toes should be dressed appropriately.</p><p>Burn debridement and dressing changes are painful procedures, and adequate pain control is essential. In an acute, hospital setting, administration of oral or IV opioids, and possibly sedation or dissociative agents, may be needed. The amount of IV medication needed for analgesia is an appropriate consideration for patient disposition. As an example, if 200 mcg of IV <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8441" href="/d/drug information/8441.html" rel="external">fentanyl</a> are needed to perform a dressing change in the emergency department (ED), the patient cannot be expected to perform a similar dressing changes at home with only oral medications. In such cases, transfer to a burn unit is indicated.</p><p>For outpatients, nonnarcotic pain control is preferred and should be optimized using scheduled, alternating doses of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8547" href="/d/drug information/8547.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a>, as long as contraindications are not present. If absolutely necessary, a narcotic agent, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9729" href="/d/drug information/9729.html" rel="external">oxycodone</a>, may be used if needed every four to six hours. We suggest the patient take pain medications at least 30 minutes prior to any dressing change to optimize pain control.</p><p>For burns requiring dressings, there are several options:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h3">Basic dressing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Particularly for emergency treatment, a basic gauze dressing provides adequate burn coverage. It is placed after the application of topical antibiotic and consists of a first layer of nonadherent gauze (eg, Adaptic or Xeroform) placed over the burn, a second layer of fluffed dry gauze, and an outer layer of an elastic gauze roll (eg, Kerlix). Care should be taken to individually wrap and separate with fluffed gauze all toes or fingers to prevent adherence and maceration. The following video clips show a basic burn dressing being applied in the operating room  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef86906" href="/d/graphic/86906.html" rel="external">movie 1</a>). In patients with less severe burns that are dressed in an outpatient setting, and who are not being treated with IV analgesics, cleaning is performed more gently and splints are generally not needed.</p><p>Some patients with minor burns may need to be transferred to a burn center for reevaluation and treatment. In such cases, all burns should be dressed in <strong>dry, nonstick gauze only</strong>. Dry gauze is preferred for several reasons. First, properly dressing a moderate-sized wound takes time, resources, and knowledge on the part of the referring hospital staff. Moreover, once the patient arrives at the burn center, dressings are immediately removed. Thus, application of ointments or creams delays definitive wound care without benefit, as these must be washed off to assess the wound. </p><p>Dry gauze is the simplest, fastest, and most economical way to dress an acute burn wound in a patient being transferred. Moist gauze dressings increase the likelihood of hypothermia, macerate wounds, and subsequently increase burn depth. When in doubt, or if there will be a significant delay before transfer, a discussion should be held with the accepting burn center about what dressings they would like placed. The key in transferring a burn patient is to keep their body warm and prevent unnecessary delays.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Biologic and synthetic dressings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although generally not used in the ED or primary care clinic, biologic and synthetic dressings can be used to treat partial-thickness burns. Their use in both adults and children reduces the frequency of dressing changes and may reduce pain, help prevent infection, and promote healing [<a href="#rid21">21-23</a>]. The different types of biologic and synthetic dressings used for temporary coverage are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13509.html" rel="external">"Topical agents and dressings for local burn wound care", section on 'Temporary burn wound coverage'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13509.html" rel="external">"Topical agents and dressings for local burn wound care", section on 'Dressings'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h3">Dressing changes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Recommended frequencies for dressing changes depend on the type of dressing used and range from twice daily to weekly [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]; no firm recommendations can be made due to the paucity of literature on this subject. However, topical antibiotic ointment and nonadherent gauze dressings should be changed once daily. A small study in a pediatric burn unit reported that once-daily dressing changes resulted in less need for pain medication with no increase in morbidity [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. It appears best to change dressings whenever they become soaked with excessive exudate or other fluids [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Topical antibiotics and desiccated fluid should be removed gently during dressing changes. Carefully soaking the dressing with cool water prior to removal may decrease pain (and make removal easier if the dressing is dry and stuck to the wound); scrubbing and sharp debridement are <strong>not</strong> necessary and may hinder healing [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Once epithelialization occurs, a nonperfumed moisturizing cream (eg, Vaseline Intensive Care, Eucerin, Nivea, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10213" href="/d/drug information/10213.html" rel="external">mineral oil</a>, or cocoa butter) should be applied to the wound until natural lubricating mechanisms return [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Avoid cosmetic preparations with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="101844" href="/d/drug information/101844.html" rel="external">lanolin</a> as well as thick waxes and ointments as these can irritate the skin [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Hypoallergenic lanolin preparations appear to be an acceptable option [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h2">Pruritus</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Itching is a common problem during the healing process. The causes of pruritus are multifactorial. It is often triggered or worsened by environmental extremes (especially heat), physical activity, and stress. Pruritus usually diminishes gradually and stops after complete wound healing of superficial burns. Until then, a variety of approaches can control itching. Systemic antihistamines (eg, oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9369" href="/d/drug information/9369.html" rel="external">diphenhydramine</a>) are standard first-line therapy, but a number of topical agents, including bicarbonate of soda baths and moisturizing lotions, can also be used. Topical agents high in <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="101844" href="/d/drug information/101844.html" rel="external">lanolin</a> should be avoided. Many patients prefer loose, soft cotton clothing. The management of burn-related pruritus is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14989.html" rel="external">"Management of burn wound pain and itching", section on 'Treatment of pruritus'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H74626788"><span class="h2">Oral burns</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Oral burns may occur from ingesting very hot liquids or solids, by inhalation of hot vapors or liquids, or by holding flammable/corrosive objects in the mouth  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103125" href="/d/graphic/103125.html" rel="external">picture 7</a>). Food heated in a microwave or nearly boiling liquids are often implicated, with tea, cheese, potatoes, and noodles among the most common sources. While little has been published regarding the management of patients affected by oral burns, proper management should include cooling with water and monitoring for evidence of airway compromise. Treatment for minor burns along the lips and oral commissure includes topical antibiotic ointment and intermittent application of Vaseline to keep the lips from drying out.</p><p>Burns involving the oral commissure are more complex, and scarring can lead to more significant and debilitating complications, such as the development of microstomia. If there is any question about the depth of a burn involving the oral commissure, consultation with a burn specialist should be obtained. Electrical injuries to the oral commissure, such as those created by biting an electrical cord, can be severe, may cause labial artery bleeding, and require transfer to a burn center.</p><p>Minor oral mucosal burns typically require no specific treatment other than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> rinses and basic oral hygiene. Alcohol-based mouth rinses should be avoided as they can irritate wounds and increase pain.</p><p>Several case reports describe epiglottitis caused by thermal injury after an oral scald burn [<a href="#rid26">26-31</a>]. Close attention should be paid to young children with oral scald burns as their airway structures are narrower and are more prone to obstruction with smaller degrees of inflammation and swelling. If there is any concern for airway compromise or about the extent of injury, the patient is best evaluated in the ED, where a more in-depth inspection of the epiglottis and airway can be performed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6080.html" rel="external">"Epiglottitis (supraglottitis): Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1748791"><span class="h2">Disposition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Minor burns are generally treated on an outpatient basis, but there are exceptions. As an example, a partial-thickness burn involving the entire circumference of an arm (&lt;10 percent TBSA) can pose a significant care challenge for some patients depending on their resources and social circumstances. Some patients may not tolerate debridement in an outpatient clinic and require admission to a burn unit for wound care and pain management. A clinician may elect to treat as an inpatient a patient with burns that meet all the minor burn criteria listed above if there are concerns about the patient's ability to tolerate dressing changes or debridement, or such issues as physical abuse, reliability, adequate follow-up, or comorbid disease (eg, diabetes). Ultimately, clinician judgment is the most important arbiter of patient disposition. (See <a class="local">'Classification'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/114176.html" rel="external">"Treatment of superficial burns requiring hospital admission"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h1">FOLLOW-UP CARE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Follow-up care involves surveying for signs of infection, increasing depth of the burn, and scarring. Patients with an infected wound should be hospitalized to minimize the risk of sepsis or extension of the burn. Scarring and contracture can result in long-term disfigurement and disability, both of which are indications for specialized care. Any questionable (eg, slow to heal) or complex burn wounds should be referred to a local burn center for further evaluation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h2">Timing of visits</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinician should examine the patient the day after injury to adjust pain medications and to assess the patient's competence performing dressing changes. Subsequent follow-up can then be done on a weekly basis until wound epithelialization occurs. Epithelialization consists of tiny opalescent islands of epithelium throughout the wound  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102891" href="/d/graphic/102891.html" rel="external">picture 8</a>). Complete healing usually follows in two to three weeks [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. If these islands are not seen by 7 to 10 days or it is taking more than a total of three weeks to heal, then the burn may be deeper than initially suspected, and the patient should be referred to a burn center. A deep partial-thickness burn at different stages of healing, including epithelialization, is shown in the following photographs  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86903" href="/d/graphic/86903.html" rel="external">picture 9</a>). </p><p>If the clinician harbors any concern that pain control may be insufficient or the patient or their family may not be able to provide adequate care, then it is best to perform daily assessments of the wound until epithelialization is complete [<a href="#rid3">3,13</a>]. More frequent follow-up, particularly during the first week after the injury, is usually necessary if biologic or synthetic dressings are used.</p><p>After epithelialization, follow-up visits are conducted every four to six weeks to look for any evidence of hypertrophic scar formation and to monitor the patient's overall well-being. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/95111.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic scarring and keloids following burn injuries", section on 'Pathologic versus typical scarring'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h2">Diagnosis and management of infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Diagnosing infection in burn patients is challenging. Fortunately, the incidence of infections among ambulatory patients with partial-thickness or superficial burns is low [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Burns themselves elicit inflammation, resulting in mild erythema, edema, pain, and tenderness. Typically, a rim of hyperemia is present on all burn wounds  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103630" href="/d/graphic/103630.html" rel="external">picture 10</a>); however, if this rim extends more than 2 cm beyond the border of the burn, cellulitis is likely  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103632" href="/d/graphic/103632.html" rel="external">picture 11</a>). In addition, burn wound hyperemia normally follows the exact borders of the wound, whereas cellulitis is more confluent, with less distinct borders. Infection should also be suspected if these signs occur in association with increased pain, lymphangitis, fever, purulent discharge, or malaise and anorexia [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. </p><p>Infection can extend the depth and extent of a burn, converting a superficial partial-thickness burn into a deep partial-thickness burn or even a full-thickness burn. In addition, burn infections are more susceptible to blood invasion and sepsis. Because of these risks, all infections of suspected partial or full-thickness burns warrant aggressive management including hospital admission and parenteral antibiotics [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>Superficial cultures of the burn wound do <strong>not</strong> differentiate colonization from invasive infection, leading some authors to recommend a full-thickness skin biopsy for all possible burn infections to confirm infection and identify the aggravating organism [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Full-thickness skin biopsy is generally performed if treatments are failing and if there is concern for invasive or resistant microorganisms. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14985.html" rel="external">"Burn wound infection and sepsis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7643.html" rel="external">"Pseudomonas aeruginosa skin and soft tissue infections", section on 'Burn infections'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18"><span class="h2">Referral</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients with minor burns should be referred for follow-up at a burn center in order to ensure that proper healing is taking place, and to establish contact for any future needs (surgical evaluation, therapy, pressure garments).

If referral is necessary, a plastic surgeon with pediatric expertise is preferable. More extensive excisions were performed in patients treated early whereas those in whom treatment was delayed needed less extensive excisions or sometimes none at all. A full-thickness burn less than 2 cm wide can be allowed to heal by contracture as long as it is in a nonfunctional, noncosmetic area, and the skin is not thin [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>The presence of necrotic tissue in deep burn wounds can cause progressive tissue injury, which suggests that excision of this tissue enhances healing. In addition, excision of necrotic tissue from burn wounds followed by skin grafting restores the skin barrier and appears to improve immunologic functioning, thereby reducing the risk of infection. Early excision of necrotic tissue and skin grafting generally results in improved outcomes. The principles, techniques, and indications for this approach are reviewed separately.

Treatment and prognosis are based largely upon these characteristics. Most important is to distinguish superficial burns  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55928" href="/d/graphic/55928.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86904" href="/d/graphic/86904.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) from partial-thickness burns  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75398" href="/d/graphic/75398.html" rel="external">picture 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef126232" href="/d/graphic/126232.html" rel="external">picture 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57851" href="/d/graphic/57851.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>), and to assess accurately the overall <strong>non</strong>-superficial burn size. These two assessments largely determine which patients are appropriately managed in the outpatient setting. (See <a class="local">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial care</strong> – Initial treatment of minor thermal injuries consists mainly of cooling (with room temperature tap water or cooled, saline-soaked gauze; <strong>not</strong> with ice), simple gentle cleansing with mild soap and water, and appropriate dressing.
