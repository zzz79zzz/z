The cornerstone of any procedure aimed at reducing AF burden is the electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins so that these discharges do not trigger the initiation of AF. In those with persistent and longstanding persistent AF, and in some patients with paroxysmal AF, additional areas, often in one or both of the atria or surrounding structures, are targeted for ablation, as they may also serve as a source of AF triggers or maintenance. Catheter ablation (CA) is the procedure that is used to prevent the initiation of AF by electrically isolating these triggers from the rest of the atrial chamber tissue. </p><p>This topic is intended to be viewed primarily by non-electrophysiologists. Electrophysiologists may be more interested in other topics:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1007.html" rel="external">"Overview of catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/93920.html" rel="external">"Maintenance of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation: Catheter ablation versus antiarrhythmic drug therapy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/949.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation: Catheter ablation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/980.html" rel="external">"Invasive diagnostic cardiac electrophysiology studies"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94502.html" rel="external">"Catheter ablation to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3630720095"><span class="h1">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A major clinical goal of CA is a reduction in AF-related symptoms. CA is superior to medical therapy at improving quality of life. Therefore, it is generally reserved for individuals with symptoms attributable to the arrhythmia, which most often include palpitations, shortness of breath, or generalized fatigue [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Even if they have no AF-related symptoms, older individuals with early AF (duration &lt;1 year) and additional cardiovascular conditions also benefit from therapies aimed at maintaining sinus rhythm; these therapies include CA [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/93920.html" rel="external">"Maintenance of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation: Catheter ablation versus antiarrhythmic drug therapy", section on 'Recommendations of others'</a>.) </p><p>Patients should be considered for ablation for AF after the history and physical exam have been reviewed and there is documentation of symptomatic correlation with AF on electrocardiogram (ECG) or other forms of monitoring. Modifiable risk factors including obesity, excessive alcohol intake, and sleep apnea should be addressed, as they are important components of AF treatment and impact the success of any rhythm control intervention [<a href="#rid4">4-8</a>]. AF CA may be appropriate in the following groups:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF who have tried a class I or III antiarrhythmic drug ablation can be considered if such medications are either unsuccessful or are not tolerated. Some individuals may choose ablation as first-line therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with long-standing persistent AF, a trial of one or more class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs is recommended. Ablation as first-line therapy can be considered in those with contraindications to drugs. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Asymptomatic younger individuals and patients with heart failure due to reduced ejection fraction may also benefit from ablation [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. </p><p></p><p>We do not perform CA in:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Individuals who are too frail to safely undergo the procedure.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with a left atrial appendage thrombus.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Individuals with bleeding diathesis who cannot receive intra- and postprocedural anticoagulation.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3596110438"><span class="h1">PREPROCEDURAL PREPARATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once a patient has been selected for AF ablation, the clinician performing the procedure or their designee should obtain informed consent from the patient. This involves shared decision-making after discussing the indications, benefits, risks, and alternatives of the planned procedure. Sedation options include general anesthesia that requires an endotracheal tube or monitored anesthesia care with sedation but not requiring intubation. Most procedures are performed under general anesthesia.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2618546904"><span class="h2">Medication management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most physicians performing ablation will discontinue antiarrhythmic drugs prior to the ablation with the rationale that it may help to identify the triggers of the AF at the time of the procedure. We acknowledge that many other electrophysiologists will continue them. There are no well-performed studies to guide practice.</p><p>With regard to oral anticoagulation, randomized trials have demonstrated superior efficacy and safety of uninterrupted anticoagulation throughout the ablation procedure compared with temporary discontinuation of anticoagulation and bridging with low molecular weight heparin. </p><p>Most operators, including the authors, perform the procedure on uninterrupted or minimally interrupted direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a>. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A meta-analysis of 17,434 patients from 12 observational trials and one randomized trial compared uninterrupted <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> with interrupted warfarin and heparin bridging at the time of AF ablation.

The incidence of major bleeding events during and up to eight weeks after ablation was lower with dabigatran than with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> (1.6 versus 6.9 percent) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. In a trial of 614 patients undergoing CA, participants were randomly assigned to uninterrupted <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="99275" href="/d/drug information/99275.html" rel="external">edoxaban</a> or VKA. Major bleeds were nonsignificantly lower in persons assigned to edoxaban compared with VKA (0.2 versus 2 percent; hazard ratio 0.16; 95% CI 0.02-1.73) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Studies of DOACS with similar bleeding risks compared with VKA: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In a trial of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9498" href="/d/drug information/9498.html" rel="external">rivaroxaban</a> or VKA in people undergoing AF ablation, bleeding events were similar in the two study arms [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. In a trial that compared uninterrupted <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="85642" href="/d/drug information/85642.html" rel="external">apixaban</a> with placebo, the rates of clinically significant and major bleeding were also similar for both groups (10.6 versus 9.8 percent) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4144824046"><span class="h2">Imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients with AF, not just those being considered for CA, should undergo transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to evaluate for factors that may affect treatment including the presence and extent of valvular disease, chamber size, and ventricular function. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1022.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation: Overview and management of new-onset atrial fibrillation", section on 'Echocardiogram'</a>.)</p><p>Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), which is superior to TTE for finding atrial thrombus, is often performed within 24 hours prior to ablation since the presence of thrombus in the left atrium or left atrial appendage is a contraindication to AF ablation. Some operators may choose to forego TEE in patients with a low risk of stroke (ie, CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc ≤1) who are expected to be in sinus rhythm at the time of the procedure and who have been and will be maintained on uninterrupted anticoagulation throughout the periprocedural timeframe. Some operators will individualize the need for preprocedure TEE and tend to only perform it in higher-risk patients. Risk factors for left atrial appendage thrombus prior to ablation include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction &lt;30 percent, persistent or longstanding persistent AF, and elevated CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. In a study of 1058 preprocedure TEEs, the rate of detection of left atrial thrombus or prethrombus was 1 percent in patients with paroxysmal AF in sinus rhythm and 2 percent for patients with paroxysmal AF who were in AF at the time of the procedure. The risk increased with increasing CHADS<sub>2</sub> score [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. </p><p>Computed tomography (CT) or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) may be performed preablation to define the left atrial anatomy, specifically the number, size, and location of the pulmonary veins  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef127240" href="/d/graphic/127240.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Data are emerging to suggest that these imaging techniques are also highly sensitive for left atrial thrombus, and many operators use CT or cMRI to evaluate for left atrial thrombus instead of TEE in low-risk individuals. A comparison of cMRI with TEE to evaluate preablation left atrial appendage thrombus demonstrated 100 percent sensitivity and 99.2 percent specificity for equilibrium phase delayed enhancement CMR with a long inversion time [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. New high-dimensional mapping catheters used during the procedure can create high-definition structural geometry, and for many operators has obviated the need for preprocedure imaging.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1405648003"><span class="h1">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ablation for AF is among the most complicated procedures performed by electrophysiologists. The procedure should be performed in centers with experience with complex electrophysiologic procedures and capabilities in managing acute complications. Advancements in procedural technologies and techniques have significantly shortened the duration of ablation procedures for AF. Total procedure time typically ranges from 1.5 to 4 hours [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>The ablation is performed using uni- or bilateral femoral venous access and transseptal puncture for accessing the left atrium. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H111493393"><span class="h2">Anesthesia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ablation for AF is performed in the fasting state with general anesthesia or monitored anesthesia care (MAC) using sedation. In a retrospective cohort study of CA performed under either general anesthesia or conscious sedation, conscious sedation had shorter total procedure times and equivalent success rates compared with general anesthesia [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. In a retrospective cohort study of CA performed under either general anesthesia or MAC, MAC had shorter total procedure times and equivalent success rates with general anesthesia [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>Agents typically used for conscious sedation include short-acting benzodiazepines (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9650" href="/d/drug information/9650.html" rel="external">midazolam</a>) and opioids (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8441" href="/d/drug information/8441.html" rel="external">fentanyl</a>) in divided doses [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The type of anesthesia used for AF ablation procedures is dependent on several variables including the expected complexity and duration of the procedure, energy source being utilized, patient comorbidities, patient preference, and availability of anesthesia support. Patient immobility is important to optimize catheter contact and reduce movement error in the anatomic mapping systems. Paralytics should not be used when testing for phrenic nerve capture during ablation. </p><p>High frequency ventilation, also called jet ventilation, which utilizes a respiratory rate greater than four times the normal value. (&gt;150 [Vf] breaths per minute) and very small tidal volumes, is used in some centers to aid catheter stability and has been associated with improved outcomes [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1897001433"><span class="h2">Intraprocedural medications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition to anesthetic agents, intravenous heparin is administered throughout the AF ablation procedure to reduce the risk of thrombus formation on the catheters, sheaths, left atrium and left atrial appendage, and at ablation sites. Heparin is administered prior to or immediately after transseptal access has been achieved with a targeted activated clotting time (ACT) of &gt;300 seconds. Target ACT may be reached faster and with lower loading doses in patients undergoing ablation on uninterrupted vitamin K antagonists (VKA) compared with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs; also referred to as direct acting oral anticoagulants [DOAC]) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Additionally, time to target ACT varies amongst the NOACs, with average time in minutes required to achieve a target ACT of &gt;300 seconds significantly longer in those receiving uninterrupted <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8926" href="/d/drug information/8926.html" rel="external">dabigatran</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="85642" href="/d/drug information/85642.html" rel="external">apixaban</a> compared with those receiving <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9498" href="/d/drug information/9498.html" rel="external">rivaroxaban</a> [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Protamine can be used to reverse anticoagulation at the time of sheath removal post-procedure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2279901752"><span class="h2">Esophageal imaging and temperature monitoring</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The proximity of the esophagus to the posterior left atrium makes it susceptible to thermal injury (see <a class="local">'Complications'</a> below). Atrioesophageal fistula, typically occurring one to four weeks post-ablation, is a potentially lethal consequence of AF ablation, with a reported incidence of 0.02 to 0.11 percent. To minimize risk, operators will limit energy delivery in the posterior wall in areas adjacent to the esophagus. As the esophagus can have a highly variable position that can vary throughout the procedure, visualization of the esophagus can be performed using electroanatomic mapping, intracardiac ultrasound (ICE), or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9180" href="/d/drug information/9180.html" rel="external">barium</a> paste. Many operators use an esophageal temperature probe to assess the effects of ablation on intraluminal temperature, though this practice has not yet been shown to reduce the risk of fistula formation given the low incidence of these events. Given the very low overall incidence of fistula, there have been no randomized data to demonstrate superiority of one esophageal monitoring strategy over another. Consequently, minimization of power delivery to the atrial tissue adjacent to the esophagus or minimization of temperature elevation remain surrogates for procedural safety</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3959362155"><span class="h2">Vascular ultrasound</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CA for AF requires multiple sheaths with large diameters in one or both femoral veins in patients receiving oral and intravenous anticoagulation. These issues make vascular complications the most common complications of AF ablation. Access can be obtained through the modified Seldinger approach. Vascular ultrasound has been used for venipuncture guidance and postprocedural evaluation.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a cohort study of 1435 patients undergoing cryoballoon ablation for AF, major clinical events occurred in 1.7 percent of those patients who had their procedure performed without ultrasound guidance versus 0 percent in those that did have ultrasound guidance [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a multicenter, randomized trial, 320 patients were randomized to ultrasound guided versus conventional venipuncture. Major complications were low and not significantly different between groups. Puncture time, inadvertent arterial puncture, and need for extra puncture attempts were all significantly reduced in the ultrasound arm [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1704290018"><span class="h2">Intracardiac ultrasound</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Intracardiac ultrasound allows for real-time imaging of cardiac anatomy. The probe is placed in the right atrium via the inferior vena cava. Common uses of ICE include the identification of intra- and extracardiac anatomic structures such as the esophagus, facilitation of transseptal puncture, guidance of catheter placement, and recognition of complications including thrombus formation on sheaths and catheters and early recognition of pericardial effusion. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1277296933"><span class="h2">Fluoroscopy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mapping and ablation of AF requires precise navigation of catheters within the left atrium and localization of intra- and extracardiac structures.

In patients with paroxysmal AF, PV triggers are the primary stimulus in most cases. As AF becomes more persistent, non-PV sources become more important [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].

The majority of ablations performed use radiofrequency energy or cryothermy (cryoballoon ablation). Infrared laser received FDA approval in 2018. </p><p>Circumferential PVI involves the creation of confluent ablation lesions that encircle the ostia of all four PVs, usually in two pairs (ie, a left- and right-sided circles) [<a href="#rid32">32-34</a>]. The goal is to electrically isolate the PVs from the left atrium. For ablation using radiofrequency energy, power, duration, and the catheter contact force determine the size and the depth of the lesion created. It is generally felt that some lesions create edema but not scars, leading to temporary but not permanent ablation, and this ultimately leads to electrical reconnection of the left atrium to the PVs. Greater power, longer duration, and greater contact force improve the efficacy of the procedure but lead to an increase in complications such as cardiac perforation [<a href="#rid35">35,36</a>]. The efficacy and safety of high-power, short-duration ablation, which creates larger, shallower, and more homogeneous lesions, is under evaluation [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. </p><p>Circumferential PVI results in extensive ablation across a wider area of the left atrium. Because of the more extensive ablation, this technique may provide additional methods for preventing AF, including autonomic denervation, elimination of triggering foci outside the PVs, and alteration of the left atrial substrate necessary for perpetuating AF. However, more extensive ablation, particularly in the posterior left atrium, may increase the rate of complications, including the development of left atrial tachycardias or flutters months or years after the ablation.

For PVI, acute procedural success is defined as electrical isolation of all PVs [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. This is defined by entry block or the inability to electrically capture PV myocardial tissue distal to the area of ablation when pacing is performed proximal to the ablation line. To do this, a circular catheter is positioned just distal to the PV ostium for the purpose of recording electrograms within the PVs. Confirmation is attempted after a 30-minute waiting period after isolation.</p><p>Some operators also test for exit block, defined by the inability to capture atrial myocardium when pacing is performed within the PV distal to the ablation line. There is a high correlation between AF recurrences and the demonstration of persistent or recurrent conduction between the PVs and left atrium (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/949.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation: Catheter ablation", section on 'Efficacy'</a>). </p><p>Recurrent PV conduction explains most cases of recurrence; it is thought to be due to recovery of function of tissue that has been acutely injured (ie, edema and inflammation) but not permanently scarred.

It is thought that mechanisms that maintain rather than trigger the arrhythmia are more important in these individuals. These observations may explain the reduced efficacy of CA procedures that are limited to PVI in patients with longstanding persistent AF seen in most studies. In these patients, additional lesions are often needed to prevent recurrence of AF. These lesions are often placed anatomically in the left atrial posterior wall and roof, in the left atrial appendage, coronary sinus, or in the right atrium. Additional targets include sites of complex fractionated electrograms and rotors [<a href="#rid43">43,44</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16402.html" rel="external">"Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation", section on 'Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation: triggers and substrates'</a>).
