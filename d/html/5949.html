This may refer to infections that are too great in number, too severe, too long lasting; that are associated with unusual complications; or that fail to resolve with standard therapy. The causes are multiple and can be grouped into four categories: the "normal" child, the child with atopic disease, the child with another chronic condition, and the child with an immunodeficiency.</p><p>The approach to the child with recurrent infections will be reviewed here. Laboratory studies evaluating the function of the immune system and specific immunodeficiencies are discussed briefly here and in more detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3903.html" rel="external">"Laboratory evaluation of the immune system"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3914.html" rel="external">"Primary humoral immunodeficiencies: An overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3963.html" rel="external">"Selective IgA deficiency: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3955.html" rel="external">"Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): An overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3913.html" rel="external">"Primary disorders of phagocyte number and/or function: An overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3928.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3951.html" rel="external">"Syndromic immunodeficiencies"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3962.html" rel="external">"Inherited disorders of the complement system"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5015545"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goal of this diagnostic approach is to differentiate the child with an inborn error of immunity (IEI; also called a primary immunodeficiency [PID]) from the "normal child" who has more than the average number of infections or from the child who has an underlying disease that mimics infection, predisposes the child to certain types of infections, and/or results in secondary immune system dysfunction. Most often, these categories can be determined from the history, physical examination, and screening investigations.</p><p>Recurrent infections are infections that are too great in number, too severe, or too long lasting. Recurrent infections are defined as two or more severe infections in one year, three or more respiratory infections (eg, sinusitis, otitis, bronchitis) in one year, or the need for antibiotics for two months/year. Severe/serious infections include those with persistent evidence of inflammation (eg, fever) or confinement to bed for a week or more (eg, missing school or other activities); failure to respond to oral antibiotics and/or the need for intravenous antibiotics or hospitalization; infections with an unusual pathogen; unusual complications (eg mastoiditis, pleural effusion, abscesses); or persistent laboratory abnormalities (eg, leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]/C-reactive protein [CRP], persistent imaging abnormalities).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5015731"><span class="h2">Clinical features suggestive of a primary immunodeficiency</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following features should lead to suspicion of an immunodeficiency and consideration of referral to an immunology specialist for evaluation [<a href="#rid1">1-7</a>].

In addition, the use of intravenous antibiotics for sepsis and failure to thrive were strong identifiers of neutrophil PID and T cell PID, respectively.</p><p>In infants, additional features suggestive of a PID include hypocalcemia with or without seizures, congenital heart defects (mainly conotruncal anomalies), absence of thymic shadow on chest radiograph  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67690" href="/z/d/graphic/67690.html" rel="external">image 1</a>), and delayed umbilical cord detachment (&gt;30 days) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is considered a pediatric emergency, and special precautions should be taken if this diagnosis is suspected. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3955.html" rel="external">"Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): An overview", section on 'Protective measures'</a> and <a class="local">'Management of the child with recurrent infection'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">MAJOR CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The majority of children who present with recurrent infections, especially localized to one organ system, have increased exposure, allergy, or chronic disease, including anatomic problems, rather than a defect in immune response. The percentages seen in each group listed below are based upon the authors' clinical experience and may vary regionally depending upon the population and referral patterns.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">The "normal" child</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Approximately 50 percent of children with recurrent infections referred for evaluation have no known significant cause for these infections.</p><p>Infants and children vary considerably as to the number of infections experienced. The average child has four to eight respiratory infections per year [<a href="#rid10">10-12</a>]. Some infants and young children have only one or two infections per year, especially if they have limited contact with persons outside of their immediate family. Others may have 10 to 12 infections per year, particularly if they have older siblings or if they attend daycare or preschool. Exposure to passive smoking also increases the risk of upper respiratory infections [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>The mean duration of viral respiratory symptoms is eight days [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, the normal range can extend beyond two weeks, which means that the "normal" child with over 10 viral respiratory infections can have symptoms for nearly one-half of a year.</p><p>With regard to the number and types of infections seen, most of the respiratory infections are viral. These children generally do not have more than one episode of pneumonia or more than two episodes of uncomplicated otitis media in the first three years of life.</p><p>These children have normal growth and development, respond quickly to appropriate treatment, recover completely, and appear healthy between infections. The physical examination and laboratory tests are normal. (See <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> below and <a class="local">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>An unusual cause of recurrent infection in a normal child is Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a form of child abuse. These children have a history of repeated illnesses, based upon the testimony of the caretaker, that often require repeated diagnostic procedures, treatment with multiple medicines, and frequent school absenteeism and/or hospitalizations. Common infectious complaints include fever, cough, recurrent skin infections, and/or diarrhea. These illnesses are not validated by repeated medical examinations, and the child often gets better in the hospital or in the absence of the caregiver.</p><p>Occasionally, the caregiver induces an infection by putting contaminated material (saliva, urine, feces) in an intravenous line, on the skin, or in the ears. Bacterial cultures show multiple organisms and mimic the profile present in the contaminating material.</p><p>The caregiver often resists stopping medications (such as antibiotics or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> infusions) or discharging the child from the hospital. In addition, the caregiver often has a history of abnormal behavior and may be seeking attention. A full description of the syndrome is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6608.html" rel="external">"Medical child abuse (Munchausen syndrome by proxy)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">The child with atopic disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Approximately 30 percent of children with recurrent infections have atopic disease. Chronic allergic rhinitis may be mistaken for chronic or recurrent upper respiratory infections. Children with atopic disease often develop coughing and wheezing following viral respiratory infections. These symptoms are frequently misdiagnosed as pneumonia or bronchitis rather than reactive airways disease/asthma. These episodes respond poorly to antibiotics but well to allergy/asthma medications. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7525.html" rel="external">"Allergic rhinitis: Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/535.html" rel="external">"Role of viruses in wheezing and asthma: An overview"</a>.)</p><p>Children with atopic disease are more likely to develop recurrent and persistent upper respiratory infections, such as sinusitis, rhinitis, and otitis media [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. This increased susceptibility to infection may be due to enhanced adherence of pathogens to inflamed respiratory epithelium, increased mucosal permeability, or an altered immune response to certain viral and bacterial pathogens [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. The specific type of infection tends to recur in a given child. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6069.html" rel="external">"Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in children: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Predisposing factors'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6021.html" rel="external">"Acute otitis media in children: Epidemiology, microbiology, and complications", section on 'Risk and protective factors'</a>.)</p><p>Growth and development are usually normal. Children with atopy often have characteristic physical findings, such as "allergic shiners" or a transverse nasal crease. A total immunoglobulin E (IgE) is sometimes included in the laboratory screening for immunodeficiency. A normal total IgE tends to exclude IgE-mediated allergy, although it may be falsely low in an infant. An elevated IgE (eg, &gt;100 int. units/mL) is suggestive of allergy, but an elevated IgE alone is not diagnostic for atopic disease. (See <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> below and <a class="local">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5541.html" rel="external">"Overview of skin testing for IgE-mediated allergic disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5540.html" rel="external">"Overview of in vitro allergy tests"</a>.)</p><p>It is important to note that primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) and allergic disease can coexist. In a retrospective series of children evaluated for PID, 31 percent (9 of 29) who had evidence of antigen-specific IgE by skin prick or blood testing were diagnosed with an immunodeficiency compared with 9 percent (6 of 68) of those who were negative on specific IgE testing [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Immunodeficiencies with associated atopy include selective immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), and DiGeorge syndrome. Immunodeficiencies in which elevated levels of IgE are seen include hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome due to signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (<em>STAT3</em>) mutations, interleukin (IL) 6 signal transducer (<em>IL6ST</em>) deficiency, zinc finger protein 341 (<em>ZNF341</em>) deficiency, caspase recruitment domain family member 11 (<em>CARD11</em>) dominant negative defect, phosphoglucomutase 3 (<em>PGM3</em>) deficiency, IL-21 receptor (<em>IL21R</em>) deficiency, erbb2-interacting protein (<em>ERBIN</em>) deficiency, actin-related protein 2/3 complex, subunit B (ARPC1b) defect, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, Omenn syndrome, IPEX (immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked) syndrome, dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency, and lipopolysaccharide-responsive-beige-like-anchor (LRBA) deficiency. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3960.html" rel="external">"Autosomal dominant hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3953.html" rel="external">"Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3924.html" rel="external">"IPEX: Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16837.html" rel="external">"Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS): Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'LRBA deficiency disease'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/141326.html" rel="external">"Combined immunodeficiencies: Specific defects", section on 'CARD11 deficiency'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3951.html" rel="external">"Syndromic immunodeficiencies"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3950.html" rel="external">"T-B-NK+ SCID: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Omenn syndrome phenotype'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">The child with chronic disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ten percent of children with recurrent infections have an underlying chronic disease other than atopy or immunodeficiency. The child with a nonimmune chronic illness often presents with poor growth/failure to thrive, a sickly appearance, and physical findings characteristic of the specific chronic disease. Diseases in this category include cystic fibrosis, gastroesophageal reflux, congenital heart disease, and chronic aspiration. Patients may also have an underlying anatomic defect. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6367.html" rel="external">"Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Overview of clinical features'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5876.html" rel="external">"Gastroesophageal reflux in infants"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5892.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5765.html" rel="external">"Suspected heart disease in infants and children: Criteria for referral"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14537.html" rel="external">"Aspiration due to swallowing dysfunction in children"</a>.)</p><p>Patients in this group are more susceptible to infection for various reasons, including the following [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Barrier failure – Skin or sinus tracts/fistulae or structural defects involving the cribriform plate or other parts of the skull</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inadequate clearance of secretions – Hypotonia or a central nervous system (CNS) abnormality leading to aspiration, abnormal cilia structure or function, abnormal mucus production</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Obstruction – Eustachian tube dysfunction, tonsillar and/or adenoidal hypertrophy, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cardiovascular problems – Heart disease with increased pulmonary blood flow, structurally abnormal cardiac valve</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Foreign body – Central venous line, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, artificial cardiac valve, indwelling catheter, or noniatrogenic foreign body typically found in the nose, ear, or airway</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Resistant organisms – Penicillin-resistant pneumococcus, <em>Pseudomonas</em>, vancomycin-resistant <em>Enterococcus</em>, multidrug-resistant <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> (recurrent skin infections caused by community-associated methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> [MRSA] are common both in children with chronic disease and in normal children despite appropriate antibiotic therapy)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Continuous reinfection – Contaminated water supply, chronically infected pet, deliberate infection (Munchausen syndrome by proxy)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">The child with an immunodeficiency</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ten percent of children with recurrent infections have an immunodeficiency, with a defect in one or more components of the immune system [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Components of the adaptive immune system include B cells (humoral or antibody system) and T cells (cellular system). The innate immune system is made up of the phagocytic cell system and the complement system. Other components of the innate immune system include sensors of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), mannose-binding protein, and respiratory tract cilia.</p><p>Immunodeficiency may be secondary or primary. Secondary immunodeficiencies usually occur well after infancy, while many PIDs present during the first years of life. Both primary and secondary immunodeficiency can lead to an increased susceptibility to malignancy and autoimmune disease. PIDs most often affect B cell function, while secondary immunodeficiencies more often affect T cells (the cellular system).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5016183"><span class="h3">Primary immunodeficiencies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The overall incidence of PIDs is 1 in 10,000.

More than 400 disorders, many genetically defined, have been characterized [<a href="#rid2">2,5,20</a>].

Evaluation for primary immunodeficiency (PID) should focus on the component of the immune system that is most likely to be involved based upon the initial assessment. The initial laboratory evaluation is reviewed briefly here and discussed in greater detail separately. Laboratory studies for disorders that cause secondary immunodeficiency (eg, sickle cell disease, diabetes mellitus) are also discussed separately (see appropriate topic reviews on the specific disorders). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3903.html" rel="external">"Laboratory evaluation of the immune system"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8388.html" rel="external">"Laboratory evaluation of neutrophil disorders"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3920.html" rel="external">"Overview and clinical assessment of the complement system"</a>.)</p><p>At a minimum, the following initial panel is suggested:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Complete blood count (CBC) with differential</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chemistry panel, including electrolytes, glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and albumin</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Urinalysis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and/or C-reactive protein (CRP)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>IgG, IgM, IgA and IgE levels</p><p></p><p>On the CBC, particular attention should be paid to the total absolute lymphocyte count. Lymphopenia, suggestive of a T cell deficiency, is defined as a count of &lt;1500 cells/microL for patients over five years and &lt;2500 cells/microL for younger children. The presence of anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, or leukopenia should be investigated. An elevated platelet count suggests chronic inflammation.</p><p>The chemistry panel may point to liver disease, hemolysis, diabetes, renal disease, hypoalbuminemia suggesting protein loss, or malnutrition. Urinalysis for proteinuria, casts, or cells may suggest nephritis. Excessive protein losses in the urine can also explain hypogammaglobulinemia in the circulation.</p><p>An elevated ESR and/or CRP suggests chronic infection or an autoimmune disease. This should be followed by appropriate cultures, additional laboratory studies, and/or imaging based upon the history and physical examination. The lungs and the sinuses are the most common site of chronic infection. Review of the chest radiograph of a young child should include examination for the absence of a thymic shadow, a finding common in severe T cell deficiencies. All children with pneumonitis should have a sweat test for cystic fibrosis. Patients with bona fide systemic infections but who lack fever and/or elevated CRP should be evaluated for innate immune diseases.</p><p>Immunoglobulin levels should be compared with age-matched controls since immunoglobulin levels change throughout infancy, childhood, and into adulthood. Low immunoglobulin levels will suggest antibody or combined immunodeficiencies. An IgG &lt;300 mg/dL, a total Ig (IgG + IgM + IgA) less than 500 mg/dL, or the complete absence of IgA and/or IgM in a child older than six months suggests an antibody deficiency. IgG subclasses are not measured as part of a screening evaluation. An elevated IgE level (&gt;100 int. units/mL) suggests allergy, eczema, or chronic skin infections. A very elevated IgE level (&gt;2000 int. units/mL) is not uncommon in patients with active eczema but begins to suggest a monogenic disorder of atopy or one of the hyper-IgE immunodeficiency syndromes. IgD is also not measured as part of a screening evaluation. Defects in generating functional antibodies can occur despite normal IgG levels. Thus, normal immunoglobulin levels are not fully reassuring.
