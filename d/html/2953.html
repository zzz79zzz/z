Urethral cancer is not one malignancy but a spectrum of diseases with various histologies. The approach to management and prognosis depends upon sex, location of the tumor within the urethra, and extent of disease.</p><p>This topic will discuss the clinical presentation, evaluation, and treatment of urethral cancer.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3365456008"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An analysis from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database included 1075 males and 540 females with urethral cancer from 1973 to 2002 [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The age-adjusted incidence rate was 4.3 and 1.5 per million in males and females, respectively. The incidence increased with age, with a maximum of 32 per million in males and 9.5 per million in females aged 75 to 84 years. In addition to the higher incidence in males, urethral cancer was also approximately twice as common in African Americans as compared with White Americans. </p><p>A European study from the RARECARE project identified 1059 cases over a seven-year period and estimated that there are approximately 650 new cases per year in the European Union [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The age-standardized rates were 1.6 and 0.6 per million in males and females, respectively.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H785088833"><span class="h1">RISK FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although<strong> </strong>the etiology of urethral cancer is not well understood, factors that have been associated with urethral cancer include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic inflammation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Males with urethral cancer often have a history of sexually transmitted infections, urethritis, or urethral stricture [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. As an example, in one study, males with urethral cancer reported a history of gonococcal urethritis, urethral stricture, or significant trauma in 37, 35, and 7 percent of cases, respectively [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Urethral strictures, which may develop following urethral trauma, are most frequently found in the bulbomembranous urethra, which is also the most common urethral segment involved with cancer [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In females, urethral diverticuli have been implicated in the development of cancer in up to 5 percent of cases, probably due to secondary chronic inflammation [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Urinary stasis and infection may also be contributing factors. As an example, in one series of 90 females undergoing diverticulectomy, five (6 percent) were found to have invasive adenocarcinoma, with some others having evidence of intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 has been implicated in the development of both male and female urethral cancers [<a href="#rid10">10-12</a>]. As an example, in one series, HPV was identified in tumors from 11 of 18 females (61 percent) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. HPV 16 was present in 9 of the 11 cases. A similar causal relationship may exist in males. In one series, tumors from 4 of 14 patients (29 percent) harbored detectable HPV [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. All four were the HPV 16 subtype. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8031.html" rel="external">"Virology of human papillomavirus infections and the link to cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Urothelial carcinoma is often multifocal and may arise in the urethra simultaneously with, precede, or follow lesions of the bladder, ureters, or renal pelvis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2957.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and risk factors of urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma of the bladder"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3512389818"><span class="h1">ANATOMY AND HISTOLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1058517580"><span class="h2">Males</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Tumors of the male urethra are categorized by both location and histology.</p><p>The predominant histologic type is urothelial carcinoma (present in 54 to 65 percent of cases), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (16 to 22 percent) and adenocarcinoma (10 to 16 percent) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. </p><p>The male urethra extends from the bladder neck to the urethral meatus, averages 21 cm in length, and is divided into the prostatic, bulbomembranous, and penile urethra [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The prostatic and bulbomembranous urethra segments are lined with transitional epithelium that is similar to the bladder and upper urinary tract. The penile urethra is lined with pseudostratified columnar epithelium, and the meatus is lined with stratified squamous epithelium. The most common site of involvement is the bulbomembranous urethra, followed by the penile and prostatic urethra (60, 30, and 10 percent of cases, respectively).</p><p>Most of the carcinomas of the penile and bulbomembranous urethra are squamous cell in origin, with urothelial and adenocarcinomas accounting for the minority of the cases [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. In contrast, the vast majority of prostatic urethral carcinomas are urothelial in origin, although squamous cell carcinomas account for 10 percent of these cancers [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>Urethral cancer can directly extend into contiguous organs, such as the penis, or spread via the lymphatics drainage into the inguinal and pelvic nodes. The distal urethra drains into superficial and deep inguinal lymph nodes, while the proximal urethra drains into the external iliac, obturator, and internal iliac lymph node chains [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4200253553"><span class="h2">Females</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The female urethra averages 3 to 4 cm in length space and is divided into an anterior segment, which comprises the distal third, and a posterior segment, which comprises the proximal two-thirds of the urethra. The proximal one-third is composed of transitional epithelium, while the distal two-thirds is stratified squamous epithelium. Along the entire urethra, however, there are submucosal glands, which are composed of columnar epithelium [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p>The lymphatic drainage of the female urethra is analogous to the male, with the distal one-third draining into the superficial or deep inguinal nodes, while the proximal two-thirds drains into the pelvic lymph nodes [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>Squamous cell carcinomas represent the predominant histology in females, accounting for up to 60 percent of urethral cancers, while 15 to 20 percent are urothelial carcinomas, and 5 to 7 percent are adenocarcinomas [<a href="#rid16">16,18</a>]. Proximal squamous cell carcinomas most likely arise from squamous metaplasia in the nonsquamous epithelium as a result of chronic inflammation. Mixed histologies are not uncommon and may be the result of differentiation of urothelial carcinoma into glandular and/or squamous components. Adenocarcinomas arise from Skene glands as a prostatic homologue, with resultant prostate-specific antigen positivity in some cases [<a href="#rid14">14</a>], from glandular metaplasia leading to columnar/mucinous adenocarcinoma [<a href="#rid17">17</a>], and rarely, from other sources leading to clear cell adenocarcinoma [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4185608506"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical presentation of urethral carcinoma varies depending upon sex.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Males </strong>– In males, symptoms may be nonspecific, and diagnosis is often delayed. Symptoms can overlap with and be attributed to benign urethral strictures, which are far more common than cancer. Thus, any patient presenting with recurrent strictures should undergo biopsy of the diseased urethral segment since urethral strictures are associated with urethral cancer. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other symptoms include hematuria (often initial rather than terminal hematuria), difficulty voiding, dysuria, urethral discharge, and urinary retention in advanced disease. Unexplained perineal pain, genital swelling, priapism, periurethral abscess, or fistula in an older adult patient should also prompt work-up to rule out urethral carcinoma [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Females </strong>– Most females with urethral cancer present with irritative voiding symptoms or hematuria, which is often mistaken for a urinary tract infection, which is far more common. In older females, recurrent or persistent pelvic symptoms, such as dyspareunia, should raise suspicion for the presence of urethral carcinoma.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lymph node and distant metastases</strong> – Up to 30 percent of males with urethral cancers have regional lymph node metastases at presentation, with less than one-half of these being clinically palpable [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Approximately 10 percent of patients have distant metastases at time of presentation, with the most frequent sites of involvement being the lungs, liver, and bone [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. These patients generally have extensive locally advanced primary tumors, along with regional nodal involvement.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H69016396"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A detailed evaluation is essential to make the diagnosis and assess the extent of disease. Definitive diagnosis requires biopsy confirmation.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Work-up should begin with a physical examination and evaluation of the palpable portion of the urethra as well as the inguinal lymph nodes. In females, this includes a bimanual examination.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cystourethroscopy should be performed to evaluate the extent of disease. Retrograde urethrography in males can help establish the exact location and extent of disease. In patients with recurrent or extensive urethral strictures or abnormal urethral mucosa, urine cytology should be sent. If clinical suspicion remains high, however, definitive diagnosis should be made with transurethral biopsies since the sensitivity of cytology is low [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cross-sectional imaging using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be obtained to evaluate for locoregional spread of cancer. Chest imaging must be performed to rule out metastatic disease. Newer MRI techniques allow superior soft tissue resolution and better delineation of tissue planes that may be helpful in surgical staging and planning [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>CT imaging may be useful to exclude distant metastases [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Bone scan should only be ordered if there are symptoms, an elevated alkaline phosphatase, or suggestion of disease on cross-sectional imaging. There are currently no available data on use of positron emission tomography (PET) scan for imaging or staging.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2915809304"><span class="h2">Staging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Accurate clinical staging is paramount given the array of various treatment options. Proper clinical staging consists of appropriate imaging, as mentioned above, examination under anesthesia with cystoscopy, and palpation of the genitalia, urethra, rectum, and perineum, in addition to bimanual examination to assess local tumor involvement.</p><p>Transurethral biopsy of the lesion is critical for accurate histologic evaluation. Cytologic studies of voided urine alone are not a reliable source for diagnosis of primary urethral carcinoma. Sensitivity of cytology is greatest with urothelial cell carcinomas (80 percent) and tumors in the pendulous urethra (73 percent) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p>The tumor, node, metastasis staging system is used for staging carcinoma of the urethra  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110807" href="/z/d/graphic/110807.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The eighth edition of this system (2017) is supported by both the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Union for Cancer Control. Staging is based on depth of invasion of the primary tumor and the presence or absence of regional lymph node involvement and distant metastasis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1914427471"><span class="h1">TREATMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1259400304"><span class="h2">General approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are no prospective trials to guide treatment recommendations for patients with urethral cancer. The treatment approaches in both males and females are based on small case series and extrapolation from the management of other malignancies of the urinary tract. Treatment varies widely based upon location, extent, histology, and sex. Contemporary reports have combined experience from higher volume centers in order to provide additional insight into the disease and its treatment.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with clinically localized disease (ie, pTa to T2), surgery is generally the preferred initial treatment. Surgical approaches range from transurethral resection to excision using partial or total urethrectomy techniques with or without radical cystectomy and heterotopic urinary diversion depending upon the site and extent of disease, as well as sex.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Locally advanced cases are best treated with multimodal therapy consisting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy (RT) followed by surgical extirpation, although experience is limited [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with metastatic disease have a poor prognosis. Management generally includes systemic therapy; in rare cases, palliative surgery may have a role.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2528672876"><span class="h2">Surgery</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2597121656"><span class="h3">Surgical approaches for males</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For males with urethral carcinoma, surgery depends upon the location and extent of disease:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with low-grade tumors or small, high-grade, noninvasive tumors may be treated with endoscopic resection [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. While this approach allows maximal functional preservation, it is also associated with a high risk of recurrence, and vigilant endoscopic follow-up is required. Patients with high-grade disease invading the subepithelial layer (cT1) ideally should be treated with segmental resection, although endoscopic management is feasible in males if the tumor can be completely resected with a pathology showing no evidence of invasive disease into the corpora.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with larger tumors or more invasive disease should undergo segmental resection with primary anastomosis, if possible. Very distal tumors near the meatus can be treated with distal urethrectomy with creation of a hypospadias. Sexual function is generally not compromised with these approaches, and patients should maintain full function, as in urethral stricture management.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>More extensive tumors involving the corpus spongiosum (T2 lesions) but not the corpus cavernosum can be treated with subtotal urethrectomy and perineal urethrostomy [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with noninvasive urothelial carcinomas of the prostate may be treated endoscopically (ie, transurethral resection) along with adjuvant Bacillus Calmètte-Guerin therapy. Complete response rates of up to 75 percent and five-year recurrence-free survival rates of 90 percent have been reported [<a href="#rid31">31-33</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with urothelial carcinoma invading the stroma of the prostate can be treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by radical cystoprostatectomy and urinary diversion, as in their bladder cancer counterpart, although there is a paucity of evidence for a survival benefit. It should be noted that prostatic stromal invasion from a primary prostatic urethral tumor is staged as T2, as compared with a bladder urothelial carcinoma that directly invades the prostatic stroma (T4). (See <a class="local">'Neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2991.html" rel="external">"Neoadjuvant treatment options for muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with locally advanced disease (cT3 to T4) should be treated with multimodal therapy including histology-directed neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Subsequent management may require extensive surgical resection to include penectomy and cystoprostatectomy with perineal reconstruction and anterior pelvic exenteration. Patients who have tumors abutting the inferior pubic ramus should undergo en bloc inferior pubectomy, and those with inguinal lymphadenopathy should undergo inguinal lymphadenectomy. (See <a class="local">'Neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H947510365"><span class="h3">Surgical approaches for females</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In females with urethral carcinoma, surgery depends upon the location and extent of disease:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with low-grade tumors or small, high-grade, noninvasive tumors may be treated with endoscopic resection, although this is very difficult to perform given the anatomic limitations. Females can maintain continence as long as the urethral sphincter is preserved.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Urethrectomy with bladder neck closure and either suprapubic cystotomy, incontinent diversion (ileovesicostomy), or a continent catheterizable stoma using the Mitrofanoff principle may be utilized in females with more extensive disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Females with advanced locoregional disease may require neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by extensive surgical resection to include anterior pelvic exenteration, including anterior vaginectomy. Patients who have tumors abutting the inferior pubic ramus should undergo en bloc inferior pubectomy. Treatment may be followed by adjuvant radiation (See <a class="local">'Neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H543490616"><span class="h2">Radiation therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>RT for urethral cancer is an alternative treatment that has the potential advantage of preserving function. Outcomes appear to be similar to those in surgical series, although the data are limited, and there is selection bias in the reported series [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Either external beam RT or brachytherapy may be used for anterior urethral tumors in males and more proximal tumors in females. </p><p>RT alone may be sufficient in patients with localized tumors (stage T1 or T2) with or without radiosensitizing chemotherapy. Locally advanced tumors are best treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by assessment of the extent of disease prior to RT. RT may also be used for management of locally advanced disease not amenable to surgical resection, or for palliation in metastatic disease.</p><p>In males, complication rates can be as high as 20 percent following RT and include fibrosis, radiation cystitis, urethritis, chronic penile edema, and rarely, fistula formation [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Urethral strictures may result from treatment with RT, and strictures require biopsy to rule out recurrent disease.</p><p>In females, definitive RT is associated with good oncologic outcomes in early-stage urethral cancers. In small series, local disease control rates between 60 and 100 percent have been reported using either brachytherapy, external beam RT, or a combination of both techniques [<a href="#rid35">35-40</a>].

Routine lymph node dissection is generally not indicated, except when enlarged nodes are identified on imaging or in those with palpable inguinal lymphadenopathy. There is some limited evidence that lymphadenectomy in males with palpable disease may improve the long-term outcomes [<a href="#rid18">18,47,48</a>]. The template of lymphadenectomy should be based on the anatomic location of the cancer within the urethra. If radical cystoprostatectomy is being performed, then a lymphadenectomy template similar to bladder cancer can be performed. In patients with prostatic urothelial carcinomas, consideration should also be made for a combined inguinal and pelvic lymphadenectomy, particularly if the disease extends into the pendulous urethra. If the carcinoma is in the distal pendulous urethra only, then a superficial and deep inguinal lymphadenectomy can be performed.</p><p>Some investigators have suggested sentinel inguinal lymph node biopsy as an alternative to inguinal lymphadenectomy; however, unlike penile cancer, this approach has not been formally evaluated in patients with urethral cancer with high false-negative rates [<a href="#rid47">47</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H138163541"><span class="h2">Adjuvant radiation therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Following surgical resection, adjuvant RT may be indicated in patients with locally advanced disease or positive resection margins, although there are limited data to guide management [<a href="#rid45">45,49</a>].

This study evaluated the use of surgery, RT, or surgery plus adjuvant RT in approximately 2600 patients with either early stage (T0 to T2, N0) or locoregionally advanced (T3 or greater, node positive) urethral cancer [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. A majority of the patients (58 percent) had urothelial carcinomas.</p><p>Among the entire study population, at median follow-up of 28 months, the three-year overall survival was 54 percent.

Among patients with squamous cell carcinoma, data suggested similar survival outcomes between all treatment approaches. However, among patients with adenocarcinoma, treatments that utilized RT were associated with improved overall survival compared with surgery alone (HR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07-0.60 for definitive RT alone; HR 0.27, 95% CI, 0.10-0.75 for surgery plus adjuvant RT) [<a href="#rid50">50</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1114405031"><span class="h2">Multimodal treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A retrospective observational study from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center suggested that patients with primary urethral cancer can benefit from multimodal therapy.

Treatments were categorized as monotherapy: surgery or radiation (57 percent); dual therapy: surgery plus radiation, surgery plus chemotherapy, chemotherapy plus radiation (21 percent); or triple therapy: surgery plus radiation plus chemotherapy (10 percent). Treatment categories accounted for primary, neoadjuvant, and adjuvant treatments but excluded any salvage treatments given after disease recurrence or progression. Most patients in both the monotherapy and dual therapy groups received surgery.</p><p>The study cohort included 74 males and 91 females, with a median age of 61 years. Common histologies were squamous cell (36 percent), urothelial (27 percent), and adenocarcinoma (25 percent). Seventy-two percent of patients had invasive disease, 24 percent had nodal involvement, and 5 percent had metastases. The median follow-up was 4.7 years.</p><p>The use of monotherapy decreased over time, while rates of dual therapy remained consistent, and rates of triple therapy increased. Treatment patterns were different among males and females, with a higher percentage of females receiving radiation therapy as part of their primary treatment (65 percent) compared with males (18 percent). Five-year local recurrence-free, distant recurrence-free, disease-specific, and overall survival were 51, 53, 48, and 41 percent, respectively. Patients receiving monotherapy had lower recurrence-free survival than patients receiving dual or triple therapy. Treatment choice was not associated with distant recurrence, cancer-specific, or overall survival.

Patients treated at academic centers with experience in the management of urethral cancer typically demonstrate superior overall survival, most likely due to the frequent use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy, radiation, and radical surgery [<a href="#rid52">52</a>].

Clinical nodal stage was the only independent predictor for overall survival. Recurrence-free survival was significantly associated with tumor location and age, in addition to clinical nodal stage.

Most patients were treated with simple surgical excision, with only 10 percent undergoing radical resection and 10 percent receiving radiation therapy (RT). On multivariate analysis, factors associated with an improved prognosis included younger age, the absence of nodal or distant metastases, and lower histologic grade. Prognosis seemed to be slightly better for patients with adenocarcinoma, with 5- and 10-year cancer-specific survivals of 68 and 60 percent, respectively. In the subset of patients with T2 to T4 nonmetastatic disease, surgery appeared to be associated with a survival benefit compared with RT, although there are numerous limitations to such comparisons.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Another SEER database study evaluated prognosis in 722 females with primary urethral cancers diagnosed between 1983 and 2008 [<a href="#rid54">54</a>].

Surgery was again the predominant form of treatment, with 69 percent undergoing some form of resection and with 42 percent receiving RT as part of their treatment. Five- and 10-year overall survivals were 43 and 32 percent, respectively, with 5- and 10-year cancer-specific survivals of 53 and 46 percent. In the multivariate analysis, negative prognostic factors included African American race, advanced tumor (T) stage, and node-positive disease.
