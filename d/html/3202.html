         Cervical cancer is the fourth most common malignancy among females globally and the leading cause of mortality among gynecologic malignancies [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Effective strategies for cervical cancer screening and treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), a precursor to cancer, have been in place for more than 70 years and, where applied, have dramatically reduced the incidence of and mortality from this disease [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         While most resource-rich countries have adopted standard cervical cancer screening strategies, such strategies (eg, cervical cytology, human papillomavirus [HPV] testing, colposcopy) are often not possible in resource-limited settings due to economic and other infrastructure limitations. Health care resources and disease burden vary among and within countries, making it difficult to draw general conclusions regarding screening strategies for the entire resource-limited world. Addressing individual countries is beyond the scope of this topic review. Therefore, cervical cancer screening in health care systems in which standard strategies are not feasible will be reviewed here.
        </p>

         The general approach to and tests used for cervical cancer screening are discussed separately.

         Worldwide, cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in females after breast, colon, and lung cancers [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The majority (over 85 percent) of new cases are diagnosed in resource-limited countries. In such countries, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer (after breast cancer) in females. In countries that have introduced successful cervical cancer screening programs, the incidence of cervical cancer has declined dramatically. In most resource-rich countries, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) for cervical cancer is less than 10/100,000, whereas in resource-limited countries, the ASIR of cervical cancer ranges from 25 to 55/100,000 [

         Barriers to implementing programs for cervical cancer prevention include competing health care demands and economic, social, and political issues [

         <strong>
          Competing health demands
         </strong>
         – Health care issues that compete with cervical cancer prevention include maternal and infant mortality and infectious diseases. For example, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic diverted resources away from cervical cancer screening. In addition, while there were approximately 342,000 deaths attributed to cervical cancer worldwide in 2020 [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ], more than 2.4 million children died within the first month of life, and there were an estimated 1.5 million new cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 10 million new cases of tuberculosis, and 241 million cases of malaria [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. HIV infection is particularly important, as it is not only a competing health priority in some regions but also exacerbates cervical neoplasia through increased incidence of oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3220.html" rel="external">
          "Screening for cervical cancer in patients with HIV infection and other immunocompromised states"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         With the scarcity of health care resources, existing health care services also tend to focus on urgent medical needs and curative, rather than preventive, health care.
        </p>
        <p>

         <strong>
          Economic factors
         </strong>
         – Economic factors also present an obstacle to screening. Resource-limited countries account for 84 percent of the global population, 90 percent of the disease burden, and 20 percent of gross domestic product, but only 12 percent of health spending [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. The disparity in per capita expenditure on health in resource-rich versus resource-limited countries is stark. In 2019, the yearly per capita expenditure on health was $10,921 in the United States, $9666 in Switzerland, and $6003 in Denmark. By contrast annual per capita health expenditure ranged from $21 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, to $46 in Bangladesh, and $64 in India [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Standard cervical cancer screening methods, such as HPV testing, cytology, or colposcopy, are costly and are not affordable considering the per capita expenditure on health in these countries.

         <strong>
          Social and political issues
         </strong>
         – Social and political conditions in resource-limited settings often impede cervical cancer screening programs. Reliable and affordable modes of communication and transportation are often lacking. Therefore, patients are not able to travel to a screening site for an initial or follow-up visit or to receive results in a timely manner. Education and literacy also make an impact. Patients in resource-limited countries may be illiterate or may use a local dialect that differs from the national language. Thus, they may not be able to read written results. Also, patients are likely to be uninformed about interventions such as cervical cancer screening, and thus, there is no public demand and no political motivation to establish such programs. War and civil strife are endemic in many resource-limited countries and are additional factors that may have devastating consequences for health care infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>

         <strong>
          Other
         </strong>
         – Other barriers include the lack of the following: medical insurance programs, medical equipment and supplies (eg, Pap spatulas and brushes, liquid fixative solutions, sterilization equipment), and trained cytopathologists or pathologists.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         These barriers result in lower rates of cervical cancer screening. In one retrospective study, the estimated number of females in resource-rich countries receiving cervical cancer screening was 63 percent (upper range: 80 to 90 percent) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. The comparative figure in resource-limited countries was 19 percent, ranging from 1 percent in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Myanmar to 73 percent in Brazil.

          SCREENING AGE AND FREQUENCY

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         While patients in resource-rich countries are often screened for cervical cancer starting at the age of 21 or 25 years and are screened every three to five years, these screening ages and frequencies are not possible in most resource-limited setting and decisions regarding screening age and frequency must be made based on available resources. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7575.html" rel="external">
          "Screening for cervical cancer in resource-rich settings", section on 'Screening in average-risk patients'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends initiation of cervical cancer screening for most patients at the age of 30 years with repeat testing every three to ten years (depending on test used); screening can be discontinued at the age of 50 years if last two consecutive screening results are negative [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Screening recommendations are different for patients with HIV. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Patients with HIV'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, for many patients in resource-limited settings, screening only occurs once or twice in a lifetime. For such patients, screening between the ages of 30 to 39 years appears to result in the largest reduction in cervical cancer incidence and mortality. This is supported by a subgroup analysis from a randomized trial in which over 80,000 patients aged 30 to 59 in India were assigned to either visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) screening or cervical cancer health education [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. At seven-year follow-up, patients in the screening group had a decrease in age-standardized rates of cervical cancer incidence (25 percent) and mortality (35 percent); these decreases were greater in patients aged 30 to 39 (incidence: 38 percent; mortality: 66 percent) compared with other age ranges (40 to 49 years: 18 and 45 percent; 50 to 59 years: 24 and 1 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         Optimal screening frequency and patient age have also been calculated using modeling studies, since longitudinal clinical data are not available. One such modeling study used clinical data from India, Thailand, Kenya, South Africa, and Peru to evaluate cervical cancer screening in patients once in a lifetime at the age of 35 years [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Within these parameters, screening with VIA or human papillomavirus (HPV) testing would reduce the lifetime risk of cervical cancer by 25 to 36 percent and cost less than USD $500 per year of life saved. Costs of the various protocols varied from country to country. By contrast, using cytology as the screening method in the United States, one study estimated that, compared with no screening, screening every three years costs $22,000 per year of life gained [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Increasing the frequency of screening to every two years would cost $440,000 for every additional year of life gained, whereas annual screening would cost $1.8 million for each additional year.

In a randomized trial of 6555 previously unscreened patients (aged 35 to 65 years) in South Africa, all patients were screened with VIA, Hybrid Capture II (HC2) HPV testing, and cytology and were assigned to one of three groups: VIA screen-positive followed by cryotherapy, HPV screen-positive followed by cryotherapy, or no further evaluation or treatment for six months [

At six-month follow-up, colposcopy with directed biopsy was performed in all patients and CIN2+ was found in fewer patients in both the VIA (2.2 percent) and HPV (0.8 percent) screen and treat groups compared with the delayed group (3.6 percent). This difference persisted at 12 and 36 months [

In a World Health Organization (WHO) demonstration project from 2005 to 2009 including approximately 19,600 patients in six African countries that included VIA screening followed by treatment with cryotherapy if positive, 39 percent of patients were screened and treated on the same day; the majority of patients (63 percent) received cryotherapy within one week of initial screening [

In one such report, based on a theoretical cohort of previously unscreened 30-year-old patients from South Africa, a single visit in which screen-positive VIA or HPV testing is coupled with cryotherapy would be more cost-effective than two-visit protocols with HPV or cytology (lifetime cost per patient USD $39 to 41 versus $42 to 44) [

          Disadvantages
         </strong>
         – An aspect of the screen and treat approach that has not been well evaluated is the impact of point-of-care testing at a primary care level. The single-visit approach does not obviate the need for counseling or careful explanation and requires additional work on already overloaded health care workers and fragile health systems. Careful evaluation and planning are needed to plan how to integrate this approach with other aspects of general health visits.

         – Xpert HPV uses polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology to detect 14 high-risk types of HPV, including HPV 16 and 18/45. It gives a result within one hour and is uniquely positioned to provide screening and treatment in one visit. The manufacturer has implemented point-of-care tuberculosis testing using similar technology (GeneXpert) in sub-Saharan Africa.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Additional advantages of Xpert HPV are that the test can be performed on site and batched so that each cartridge can be inserted into the machine singularly, rather than having to fill 80 or more wells to run samples simultaneously. It can be performed by an individual who is trained but not as a fully credentialed laboratory assistant. In one prospective study including 1121 patients (ages 30 to 65 years and over half of whom were living with HIV), cervical samples were collected for Xpert HPV testing, and all patients underwent colposcopy and histological sampling with consensus pathology review. Modifying cycle thresholds of the Xpert HPV assay allowed specificity to improve (from 63 to &gt;80 percent) without loss of sensitivity. Improved specificity results in lower rates of overtreatment, an important consideration for use of HPV DNA testing. [

         HPV testing reduces cervical cancer mortality in resource-limited settings and is superior to VIA or cervical cytology. This was illustrated in a randomized trial of 131,746 patients aged 30 to 59 years in rural India that compared a single lifetime screening with one of three screening modalities with standard care; the screening modalities were HPV testing using the HC2, cervical cytology, or VIA [

At eight-year follow-up, patients who received HPV testing versus standard care had a 50 percent reduction in stage II or higher cervical cancer (15 versus 33 per 100,000 person-years) and cervical cancer mortality (13 versus 26 per 100,000 person-years). For the groups screened by cytology or VIA, rates of stage II or higher cervical cancer (VIA: 32 per 100,000 person-years; cytology: 23 per 100,000 person-years) or cervical cancer mortality (VIA: 21 per 100,000 person-years; cytology: 21 per 100,000 person-years) were similar compared with standard care but were higher than patients in the HPV testing group. This result for VIA differed from the finding of the trial in 80,000 patients described below (see

          'Acetic acid'

         Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing has a high sensitivity but a low specificity. Specificity takes on added importance in resource-limited settings whether follow-up for a positive test is further evaluated or immediately treated. Additional costs are incurred when patients with false-positive screening tests are referred for a costly test like colposcopy. Also, where treatment is performed based on a screening test, low test specificity may result in large numbers of patients being treated unnecessarily.
        </p>
        <p>
         One approach to the low specificity of HPV testing is to change the definition of a positive test. In the case of HPV testing, the definition of a positive test can be varied by changing the positivity threshold (expressed as the ratio of light emission or relative light units [RLU] per positive control specimen [PC]). As for most tests, increasing the specificity results in a decrease in sensitivity. In a study of over 2900 patients in South Africa in which detection of CIN2+ by HC2 at a threshold of &gt;1 RLU/PC (the typical standard) had a sensitivity of 88 percent and specificity of 82 percent, while a threshold of &gt;8 RLU/PC had a sensitivity of 79 percent and specificity of 90 percent [

         For patients who do not have access to a speculum examination or who are reluctant to undergo a pelvic examination, self-collected vaginal samples can be used for HPV testing [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. Patients can collect samples from the vagina using a tampon, Dacron or cotton swab, cytobrush, or cervicovaginal lavage. Self-collection can be performed under supervision at a clinic or at home. If a patient collects a sample at home, it is then placed in a collection tube with a transport medium and brought back to the clinic for processing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Self-collected samples appear to be acceptable to patients and as effective at detecting high-grade CIN as provider-collected screening methods. In a randomized trial of 12,330 patients in Mexico, patients underwent either self-collection of HPV samples (with a cervical brush) or cervical cytology performed at a clinic [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. The acceptability of self-collected HPV testing was high; 98 percent of patients in the HPV testing group agreed to collect the sample and performed the testing, while 89 percent of those scheduled for a Pap test had the test performed. HPV testing had a higher sensitivity for detection of CIN2+ (relative sensitivity 2.9, 95% CI 2-4.1) and for invasive cancer (3.6, 95% CI 1.6-7.9). The disadvantage of HPV testing was that more patients underwent colposcopy and ultimately had negative findings: 28 percent in the HPV testing group compared with none in the cytology group. For CIN2+, the positive predictive value of HPV testing was 12.2 percent compared with 90.5 percent for cytology.
        </p>
        <p>
         Similarly, in a meta-analysis including 56 accuracy studies and 25 randomized trials, self-collected compared with clinician-collected samples had similar absolute pooled sensitivity (96 percent) when high-risk HPV (hrHPV) assays for CIN2+ based on polymerase chain reaction were used [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. In addition, patients receiving a self-sampling kit rather than a reminder letter to attend a clinician-screening appointment had higher response rates (pooled relative participation rate of 2.3, 95% CI 1.9-2.9); however, response rates were highly variable among different settings.
        </p>
        <p>
         Further study is needed to determine the best method of self-collection (eg, swab, cervical brush, tampon). In an earlier meta-analysis, which included 12 studies also used in the meta-analysis described above [
         <a href="#rid28">

         <a href="#rid29">
          29

         ]. Seven studies used a Dacron or cotton swab or a cytobrush, for which the pooled sensitivity and specificity for HPV detection was 78 and 90 percent. For three studies in which a tampon was used, the sensitivities and specificities ranged from 67 to 94 percent and 80 to 100 percent, respectively. These data, unfortunately, do not allow comparison among the methods.

However, it has reemerged as a screening tool in resource-limited settings because, despite its limited specificity and low positive predictive value (around 10 percent), it is economical, requires little equipment, and provides immediate results [

Primary care clinicians or midlevel providers can also be trained to perform visual inspection within a relatively short period of time; however, due to the subjective nature of the test, it is difficult to standardize quality control. Improved training and quality control may be obtained by utilizing smartphone technology (smartphone VIA [S-VIA]) and allowing remote expert reviewers to view cervical images and provide diagnostic and management feedback [

         Combining two screening tests (eg, HPV followed by VIA or cytology) has also been described as is the preferred screening test in resource-limited settings for patients with HIV (see

          'Patients with HIV'

        <p>
         Two-test strategies can be either: additive, with screen-positive defined as an abnormal result on either test; or sequential, in which only patients with an abnormal result on the first test undergo a second test and only those who are also positive on the second test would receive treatment [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Use of a two-test approach decreases the number of patients receiving unnecessary treatment. In a prospective study of 1266 South African patients (ages 35 to 65 years), patients underwent sequential screening with Hybrid Capture I HPV testing and VIA; VIAM, cervicography (a photograph of the cervix after application of acetic acid), and cytology were also performed [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. Patients with abnormal results on any of the screening tests underwent colposcopy at a follow-up visit. Sequential screening resulted in lower rates of unnecessary treatment (22 to 41 patients without disease/1000 patients screened) compared with either VIA (182/1000) or HPV alone (137/1000).
        </p>

         A disadvantage of this approach is that more patients are lost to follow-up than with single-test screen-and-treat protocols.

         The use of optical devices to either triage HPV testing or to use as a primary screening test is a new approach under evaluation. These devices use the technology included in smart phones (smartphone VIA [S-VIA]) and are able to take pictures of the cervix and to store data. Essentially, a mobile phone is used as a colposcopist aid. Ultimately, these devices will rely on artificial intelligence (AI) but clinical validation is awaited as algorithms are tested and developed. The use of AI to interpret cytology specimens has also been described [

         Multi-visit protocols include a screening test followed by a second (or more) visit based on results from the screening test. This approach requires communication of test results to the patient after each step. Two-visit protocols typically include a first visit with cervical cytology or human papillomavirus (HPV) testing followed by a second visit with colposcopy and treatment based on colposcopic impression. The three-visit protocol is the standard approach to cervical cancer screening in resource-rich settings; this approach typically includes HPV testing and/or cytology, followed by colposcopy, and then treatment based on the results of colposcopic biopsies.

         – An abnormal HPV or cytology result is followed by colposcopy, which requires a level of clinical expertise typically found only in tertiary health care facilities, if available at all, and histology requires a laboratory infrastructure and trained pathologists, all of which are in short supply in resource-limited countries.

         Overtreatment, defined as treatment of lesions that are actually low grade, is an important concern with multi-visit protocols, as with one-visit protocols (see
         <a class="local">
          'Role of combining two screening tests'
         </a>
         above). The risk of overtreatment also appears to increase when there is a discrepancy between cervical cytology and colposcopic impression and with treatment in the presence of a low-grade colposcopic appearance. In a meta-analysis of 13 studies including 4611 patients managed with cervical cytology followed by colposcopy and treatment (with loop electrosurgical excision procedure [LEEP]), overtreatment rates for differing combinations of cytology and colposcopic impression were as follows: high-grade cytology and high-grade colposcopic impression (11.6 percent), high-grade and low-grade (29.3 percent), low-grade and high-grade (46.4 percent), and low-grade and low-grade (72.9 percent) [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>
         ]. Thus, for patients with a discrepancy between cervical cytology results and colposcopic impression, with a low-grade colposcopic impression, and who are able to comply with a three-visit protocol, biopsy and treatment only for a histologic result of cervical intraepithelial lesion 2 or 3 is prudent. This is particularly true for patients who plan future pregnancy such treatments may result in adverse obstetric outcomes. (See

         Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is treated with excisional (eg, loop electrosurgical excision procedure [LEEP], cold knife conization) and ablative (eg, cryotherapy, CO

         laser ablation, thermal ablation) techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
         The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends LEEP over cryotherapy in settings where LEEP is available [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51

         ]. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, in most resource-limited settings, cryotherapy rather than LEEP is often the preferred treatment as it is generally easier and cheaper to perform in a primary care setting, and a handheld portable device is available. Cryotherapy also does not require local anesthetic, and complication rates are low [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52,53
         </a>
         ]. In the randomized trial discussed above (see
         <a class="local">
          'Advantages and disadvantages'
         </a>
         above), adverse effects reported by patients who underwent cryotherapy included vaginal discharge (78 percent), abdominal pain (30 percent), and abnormal bleeding (14 percent); only one patient had bleeding that required hospitalization [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Patients who underwent cryotherapy had more unscheduled visits during the study period than those who did not (1 versus 0.5 percent). This study was limited by the protocol used, since screening was followed two to six days later by treatment in the screen and treat groups, while a one-visit approach is generally completed in one day. In fact, in this trial, 82 patients did not return after the initial screening visit.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since 2018, thermal ablation (also called cold coagulation or thermocoagulation) has regained popularity as a method of ablating the transformation zone due to the difficulty of acquiring gas (which is required for cryotherapy) in resource-limited settings. The WHO endorsed the use of such devices for the treatment of precancerous cervical lesions in 2019 [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54

         Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination should be used together with cervical cancer screening to decrease the risk of cervical cancer. In resource-limited settings, expert groups recommend that public health efforts focus primarily on vaccinating young females, the group in which the absolute benefit of HPV vaccination is the highest. In a modeling study in 78 low-income and lower middle-income countries, HPV vaccination of young females had minimal predicted impact on cervical cancer mortality, but vaccination in addition to twice-lifetime Pap smear screening and scaled up cancer treatment was projected to decrease the mortality from cervical cancer by approximately 33 percent by the year 2030 and 99 percent by the year 2120 [

         In general, screening of pregnant patients in resource-limited settings is not recommended, particularly after 20 weeks of gestation. Quality of cytology is impaired due to the high levels of progestogen in pregnant patients, which renders endocervical secretions more viscid and limits exfoliative cytology [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57,58

         ]. Furthermore, in such settings, pregnant patients often initiate care late and follow-up post screening is poor.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, if performed and cytology shows a precancerous abnormality, colposcopy is recommended to exclude evidence of microinvasion. However, histological sampling of the cervix should only be performed if a lesion is present that appears to be high-grade. Otherwise, further follow-up can be delayed until postpartum. (See

Screening between these ages appears to result in the largest reduction in cervical cancer incidence and mortality. (See

         For patients in whom more frequent testing can be performed, we initiate screening at age 30 years and repeat testing every three to ten years (depending on test used) until age 50 years. (See

          Screen-and-treat protocols
         </strong>
         – Screen-and-treat protocols include a screening test followed in the same visit by treatment of positive results. This approach is only possible in settings where tests that produce immediate results (ie, rapid-result human papillomavirus [HPV] testing, visual inspection) are available. Such protocols eliminate communication difficulties involved in delivering and interpreting written results as well as the issue of noncompliance with follow-up. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Screen-and-treat protocols'

         <strong>
          Rapid-result HPV
         </strong>
         – For patients undergoing a screen-and-treat protocol, we prefer HPV testing rather than visual inspection  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef140161" href="/z/d/graphic/140161.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). This is consistent with the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. Rapid-result HPV tests include Xpert HPV (Cepheid) and careHPV (Qiagen)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef129179" href="/z/d/graphic/129179.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ); screening with these tests is repeated every five to ten years. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Preferred: HPV testing'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         For patients screened using HPV testing who do not have access to a speculum examination or who are reluctant to undergo a pelvic examination, self-collection of vaginal samples rather than clinician-collected samples is a reasonable option. There is insufficient evidence regarding the best method for self-collection (eg, swab, cytobrush, cervicovaginal lavage). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Self-collected samples'

         <strong>
          Visual inspection
         </strong>
         – Visual inspection of the cervix every three years is an alternate approach to cervical cancer screening when an affordable HPV rapid-result test in not available. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Alternate: Visual inspection methods'

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         For patients screened using visual inspection, we prefer visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) rather than with Lugol iodine (visual inspection with Lugol iodine [VILI]) or magnification (VIA with or without magnification [VIAM]). In our experience, VIA allows for a more nuanced and detailed analysis of the dysplastic area. (See

          Multi-visit protocols
         </strong>
         – Unfortunately, due to the barriers discussed above, the multi-visit protocol approach used in resource-rich countries has not been replicated in resource-limited countries and is unavailable to most patients. (See

          Treatment
         </strong>
         – Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) can be treated with excisional (eg, loop electrosurgical excision procedure [LEEP]) and ablative (eg, cryotherapy) techniques. While LEEP is the preferred treatment option, cryotherapy is more commonly performed given the resources available in resource-limited settings. (See

          HPV vaccination
