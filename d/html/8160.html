         In most patients with chronic aortic regurgitation (AR), the disease evolves in a slow and insidious manner with a very low morbidity during a long asymptomatic phase. While some patients with mild AR do not progress for decades, others exhibit progression of the regurgitant lesion with the gradual development of severe AR with subsequent left ventricular dilation, systolic dysfunction, and eventually heart failure  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54569" href="/z/d/graphic/54569.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         ). (See

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The volume load that burdens the left ventricle in patients with chronic AR leads to a series of compensatory myocardial and circulatory adjustments that can be affected by pharmacologic therapy and reversed by valve replacement. Thus, the management of patients with this disorder requires an understanding of the natural history of the disease, the limited role of medical therapy, and the timing of surgery [

         Chronic AR generally evolves slowly with a long asymptomatic compensated phase with some patients developing worsening regurgitation that may progress to severe AR with left ventricular (LV) dilation, LV systolic dysfunction, and heart failure  (

         Data from case series of patients with chronic AR have been used to develop criteria to define compensated and decompensated phases of chronic severe AR  (

         The nature of the transition from a compensated to a decompensated phase is poorly understood, and the definition of such a transition has not been validated in a prospective fashion. The transitional phase appears to develop during the latter portion of stage C (C2) [

         ]. Thus, these phases should only be used as general guidelines in making clinical decisions that include all other clinical data and patient preferences. Intercurrent illness, such as infective endocarditis, may alter the clinical course of a patient with mild AR, worsening the degree of regurgitation, and precipitating the need for surgery. Nevertheless, this information has been useful in defining limits that are predictive of the future need for aortic valve replacement [

         Patients with chronic AR should be monitored for changes in symptoms, severity of AR, and LV systolic dysfunction to reassess the stage of AR. The clinical stages of chronic AR are defined by symptoms, valve anatomy, severity of regurgitation, and LV systolic function (generally quantified as LVEF and LV end-systolic dimension [LVESD])  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53536" href="/z/d/graphic/53536.html" rel="external">
          table 2B

         ) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Serial monitoring of the severity of AR is generally performed by transthoracic echocardiogram since physical findings are not reliable. If the echocardiogram is inconclusive, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is suggested. Cardiac catheterization is recommended if noninvasive tests are inconclusive or if there is a need to assess coronary anatomy prior to aortic valve surgery. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8159.html" rel="external">

         Patients with chronic AR should undergo at least yearly clinical evaluation including history and physical examination [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The key symptoms for staging of AR are symptoms of heart failure (and occasionally angina), which generally develop as late manifestations in patients with severe AR. Symptoms may include exertional dyspnea or more severe symptoms of heart failure such as orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Some patients with chronic AR develop exertional or nocturnal angina in the absence of coexistent coronary artery disease due to reduction in coronary flow reserve [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ] Patients should be educated on the possible symptoms that may develop and be encouraged to report any that develop prior to the next scheduled routine visit. The physical examination may reveal signs of progressive valvular and ventricular changes but confirmation by imaging is required for staging.

         Echocardiography is the mainstay for serial monitoring and evaluation of patients with chronic AR. For patients with suspected moderate or severe AR with inconclusive echocardiography findings, CMR provides accurate quantitation of AR regurgitant volume and fraction and precise measurement of LV volumes and function. CMR is particularly helpful when the degree of LV dilation seems greater than expected for AR severity on echocardiography. CMR may also be useful in patients thought to have severe AR without LV enlargement; the diagnosis of severe AR should be questioned if the LV end-diastolic volume or dimension is not increased. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, aortic angiography provides a semiquantitative assessment of AR severity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Evaluation of LV size and function is important because these parameters predict outcome and do not correlate well with symptoms. As an example, in one report of 450 patients, 28 percent of patients with an LVEF &lt;35 percent were asymptomatic, a value not significantly different from the 37 percent of patients with an LVEF ≥50 percent who were asymptomatic [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Using imaging techniques, LV systolic function is generally quantified as LVEF. Increases in LVESD also reflect worsening LV systolic function. Increased LV end-diastolic dimension (&gt;60 to 65 mm) is also associated with risk of development of symptoms or LV systolic dysfunction, but less so than LVESD [

         With periodic echocardiographic monitoring, some studies can be limited to evaluate only the severity of AR, LV size, and systolic function with a more complete study at longer intervals. In addition to this schedule for routine monitoring, echocardiography should be performed more frequently if the patient becomes symptomatic or has equivocal symptoms or a decline in exercise tolerance.

         Aortic valve surgery (predominantly aortic valve replacement) is the mainstay of treatment of symptomatic severe AR or asymptomatic severe AR with LV systolic dysfunction. The role of pharmacologic therapy in treatment of severe chronic AR is limited to symptomatic patients (or asymptomatic patients with LV systolic dysfunction) who are not candidates for aortic valve surgery. In addition, pharmacologic therapy is used to treat symptomatic patients with severe AR in preparation for aortic valve surgery.

         The role of pharmacologic therapy in the treatment of chronic AR is limited since efficacy of such therapy has not been established. Routine vasodilator therapy is not recommended in patients with chronic asymptomatic AR and normal LV function as there is no evidence that vasodilator therapy alters the disease course in this setting [

         For symptomatic patients with severe AR who are candidates for valve surgery, valve replacement is recommended after a period of intense medical treatment for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) including diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, single-agent angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) [

         Patients with chronic AR should receive treatment for hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg). Vasodilators such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8627" href="/z/d/drug information/8627.html" rel="external">
          amlodipine
         </a>
         ) may be favored since they may reduce systolic blood pressure in this setting. Beta blocker therapy may be less effective in this setting since reduction in heart rate and associated increase in stroke volume may contribute to elevated systolic pressure. The reduction in heart rate also leads to an increase in the duration of diastole, which can contribute to an increase in the regurgitant volume.

        <p>
         Borderline or even definite LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF &lt;50 percent) of short duration may not carry the same ominous prognosis as a prolonged period of LV dysfunction. If LV dysfunction is present for less than 14 months, corrective surgery is more likely to reverse the volume-overload state and to allow recovery of the ventricle [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. In contrast, more prolonged LV dysfunction, particularly in association with congestive symptoms, is usually predictive of a poor LV response to corrective surgery. However, aortic valve surgery is still beneficial in patients with prolonged LV dysfunction; while the LV response may be suboptimal (persistent LV enlargement and low LVEF), the reduction in regurgitant volume is followed by a reduction in LV filling pressures and a reduction in congestive symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some consideration of body size should be included in any estimation of LV dimension, since smaller women are less likely to reach the above criteria that were established in men [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,33
         </a>
         ]. However, simply indexing to body surface area can lead to misleading conclusions, especially in obese patients. In general, somewhat lower values should be used in very small patients and somewhat higher values in very large patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         The importance of timely aortic valve surgery for chronic AR was suggested by a prospective study of 170 patients [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. Sixty patients underwent early surgery according to standard guideline recommendations (for New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class II symptoms, an LVEF between 45 and 50 percent, and/or an LVESD between 50 and 55 mm) and 110 patients underwent "too late" surgery, defined as occurring in the presence of severe symptoms (NYHA class III or IV), an LVEF &lt;45 percent, or an LVESD &gt;55 mm.

         At a mean follow-up of 10 years, mortality was significantly higher in the patients who underwent "too late" surgery compared with those undergoing early surgery (37 versus 12 percent). The increase in mortality was largely due to more deaths from heart failure or sudden death in the "too late" surgery group (20 versus 1).

         Surgery after the onset of severe symptoms was associated with worse outcomes. Patients with NYHA functional class III or IV symptoms compared with those with no or only mild (NYHA class II) symptoms, had significant increases in both operative mortality (14 versus 3 percent) and long-term cardiac mortality (35 versus 10 percent).

          Aortic valve repair

          —
         </span>
         As noted above, most patients with AR require aortic valve replacement but aortic valve repair is an option for some patients with chronic AR [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,35-38
         </a>
         ]. Aortic valve repair has the major advantages compared to aortic valve replacement of low thromboembolic risk, which avoids the need for chronic anticoagulation, preservation of a near normal aortic valve orifice, and the potential for a less complicated reoperation. The main disadvantages are a higher rate of reoperation (about 15 percent at ten years) and less widespread surgical experience [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. Valve repair has more often been performed in young patients  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98169" href="/z/d/graphic/98169.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Use of aortic valve repair is primarily limited to AR due to aortic root dilatation and/or excess cusp motion since repair of retracted or heavily calcified valves (such as rheumatic valves) has not provided long-term success [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35,40
         </a>
         ]. Aortic valve repair may consist of an isolated aortic valve sparing operation, an isolated aortic cusp repair, or a combination of these procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
         The predictive value of aortic valve anatomy for valve repairability was evaluated in a study of 163 patients undergoing surgery for AR [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. The mechanism of aortic regurgitation was classified as due to aortic root dilatation (type 1), excess cusp motion, including cusp prolapse and cusp fenestrations, with good cusp tissue quality (type 2), or poor cusp tissue quality including cusp retraction, extensive cusp calcifications and/or endocarditis (type 3). Type 1 and 2 lesions were considered repairable unless cusp body calcification was present, while type 3 lesions were considered nonrepairable. Transesophageal echocardiography classification of lesion type agreed strongly with surgical inspection (93 percent) and was strongly predictive of valve repairability and postoperative outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
         The outcomes after aortic valve repair were evaluated in a 2004 report from the Mayo Clinic of 160 patients who underwent repair procedures, there was one early death, a need for repeat repair during the initial hospitalization, and 16 late deaths at a mean follow-up of 4.2 years, only two of which might have been related to AR [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ]. The survival rate was similar to that of an age- and sex-matched control population. Reoperation, primarily aortic valve replacement for severe AR, was required in 9, 11, and 15 percent of patients at three, five, and seven years, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another study compared the short-term outcomes in 44 patients with a bicuspid aortic valve and chronic AR who underwent valve repair to 44 patients matched for age and left ventricular function who underwent valve replacement [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37

         <span class="glyph">

         Freedom from repeat valve surgery at five years for progressive AR or endocarditis was similar in the two groups: 91 versus 94 percent. However, freedom from moderate to severe AR at five years was significantly lower with valve repair (79 versus 94 percent).

         Off-label first generation self-expanding transcatheter heart valve (CoreValve) use for chronic aortic regurgitation has been tried but limited by insufficient anchoring of the transcatheter heart valve within the noncalcified aortic annulus and the risk of residual AR with resulting high rate (18.8 percent) of acute valve-in-valve implantations [

         An echocardiogram should be performed approximately six weeks to three months after valve implantation to provide an assessment of the effects of surgery and to serve as a baseline for future comparison [

          3

         ]. A good predictor of the eventual improvement in LV function is the reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, approximately 80 percent of which occurs in the first 10 to 14 days after surgery [

         The frequency of follow-up depends upon the patient’s clinical condition. After the first postoperative evaluation, asymptomatic patients with an uncomplicated course are generally seen yearly. Routine serial echocardiography is not usually indicated if the first postoperative echocardiogram shows a substantial reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, the LVEF is normal, and the patient is asymptomatic. Echocardiography is warranted if the patient develops new symptoms or signs, such as a new murmur.

          Monitoring

         – Patients with chronic AR should be monitored for changes in symptoms, severity of AR, and LV systolic dysfunction to reassess the stage of AR.
