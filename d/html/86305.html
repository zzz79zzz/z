         Optimal care for seriously ill patients should be individualized; reflect each patient’s preferences, hopes, and values; and be shaped by each patient’s unique physical, emotional, social, spiritual, and cultural needs. Culture shapes one’s experience of illness and death in clinically meaningful ways.
        </p>
        <p>
         Culture is a broad concept that encompasses aspects of an individual’s person’s experience, such as socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, identity, norms, traditions, beliefs, and habits. Culture may apply to some groups broadly or apply to individuals in unique ways. To provide effective care while avoiding stereotyping, clinicians need tools and skills for approaching patients in a culturally appropriate manner. Becoming familiar with commonly encountered attitudes, beliefs, and norms among different groups can serve as a starting point for clinicians wishing to provide culturally appropriate care to individual patients. A clinician must be willing to learn about patients’ cultural backgrounds while maintaining a humble curiosity about how each individual patient does and does not represent the dominant values of their cultural traditions. Clinicians must do all of this while also being aware of their own background assumptions, personal and professional, both of which are shaped by culture.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will address several components of culture and offer practical advice regarding the provision of culturally appropriate palliative and end-of-life care. Throughout this topic, we have endeavored to use consistent terminology in discussing socially constructed and politically charged terms, such as race, regardless of the term chosen in the individual studies discussed. We use the term “White” when discussing people who identify themselves as non-Hispanic Whites, European American, or of European ancestry. We use the term “Black” when discussing people who identify themselves as Black, African American, or of African ancestry. We use the terms “Native American,” “Hispanic,” and “Asian” to describe individuals who identify with each of those communities. When particular countries, regions of origin, religious backgrounds, or other sociocultural details are relevant, we describe those specifically (eg, Chinese American or Black Caribbean peoples). When we discuss populations who have borne the brunt of systemic oppression, racism, and injustice, we describe them as “historically marginalized.”

         Culture is typically defined as a body of values, perspectives, beliefs, behaviors, and traditions that are salient within a specific group or for some at the individual level. Race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, social class, immigrant status, experiential racism and systemic oppression, religion, and family constellation can all intersect to create an individual person’s culture [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. At its most basic, culture is the world any person inhabits, and it informs how they understand themselves and impacts their actions. Notably, people can inhabit multiple cultures simultaneously in both their personal and professional lives. (See

         Culturally appropriate care enables clinicians to deliver services that are respectful of and responsive to the health beliefs, practices, and linguistic needs of all patients. Such care ideally demonstrates “cultural humility” [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ], which is not dependent on the discrete mastery of a fixed and finite body of knowledge [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Cultural humility is defined as a process of openness and self-awareness in which one incorporates self-reflection and critique while interacting with all individuals [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Cultural humility recognizes that culture is mutable over time and uniquely defined in the context of a patient’s life experiences and beliefs. It requires the clinician’s active engagement with and curiosity about each patient as a person, including how the patient fits into their larger cultural community. It also requires that clinicians reflect on how their own culture and the culture of contemporary biomedicine [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ] may be interacting with the patient’s culture to influence patient care and the patient-clinician relationship [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,6,7
         </a>
         ]. As an example, medical values about the importance of clinician detachment and objectivity may represent barriers to culturally appropriate care, particularly among historically marginalized groups [

         </span>
         Multiple barriers to high-quality end-of-life care for patients have been identified, especially for patients from historically marginalized groups. One example is a failure on the part of clinicians to provide culturally appropriate care that considers differences in cultural attitudes toward suffering, death, decision-making styles, varying roles of family or friends, and patient and family preferences for information-sharing [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,8,9
         </a>
         ]. For patients living with serious illness, cultural disparities have been noted in the provision of adequate pain management [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ], access to and use of hospice care [

         engagement with advance care planning (ACP) and completion of advance directives (ADs) [

         The importance of understanding the patient and family or other loved one’s cultural background and how it relates to their decision-making process and approach to illness, pain, grief, dying, and bereavement is underscored by the inclusion of cultural aspects of care as one of the domains in the

         Many of the myriad traditions and customs that help to shape a person’s cultural environment have a significant relation to health and illness, including issues related to dietary practices, folk remedies, and certain religious customs. While it is not possible to describe even a fraction of these medically relevant traditions and customs, it is important to have an awareness of their significance, as well as the openness and skills to explore them further with individual patients. Many of these health-based traditions and customs are directly related to the patient’s worldview, religion, or spiritual beliefs. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2753.html" rel="external">

         Illness and death are among the most powerful and mysterious phenomena in our existence, and people often seek meaning in these experiences through spirituality. Questions that can help clinicians learn more about patients’ customs, religion, and spirituality can be found in the table  (

         The needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, and questioning/nonconforming (LGBTQIA+) patients are important to understand and address. This topic and techniques for understanding sexual and gender issues, customs, and taboos are presented elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2753.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Some important points that are relevant to palliative and end-of-life care are worth noting here. The inclusion of all care partners in medical decision-making is essential. While research on this topic is limited, inclusion of care partners has also been identified as a high priority for LGBTQIA+ patients [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. For many LGBTQIA+ individuals, as well as many other patients, the concept of family may be broad and considered “family members by choice” rather than by birth. Nonetheless, the majority of LGBTQIA+ patients have not named a surrogate decision-maker or formalized this process through an advance directive (AD) [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25-29
         </a>
         ]. The adoption of same-sex marriage laws across the United States as of 2015 has allowed for married LGBTQIA+ care partners to be considered default surrogate decision-makers in those states that have default surrogate laws. However, for unmarried partners, for “family members by choice,” or in states without the default surrogate legal provision, LGBTQIA+ partners remain at risk for exclusion and often continue to experience stigma. For example, partners facing the loss of same-sex loved ones may experience grief that is not recognized as legitimate by uninformed parties [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25,30
         </a>
         ]. In such cases, these patients and families may need additional support [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24,25
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In many parts of the world, binary gender roles are still strictly defined and enforced. For example, in some cultures, the male role is seen as that of protector and spokesperson for the family. Cultural differences in attitudes towards sexuality and gender roles should be addressed with tact and respect to maintain the therapeutic relationship. Health care providers must respect differing sexual and gender identities when working with patients of all cultures to promote a trusting relationship.

         Pain and suffering are complex phenomena encompassing aspects of physical pain, psychosocial distress, and spiritual and existential suffering. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2198.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of spirituality in palliative care", section on 'Spiritual distress and existential suffering'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         An individual's experience of pain is subjective and personal, influenced by a complex interaction of multiple biological, psychological, and social factors, which, together, result in variability in the experience of and response to pain. Differences in self-reported pain are corroborated by scientific data demonstrating biological variations in mechanisms that contribute to one's pain response. For example, studies demonstrate interindividual differences in cerebral activation in response to identical pain stimuli. Additionally, genetic differences, such as different haplotypes of the gene that encodes catechol-O-methyltransferase and variations in the mu-opioid receptor gene, influence pain sensitivity, presentation, and impact [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Such biological and genetic differences interact with psychosocial and cultural variables to influence each individual’s pain experience. Although research may report differences in the pain experience between persons of different demographic groups, the demographic factors likely serve as proxies for underlying factors that modulate the experience of pain or its expression for each individual [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients can experience several types of pain simultaneously, and one type of pain (eg, physical) may contribute to another type of pain (eg, psychological). Further, experiences of physical and existential suffering may be given meaning through cultural understanding [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. Differences in how people perceive, experience, and communicate pain have been documented, and culture may play an important role [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33,34
         </a>
         ]. Individual patients will respond differently to pain and to strategies to manage pain. Sample questions for taking a culturally appropriate pain history following an “explanatory models approach” [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ] can be found in the table  (

          Attitudes about discussing serious illness and death

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Patients express a variety of attitudes toward discussing life-threatening illness and death, both within and across cultural boundaries [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ]. It is important to consider these attitudinal variations because a patient’s attitude toward death may influence clinical decision-making practices (eg, patient-centered versus family-centered decision-making) as well as end-of-life treatment preferences (eg, using ADs, electing hospice care, etc). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Hospice referral and use'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         There are broad geographical and cultural underpinnings in these attitudes. For example, clinical settings that are schooled in Western bioethics tend to value autonomy, agency, and transparency, entailing full disclosure between the doctor and the patient, even for life-threatening diagnoses and terminal prognoses. By contrast, many patients from other cultures might prefer not knowing when they have a terminal illness [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37,38
         </a>
         ], and some patients believe that discussing death might in fact hasten its occurrence [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38-42
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, cultural norms are fluid, and one cannot make assumptions about how any given individual might wish to approach discussing serious illness or the possibility of death. Clinicians should ascertain each patient’s unique needs and refrain from making assumptions based on patients’ culture [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. Because it is impossible to predict individual preferences, clinicians should ask all patients how much and what type of information they wish to receive in order to tailor the approach to information disclosure to the patient’s preferences. Clinicians should also explore the patient’s preferences for how much information is to be shared with individual family members. (See

          37,43,45
         </a>

         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. For example, in one study of English- and Spanish-speaking older adults receiving care in a public safety net hospital in the United States, close to 20 percent reported they did not want to make their own medical decisions and preferred family, friends, or clinicians make decisions for them [
         <a href="#rid46">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         While Western biomedicine has made great efforts to instill individuals with decision-making power, some patients prefer to take a more passive stance in medical decisions, relying to a greater degree on clinicians’ medical expertise to guide treatment decisions [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. The processes and ideals of the shared decision-making model of Western biomedical practice may confuse individuals from cultures in which healers receive deferential treatment; indeed, they may lose confidence in clinicians who ask for patients’ views [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. Clinicians must carefully balance patients’ individual communication and decision-making preferences when seeking to provide medical care that is consistent with patients’ goals and values. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Assessing communication, information-sharing, and decision-making preferences'

         The goal of advance care planning (ACP) is to help ensure people receive medical care that is consistent with their values, goals, and preferences during serious and chronic illness. The definition of ACP continues to evolve over time. In response to high-profile court cases in the 1970s, ACP was initially defined as legal documents about end-of-life procedures. The definition was subsequently updated in 2017 as “a process that supports adults at any age or stage of health in understanding and sharing their personal values, life goals, and preferences regarding future medical care” [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. The definition has evolved still further to focus on preparation of patients and surrogates for communication and medical decision-making for both current and future medical care [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49,50
         </a>
         ]. Many ACP activities may occur in health care settings, but many may also occur in patients’ homes and communities. In the health care setting, ACP documentation includes clinical notes reflecting discussions between patients and clinicians about patient preferences for care; patient-provided documents and legal forms, such as ADs, living wills, documentation of proxy decision-makers for health care; and clinician-completed documents such as Physician/Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment forms. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86248.html" rel="external">
          "Advance care planning and advance directives"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         ACP is a form of decision-making based on underlying values, and a patient’s cultural norms likely influence their personal preferences surrounding ACP discussion and documentation. While there are differences in rates of ACP and completion of ADs based on race and ethnicity, the cause of these differences is likely complex [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. In general, White patients tend to have higher rates of completion than persons from underrepresented and historically marginalized groups [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,12,17-23,52-55
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Research points to several mechanisms that intersect to explain disparities in engagement with ACP. Some factors may stem from patients, including knowledge about ACP [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ], health literacy, degree of comfort discussing death, preferences for or against aggressive care near the end of life, spiritual beliefs, and attitudes and/or distrust toward modern health care institutions [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,56
         </a>
         ]. Historical acts of injustice committed within the health care system, such as the infamous Tuskegee Syphilis Study, have also contributed to a milieu of distrust that likely impacts some patient populations and may contribute to disparities in ACP [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,12,44,56,57
         </a>
         ]. Clinicians also play an important role in their patients’ engagement with ACP. For example, unconscious biases and assumptions about a patient’s preferences (based on cultural stereotypes or other factors) may influence a clinician’s decision to engage in ACP with their patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important for clinicians to clarify that the process of ACP is meant to empower patients to discuss their treatment preferences with trusted friends, family, and/or health care providers to ensure that their voices can be heard and their wishes known if their decisional capacity or ability to communicate a preference is ever compromised.

         </span>
         There are many studies documenting race- and ethnicity-based disparities in hospice use. The broad trends are consistent, showing that White patients enroll in hospice far more than any other group [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. The National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization report from 2020 showed that 82 percent of hospice patients were White, 8.2 percent were Black, 6.7 percent were Hispanic, 1.8 percent were Asian/Pacific Islander, and 0.4 percent were Native American [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. The Western hospice philosophy defines a “good death” as being at home, surrounded by friends and family [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ], but this cultural ideal may not resonate with all family cultures.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to cultural and spiritual considerations that contribute to lower utilization of hospice among underrepresented and historically marginalized populations, there are also health care access issues. Isolated rural areas have less reliable access to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-accredited hospices [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>
         ], a situation that Congress worked to remedy by passing the “Rural Access to Hospice Act” in 2021 [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60
         </a>
         ]. Reservations are often located in remote rural areas, so collaborative efforts between the Native American community and hospices serving rural communities have the most success in reaching these communities and providing culturally sensitive care [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,61
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Likewise, general attitudes toward the modern health care system, which are largely shaped by a community’s social history, relationship with the health care system, and health care access, may impact the decision to use or forego hospice services. As an example, distrust of the health care system [
         <a href="#rid62">
          62
         </a>
         ], discomfort discussing death, desire to pursue aggressive care at the end of life, and spiritual beliefs together interact to explain why some people may have less favorable beliefs about hospice care and decreased hospice utilization [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,12,20
         </a>
         ]. However, what appear to be cultural differences in hospice utilization may actually be driven by provider and system level issues such as hospice being framed around Western ideals of death [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47,61
         </a>
         ] and providers spending less time at the bedside with underrepresented and historically marginalized patients [
         <a href="#rid63">
          63
         </a>
         ]. For example, a study that examined audiotaped hospital consultations between palliative care clinicians and patients with advanced cancer found that clinicians discussed prognosis less frequently with patients who identified as being Black or Hispanic, even when those patients expressed values that were geared more towards comfort near the end of life [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64
         </a>
         ]. Additionally, when prognostic communication did occur, it was framed differently in conversations with Black and Hispanic patients as compared with others. Such disparate prognostic communication likely influences patient and family prognostic understanding, and therefore decision-making, at the end of life.

         Discussion of organ donation and autopsy requires particular attention for many reasons, not least of which is distress immediately following a loved one’s death. Patient and family/loved one’s values pertaining to organ donation and autopsy are influenced by cultural beliefs, religious traditions, and community norms. Importantly, there are times when examining the body through autopsy is a legal necessity, such as in the case of an unexplained death. In those circumstances, it is essential to be clear with the deceased’s family or friends that the medical examiner has determined that the autopsy is required for legal reasons.

In most Islamic societies, autopsy is allowable when required (such as in the case of a suspicious death), although all efforts are made to proceed quickly and in the most respectful and minimally invasive way possible. In general, the family proceeds with ritual washing and shrouding of the body for burial after the autopsy is complete and the body is returned to the family [

         Clinicians’ attitudes (no less than those of their patients) are informed by their past life experiences and the culture of biomedicine in which they practice. As such, all clinicians run the risk of employing unconscious bias when interacting with their patients, which can lead to unintended acts of discrimination. Because one is unable to correct for biases of which one is unaware, active curiosity and self-reflection are essential to providing culturally appropriate care. Absent time for reflection and thought, clinicians may rely more heavily on habitual, “rule of thumb” decision-making patterns, which can inadvertently result in perpetuating disparities [

          70,71

         Cultural humility requires a respectful curiosity about the patients in one’s care as well as the ability to recognize one’s own beliefs and values and how they may be interfering with the optimal care of patients. For example, Western biomedicine has been characterized as having a “culture of no culture,” in which medical professionals are presumed to possess knowledge of “real” things, such as disease pathophysiology, whereas a patient’s understanding of disease is considered “cultural” and thus less real, often at the expense of patient experience [

         <a href="#rid73">
          73
         </a>
         ]. Consider the clinician who feels it is important to tell the patient that they have terminal cancer despite the patient and family’s preference that the patient not be told the specifics of the diagnosis. Or consider a patient who deliberately forgoes life-sustaining therapy that the medical providers consider to be minimally burdensome: for example, a diabetic man in his 60s who has a life-threatening limb infection. His life could be saved with amputation, and his functional impairment could be limited to those things associated with the loss of his leg. However, for reasons involving his family, his beliefs, and how he wants to live, he prefers death to amputation, leading to tremendous upset among the medical teams caring for him, who struggle to understand his choice and require multiple reassurances that he understands his decision and has the capacity to make it.

All the interventions demonstrated to provide benefit rely heavily on improving clinician training in cross-cultural issues and clinician-patient communication. Practices that have shown promise in reducing disparities in the health care setting include tailoring interventions around patients’ cultural needs, providing health education in an easy-to-read format in the patient’s native language, having patient navigators, engaging multidisciplinary care teams in delivering culturally relevant care and education, and initiating patient health education programs that are interactive and skills based rather than only didactic [

         Cultures are heterogeneous, and dynamic, and individuals within these cultures vary in their expression and embrace of cultural beliefs and practices. In our multicultural society, patients can have vastly different attitudes and approaches toward discussing illness and death, making medical decisions, fulfilling spiritual and familial needs, and understanding the meaning of suffering. In addition, due to experiential racism in health care, they may also have grave mistrust of the health care system. Clinicians must therefore connect with each individual patient on a human-to-human level [

         The need to foster clinician-patient trust is a common theme in studies about providing palliative and end-of-life care, particularly to historically marginalized racial and ethnic groups. Crawley et al advocate reframing discussions about patient “distrust” into discussions about how clinicians and health care providers can establish “trustworthiness” [
         <a href="#rid83">
          83-85

         <a href="#rid86">
          86
         </a>
         ]. As a clinician, one cannot undo past injustices and episodes of discrimination, nor can one erase the impact of centuries of structural and systemic racism in society or health care. However, one can foster interpersonal trust by making an effort to learn about the unique customs, practices, and experiences of patients and their families/friends and by demonstrating compassion, credibility, and reliability [

         Clinicians must ensure that patients receive medical information in a way they can understand. Health literacy is defined as “the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions” [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45,92

          92

         ]. In addition, physiologic stress and high emotional burden can hinder an individual’s ability to obtain and process health information. (See

         Clinicians should create a shame-free environment, speak slowly, use visual aids (if available), and offer frequent opportunities for the patient/family/other friends to ask questions (ask “What questions do you have?”).

          ●
         </span>
         Initially, address patients using their last name (and title if relevant) to communicate respect. Subsequently, ask their preference as to how they wish to be addressed. This allows patients to indicate preferences not only regarding title and first name/last name but also pertaining to gender-specific pronouns.

         Speak slowly and with a measured tone. Sit down, face the patient (not the computer screen), and speak with the patient at eye level. This is particularly important for patients who speak a language other than English or for those who may be hard of hearing. Use straightforward sentences and words, avoiding medical jargon (eg, “prognosis” and “benign”) and idioms (eg, “We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it” or “Let’s make sure we’re all on the same page”).

For example, asking about the patient’s community, family, and decision-making style (eg, “How do you and your family make medical decisions?”) may be preferable to asking about their “culture,” which can imply that the patient is different from the clinician and may even convey unintended insult.

         Regardless of backgrounds and belief systems, it is always possible to talk sensitively with patients and their families/friends about the management of symptoms and alleviation of suffering, their preferences regarding how serious illness is discussed and managed in their family and community, and their hopes and concerns about the future [

         <strong>
         </strong>
         patient as a unique individual are useful as a starting point, including asking about important aspects of the patient’s life, family, and spirituality. Such exploratory questions help clinicians learn more about the patient as a person while identifying issues and stressors important for the patient’s care and treatment  (

Direct or “low-context” communication relies less heavily on shared cultural context than “high-context” communication (eg, relying on nonverbal cues; making specific cultural references or metaphors; using slang). It is important for clinicians to recognize that some individuals value high-context communication over low-context communication. Clinicians are encouraged to seek clarification if they sense that they are missing context, nuance, or shared reference points in a conversation [

         Given the tremendous individual variations in patient and family preferences for information-sharing and medical decision-making, clinicians must be open to patients’ communication and medical decision-making preferences. To achieve this, it can be helpful to use open-ended questions that respect values and beliefs across cultures [

         One can start by assessing the patient’s desire for medical information, as well as how they like to receive it  (

          table 4
         </a>
         ). As part of that process, assess which family or community members the patient may want present for information-sharing and decision-making. With the patient’s consent, clinicians can involve family members or others in these discussions.

         </span>
         Sometimes, families or other friends express a preference for all information to go through them instead of the patient. Indeed, in some cultures, this is the normal and preferred means of medical decision-making. However, whether it is normal within the context of that patient’s culture of origin is less important than the patient’s wishes on the matter. Such an arrangement is entirely acceptable if it is consistent with the patient’s wishes. Therefore, determining the patient’s preferences for information-sharing and medical decision-making is essential. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2753.html" rel="external">
          "The patient’s culture and effective communication", section on 'Family dynamics'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         When a family requests that the patient not receive medical information or be involved in decisions, clinicians can assess the patient’s preferences directly in a manner that avoids sharing information that the patient may not want to hear; a suggested approach is included in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119638" href="/z/d/graphic/119638.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). When taking this step, it is critical that the health care provider includes key family members or other decision-makers in the discussion and prepares them in advance that the health care team will honor the patient’s wishes, whichever way they are expressed. Not including the family or other decision-makers may lead to distrust of the clinician. Strategies to manage requests from family members to withhold information from patients are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2202.html" rel="external">
          "Ethical issues in palliative care", section on 'Requests from the family to withhold information'

        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, patients sometimes change their minds and later wish to be included in discussions that they initially chose to avoid. It can therefore be helpful to check in with patients intermittently regarding their desired level of involvement and certainly before major conversations or decision-making discussions; a suggested approach is included in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119638" href="/z/d/graphic/119638.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). If the patient confirms a preference not to be involved in the meeting and/or decision-making, the clinician can proceed, reminding the patient that they are welcome to ask questions at any time.

See the table for questions that can aid clinicians in eliciting patients’ understanding, interpretation, and experience of their illness  (

         Clinicians should seek to understand patients’ personal and cultural beliefs when approaching ACP, recognizing that patients and families/friends differ in their knowledge and understanding of ACP. It may be helpful to start by explaining the purpose of ACP (see
         <a class="local">
          'Advance care planning and advance directives'
         </a>
         above) and by getting a sense of what the patient may have discussed previously with other clinicians and/or family and friends. One can use open-ended questions that respect the values and beliefs of a wide range of cultures [
         <a href="#rid100">
          100
         </a>
         ] to elicit patients’ hopes, fears, and wishes about treatments and outcomes  (

         ]. (See

         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Ideally, and with a patient’s permission, surrogate decision-makers are included in these discussions so that they are better prepared to support the patient’s wishes going forward. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, clinicians must recognize that the point of ACP is not to get the patient to sign a form or to accept a particular “code status.” It is instead to help patients define and clarify their wishes and priorities for medical care to prepare them for the future and to aid in future decision-making. Some patients may be willing to discuss wishes for care with family or friends but not with a health care provider [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ]. Others may not be comfortable with discussing hypothetical situations. If that is the case, the clinician can encourage the patient to name and document a surrogate decision-maker and to talk with the surrogate about their wishes, leaving the rest of the form blank. Then, with the patient’s permission, the clinician, patient, and surrogate can meet together to discuss the patient’s wishes for care  (

         It is important to distinguish palliative care from hospice and end-of-life care, using language that is clear and acceptable to patients. A review of the literature examining public perceptions of ACP, palliative care, and hospice found that 66 to 71 percent of participants reported no awareness of palliative care and often conflated it with end-of-life care, while a majority of participants (80 to 90 percent) reported awareness of ACP and hospice and most of those had favorable impressions of both [
         <a href="#rid104">
          104
         </a>
         ]. This is aligned with public opinion polls of conducted by the Center to Advance Palliative Care in 2011 and 2019, both of which demonstrated a limited understanding of palliative care amongst the general public. In both surveys, providing participants with a straightforward definition of palliative care improved their perception of palliative care and whether or not they would be willing to consider it for a loved one [
         <a href="#rid104">
          104-107
         </a>
         ]. When speaking about palliative care, using patient-centered language and preferred terms, such as “person with a serious illness” and “living with serious illness,” is recommended [
         <a href="#rid106">
          106

         There are many barriers to hospice referral and enrollment, some of which transcend culture, including poverty, housing challenges, and family structures that cannot support home caregiving for a seriously ill loved one. For some families/friends, providing intimate physical care is inconsistent with their relationships or cultural values, making home hospice with primary family caregivers inappropriate. In addition, health care professionals often lack crucial knowledge about insurance eligibility related to hospice, making it harder for patients to consider hospice as a viable health care option [
         <a href="#rid108">
          108
         </a>
         ]. (See

         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Strategies for improving knowledge of hospice care include increasing outreach in historically marginalized communities, enhancing understanding of cultural issues in death and dying within the medical community, and improving communication with community members who do not speak the dominant local language [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients may not understand what services are available to them through hospice, the payment structure, or how various services may help them. Clinicians should work with patients to determine what services would best meet their needs. If that is hospice, it can be helpful to describe the services and why they might help before labeling them or introducing the word “hospice”  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119642" href="/z/d/graphic/119642.html" rel="external">
          table 8
         </a>
         ). Recognize, however, that there are disparities in what hospice and palliative care resources are available in different communities. Certain communities and rural areas may have limited access to hospice and other services; this may require troubleshooting on the clinician’s part to devise a plan that is both effective and realistic. See the table for tips on how to discuss hospice with patients and families/friends  (

         Sometimes, patients or their families/friends desire life-sustaining care even when the prognosis is dismal and, from the clinician’s viewpoint, care is futile and death is a certainty. Belief in miracles and divine intervention is common [
         <a href="#rid110">
          110
         </a>
         ], and family members may express hope for a miracle, even when facing a loved one’s imminent death. The concept of a “miracle” can express a multitude of hopes, fears, and religious beliefs [
         <a href="#rid111">
          111
         </a>
         ]. Such hopes can drive wishes for ongoing aggressive care, even when such care seems to add to patient discomfort without the potential for therapeutic benefit. This dynamic may be most pronounced if the patient is young or a child.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinicians can find goals of care discussions in these circumstances extremely challenging. Approaching the patient and their family or other friends with respect and curiosity about their decisions and beliefs can open the lines of communication so that the medical team can explore with them the full range of options available, including those that can ensure comfort while maintaining hope [
         <a href="#rid110">
          110

        <p>
         In order to respectfully negotiate a care plan with the patient and their family or other friends that addresses medical realities, family beliefs, and the patient’s comfort and dignity, the clinician must understand the family’s desires for life-sustaining care as well as the beliefs and values driving them  (

          What is culture?
         </strong>
         – Culture is typically defined as a body of values, perspectives, beliefs, behaviors, and traditions that are salient within a specific group or for some at the individual level. Race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, social class, immigrant status, experiential racism and systemic oppression, religion, and family constellation can all intersect to create an individual person’s culture. Optimal care for seriously ill patients should reflect each patient’s preferences, hopes, and values, considering their unique physical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs, all of which are heavily influenced by cultural factors. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Impact of cultural issues
         </strong>
         – One of the barriers to high-quality palliative and end-of-life care for patients from historically marginalized groups is a failure on the part of clinicians to provide culturally appropriate care that considers cultural and individual differences in attitudes toward suffering and death; preferences for how and what kinds of information are delivered to patients and families/friends; decision-making styles and the role of family or other decision-makers; and a lack of knowledge and/or wary attitudes about advance care planning (ACP) and hospice.

         <strong>
          Importance of communication
         </strong>
         – Meeting the needs of culturally and linguistically varied populations requires effective clinician-patient communication and sensitivity to patients’ cultural understanding, preferences, and needs  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119637" href="/z/d/graphic/119637.html" rel="external">

          table 2
         </a>
         ). Approaching patients with cultural humility encourages clinicians to actively explore opportunities to provide care that is tailored to each unique patient and family. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Impact of cultural issues on clinicians'

         To optimize cultural understanding and communication, clinicians must ensure that patients receive information in a manner they can understand by providing easy-to-read health education materials and utilizing a professional interpreter if English is not the patient’s first language  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119636" href="/z/d/graphic/119636.html" rel="external">

         Clinicians must be open to each patient’s communication and decision-making preferences. Clinicians must assess the patient’s desire for medical information and preferences as to how they wish to receive information, as well as what family or community members the patient may want present for information-sharing and decision-making  (

          Eliciting illness understanding

         – To build shared understanding, clinicians must first elicit patients’, families’, and other friends’ understanding and interpretation of their illness, care plan, and therapeutic options before sharing new information with them  (

          Advance care planning
         </strong>
         – Clinicians must be open to patients’ ethnic, cultural, and personal beliefs regarding how ACP is approached and must take the initiative in these discussions. Learning what patients have discussed previously with family, friends, and other clinicians is an important first step, and surrogate decision-makers should be included in discussions whenever possible  (

         Sometimes, patients or their families/friends desire life-sustaining care even when the prognosis is dismal and, from the clinician’s viewpoint, care is futile and death is a certainty. Discussing goals of care with such patients and their surrogates can be very challenging. In order to respectfully negotiate a care plan with the patient and their family or friends, the clinician must understand their desire for life-sustaining care, as well as the beliefs and values driving them  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef100742" href="/z/d/graphic/100742.html" rel="external">
          table 9

         ). A suggested framework for discussing treatment preferences with patients who want life-sustaining treatment in the face of a dire prognosis is provided in the algorithm  (

         ). (See
