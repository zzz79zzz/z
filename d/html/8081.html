A pessary is a vaginal support device that can be used to treat symptoms of POP, SUI, or both. Pessaries are inert; typical materials include silicone or plastic. Advantages of pessaries include potential for long-term use and avoidance of surgery. Pessary treatment is also generally inexpensive, well-tolerated, and safe, although the overall efficacy is unclear because of limited data.</p><p>This topic will review the applications, approach to selection, and types of vaginal pessaries for use in gynecologic patients.

When used for POP, pessaries provide support to the vaginal hernia defect, including anterior, posterior, apical, and combined sites.</p><p>The mechanism of action of vaginal pessaries for SUI is related to improved urethral function. Urodynamic studies of women treated with a pessary for SUI have shown increases in functional urethral length [<a href="#rid1">1</a>] and urethral closure pressure [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>], absence of urethral obstruction to flow [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], and resolution of detrusor instability in women with severe prolapse and detrusor instability [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Anatomically, pessaries improve urethral support as there is a reduction in the straining Q-tip angle [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging studies show a decreased posterior urethrovesical angle, elevation of the bladder neck, and increased urethral lengths [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3486878139"><span class="h2">Efficacy</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1285542510"><span class="h3">For POP or SUI</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pessaries are commonly used as first-line therapies for symptomatic POP and SUI based on supporting data from validated questionnaires. A meta-analysis of eight studies with 627 patients demonstrated benefit with pessary treatment of POP, with significant reductions in the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20 (mean change -46), the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire-7 (mean change -36), and the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Impact Questionnaire-7 (mean change -16) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. A meta-analysis of 10 studies with 376 patients demonstrated subjective and objective benefit with pessary treatment for SUI [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Urinary Distress Inventory and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire scores decreased significantly, by 47 and 68 percent, respectively.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3364387769"><span class="h3">Compared with other treatments</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Studies have compared pessary use with pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and surgical correction.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pelvic floor muscle training</strong> – PFMT requires more time for a patient than pessary use. By contrast, exercises have no associated adverse effects, while pessary use may be accompanied by vaginal erosions and malodorous vaginal discharge. Given these clinical considerations and the data presented below, in women with SUI, we prefer PFMT rather than continence pessary use for women who do not otherwise have a preference for one of these nonsurgical modalities and in women whose incontinence interferes with sexual function. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8070.html" rel="external">"Female stress urinary incontinence: Choosing a primary surgical procedure"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Treatment of SUI with a pessary appears to be less successful than PFMT during the first few months of therapy; however, long-term use of either strategy is associated with similar outcomes. The highest quality data regarding this issue are from the Ambulatory Treatment for Leakage Associated with Stress Incontinence (ATLAS) trial that randomly assigned 446 women with SUI to one of three treatment groups: continence pessary, behavioral therapy (PFMT and other strategies), or combined use of a pessary and behavioral therapy [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. At three months, significantly fewer women in the pessary versus behavioral or combined groups reported a complete absence of bothersome incontinence symptoms (33, 49, and 44 percent, respectively) and treatment satisfaction (63, 75, and 79 percent, respectively). These outcomes did not differ significantly between the behavioral and combined groups. At 12 months, there were no significant differences among the three groups for absence of incontinence symptoms (35, 40, and 33 percent, respectively) or patient satisfaction (50, 54, and 54 percent, respectively).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A subsequent study from the ATLAS trial reported that, among women successfully treated for SUI, improvement in continence during sexual activity was greater in the behavioral and combined groups than in the pessary group [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In a different planned secondary analysis of the same trial, predictors of success and satisfaction with nonsurgical management (all types) included postmenopausal status, higher education, no previous urinary incontinence surgery, and lower incontinence frequency [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. This information may help providers in counseling patients regarding nonsurgical treatment outcomes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In women with POP, pessary use combined with PFMT improves POP symptoms more than PFMT alone [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In a trial of 276 women with POP (all were receiving PFMT) that compared pessary use with non-use, both groups reported improvements in prolapse symptoms and quality of life, but the mean improvement was greater for women in the pessary plus PFMT group (-29.7 compared with -4.7) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The outcomes were measured using the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI) and Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaires (PFIQ).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Surgery</strong> </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>POP symptoms</strong> – While both surgery and pessaries improve POP symptoms, some observational studies have suggested surgery may be associated with greater improvement [<a href="#rid11">11-13</a>]. In attempt to resolve the issue, a noninferiority trial compared surgery or pessary in 440 randomized patients with symptomatic stage 2 POP [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Although similar numbers of patients reported subjective improvement at 24 months (76.3 versus 81.5 percent, risk difference -6.1, 95% CI -12.7 to ∞), definitive conclusions regarding treatment equivalence were limited because 118 of 218 patients (54 percent) crossed over from the pessary group to the surgery group. We counsel patients that both methods are effective, surgery may have some additional benefit, and the decision for pessary or surgery comes down to patient preferences regarding the risks and benefits of the two treatments. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Sexual function</strong> – As with POP symptoms, both surgery and pessary use may improve sexual function, but surgery appears to have greater benefit. A cohort study evaluating sexual function, as measured with a validated questionnaire, reported improved condition-specific and condition-impact domains for patients undergoing surgery compared with those using a pessary at 24 months of follow-up [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. In addition, patients in the surgery group were more than twice as likely as those in the pessary group to change from no sexual activity to being sexually active.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Conversion from pessary to surgery</strong> – In a study of 444 patients with POP who were successfully fit with a pessary, 31 percent ultimately elected surgery over a five-year period [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Approximately 60 percent underwent surgery within one year and 90 percent within two years.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2689012657"><span class="h2">Clinical applications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A pessary trial can be offered to all women with POP, SUI, or both, regardless of patient characteristics. Clinical settings where pessary use should be considered include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient preference for nonsurgical treatment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Presence of severe medical comorbidities that make the patient a poor surgical candidate.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Need to delay surgery for several weeks or months.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recurrent POP or SUI and patient preference for avoidance of repeat surgery. However, prior prolapse surgery and prior hysterectomy are risk factors for failure to fit a pessary. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/122458.html" rel="external">"Vaginal pessaries: Insertion and fitting, management, and complications", section on 'Inability to fit a pessary'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vaginal ulcerations caused by severe POP. Reduction of POP through use of a pessary and application of vaginal estrogen cream both promote healing of the ulcers within three to six weeks, which is useful prior to surgical repair.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>POP in a current pregnancy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Desire for future childbearing. The benefit of surgical repair of POP may be nullified by subsequent pregnancy and childbirth.</p><p></p><p>Pessary use to treat cervical insufficiency in pregnant women is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6774.html" rel="external">"Cervical insufficiency", section on 'Pessary'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1388444386"><span class="h2">Contraindications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Contraindications to pessary use are rarely encountered. Potential contraindications include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Local infection</strong> – Active infections of the vagina or pelvis, such as vaginitis or pelvic inflammatory disease, preclude the use of a pessary until the infection has been resolved.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Exposed foreign body</strong> – An exposed foreign body, such as vaginal mesh, should preclude pessary use until the exposure of the foreign body has been resolved.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Latex sensitivity</strong> – The Inflatoball pessary is made of latex; therefore, it is contraindicated in women with latex allergies. The other pessaries discussed below are nonallergenic.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Noncompliance</strong> – Noncompliance with follow-up could be harmful since an undetected and untreated erosion could put the patient at risk of developing a fistula.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sexually active women who are unable to remove and reinsert the pessary</strong> – Inability to manage the pessary around coital activity could be discouraging.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2484735999"><span class="h2">Patient acceptance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patient acceptance of pessaries varies from 42 to 100 percent [<a href="#rid16">16-19</a>] and is related to appropriate counseling and encouragement from the provider [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Patients who decline a pessary trial are more likely to be nulliparous [<a href="#rid17">17</a>], younger [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>], or have severe prolapse and incontinence [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. This was illustrated in two studies of treatment choices among women with POP that reported older women were more likely than younger women to choose a pessary whereas women with prior prolapse surgery, more severe prolapse, and more severe symptoms related to bowel emptying, sexual function, and quality of life were more likely to choose surgical treatment [<a href="#rid19">19,21,22</a>]. Similarly, in two studies of women with stage II POP or greater, women ages &gt;65 years were more likely to use a pessary for more than one year compared with women ≤65 years [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2855516733"><span class="h1">OUR APPROACH</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3770938212"><span class="h2">Patient evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial assessment includes taking a history to understand the patient's most bothersome symptoms, concerns, goals, and activity limitations, as well as a physical examination to understand the pelvic anatomy and exclude pathology. In addition to the routine gynecologic history, we focus on urinary symptoms (urinary incontinence, voiding difficulty, urinary tract infection, and overactive bladder), bowel symptoms (defecation difficulty, fecal incontinence, constipation), and on pelvic organ prolapse (POP) symptoms (vaginal bulge, pelvic pressure, heaviness, discomfort). The symptom cluster helps guide us toward pessary choice; we consider a support pessary for urinary incontinence symptoms and either a support or space-filling pessary for prolapse symptoms, with or without urinary or bowel symptoms. In general, support pessaries can be used for women with stage II to III POP, and space-filling pessaries can be used for women with advanced stage III to IV prolapse [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].

Pessaries come in several different shapes and sizes  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73252" href="/z/d/graphic/73252.html" rel="external">picture 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122649" href="/z/d/graphic/122649.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Most are made of silicone, which is nonallergenic, durable, autoclavable, and does not retain odors. A few are made of other materials, such as latex or polycarbonate. Patients should be asked about latex allergies prior to being fit with a latex pessary. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5543.html" rel="external">"Latex allergy: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1244613176"><span class="h3">Support versus space-filling pessaries</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pessaries can be classified into essentially two categories: support and space-filling  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122649" href="/z/d/graphic/122649.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The support pessary is used to treat all stages of POP and SUI whereas the space-filling pessary is mostly used for severe POP (stage III to IV). Both types are held in place proximally by the uterus (or the vaginal apex following hysterectomy), laterally by the levator muscles, and distally by the pubic bone and the vaginal introitus. Space-filling pessaries and larger size pessaries are often needed for severe prolapse (stage III or IV), as vaginal capacity can increase significantly as a result of levator atrophy and an enlarged vaginal introitus can allow a support pessary to rotate and be expelled.</p><p>Surveys of gynecologists [<a href="#rid25">25</a>] and female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery specialists [<a href="#rid26">26</a>] reported that the ring pessary (support type pessary) was the most commonly used pessary. A prospective observational study reported that most women with stages II and III prolapse (100 and 71 percent, respectively) were successfully fitted with ring pessaries whereas women with stage IV prolapse usually required a Gellhorn pessary (space-filling pessary; 64 percent) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. A randomized crossover trial compared the "ring with support" with Gellhorn pessary in women with stage II to IV prolapse and showed significant improvement in prolapse, urinary, and rectal symptoms with both and no difference in symptom response between pessaries [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1347204756"><span class="h3">Empiric trial of ring or Gellhorn pessary</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ring and Gellhorn pessaries are typically the first-line devices for patients who elect a pessary trial.

Again, a string may be attached to aid in removal.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Less commonly used</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Inflatable pessary (Inflatoball) </strong>– The Inflatoball pessary was designed to facilitate removal and insertion by the patient, as in letter M in the picture  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73252" href="/z/d/graphic/73252.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). It has an air-filled ball and a stem with a port; a bulb is attached to the port to inflate or deflate the pessary, which makes the device less bulky during insertion and removal. However, the stem protrudes from the vagina and may cause unacceptable discomfort. Additionally, the pessary is made of latex, not silicone, so it cannot be used in women with latex allergy or sensitivity. The author no longer uses this pessary as patients are too often bothered by the protruding stem.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The Inflatoball is placed in a similar manner as the donut pessary. The bulb is then attached, a ball-bearing within the stem is moved to a lateral projection on the side of the stem, the pessary is inflated, the ball-bearing is moved back into position to keep the pessary inflated, and the bulb is removed  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69101" href="/z/d/graphic/69101.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). The Inflatoball pessary is available in diameter sizes of 2 to 2.75 inches in one-quarter inch increments.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Spherical pessary</strong> – Although no longer in production, the spherical pessary (commercial name Colpexin Sphere) was designed to make removal and insertion easier, improve comfort (because of its smaller size and spherical shape), and allow the patient to perform concomitant pelvic floor muscle exercises  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69336" href="/z/d/graphic/69336.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>). It is made of polycarbonate with an attached braided nylon string for ease of removal. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18"><span class="h2">Incontinence pessaries</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A few pessaries are designed specifically to treat SUI  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122649" href="/z/d/graphic/122649.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). When fitted properly, an incontinence pessary compresses the urethra against the upper posterior portion of the symphysis pubis, causing an increase in urethral resistance that prevents leakage associated with sudden increases in abdominal pressure (ie, cough, Valsalva, or exercise). The author typically uses a ring pessary or an incontinence ring pessary (with or without support) for women with SUI as these are commonly available, reasonably easy for patients to insert and remove, and relatively inexpensive. Whereas pessaries for POP are typically used all day, every day, pessaries for SUI can be used as needed (for example, during exercise). Additionally, some women are able to use a tampon as a pessary to treat SUI symptoms. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Commonly used</strong> </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Incontinence ring and dish</strong> – The incontinence ring pessary, as in letter L in the picture  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73252" href="/z/d/graphic/73252.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>), has a knob that is placed beneath the urethra to increase urethral pressure to treat stress incontinence  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76369" href="/z/d/graphic/76369.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>). The incontinence dish is more rigid and shaped like a dish and generally has minimal added benefit. Some patients with large anterior prolapse may experience better tissue reduction with the dish compared with the ring, but this is anecdotal. The author prefers to fit all women with SUI with a ring pessary, with or without a support diaphragm, with or without an incontinence knob. The author starts with a ring without a knob because sometimes the knob is too big and uncomfortable. If the ring pessary alone does not control symptoms, then the ring with incontinence knob is tried. The author will try an incontinence dish pessary in patients whose symptoms do not adequately improve with the ring pessaries.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Impressa incontinence device</strong> – The Impressa incontinence pessary is an over-the-counter, disposable, tampon-like device made from medical-grade silicone. It comes in three different sizes, is self-inserted into the vagina, and supports the urethra to prevent stress incontinence [<a href="#rid70">70</a>]. An initial sizing kit can be purchased over-the-counter to determine which size best reduces symptoms. The patient can then purchase supports in the correct size for continued use. Advantages of this device include that it does not require fitting by a clinician and can be purchased in a local drug store or online.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Less commonly used</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Bell-shaped incontinence pessary</strong> – The bell-shaped incontinence pessary (commercial name Uresta) has a handle at its base for easy removal and insertion and has a narrow, rounded tip that allows easy insertion into the vaginal introitus. When properly positioned, the wide base supports the urethra. It is made of a medical-grade rubber that has been extensively tested for biocompatibility and safety and is available in sizes 3, 4, and 5 (small, medium, and large). It is available for purchase online from the manufacturer.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Cylindrical intravaginal device</strong> – The cylindrical intravaginal device (commercial name Contiform) is shaped like a large, hollow tampon and is made of Santoprene, a nonallergenic thermoplastic rubber. The device sits behind the pubic bone and supports the urethra during episodes of increased intra-abdominal pressure. Its tampon-like shape was partly designed to facilitate self-insertion/removal by patients.

Exceptions are women with exposed foreign body (eg, vaginal mesh), active pelvic infection, inability to remove the pessary (if sexually active), and those who cannot be compliant with follow-up. (See <a class="local">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Alternate treatment options</strong> – Alternate treatment options to pessary use include pelvic floor muscle training and surgical correction. Pessaries can be used alone or in combination with other therapies. (See <a class="local">'Compared with other treatments'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial assessment</strong> – For patients who desire a pessary trial, the initial assessment includes taking a history to understand the patient's most bothersome symptoms, concerns, and activity limitations as well as a physical examination to understand the pelvic anatomy and exclude pathology. (See <a class="local">'Patient evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Type of pessaries</strong> – Pessaries can be classified into two general categories: support and space-filling  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122649" href="/z/d/graphic/122649.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73252" href="/z/d/graphic/73252.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). Support pessaries are used to treat all stages of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) whereas space-filling pessaries are mostly used for severe POP. (See <a class="local">'Support versus space-filling pessaries'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The most commonly used pessaries are the ring, with (F) or without a support (G), and the Gellhorn (J, K) as seen in the image  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73252" href="/z/d/graphic/73252.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). (See <a class="local">'Empiric trial of ring or Gellhorn pessary'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial pessary selection</strong> – For individuals who desire a pessary for POP, SUI, or both:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For those whose vaginal introitus measures 1 to 2 fingerbreadths or who have stage I to II prolapse, we suggest a ring pessary rather than a Gellhorn or other pessary types (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). As 70 percent of patients can be fit with a ring pessary, the author typically begins with this device because they are comfortable and easily removed and inserted by the patient, and sexual intercourse is possible with the ring pessary left in place.  (See <a class="local">'For POP or SUI'</a> above and <a class="local">'Empiric trial of ring or Gellhorn pessary'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For those whose vaginal introitus is 3 to 4 fingerbreadths or who have stage III to IV prolapse, we suggest a Gellhorn pessary rather than a ring or other pessary types (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'For POP or SUI'</a> above and <a class="local">'Empiric trial of ring or Gellhorn pessary'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The above recommendations are based on the author’s clinical experience and the limited available evidence suggesting ring and Gellhorn pessaries have similar outcomes. Initial treatment with other pessary types also appears reasonable, but supporting data are scarce. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Repeat pessary selection</strong> – For women in whom the first pessary choice does not work, the selection of the next pessary is guided by the reasons for initial failure. Next steps can include a different size of the same device or a different type of device, including pessaries specific for SUI. (See <a class="local">'If initial pessary is not successful'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptom resolution and continued use</strong> – Pessary use improves approximately 80 percent of prolapse symptoms (bulge, pressure, splinting), 50 percent of urinary symptoms (stress and urgency incontinence and voiding difficulty), and 40 percent of bowel symptoms (anal incontinence, anal urgency, and obstructive symptoms). In addition, approximately 50 percent of patients report increased sexual frequency and satisfaction. (See <a class="local">'Symptom resolution'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Short-term (two to six months) satisfaction and continued use is approximately 80 percent, and medium-term (one to two years) satisfaction and continued use is approximately 60 percent. (See <a class="local">'Satisfaction and continued use'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preoperative uses of pessaries</strong> – Pessaries have been used in women with POP to diagnose occult SUI and to predict postoperative cure of urinary retention after prolapse surgery.
