Worldwide, bladder cancer accounts for approximately 600,000 new cases and over 200,000 deaths [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In developed areas of the world, such as North America and Western Europe, these bladder cancers are predominantly urothelial.</p><p>Nearly 70 percent of new bladder cancer diagnoses are early stage (ie, Ta, Tis, and T1 disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110763" href="/z/d/graphic/110763.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)) and have not yet invaded the muscular layer of the bladder wall. These patients are often managed with transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) with or without adjuvant intravesical therapy. The remaining 30 percent of patients have muscle-invasive bladder cancer, including cancer involving the muscularis propria (T2), perivesical tissue (T3), or adjacent pelvic organs/structures (T4).</p><p>Radical cystectomy remains the cornerstone of curative treatment for muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer. Radical cystectomy involves removal of the bladder (in combination with removal of the uterus/ovaries/fallopian tubes and possibly a portion of the vagina in women and the prostate and seminal vesicles in men), pelvic lymph node dissection, and reconstruction of the urinary tract. The morbidity and long-term outcomes of cystectomy are well documented [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Because of the high risk of distant failure in muscle-invasive bladder cancer, systemic chemotherapy either before or after radical cystectomy is often administered to improve outcomes. For most patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer who will undergo a radical cystectomy, cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy is indicated, as this approach improves survival in this population. Modern series of patients managed with radical cystectomy have a five-year pelvic control rate of nearly 80 percent and five-year overall survival rates ranging from 40 to 60 percent [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p>Modern oncologic therapies are increasingly driven toward organ preservation and maximizing functional outcomes while maintaining treatment efficacy. Trimodality therapy (TMT) incorporating maximal TURBT followed by radiation therapy (RT) with concurrent radiosensitizing chemotherapy can be a comparably effective regimen to preserve a functioning bladder in well-selected patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer who are either poor candidates for radical cystectomy or patients who are motivated to maintain their native bladder. This combined-modality approach utilizing TURBT followed by RT with concurrent chemotherapy is often referred to as trimodality therapy.</p><p>This topic discusses TMT for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. An overview of the approach to the treatment of bladder cancer is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2978.html" rel="external">"Overview of the initial approach and management of urothelial bladder cancer"</a>.)</p><p>Topics related to other specific aspects of bladder cancer management include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2974.html" rel="external">"Radical cystectomy"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2991.html" rel="external">"Neoadjuvant treatment options for muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2966.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant therapy for muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2996.html" rel="external">"Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3000.html" rel="external">"Treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and urinary tract"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4615471"><span class="h1">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients must be clinically staged prior to pursuing definitive treatment. Briefly, patients should undergo cystoscopy with transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) along with an examination under anesthesia to assess the local extent of disease. Imaging studies are needed to rule out disseminated disease in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Because urothelial carcinoma can be multifocal, upper tract urothelial carcinoma of the ureters or renal pelvis should be ruled out as well. The diagnosis and staging of bladder cancer is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2989.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of bladder cancer"</a>.)</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the bladder is a promising modality to assess the local extent of disease and has proven more useful in distinguishing non-muscle-invasive from invasive disease [<a href="#rid6">6</a>] and in assessing for perivesical disease extension [<a href="#rid7">7-13</a>]. Advanced MRI with nanoparticle lymphangiography may also prove more useful at detecting pelvic nodal metastases [<a href="#rid9">9,12</a>]. If obtained, bladder MRI should be performed before TURBT, as it may be difficult to distinguish between tumor and postsurgical change. More accurate bladder-specific imaging with MRI may also assist with radiation treatment planning in those patients who choose bladder-preserving, combined-modality therapy to better delineate tumor boost volumes. MRI technology is evolving, and further studies are necessary.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4615478"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Radical cystectomy with neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the standard approach for the treatment of muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer. For patients who are not candidates for radical cystectomy or who desire preservation of their native bladder, trimodality therapy (TMT) incorporating maximal transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) followed by radiation therapy (RT) with concurrent chemotherapy is an appropriate alternative [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>There have been no completed definitive, randomized trials that compare bladder-preserving TMT with radical cystectomy. The Selective Bladder Preservation Against Radical Excision (SPARE) trial was a randomized phase III study (with a built-in pilot feasibility study) initiated in the United Kingdom comparing radical cystectomy versus RT (with or without chemotherapy) in muscle-invasive bladder cancer [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. However, this trial was closed due to poor accrual.</p><p>Observational data comparing TMT with radical cystectomy are conflicting for the optimal treatment approach. Most studies suggest similar or improved overall survival (OS) for TMT relative to radical cystectomy [<a href="#rid16">16-19</a>], while other studies suggest worse OS outcomes [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. As an example, in one meta-analysis of eight observational studies that included 9000 patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer, 5- and 10-year OS were similar between TMT and radical cystectomy [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. In another retrospective analysis of 722 patients with advanced muscle-invasive bladder cancer, TMT was associated with improved five-year OS relative to radical cystectomy (66 versus 73 percent, HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.92) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. By contrast, in a retrospective study of approximately 18,000 evaluable patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer, TMT was associated with a lower five-year OS relative to radical cystectomy (30 versus 40 percent) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. However, approximately 20 percent of the patients treated with TMT had node-positive disease, and there is limited information on the chemotherapy regimens used.</p><p>Other approaches that have been used to preserve a functioning bladder include TURBT alone [<a href="#rid21">21</a>], TURBT followed by interstitial brachytherapy [<a href="#rid22">22</a>], partial cystectomy [<a href="#rid23">23</a>], and radiation with intra-arterial chemotherapy [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. However, none of these have an established role in muscle-invasive bladder cancer.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4615492"><span class="h1">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bladder-preserving, trimodality therapy (TMT) is an appropriate treatment strategy for selected patients with muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer who are not surgical candidates due to medical comorbidities and for those who desire to retain their native bladder.</p><p>Even among patients with minimal medical comorbidities, radical cystectomy is associated with a treatment-related mortality risk of 1 to 2 percent [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], with an increasing risk in patients with more severe comorbidities. Furthermore, urothelial carcinoma is a disease of the older population, and the median age at diagnosis is 73 years [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. The 90-day perioperative mortality rates for patients ≤69, 70 to 79, and ≥80 years old have been reported to be as high as 2, 5, and 9 percent, respectively, in a population-based study [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Furthermore, cigarette smoking is an etiologic factor for bladder cancer, and many patients have one or more tobacco-related comorbidities that increase the risk of perioperative mortality.</p><p>Although there are no absolute criteria for identifying candidates for bladder-preserving TMT, important factors include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Urothelial histology </strong>– Prospective studies evaluating the use of TMT have been performed exclusively in patients with urothelial histology and thus cannot be generalized to patients with less common histologies (squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, micropapillary). In addition, nonurothelial carcinoma histologies may respond less favorably to chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT) [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although TMT has been used primarily for patients with pure urothelial bladder cancer, this approach appears to have a similar level of activity for those with variant urothelial pathology (eg, elements of squamous or glandular differentiation) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. However, because of the limited number of patients in some of the histologic variants, definitive equivalence cannot be established.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Maximal TURBT </strong>– A visibly complete transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) is associated with a higher complete response rate after chemoradiation, decreased rates of salvage cystectomy, and improved overall survival (OS) [<a href="#rid29">29-33</a>]. Although complete resection is optimal, a complete response was achieved in 57 percent of patients with a visibly incomplete TURBT in a single-institution series [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Similarly, over one-third of patients in the randomized Bladder Cancer 2001 (BC2001) trial had a biopsy only or an incomplete TURBT, and a similar proportion had a residual mass at time of treatment; despite this, the locoregional disease-free survival (DFS) was over 80 percent with chemoradiation [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical T2 to T4a disease </strong>– Increasing tumor (T) stage is associated with decreased rates of complete response after chemoradiation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110763" href="/z/d/graphic/110763.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). This was illustrated by a single-institution series of 348 patients, in which clinical T2 disease had a complete response rate of 81 percent compared with 64 percent in clinical T3 to T4 disease [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Although patients with clinical T2 to T3a disease may be more favorable candidates for TMT, the large institutional experiences, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) prospective studies, and BC2001 trial used clinical T4a disease (ie, disease extension into the prostatic stroma in men or uterus/vagina in women) as the upper limit of clinical T stage acceptable for TMT. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Absence of tumor-associated hydronephrosis </strong>– Patients with tumor-associated hydronephrosis are less likely to achieve a complete remission to chemoradiation (64 percent in patients without hydronephrosis versus 38 percent in patients with hydronephrosis) [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. A large retrospective series of 348 patients treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital also suggests that patients with tumor-associated hydronephrosis (n = 58) fare worse with regard to OS and disease-specific survival (DSS) outcomes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Kidney function </strong>– Adequate kidney function is necessary to receive cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapy. However, the combination of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/z/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9658" href="/z/d/drug information/9658.html" rel="external">mitomycin</a> or single-agent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8487" href="/z/d/drug information/8487.html" rel="external">gemcitabine</a> represent reasonable alternative concurrent chemotherapy regimens for patients with compromised kidney function.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Absence of extensive CIS </strong>– In a single-institution experience of 40 patients, extensive carcinoma in situ (CIS) was associated with a trend toward a higher bladder tumor recurrence rate compared with those without CIS (40 versus 6 percent) [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Furthermore, in a systemic review of bladder preservation in muscle-invasive bladder cancer, extensive CIS was found to be associated with a higher risk of local recurrence in patients treated with RT alone, although the association was less clear with TMT [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Unifocal tumors &lt;6 cm in maximum diameter.</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Good bladder function and capacity (ie, a bladder worth sparing).</strong></p><p></p><p>Advanced age is not a contraindication for a combined-modality approach. While older patients are more likely to have significant comorbidities, a bladder preservation approach is appropriate in this population given its generally good tolerability. In an analysis from a large single-institution experience, there was no difference in DSS for older adult patients (≥75 years) treated with a bladder preservation approach compared with a younger cohort [<a href="#rid29">29,37</a>]. Similarly, the RTOG pooled analysis showed no difference with respect to rates of complete response, DSS, or bladder-intact DSS in patients ≥75 years [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].</p><p>There may be some patients whose medical comorbidities or other patient factors make them poor candidates for chemotherapy in combination with RT. In this setting, TURBT followed by radiation alone is a reasonable treatment strategy. RT was used as bladder-sparing monotherapy for several decades in patients unfit for radical cystectomy [<a href="#rid34">34,39-41</a>], and there exists a group of patients with durable disease control with radiation alone (34 percent locoregional DFS at five years in the BC2001 study [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]). </p><p>However, for patients who are candidates for bladder preservation and reasonable candidates for radiosensitizing chemotherapy, we recommend chemoradiation (CRT) over RT alone, as this approach improves locoregional disease control over RT alone [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. Multiple chemosensitizing chemotherapy regimens are available that are well-tolerated. (See <a class="local">'Chemoradiation versus radiation monotherapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>New biomarkers may represent a promising strategy for identifying patients appropriate for bladder-preserving TMT. For example, MRE11 is a protein involved in detecting double-stranded DNA breaks along with RAD50-NBS1. A study analyzing pretreatment tumor specimens from patients receiving RT for their bladder cancer demonstrated that high MRE11 expression is associated with improved cancer-specific survival compared with radical cystectomy patients. This finding was validated in another cohort of patients, wherein elevated MRE11 expression was associated with improved cancer-specific survival in patients receiving TMT but not in those managed with radical cystectomy [<a href="#rid43">43-45</a>]. Gene expression profiling studies have also suggested that higher immune infiltration is associated with improved DSS after TMT, whereas higher stromal infiltration is associated with shorter DSS after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical cystectomy [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. Further studies are needed to prospectively validate such biomarkers.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4615511"><span class="h1">TURBT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goal of transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) is to define the depth of tumor invasion and to maximally resect all visible tumors in a safe manner. Site-directed bladder mapping biopsies should be performed to identify carcinoma in situ (CIS) remote from the primary tumor [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. Several technical maneuvers can be employed to assist in maximally safe TURBT, including use of paralytics for lateral bladder wall tumors to mitigate an obturator reflex and avoiding bladder overdistension while resecting to decrease the risk of perforation. The depth of resection can often be safely extended through the detrusor muscle and into the perivesical adipose tissue by an experienced urologist if this is required to perform a visually complete TURBT. A bimanual examination under anesthesia (EUA) should be performed both before and after TURBT. A palpable three-dimensional mass on EUA prior to or after a maximal TURBT indicates locally advanced (T3 to T4) disease.</p><p>TURBT with EUA requires special consideration if performed postinduction (ie, after 40 to 45 Gy radiation therapy with induction chemotherapy) or after consolidation (ie, after completion of the entire course of chemoradiation) chemoradiation. Often the previous resection site has significant fibrosis. A cold-cup biopsy of the previous tumor site is frequently inadequate, and the previous resection site needs to be reresected with a resectoscope with the goal of obtaining detrusor muscle to assess for residual invasive cancer.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4615544"><span class="h1">CONCURRENT CHEMORADIATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H87035539"><span class="h2">Efficacy of chemoradiation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Data supporting the use of chemoradiation come from a pooled analysis of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) studies [<a href="#rid38">38</a>], a large British randomized trial comparing chemoradiation versus radiation therapy (RT) without chemotherapy [<a href="#rid34">34</a>], and several single-institution series [<a href="#rid29">29,31</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4615651"><span class="h3">RTOG pooled analysis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A pooled analysis of six NRG/RTOG studies demonstrated the efficacy of chemoradiation as part of a bladder-preserving trimodality therapy (TMT) approach [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. These studies employed variable radiation doses and schedules, as well as different concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens.

An adequate dose of radiation is required to eradicate all tumor and to treat adjacent areas of bladder that are at high risk for local recurrence.

These data, however, are retrospective, and there is significant heterogeneity in non-muscle-invasive recurrences; thus, the judgment of the treating clinicians is integral in deciding which patients can avoid cystectomy. Clinicians should continue long-term surveillance of these patients, as they would for patients with primary non-muscle invasive disease.

Further, intravesical therapy after TMT is well tolerated by patients, with 68 percent of patients in this setting completing induction BCG without a stop in therapy or significant toxicity. Thus, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer recurrences following TMT can be managed with intravesical BCG with reasonable efficacy and tolerability. However, salvage cystectomy should be considered in patients with aggressive tumors, such as extensive high-grade/CIS or T1 disease, and in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer refractory to intravesical therapy.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4617950"><span class="h2">Salvage cystectomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Salvage cystectomy is indicated in patients who are cystectomy candidates and who failed to achieve a complete response after bladder-preserving TMT, those with muscle-invasive recurrence at any point, those with aggressive non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer recurrences (especially T1), and those with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer refractory to intravesical therapy.</p><p>Post-TMT salvage cystectomy has an acceptable 90-day major complication (≥Clavien grade 3) rate of 16 percent and 90-day mortality rate of 2 percent, which is similar to published series for radical cystectomy without antecedent radiation therapy (RT) [<a href="#rid72">72</a>]. Early complications (&lt;90 days) are most commonly cardiovascular and/or hematologic in nature, while delayed complications were related to wound complications, uretero-enteric anastomotic strictures, and stoma stenosis [<a href="#rid72">72,73</a>]. The risks of rectal injury (3 percent) and colostomy (1 percent) are rare in experienced centers [<a href="#rid72">72</a>].</p><p>Observational data generally suggest similar survival outcomes for patients who fail TMT and require salvage cystectomy compared with those who were treated with upfront cystectomy [<a href="#rid18">18,72,74</a>].

In another observational study, 265 patients who underwent radical cystectomy for cT1 to T4 bladder cancer were treated with either salvage cystectomy after TMT; primary cystectomy; or primary cystectomy with prior history of non-TMT abdominal or pelvic radiotherapy [<a href="#rid74">74</a>]. At median follow-up of 66 months, salvage cystectomy for intravesical recurrence after TMT had an intraoperative and early complication rate similar to primary cystectomy, but was associated with a higher risk of overall and major late complications.

If the ileum is unsuitable, then a transverse colon conduit can be created.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Due to the potential need to use large bowel and the rare risk of rectal injury, all salvage cystectomy patients should have a preoperative mechanical bowel preparation.
