This topic will review the concept of joint protection and will suggest approaches to evaluation and interventions that may promote joint health.</p><p>Specific applications of joint protection to particular sites are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7751.html" rel="external">"Joint protection program for the upper limb"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7763.html" rel="external">"Joint protection program for the lower limb"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7758.html" rel="external">"Joint protection program for the neck"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h2">What is joint protection?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Joint protection is a process that includes the following two major components [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Individualized assessment of a patient's activities to ascertain the potential to contribute to worsening pain, inflammation, instability, and/or deformity of an already abnormal joint</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Creation of a program to increase a patient's functional ability that includes altered work methods, behavioral modifications, and good body mechanics and that is supplemented, if necessary, with splints, braces, or assistive equipment designed to minimize further joint damage</p><p></p><p>The process of joint protection also includes energy conservation, which is a paced, more efficient use of muscles and joints. These principles encourage people with musculoskeletal problems to utilize their bodies in a manner to minimize pain, swelling, and associated limitations of movement and function. Occupational therapists have training that allows them to assess patients and to provide individualized joint protection advice.</p><p>Although "joint protection" is the classic terminology, "joint care" more accurately describes the goal of these principles. "Protection," as used in this context, does not denote strict avoidance of use. Indeed, joint immobilization for a prolonged period can contribute negatively to joint problems by promoting articular stiffness and muscular weakness.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">What is ergonomics?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ergonomics is defined as the science related to humans and their work, embodying the anatomic, physiologic, and mechanical principles affecting the efficient use of human energy. Safe lifting techniques, proper posture, appropriate seating position, and assistive equipment are only a few of the many examples of ergonomics in the workplace.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Who benefits from joint protection?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Joint protection was originally designed for people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with the goals of reducing pain and inflammation and of protecting their fragile joint capsules and ligaments. These principles were subsequently expanded to include individuals with osteoarthritis (OA) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>] and overuse conditions.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Efficacy of joint protection and energy conservation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is evidence that joint protection relieves pain, reduces local inflammation, and maintains functional ability. Patients are able to identify activities that cause pain and experience an improvement in pain when using joint protection techniques [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, the strength of data may vary based on the underlying condition, area of pain, and type of joint protection intervention.</p><p>An overview of systematic reviews found high-quality evidence for beneficial effects of joint protection and patient education for patients with RA, with pain, function, and patient global assessment being the primary outcomes of interest [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. There is conflicting evidence about the effectiveness of joint protection for hand arthritis in particular. Some studies have shown improvements and pain and function [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>], while others failed to find a difference in outcomes for patients receiving a joint protection intervention compared with those receiving a self-management intervention [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>].</p><p>There is some evidence to support various types of joint protection interventions, including group education programs [<a href="#rid8">8-10</a>] and web-based rehabilitation interventions [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>More details on the use of many components involved in joint protection, such as education, exercise, and physical and occupational therapy referrals, for patients with RA and OA can be found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7498.html" rel="external">"Nonpharmacologic therapies for patients with rheumatoid arthritis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106097.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of osteoarthritis"</a>.)</p><p>There is also evidence that muscle strengthening decreases pain and improves function. The beneficial effects of strength training in RA and OA are presented in more detail elsewhere [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/111177.html" rel="external">"Management of knee osteoarthritis", section on 'Exercise'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7498.html" rel="external">"Nonpharmacologic therapies for patients with rheumatoid arthritis", section on 'Rest'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">THE PRINCIPLES OF JOINT PROTECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following principles are the foundation of patient education in joint protection. Each is discussed in more detail below.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Respect pain</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Distribute the load over stronger joints and/or larger surface areas</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoid maintaining the same joint position for prolonged periods</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduce excess body weight</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use good posture and body mechanics</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use the minimum amount of force necessary to complete the job</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Simplify work by using efficiency principles: plan, organize, and balance work with rest</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Remain active to maintain and increase strength and range of motion</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Respect pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Activities that worsen joint pain warrant modification. Learning to respect pain involves attending to it and to aspects of activities that cause or worsen joint pain, followed by making an assessment and plan based upon previous experience, with the goal of continuing important activities with a minimum of pain. As an example, if pain results from too much activity, patients can try to take more rest breaks, perform tasks with adapted equipment, and/or otherwise modify how they carry out activities. If such modifications fail to prevent pain due to a particular task that could previously be performed with a minimum of discomfort, it may indicate a change in disease, and a clinician should be consulted.</p><p>For the patient who is deconditioned or inactive, exercise can initially reproduce or increase pain. Encourage patients to communicate with their therapist regarding the modification of their exercise program rather than stopping exercise completely. Often the pain is of muscular origin.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>The two-hour pain rule</strong> – This rule is a useful guideline to evaluate excessive activity. If a patient has pain for two hours after the activity, it means they have done too much. While there are several time frames suggested in the literature, the Arthritis Foundation and the Arthritis Self-Management Course advocate use of the two-hour pain rule [<a href="#rid1">1,14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Activity pacing</strong> – Activity pacing involves goal setting, planning, and gradual increases around activity [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The goal of activity pacing is to avoid cycles of overactivity and underactivity, as can happen when activity leads to pain. As an example, providers may ask patients to follow three steps [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Make a list of some of the things that you tend to overdo</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Make a time limit for the activity and then <strong>stop</strong> and <strong>rest</strong></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Keep track of how you are doing (how many times did you stop yourself from overdoing it?)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients may need to track pain levels following activity and modify activity if they experience delayed increases in pain. Increased time in an activity is not helpful if it results in increased pain later. An activity pacing form for patients can be seen on the US Department of Veterans Affairs <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mentalhealth.va.gov%2Fcoe%2Fcesamh%2Fdocs%2FActivity_Pacing-patients.pdf&amp;token=D0NWoDBZ70ky9Z5X7nvJdMeIqnDV6TBmA72tQEyK6WjghV7H4ig4pLII%2BG0qT1s9X92XAvcQKxSknJqmforZhnNINAbQdOFQy4HALC0Q4Bw%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=7754" target="_blank">website</a> [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Factors affecting activity-related joint pain</strong> — Many factors can influence the onset and intensity of joint pain that is activity-related. The following are illustrative:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Time – The length of time one spends on an activity can influence pain. As an example, five minutes of an activity may be manageable, but an hour of the same task may result in pain that lasts for a few days.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Weight – Weight can influence pain in more than one way. Carrying a small bag of groceries with a few items may not cause any difficulties, but a full 10 lb (4.5 kg) bag of groceries can cause or worsen hand or knee pain depending upon the vulnerable joints. Pain can also occur from carrying too much body weight.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Repetition – The number of repetitions of an activity that cause or worsen pain is notable. Stapling a few sheets of paper may not cause any pain but stapling 25 or 50 handouts may cause significant pain that lingers for hours or days.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Lifting, climbing, kneeling, and squatting are work activities affected by time, weight, and repetition. A systematic review found that longer cumulative exposure to kneeling or squatting in the workplace is associated with a higher risk of knee OA [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h2">Reduce excess body weight</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Even modest amounts of weight loss (5.0 to 7.5 percent of body weight) may improve symptoms and function in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Excess weight puts a strain on the body, especially lower extremity joints such as hips, knees, and ankles. Excess body weight is a powerful risk factor for developing OA. Furthermore, joint pain can lead to inactivity and subsequent weight gain, which can further exacerbate pain. The role of obesity in causation of OA and the role of weight loss in treatment of OA are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/111177.html" rel="external">"Management of knee osteoarthritis", section on 'Weight loss'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5499.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and risk factors for osteoarthritis", section on 'Obesity'</a>.)</p><p>Extra weight can also result in strain on the lower back area. Some patients may compensate for abdominal obesity by developing an increased lumbar lordosis. We encourage patients to maintain a normal weight for their height and build. Weight loss often results in decreased pain and in increased energy [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Management of chronic low back pain, including exercise-based therapy, is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7774.html" rel="external">"Exercise-based therapy for low back pain", section on 'Subacute and chronic low back pain: Exercise is beneficial'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7770.html" rel="external">"Subacute and chronic low back pain: Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h2">Use good posture and body mechanics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Another tenet of ergonomics and good biomechanics is that each joint should be used in its most anatomically stable and functional plane. Good body mechanics and posture can have a powerful impact by minimizing musculoskeletal strain and thereby preventing or reducing pain. People are often unaware of the impact of poor body mechanics and posture on their body. Teaching people with arthritis or overuse problems to be meticulous in their body mechanics and posture can have a significant impact on decreasing pain. While it takes more energy initially, once it becomes a habit, it takes less energy to maintain good posture.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Spine</strong> – There is a lack of strong evidence to support a causal relationship between awkward postures and low back pain [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Thus, it may be preferable to encourage regular movement and avoid sustained postures (eg, sitting while viewing a computer monitor in neck flexion) rather than recommending a specific posture.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Peripheral joints</strong> – All body parts experience less strain in the neutral position. Patients are less vulnerable to wrist pain and strain when they avoid extremes of flexion and extension. A knee that is neither locked nor flexed is more stable.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2739887372"><span class="h2">Distribute the load</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with a painful joint may benefit from distributing the load over stronger joints and/or larger surface areas when possible. As examples, patients may wash a table with an open hand rather than fingers, wear a purse or satchel over their shoulder if they have pain in their elbow or hands, or use a backpack if the shoulder is painful. This is because large joints are stronger than small ones due to basic body mechanics [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Thus, using larger joints to bear a load will reduce strain that can overstretch ligaments and/or create instability. By contrast, small hand joints are more vulnerable to pain or inflammation when used too much or too often. Bearing large loads on small joints can strain and pain even if one's joints are very stable.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h2">Use the minimum necessary force</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Squeezing and pinching activities put stress on the small joints of the hand. Patients can use less force by consciously holding equipment with less effort, taking rest breaks, and using special equipment. Patients with OA of the knees can descend stairs backwards, as this decreases joint forces in both the supporting and leading legs [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h3">Assistive devices</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Assistive devices include braces and splints, as well as modifications to devices (eg, foam padding to provide a grip cushion).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>For the hand and wrist</strong> – For patients with painful hand and wrist problems, specially made or assistive devices allow forces to be spread over larger areas and permit joints to operate nearer the mid-range of their motion. Lightweight equipment with built-up handles of about one inch (2.5 centimeters) in diameter can decrease the amount of force on joints. Built-up handles can also help individuals with weak hands. Foam pipe insulation is widely available and can be cut and used as grip cushions on tools, handles, brooms, etc.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and OA support the use of assistive devices. A study of women with RA showed that pain was significantly reduced when assistive devices were used for activities of daily living [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Another study demonstrated that nighttime hand-positioning splinting also improved grip and pinch strength, as well as upper limb function and functional status in RA [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Combining assistive equipment with joint protection education and exercise resulted in improved grip strength and global hand function in patients with hand OA [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>For gait</strong> – Use of a cane in the contralateral hand decreases loading on the knee joint through reducing ground reaction forces and reducing the knee adduction moment. A randomized trial of patients with knee OA demonstrated significantly diminished pain and improved physical function after two months of daily cane use [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/112192.html" rel="external">"Management of moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis", section on 'Walking aids'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Obtaining devices</strong> – Patients may search for these devices through online retailers using search terms such as "assistive devices," "adaptive equipment," and "adaptive devices." They can add specificity by adding the purpose of the devices (eg, eating, bathroom safety). Additional devices can be found by searching for "ease of use" products on the Arthritis Foundation <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.arthritis.org%2F&amp;token=j%2BtF41plvYHq0KcVLVNCgheCWGCPdpuHEzc0tNOfiFfXoGgYGTXzdHHqcJSD0TLb&amp;TOPIC_ID=7754" target="_blank">website</a>.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19"><span class="h2">Simplify work by using efficiency principles</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Planning, organizing, and balancing work with rest are useful principles to employ to reduce stress on joints. A 2016 systematic review found moderate evidence that education on joint protection and energy conservation increased joint protection behaviors [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Moderate evidence supports balancing work with rest (activity pacing) as an occupational therapy intervention for hip and knee OA [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. For problems in the workplace, the patient should seek professional consultation with an onsite occupational health nurse or referral to an occupational therapist.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Planning</strong> – Patients who plan ahead can find the best time of day to perform a task, allow sufficient time, and eliminate steps or otherwise simplify the task. Patients tend to have less pain when they avoid rushing, simplify tasks, and spread out difficult tasks (eg, cleaning activities). In addition, patients may recognize during planning that getting help to perform a difficult task can reduce stress and pain during a busy week.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Organizing</strong> – Organizing tasks also makes them easier. Having supplies at easy to reach locations, between eye-level and hip-level, prevents excess strain on joints. Duplicating supplies in different locations avoids excess energy expenditure, and eliminating clutter helps patients avoid awkward positions and save time and energy in finding items.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Resting</strong> – Patients should schedule rest breaks during the day. Breaks give patients an opportunity to rest their joints, thereby avoiding pain and inflammation. Alternating heavy and light tasks is another way to take pressure off joints. Many people alternate between sitting and standing activities to put less strain on joints. If work requires sitting all day, encourage patients to walk around and stretch periodically. If work requires prolonged standing in one location, placing a block of wood on the floor and stepping upon it with alternating feet may reduce strain.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23"><span class="h3">Using a computer workstation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An ergonomically coordinated workstation can minimize joint and body strain. Although, working at a computer workstation looks like a low-strain activity at first glance, regular computer use can cause or contribute to back pain, neck pain, muscle fatigue, carpal tunnel syndrome, wrist fatigue, shoulder fatigue, headache, and eyestrain. Useful information can be learned by asking the patient how much time they spend on a computer and what other types of activity or exercise they do in an average week. All patients who work at a computer station who have any joint problems or signs of repetitive strain should be asked about their computer workstations at work and/or home, including how often and how long they use these workstations.</p><p>There are several key principles to follow to reduce risk of repetitive strain injury (RSI) and pain. These include good posture, proper placement of equipment, fitness maintenance, and regular rest breaks. Good posture and body alignment are key to any computer workstation. Guidelines for correct posture and sit-stand work surfaces are listed on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OHSA) <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.osha.gov%2Fetools%2Fcomputer-workstations&amp;token=DDuKmbncU2oEYKdF7baRPbhwQjiigxorEHz8iHQDh15OLd1fx6PMB59Obr6%2BOgqTtM2eiQqS5gWBoH%2BeaDAm5w%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=7754" target="_blank">website</a>.</p><p>Sit-stand workstations assist in reducing total sitting time. They offer the opportunity to change position as needed and may reduce musculoskeletal pain, although the data are mixed [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. Some sit-stand workstations may reduce productivity [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. More long-term studies are indicated to clarify the benefits of sit-stand workstations.</p><p>Individuals need to take rest breaks regularly. Brief exercises improve circulation, increase mobility, and prevent pain and discomfort. For example, every hour, the worker can perform warm-up exercises and stretches. Hand and thumb stretches for 10 seconds periodically can be helpful. Performing regular aerobic exercise improves blood flow and the body's muscle endurance. Strong muscles can also tolerate more stress. Those who are fit will be able to work at their workstations longer without developing symptoms.</p><p>A systematic review of workplace interventions to manage chronic musculoskeletal conditions found that specific strength exercises appeared to have better effects on pain and functional activity in comparison with other types of exercises, but all exercises showed within-group improvement [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Improvements in functional status and pain were associated with the use of a workplace integrated care program provided by a physical or occupational therapist with ergonomics training, whereas self-management strategies had little impact on outcomes. Additional evidence in support of ergonomic interventions in the workspace comes from a small randomized trial in which workers in the intervention group who received tailored ergonomic workstation modifications experienced lower-intensity pain (on a self-reported scale) in areas including the neck, shoulder, upper back, wrist, and hand, as compared with the control group [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1747389390"><span class="h2">Avoid prolonged immobility</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients should avoid maintaining the same joint position for prolonged periods. Joints that are kept in one position for long periods of time are inclined to get stiff (gel phenomenon). Immobilization of a joint for days or weeks can lead to muscle atrophy and joint contractures. Many patients complain of stiffness in their knees when they sit for long periods of time. Some people relieve stiffness by sitting on the aisle so they have the room to periodically stretch out bent knees during a play or movie. Often patients make these changes independently, and health professionals reinforce them. Clinicians can facilitate the process by asking patients, "When do you find yourself getting stiff in that joint?" Other questions include "Is there anything you already do that helps at least some of the time?" and "Is there anything else you can do that would help you manage your pain or stiffness?"</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H24"><span class="h2">Remain active</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients are encouraged to remain active to maintain and increase strength and range of motion. Movement is vital to living. Exercise plays an important role in control of body weight, cardiovascular fitness, and prevention of coronary heart disease. Furthermore, exercise generally is expected to improve rather than worsen joint pain and function when individualized for a patient with musculoskeletal disorders.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25"><span class="h3">Type of exercise</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The type and amount of exercise depend upon the person for whom it is prescribed. Walking, swimming, aquatic exercise, tai chi, and biking are low-impact or non-impact forms of exercise that many people with arthritis can safely perform. If individuals need help with selecting appropriate exercises or with beginning an aerobic program, they may benefit from a referral to an occupational therapist, a physical therapist, or an exercise physiologist. Some hospital-based fitness programs have professionals on staff who have special training to help people with chronic illness and arthritis.</p><p>Caution needs to be applied to patients with lax or malaligned knees as greater quadriceps strength may increase progression of preexisting arthritis. Such patients should be referred to a physical therapist who specializes in treating people with arthritis knee problems. Treatment may include modified exercises and appropriate bracing. Caution is also indicated for physical activity after knee or hip arthroplasty, which is described in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7972.html" rel="external">"Total hip arthroplasty", section on 'Follow-up and activity level'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7967.html" rel="external">"Total knee arthroplasty", section on 'Follow-up and activity level'</a>.)</p><p>Some patients are not interested in a formal exercise program. Examples of moderate-intensity lifestyle physical activity that patients with arthritis may perform include light housework, shopping, gardening, clearing walks and driveways, child care, care of older adults, leisure walking, and pool exercises [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p>More detailed discussions of exercise for patients with OA and RA are presented elsewhere:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7498.html" rel="external">"Nonpharmacologic therapies for patients with rheumatoid arthritis", section on 'Physical activity'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106097.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of osteoarthritis", section on 'Nonpharmacologic therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/112385.html" rel="external">"Management of hand osteoarthritis", section on 'Exercise'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/119317.html" rel="external">"Management of hip osteoarthritis", section on 'Nonpharmacologic measures'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/111177.html" rel="external">"Management of knee osteoarthritis", section on 'Initial nonpharmacologic measures'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The role of exercise in general health promotion is discussed in more detail separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/107636.html" rel="external">"Exercise for adults: Terminology, patient assessment, and medical clearance"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/120020.html" rel="external">"Exercise prescription and guidance for adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2786.html" rel="external">"The benefits and risks of aerobic exercise"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115880.html" rel="external">"Strength training for health in adults: Terminology, principles, benefits, and risks"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26"><span class="h1">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT JOINT PROTECTION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27"><span class="h2">Who teaches joint protection or joint care?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Occupational and physical therapists teach patients how to care for their joints and how to use them wisely. Occupational therapists tend to have expertise in teaching patients specific ways to protect their hands and ways to use them in daily activities [<a href="#rid25">25</a>], while physical therapists tend to have expertise in teaching specific ways to protect knees and hips. Additionally, both instruct in proper body mechanics, posture, and transfers, with physical therapists more focused on ambulation and occupational therapists more focused on daily living activities. Other professionals, including exercise physiologists, may also have special training. Patients should be encouraged to check the training, as well as the certification or licensure, of individuals they consult and to ask orthopedic surgeons and rheumatologists for referral, as these clinicians often have working relationships with therapists with relevant interest and expertise.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H28"><span class="h2">Is there a role for personal trainers?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some personal trainers can provide useful exercise information for healthy individuals who want to exercise in a gymnasium or health club. However, their ability to advise patients with arthritis is likely to be inferior to that of a physical or occupational therapist due to significant differences in training and certification. The training of a personal trainer varies widely, from no training to certificate programs and brief clinical experience. Thus, if the patient has symptomatic or advanced osteoarthritis (OA) or an inflammatory arthritis, we suggest referral to a physical therapist for assessment and structuring of any activity as part of a health club program. Then, if a patient gets worse with a personal trainer, the physical therapist recommendations can provide a framework for a personalized exercise regimen.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H29"><span class="h2">What constitutes quality joint care education?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A good program explores the tasks patients need to do in their daily lives and identifies tasks patients find painful or feel unable to do. Together with the therapist, patients learn and practice alternate ways to perform tasks using the principles of joint protection. The key to success is engaging the patient in the process of identifying difficult and painful tasks, as well as finding and practicing solutions. Many clinics perform this training in small group settings. This is ideal as the patients can learn from others and can explore more tasks than they might by themselves [<a href="#rid4">4,8,9</a>]. In addition, therapists can recommend what to look for when purchasing special equipment and stores or websites where patients can place orders.</p><p>A behavioral program that focuses on self-management education has been found to be more effective in the long term in enabling people with RA to reduce pain, improve psychological status, and self-manage their condition, compared with standard information-focused education [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Another study that demonstrated similar results found that improvements were not seen until six months after beginning the program. These findings suggest that patients with chronic disease may need a longer period of intervention and follow-up to observe results [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p>Some clinics provide handouts with lists of "Dos and Don'ts" to teach joint protection skills. While these lists contain useful information, they are <strong>not</strong> recommended as the sole focus of education because they do not teach people to apply the material to themselves.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30"><span class="h2">When should a patient be referred to occupational and/or physical therapy?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Refer a patient who:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Has joint or overuse problems, has repeated exacerbations of pain following activity, and is unable to independently modify their behavior.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Has a joint injury and does not know how to care for their joints.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Has OA of the hand, for evaluation of ability to perform activities of daily living and for instruction in joint protection [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Has a newly diagnosed joint disease and who needs help learning to cope with their condition (eg, newly diagnosed RA) [<a href="#rid3">3,35,36</a>].

For those with varus deformity of the knee, an unloader brace may produce a significant decrease in pain and improvement in physical function. Patients with OA without severe deformity may experience a modest decrease in symptoms when using a neoprene sleeve. Bracing for patients with osteoarthritis is discussed in more detail elsewhere.

The most consistent effect of splinting is reduction of pain [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. Prefabricated wrist splints are better accepted than hard (plaster or molded thermoplastic) splints by patients [<a href="#rid41">41</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Nighttime use may be preferable to continuous use for patients with RA. One study randomly assigned 50 patients with RA to the use of a nighttime hand positioning or to usual treatment [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. The group assigned to splinting had less pain, improved grip and pinch strength, improved upper limb function, and improved functional status [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. However, in another randomized controlled trial with 120 patients, there was no significant difference between the two groups on measures of grip strength, deformity, hand function, and pain [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Wrist splinting may also be beneficial for patients with carpal tunnel syndrome [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. Use of splints for carpal tunnel syndrome is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Splinting the CMC joint has been shown to relieve pain and increase function for patients with CMC joint OA when used for at least three months [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. Splints for the first CMC joint may be molded to the patient's thumb and wrist from thermoplastic by an occupational therapist. Alternatively, a prefabricated CMC splint may also be used. A more detailed discussion on the role of splinting for CMC joint OA can be found elsewhere.

Their design prevents hyperextension of the IP joint. They can improve grasp and prehensile strength, as well as the appearance of the joint [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. In a pilot study with 17 patients with RA, ring splints significantly improved dexterity, and patients reported improved hand function. For satisfactory results, careful patient assessment by an occupational therapist and well-fitting splints are required. Patients with early-stage RA disease are the best candidates for extensive hand splinting [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. Thermoplastic splints have been found to be equally effective [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. In a systematic review, splints improved dexterity for patients with swan neck deformities, but there was no evidence supporting splints for RA boutonniere deformities [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Splints for OA in the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint may also be helpful, although these are less frequently prescribed.

Discomfort and/or swelling are also sometimes reported by patients wearing night splints to manage carpal tunnel syndrome [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. A 2005 systematic review found some evidence to suggest that long-term adherence to knee bracing for osteoarthritis is relatively low, but the reasons were not determined [<a href="#rid49">49</a>].</p><p>Neoprene sensitivity is another potential risk but is rare. Splints and braces made with neoprene pose two dermatological risks: allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) and miliaria rubra (prickly heat). The most common symptom of ACD is severe itching at the contact site. Swelling in the contact area and distally is also common. Prickly heat is caused when sweat ducts are blocked by dirt, dust, or creams. Characteristic symptoms are small red, elevated, inflammatory papules that produce a tingling, burning, or pricking sensation. Thiourea compounds and mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) used in the manufacturing of neoprene are thought to be the causes of these reactions, which can occasionally be of sufficient severity to require hospitalization. These dermatological conditions may be underdiagnosed in patients using splints [<a href="#rid50">50,51</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13655.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1733.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with pustular skin lesions", section on 'Miliaria'</a>.)</p><p>Strategies for reducing the dermatologic risks of splints and braces include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Screening patients for history of allergies to neoprene or other materials containing thiourea compounds and using alternate materials for those at risk</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Educating patients regarding the increased risk from hot and humid environments.
