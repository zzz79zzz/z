Respiratory failure results from multiple contributing factors, including respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) from surfactant deficiency. The pathophysiology of RDS is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5055.html" rel="external">"Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in the newborn: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>Many factors that contribute to respiratory failure in this population have important implications for MV management. Examples include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Immature respiratory drive</strong> – Preterm neonates are prone to central apnea and hypopnea due to an inconsistent respiratory drive from an immature nervous system. Because of this, VPT neonates typically require a MV mode with a set mandatory or back-up breath rate. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5052.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of apnea of prematurity"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Narrow and collapsible airways</strong> – The supraglottic and subglottic airways of VPT neonates are narrow and lack a mature supporting tissue architecture, making them unstable and prone to collapse. This is one of several reasons why VPT neonates benefit from continuous distending airway pressure (noninvasive continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] and/or invasive positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP]) during MV. (See <a class="local">'Initial conventional MV settings'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Reduced alveolar air space</strong> – The alveolar air space is reduced due to incomplete alveolarization, with less surface area available for gas exchange; inadequate surfactant quantity and quality; and edema from a secretory alveolar epithelium, excessive pulmonary blood flow, underdeveloped pulmonary lymphatics, and inflammation. As a result, gas exchange in VPT neonates is compromised by low pulmonary compliance, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, and poor diffusion. Compliance is not static and marked dynamic changes can occur (eg, after surfactant administration). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5055.html" rel="external">"Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in the newborn: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Compliant chest wall</strong> – VPT neonates have biomechanical disadvantages, including a compliant chest wall and the suboptimal shape and position of the immature ribs and diaphragm. These disadvantages contribute to a low functional residual capacity and risk atelectasis, while increasing the work of breathing.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2702193613"><span class="h2">Need for respiratory support</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because the immature respiratory system fails to maintain adequate gas exchange, most VPT neonates require some form of respiratory support (either noninvasive support or invasive MV) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The likelihood of requiring invasive MV increases with decreasing gestational age (GA). Despite the trend towards increasing use of noninvasive respiratory support in managing VPT neonates since the 1990s and early 2000s, use of invasive MV remains common in this population, especially in extremely preterm (EPT) infants (GA &lt;28 weeks).</p><p>In a study from the Australian and New Zealand Neonatal Network (2007 to 2013) of nearly 12,000 VPT neonates who were initially managed with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP), one-quarter required endotracheal intubation within 72 hours of birth [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. CPAP failure was more common among neonates born at 25 to 28 weeks GA compared with 29 to 32 weeks GA (43 versus 21 percent, respectively).</p><p>In a prospective registry study that included nearly 11,000 neonates &lt;29 weeks GA in the United States Neonatal Research Network (2013 to 2016), 84 percent required MV at some time in the postnatal course [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. MV use increased with decreasing GA, with &gt;99 percent of neonates born at 23 weeks GA requiring MV compared with 88 percent of infants born at 26 weeks GA and 66 percent of neonates born at 28 weeks GA [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1637295218"><span class="h1">CLINICAL APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following sections detail the approach to MV in very preterm (VPT) neonates. Management is tailored to meet the needs of the individual neonate, which will differ between patients and within the same patient over time. Individualized assessment and frequent reassessment of the adequacy of ventilator settings is critical, especially with changes in cardiopulmonary physiology during the early postnatal period.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4076520662"><span class="h2">General principles</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While lifesaving, MV can also cause lung injury and impact hemodynamics, with secondary consequences on the brain and other organs. MV can cause ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) at any age and the general measures used to minimize VILI are fairly consistent regardless of age; however, the impact of VILI and the imperative for utilizing lung-protective strategies are particularly important for VPT neonates with immature, injury-prone lungs. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common and consequential morbidity of preterm birth caused by concurrent injury and maldevelopment of the immature lungs.

Although the parameters below provide a useful framework, consensus is lacking, and there is no standardized definition to determine when invasive MV should be initiated. Our approach is generally consistent with definitions used in major clinical trials evaluating respiratory support in VPT infants [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We attempt to avoid MV through the preferential use of noninvasive respiratory support (eg, nasal continuous positive airway pressure [nCPAP]). In our center, nCPAP is the preferred initial modality. The evidence supporting preferential use of different noninvasive respiratory support modes such as nCPAP and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (nIPPV) preterm infants to prevent VILI and BPD is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4997.html" rel="external">"Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants: Management", section on 'Noninvasive positive airway pressure'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We allow a trial of noninvasive support (eg, nCPAP) in all preterm neonates, irrespective of gestational age (GA).

However, the thresholds are not hard set and these parameters should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical findings. For neonates with signs of labored breathing, hemodynamic instability, or persistent metabolic acidosis, we generally use a lower threshold for transitioning to invasive MV. The threshold to transition to invasive MV is lower in the most immature infants who are at highest risk of failing noninvasive support.</p><p></p><p>Our approach to determining when efforts to optimize noninvasive respiratory support have failed is generally consistent with the definitions used in clinical trials evaluating nCPAP in preterm neonates. For example, in the COIN trial, infants randomized to nCPAP were deemed to have failed if they had pH &lt;7.25 with a PaCO<sub>2</sub> &gt;60 mmHg, persistent metabolic acidosis, FiO<sub>2</sub> &gt;0.60, or excessive apneic episodes (ie, ≥6 episodes requiring stimulation or &gt;1 episode requiring positive-pressure ventilation within a six-hour period) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Similarly, in the SUPPORT trial, failure criteria for infants randomized to nCPAP were a PaCO<sub>2</sub> &gt;65 mmHg, FiO<sub>2 </sub>&gt;0.50 to maintain SpO<sub>2</sub> above 88 percent for over one hour, or hemodynamic instability [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1598979974"><span class="h2">Choice of mode</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2364469019"><span class="h3">Our approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The approach to choosing a mode of ventilation and initial ventilator settings is not standardized and practice varies from center to center. Our general approach is as follows  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef131155" href="/d/graphic/131155.html" rel="external">table 3</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We use CMV as the initial approach and reserve high-frequency ventilation (HFV) for cases of refractory respiratory failure.

(See <a class="local">'Role of high-frequency ventilation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We use a synchronized mode with both mandatory and spontaneous breaths (ie, synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation plus pressure support [SIMV + PS] or assist control ventilation [ACV]). Data comparing these modes are discussed separately.

Pressure-limited ventilation (PLV) may be used if VTV is not available or when there is a technical challenge that limits the reliable delivery of measured Tvs (eg, large endotracheal tube [ETT] leak). Data supporting preferential use of VTV are described below. (See <a class="local">'Volume-targeted versus pressure-limited ventilation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4024720188"><span class="h3">Volume-targeted versus pressure-limited ventilation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Use of VTV in neonates has increased over time as technical advances have allowed for more accurate measurement of small Tvs and better compensation for endotracheal tube (ETT) leaks. In a 2018 report of respiratory management of extremely preterm infants among various international neonatal networks, approximately one-third of NICUs reported using VTV as the most common initial mode of MV [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. VTV was the predominant mode in Australia and New Zealand, Canada, Finland, and Spain, but remained less commonly used in other regions.</p><p>The shift towards increasing use of VTV in neonates was spurred by preclinical observations that tissue stretch from lung overdistension (volutrauma) caused more lung inflammation and injury than exposure to high pressure without excessive stretch (barotrauma) [<a href="#rid8">8-10</a>]. The superiority of VTV over PLV has been confirmed in meta-analyses of clinical trials, which demonstrate improved short-term outcomes [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. However, there are few data on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p><p>A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis identified 20 randomized controlled trials comparing VTV and PLV in 977 neonates (predominantly preterm neonates) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. VTV resulted in:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Shorter duration of MV (mean difference 1.35 days shorter; 95% CI 0.86-1.83 days)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lower incidence of pneumothorax (5 versus 9 percent; rate ratio [RR] 0.52, 95% CI 0.31-0.87)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lower incidence of BPD at 36 weeks (23 versus 35 percent; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53-0.87)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lower incidence of periventricular leukomalacia or grade 3 and 4 intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (8 versus 16 percent; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27-0.80)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nonsignificant trend towards lower mortality (12 versus 16 percent; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.53-1.07)</p><p></p><p>All of the trials included in the meta-analysis compared volume-targeted with pressure-limited strategies, but there was considerable heterogeneity with respect to the specific mode used in each arm. In addition, the trials were conducted at centers with relative expertise in the use of VTV. The generalizability of these results to centers implementing the novel use of VTV remains uncertain.</p><p>Historically, PLV was the standard approach used for neonatal MV. In fact, PLV is the only mode available on many older generations of neonatal ventilators. A key disadvantage of PLV is breath-to-breath variability in delivered Tv. This can be pronounced when the mechanics of the lung and respiratory circuit change dynamically, as may occur after surfactant administration, with changes in lung volume, or when the ETT is partially occluded (eg, from secretions) or has a positional leak. Both unacceptably large and small Tvs can contribute to VILI from volutrauma and atelectrauma, respectively. In addition, rapid fluctuations in carbon dioxide may contribute to unstable cerebral perfusion and brain injury. In a study analyzing data on nearly 12,000 ventilator breaths in 36 preterm neonates managed with PLV or VTV, there was considerably more breath-to-breath Tv variability with PLV, with 61 percent of breaths in the PLV group falling outside the target range of 4 to 6 mL/kg compared with 37 percent of VTV breaths [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>However, there are some advantages to PLV:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cost and availability – Unlike VTV, which generally requires more modern ventilators to function effectively in neonates, PLV can be used with older generations of neonatal ventilators, many of which lack a VTV option and only provide PLV.

In our practice, we do <strong>not</strong> use elective HFV as a primary mode of ventilation in VPT neonates because CMV is more readily available, easier to use, and conclusive evidence supporting elective HFV is lacking. However, other centers may use HFV more commonly as the initial ventilation approach, particularly in neonates at high risk of developing VILI.</p><p>The approach to using HFV as a "rescue" therapy for neonates with refractory respiratory failure is detailed below.

An "open-lung" strategy minimizes atelectasis and increases lung volume, typically through application of higher continuous distending airway pressure settings such as mean airway pressure (during HFOV) or PEEP (during CMV).

Clinical trial data comparing different Tv settings are limited. In a small trial involving 30 preterm neonates randomized to a Tv of 3 or 5 mL/kg within the first hour after birth, neonates in the 5 mL/kg group had shorter duration of MV and lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines detected in tracheal aspirates [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].

This range is consistent with PEEP levels reported in the previously described cross-sectional European survey study and a secondary analysis of an international multicenter trial involving 278 extremely low birth weight (ELBW, birth weight &lt;1000 g) infants (mean PEEP levels in these studies were 4.5 and 5.7 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, respectively) [<a href="#rid31">31,33</a>].

In a 2003 meta-analysis of five trials (694 neonates) comparing "shorter" Ti (ranging from 0.33 to 1.0 seconds) with "longer" Ti (ranging from 0.7 to 1.0 seconds), longer Ti was associated with more air leak (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.25-1.94) and higher mortality (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.00-1.59) [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].

Historically, use of TCOM in preterm infants was limited by technical limitations and concerns that use of heat on the TCOM sensor risks injury to the immature skin. Similarly, use of EtCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring in VPT neonates was limited due to concerns about the additional weight (and therefor risk of ETT displacement) and added dead space to the respiratory circuit.

In a single-center observational study of 301 preterm neonates receiving MV before and in the two years after implementing a respiratory therapist-driven MV weaning protocol, implementation of the protocol was associated with a shorter time to first extubation attempt, shorter overall duration of MV, and lower rate of extubation failure [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].

We do not use spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) or other readiness testing beyond our clinical judgement to inform the decision to proceed with a trial of extubation. The reluctance to extubate infants too early resulting in a high risk of extubation failure stems in part from concern that exposure to multiple tracheal intubations and courses of MV may place the neonate at greater risk of morbidity (eg, upper airway injury, risk of BPD, and organ injury from associated hemodynamic instability and hypoxemia). However, the number of intubations and extubations does not appear to increase the risk of BPD. An observational study in ELBW infants found that the risk of BPD was progressively higher for infants exposed to greater numbers of MV courses [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. But the association was no longer significant after adjusting for the total duration of MV, except for infants exposed to ≥4 MV courses. This suggests that duration of MV impacts the risk of BPD more than the number of intubations and extubations.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">An objective assessment tool that could accurately identify extubation readiness would be desirable since it could potentially shorten MV duration for some neonates, while maintaining adequate support in those at high risk of failure.

This high intrathoracic pressure can decrease systemic venous return (ie, reduce preload), which can negatively impact cardiac output and hemodynamic stability.

However, many other factors contribute to brain injury in preterm infants and the relative contribution of HFV to the overall risk in this population remains unclear. The clinical trials described above had inconsistent findings, with some reporting similar rates of IVH and PVL in the HFV and CMV groups [<a href="#rid13">13,15,25,49</a>], while others reported increased risk of adverse neurologic outcome in the HFV group [<a href="#rid16">16,26,47</a>].

It results from multiple contributing factors, including surfactant deficiency, incomplete alveolarization, and an immature respiratory drive. Despite the trend towards increasing use of noninvasive respiratory support in managing VPT neonates, use of invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) remains common in this population. (See <a class="local">'Respiratory failure in VPT neonates'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5055.html" rel="external">"Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in the newborn: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ventilator-induced lung injury</strong> – While lifesaving, MV can also cause lung injury and contribute to hemodynamic instability and brain injury. The impact of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and the imperative for utilizing lung-protective strategies are particularly important for VPT neonates. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common and consequential morbidity of preterm birth caused by concurrent injury and maldevelopment of the immature lungs. (See <a class="local">'General principles'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4987.html" rel="external">"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD): Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>MV management</strong> – MV management in VPT neonates is tailored to meet the needs of the individual neonate, which will differ between patients and within the same patient over time.
