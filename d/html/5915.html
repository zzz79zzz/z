         Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is an acquired syndrome characterized by excessive systemic activation of coagulation, resulting in both hemorrhage and thrombosis. DIC can progress rapidly into life-threatening multiorgan failure; thus, identifying the underlying etiology is paramount to management.
        </p>
        <p>
         The etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of DIC in infants and children will be reviewed here. DIC in adults and in pregnancy is discussed separately. (See

         The following is a summary of the pathogenesis of DIC. A more complete discussion is found elsewhere. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Under normal hemostatic conditions, clot formation and resolution are tightly regulated. In DIC, dysregulated activation of the coagulation system results in a consumptive coagulopathy and microvascular thrombosis. DIC is always a secondary process caused by a variety of underlying disorders (eg, sepsis, trauma, or malignancy), which can cause endothelial tissue damage and procoagulant exposure [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. This activates the coagulation cascade, which promotes fibrin production and deposition and consumption of clotting factors. The subsequent consumption of coagulation factors and platelets, inhibition of natural anticoagulants and fibrinolysis, and fibrin deposition result in the clinical picture of DIC: a bleeding diathesis accompanied by microvascular thrombosis that often leads to end-organ damage  (

        </p>

         DIC can be summarized into the following processes  (

         Intravascular activation of coagulation – Tissue damage from the initiating underlying disease releases procoagulants into the bloodstream, resulting in intravascular activation of coagulation. Examples of procoagulants include lipopolysaccharides from bacteria, phospholipids from damaged vascular endothelium, or the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps.

         Sepsis is the most common cause of DIC in infants and children. DIC was classically recognized as an extreme complication of endothelial damage produced by meningococcemia. (See

         A wide variety of viral, rickettsial, fungal, parasitic, and bacterial infections can be associated with DIC  (

         DIC is a recognized complication of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) in adults, and it has been described in children with COVID-19-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). (See

         Neonatal viral infections (eg, rubella, herpes, cytomegalovirus, and enterovirus), systemic candidiasis, and bacterial sepsis (eg, group B streptococcus and gram-negative organisms) are causes of neonatal DIC. Congenital infections (TORCH infections) are also associated with DIC. In addition to exposure of procoagulant-triggering DIC, hypotensive shock from sepsis and the ensuing hypoperfusion contributes to endothelial damage and further propagates DIC. (See

         In children, DIC can be a complication of any major trauma or tissue injury. These include crush injury, massive burns, extensive surgery, severe hypothermia, heat exhaustion, and shock. In all these cases, release of tissue enzymes and phospholipids from damaged tissue into the systemic circulation triggers activation of the coagulation system. Brain tissue is a potent thromboplastin, and patients who sustain severe brain injury are especially at risk for DIC. (See

         Conditions associated with prematurity – In neonates with NEC, ischemic bowel tissue releases tissue factor, which activates the coagulation system. Patients with severe RDS are also at risk for DIC, presumably due to tissue damage from hypoxia. Autopsy studies in preterm infants with RDS have demonstrated fibrin deposition not only in the lungs but also the liver and kidney [

         Although the clinical spectrum and causes of DIC are variable in infants and children, the pathophysiology is the same, with an overwhelmed hemostatic system that is unable to compensate for the ongoing consumption of clotting factors and platelets. In these patients, clinical bleeding and microthrombosis occur and coagulation tests are often abnormal.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinical findings vary depending on the severity of DIC. In mild cases, bleeding may only be noted at venipuncture sites, but in more severe cases, there may be extensive hemorrhage and thrombosis with end-organ damage to the kidney, liver, lung, extremities, and central nervous system. Hemorrhage is the most common presentation, followed by skin manifestations of purpura and acral gangrene (purpura fulminans).
        </p>
        <p>
         In neonates, the most common sites of bleeding are the gastrointestinal tract and venipuncture sites [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. In severe cases, intrapulmonary and intraventricular hemorrhages occur. Risk factors for DIC in neonates include prematurity, low birth weight, and low Apgar scores [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         DIC can also occur in a chronic form due to continuous exposure to small amounts of a procoagulant, such as in the example of malignancy. In chronic DIC, production compensates for the consumptive coagulopathy and thrombosis tends to be the prevailing presentation, rather than hemorrhage.

         Decreased fibrinogen – When the fibrinogen concentration is low, it is consistent with a diagnosis of DIC due to its consumption in the formation of fibrin.

          9

        <p>
         Physiologic levels of factors V and VIII and fibrinogen in term infants are similar to those in adults and can serve as diagnostic markers for DIC in this age group [

In addition, neonates have relatively decreased amounts of plasma due to their higher hematocrit levels, and, therefore, it is imperative that the correct anticoagulant-to-plasma ratio is obtained in the blood specimens to ensure accurate testing.

         While not routinely required for the diagnosis, decreased levels of factors V and VIII help substantiate the diagnosis of DIC in uncertain cases.

Factor VIII is not produced by hepatocytes and thus is often low in DIC and increased or normal in liver disease. (See

         The related ISTH sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) score is a newer tool to assess patients with suspected DIC as a consequence of sepsis. The ISTH SIC score is determined by the degree of thrombocytopenia (2 points if &lt;100/microL; 1 point if ≥100 to &lt;150/microL), degree of PT prolongation (2 points for INR &gt;1.4; 1 point for INR &gt;1.2 to ≤1.4), and severity of organ dysfunction (measured using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score; 2 points for SOFA ≥2; 1 point for SOFA of 1) [

While the SOFA score is widely used in adult patients and is included in the consensus definition of sepsis in adults, there are fewer data on its use in children. An age-adjusted pediatric SOFA score (pSOFA) has been developed and validated in pediatric patients [

These scoring systems provide objective tools for assessing the likelihood of DIC, and they have prognostic value in patients with overt DIC. Disadvantages include their complexity and limited ability to capture asymptomatic or "non-overt" DIC.

         DIC is a serious complication of the underlying primary disease. The most important principle in managing a child with DIC is to identify and treat the underlying cause, thereby removing the triggering factors implicated in the DIC process. In some cases, successful treatment of the underlying cause will lead to resolution of DIC. In others, despite vigorous therapy directed towards the primary disease, coagulation abnormalities persist, resulting in significant hemorrhage and/or thrombosis with organ damage. DIC supportive therapy is appropriate for such patients. However, the risk of mortality and morbidity in severely affected patients remains high.

Treatment is individualized based upon a patient's age, severity of clinical symptoms, underlying primary disorder, and overall clinical status.

          Indications

         – Replacement therapy is indicated in patients with DIC who have clinically significant bleeding symptoms or who are at high risk for bleeding because of an impending invasive procedure. Examples of clinically significant bleeding may include gastrointestinal bleeding (not merely a positive guaiac test), prolonged bleeding from venipuncture sites, prolonged epistaxis, or prolonged bleeding after suctioning the endotracheal tube.

         to normalize laboratory tests (which often is impossible). Reasonable goals for the judicious use of blood components in the setting of clinically significant bleeding include maintaining platelet counts &gt;50,000/microL and fibrinogen concentrations &gt;100 mg/dL (1 mol/L) [

          Choice of replacement products
         </strong>
         – Clotting factors can be replaced by either FFP or cryoprecipitate. FFP provides both procoagulant and anticoagulant proteins and is administered every 12 to 24 hours at a dose of 10 to 15 mL/kg per infusion. Cryoprecipitate has higher concentrations of factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, and fibrinogen and can be used to correct hypofibrinogenemia. It is administered every six hours as needed at a dose of 10 mL/kg per infusion. Platelet transfusions are administered with a goal of maintaining the platelet counts &gt;50,000/microL.

          Repeat transfusions
         </strong>
         – Repeat transfusions may be necessary. The theoretical concern of replacement therapy increasing thrombotic risk by "adding fuel to the fire" has not been demonstrated [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ] and should not dissuade the clinician from administering replacement therapy to control significant bleeding. Clinicians should monitor for volume overload in patients who receive factor replacement. The exception to this is for patients with Kasabach-Merrit syndrome, in which platelet transfusions are thought to exacerbate bleeding and swelling of the tumors, presumably due to intratumoral trapping and activation of platelets. The risks and benefits of platelet transfusion should be carefully weighted, especially if the tumor is in a critical location such as the airway or neurovascular space.

         Therapeutic anticoagulation has a very limited role in the management of pediatric DIC. In our practice, we administer anticoagulant therapy (typically with

          unfractionated heparin

        </p>
        <p>
         In infants and children with DIC, heparin is generally avoided (with the exception of the rare patient with life-threatening or symptomatic thrombosis) because of its potential to exacerbate bleeding and because there are no compelling data demonstrating a benefit of heparin therapy in children or adults with DIC. In the past, heparin was routinely used in patients with clinically overt thrombosis and potential end-organ failure, but there is little evidence that this improved organ dysfunction.
        </p>
        <p>
         The use of heparin in pediatric patients differs from practice in adults, in which therapeutic heparin may be used for patients with predominantly thrombotic manifestations without bleeding, or for prophylaxis in critically ill patients without bleeding [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16

        </p>
        <p>
         If the clinical decision is made to administer therapeutic doses of heparin, continuous intravenous infusion of UFH is preferred because it allows for finely tuned titration and can be quickly turned off should bleeding occur. The starting dose of UFH should be lower than is typically used for treatment of thromboembolic disease (we typically start the continuous intravenous infusion at 5 to 10 units/kg per hour). For children with DIC, loading doses generally should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>

         The levels of endogenous anticoagulants (eg, antithrombin and protein C) are decreased in DIC. It has been suggested that administration of these anticoagulants may reduce microthrombus formation and improve outcomes in patients with DIC. However, the available data suggest that these interventions are either not effective or their effectiveness is limited to very select clinical settings.

          Pathogenesis and etiology

         – Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is an acquired syndrome characterized by hemorrhage and microvascular thrombosis. It results from activation of the coagulation system  (

          Clinical manifestations
         </strong>
         – Clinical manifestations vary depending on the ability of the hemostatic system to compensate for the ongoing depletion of coagulation factors and platelets. In mild cases, bleeding may only be noted at venipuncture sites, but in more severe cases, there may be extensive hemorrhage and thrombosis, with end-organ damage to the kidney, liver, lung, extremities, and central nervous system.

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of DIC is based upon a combination of clinical findings (eg, bleeding and microthrombi in a patient with a predisposing medical condition) and abnormal coagulation studies. No single test confirms the diagnosis. Laboratory values must be evaluated in aggregate, and serial testing is more informative than single measurements. Scoring systems have been developed to assist in diagnosing DIC  (

          Differential diagnosis

         – The differential diagnosis for DIC is broad and includes diseases that present with bleeding, coagulopathy, and/or thrombocytopenia  (

         Replacement therapy – In patients with clinically significant bleeding, we recommend the administration of replacement therapy with platelet transfusion and/or coagulation factors (fresh frozen plasma [FFP] or cryoprecipitate) (

          Grade 1C

         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         to normalize laboratory tests. Repeat transfusions may be necessary. The theoretical concern of replacement therapy increasing thrombotic risk by "adding fuel to the fire" has not been demonstrated and should not dissuade the clinician from administering replacement therapy to control significant bleeding. Patients who require a considerable volume of replacement therapy should be monitored for signs of volume overload. (See
