This disease primarily affects infants. It is most commonly caused by cow's milk (CM) or soy protein, although other foods can be triggers [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p>A number of gastrointestinal disorders in children have been attributed to immunologic reactions to dietary proteins. Immunologic reactions to dietary proteins may be classified as IgE mediated, non-IgE mediated (T cell), or mixed (IgE and T cell mediated). The entire gastrointestinal tract can be affected, from the mouth to the rectum. Most of these disorders affect a specific region of the gastrointestinal tract, such as eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), eosinophilic gastritis, food protein-induced enteropathy, enterocolitis, or proctocolitis. FPIES has some features that overlap with the other non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal allergic disorders, food protein-induced enteropathy, and proctocolitis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2398.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5897.html" rel="external">"Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis of infancy"</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis is based upon the presence of consistent clinical features with improvement following withdrawal of the suspected causal protein. Affected children are often misdiagnosed as having acute viral gastrointestinal illness or sepsis, delaying diagnosis of FPIES for many months. An oral food challenge (OFC) is sometimes performed to confirm the diagnosis or to determine resolution of the food allergy. Treatment consists of elimination of the food trigger(s) from the diet, anticipatory guidance regarding complementary feeding, periodic reassessments for resolution, and managing acute emergencies [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15042624"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Non-IgE-mediated and mixed gastrointestinal immune reactions to cow's milk (CM) proteins are estimated to account for up to 40 percent of CM protein hypersensitivity in infants and young children [<a href="#rid1">1,7</a>]. FPIES represents the severe end of the spectrum of food protein-induced gastrointestinal diseases in infants and is far less common than proctocolitis [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. The incidence ranges from 0.015 to 0.7 percent [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. There is a slight male predilection (52 to 60 percent) in FPIES [<a href="#rid10">10-13</a>]. Reports of FPIES in siblings of an affected child are rare. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5897.html" rel="external">"Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis of infancy"</a>.)</p><p>In a large, Israeli, population-based birth cohort from a single hospital, 0.34 percent of infants (44 of 13,019) were diagnosed with FPIES (confirmed by resolution of typical FPIES symptoms with removal of CM from the diet and/or a clinician-supervised oral food challenge [OFC] to CM in the first year of life), suggesting that FPIES may be more common than previously appreciated [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The incidence of IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy (CMA) in this same cohort was 0.5 percent.</p><p>Another study used data from the Australian Pediatric Surveillance Unit that provides monthly reports from 1400 involved pediatricians and is estimated to represent at least 50 percent of all eligible pediatricians in Australia [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. They provided the pediatricians with a standardized case definition of acute FPIES and collected monthly reports of new cases of acute FPIES in children younger than two years old. A total of 230 infants with FPIES were identified, giving an estimated annual incidence of 15.4 per 100,000. While this estimate dispels the myth of FPIES as a rare disorder, it is possible that it underestimates the true incidence of FPIES due to the methodologic limitations of the voluntary reporting system. This study did not address the incidence of chronic FPIES, although it is estimated that acute FPIES accounts for the majority of the FPIES cases.</p><p>In Spain, FPIES was reported to affect 0.7 percent of infants younger than 12 months in a single-center, unselected, population-based birth cohort (n = 1142) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. CM, hen's egg (HE) yolk, and fish (hake) were the most common triggers.</p><p>A population-based survey of food allergies in the United States was administered online or via telephone to a nationally representative sample of 53,575 households between 2015 and 2016 [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. Lifetime, physician-diagnosed FPIES was estimated to affect 0.51 percent (95% CI 0.42-0.62) of the US population under the age of 18 years and 0.22 percent (95% CI 0.17-0.28) of adults (18+ years), with an overall prevalence of 0.28 percent (0.24-0.33 percent). In another study from the US, among 158,510 pediatric patients in a birth cohort, 214 patients met 2017 FPIES diagnostic criteria. Pediatric FPIES incidence was between 0.17 and 0.42 percent depending upon birth year. As in prior reports, most patients had an acute presentation (78 percent), and CM, soy, oat, rice, potato, and HE were common triggers. The mean age of diagnosis was 6.8 months [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15042632"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>FPIES is triggered by non-IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity. However, the exact underlying mechanisms of FPIES are not clearly understood. It is postulated that ingestion of food allergens causes local inflammation mediated by T cells, leading to increased intestinal permeability and fluid shift [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>]. However, baseline intestinal absorption was normal in a group of infants with FPIES confirmed by oral food challenge (OFC) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, and decreased expression of transforming growth factor (TGF) beta receptors in the intestinal mucosa may be involved in the intestinal inflammation [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>Systemic food-specific IgE antibodies (determined by serum food-specific IgE and/or skin prick test) are not detected in the majority of patients with FPIES. However, up to 25 percent of children have evidence of specific IgE to the FPIES-inducing food [<a href="#rid21">21-24</a>]. Intestinal mucosal IgE may facilitate the antigen uptake and local intestinal inflammation [<a href="#rid25">25</a>], but this requires further study. A decrease in serum food-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody and an increase in serum food-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels were noted in one study [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. A subsequent study found that both casein-specific IgG4 and IgA antibodies were significantly decreased in cow's milk (CM) FPIES [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p>Profiling of whole blood by mass cytometry demonstrated activation of cells of the innate immune system (monocytes, neutrophils, natural killer cells, and eosinophils) in addition to T lymphocytes after food challenge in children with FPIES [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. This activation was not observed in children who had outgrown FPIES. Innate immune activation was confirmed by ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing in a larger cohort. Proteomic analysis of peripheral blood showed elevated interleukin (IL) 17a, IL-17c, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL) 20, in addition to regenerating family member 1 alpha (REG1A), which regulates intestinal mucosal barrier downstream of IL-22. Cellular sources of IL-17 were identified as CD4+ T helper type 17 (Th17) cells; however, mass cytometry indicated preferential activation of nonconventional T cell populations, including gamma-delta T cells and CD3+CD4-CD8-CD161+ cells [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p>Untargeted serum metabolomics identified 34 metabolites that were significantly increased following a symptomatic food challenge, in particular, steroids in the corticosteroid and androgen (pregnenolone and progestin) families, inosine, and metabolite of serotonin (5-hydroxylindoleacetate) [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Adenosine, inosine, and urate are a part of the purine pathway initiated by adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Adenosine in the extracellular space binds P1 purinergic receptors that exert antiinflammatory effects through the generation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and suppresses immune cell functions and proliferation in monocytes and T cells. Inosine was significantly and positively correlated with REG1A, a regulator of mucosal barrier function that was previously reported to be upregulated after an oral food challenge (OFC).</p><p>In a small study, plasma metabolic profiles were different among patients with cow's milk allergy (CMA), with significantly lower concentrations of various fatty acids and higher concentrations of primary metabolites such as amino acids in CM FPIES compared with IgE-mediated CMA [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15042640"><span class="h2">Food triggers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although CM and soy protein have traditionally been reported as the most common triggers in young infants, more studies now indicate that solid foods, such as rice, oat, hen's egg (HE), and fish, are also triggers.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15042910"><span class="h3">Milk and soy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common food triggers in FPIES are CM and soy (classic FPIES), with reactions occurring to infant formula during the first months of life. While several studies have shown that over 50 percent of infants with FPIES react to both foods [<a href="#rid22">22,32</a>], none of the 44 infants diagnosed with CM FPIES in a birth cohort study in Israel showed sensitivity to soy [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. This difference could be attributed to a milder phenotype reported from a nonselected birth cohort compared with a more severe phenotype reported from allergy and gastroenterology referral populations. Alternatively, this could be attributed to different patterns of soy formula use in infancy. Globally, CM remains the single most common FPIES trigger [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p>CM FPIES in exclusively breastfed infants is rare, suggesting a protective role of breastfeeding that may be attributed to predigested and partially processed food allergens as well as presence of TGF-beta and IgA in mother's milk [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Only a few cases of exclusively breastfed infants with CM FPIES have been reported in the literature [<a href="#rid34">34-36</a>], and there are no reports in the literature of soy FPIES in exclusively breastfed infants.</p><p>FPIES to goat's milk was reported in an Italian series [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15042648"><span class="h3">Solid foods</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>FPIES may be induced by solid food, including grains (rice, oats, barley, corn, wheat); meat and poultry (beef, chicken, turkey); HE (egg white and egg yolk); vegetables and fruit (white potato, sweet potato, squash, string beans, avocado, mushroom, banana, apple, tomato); legumes (peanut, green peas, lentils); tree nuts; seafood (fish, crustaceans, molluscs); seeds (sesame); and the probiotic <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9481" href="/d/drug information/9481.html" rel="external">Saccharomyces boulardii</a> [<a href="#rid8">8,12,13,18,21,37-50</a>]<em>.</em> Among infants with solid-food FPIES in one series, 80 percent reacted to more than one food, 65 percent were previously diagnosed with CM and/or soy FPIES, and 35 percent were breastfed [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Infants with early-onset FPIES and reactions to fruits or vegetables are at higher risk for reacting to multiple food triggers [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1180236300"><span class="h4">Cereal grains</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Rice and oat are the most common solid foods inducing FPIES [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. In one case series, rice was responsible for 46 percent of FPIES episodes requiring hospitalization [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. Children with rice-induced FPIES were more likely to have multiple food sensitivities and severe symptoms requiring intravenous fluid resuscitation compared with children with CM- or soy-induced FPIES.</p><p>Those with a history of FPIES to one grain have an approximately 40 to 50 percent chance of developing FPIES to other grains. However, wheat FPIES has not been reported in infants with oat or rice FPIES [<a href="#rid7">7,13</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2519575531"><span class="h4">Egg</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HE is among the common triggers of FPIES. The reported frequency of infantile HE FPIES is approximately 11 percent in Australia and the US and up to 36 percent in Turkey [<a href="#rid24">24,52,53</a>]. In an Italian multicenter study, among 61 children with HE FPIES, 47 (77 percent) tolerated cooked HE at the mean age 30.2 (range: 7 to 120) months; of them, 32 (68.1 percent) tolerated raw HE at a food challenge done at a mean age 43.9 (range: 18 to 120) months [<a href="#rid54">54</a>]. In Japan, a marked increase in HE FPIES incidence was observed over the five-year period from 2014 to 2019, coinciding with changes in infant feeding practices resulting in earlier introduction of HE into infants' diet [<a href="#rid55">55</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4253285725"><span class="h4">Seafood</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In Spain, Italy, and Greece, fish are the most common solid food triggers in infantile acute FPIES, likely reflecting the local dietary patterns. Fish FPIES in infants and young children has less favorable prognosis than other foods. In a single-center study in Spain, only 3 of 16 patients (18.7 percent) became tolerant by mean age 4.5 years [<a href="#rid49">49</a>].</p><p>In older children and adults, fish and shellfish are the most common triggers of FPIES. In adults with seafood FPIES, overall 60 percent react to a single food group. Fifty percent with fish FPIES react to a shellfish (crustacean or mollusk), 40 percent with crustacean FPIES react to a mollusk, and 55 percent with mollusk FPIES react to crustacean and/or fish [<a href="#rid56">56</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1198040689"><span class="h4">Peanut</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Peanut was an uncommon trigger for acute FPIES, generally representing less than 2 percent of cases in large series. However, more recent reports have highlighted the possibility of increasing incidence of infantile peanut FPIES [<a href="#rid57">57,58</a>]. One retrospective, single-center study identified 14 cases of peanut FPIES from 2017 to 2019 compared with no cases in the same institution between 2001 and 2011 [<a href="#rid58">58</a>]. Possible association with early introduction remains speculative in the absence of a comparison group without early introduction, requiring a prospective or case-control study. Pediatricians and allergy specialists should consider acute FPIES in the differential diagnosis of adverse reactions to peanut in infancy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3161410827"><span class="h4">Multiple-food FPIES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The reported proportion of patients with<strong> </strong>single- versus multiple-food FPIES varies widely, between 40 to 80 percent depending upon the study population and methodology. In general, higher rates of multiple-food FPIES are reported from studies based upon the surveys among caregivers compared with studies based upon data from allergy practices. In a small subset of infants and children, three or more triggers were documented in 9 to 18 percent [<a href="#rid23">23,59</a>]. Compared with FPIES due to two or fewer triggers, patients with multiple triggers were more likely to develop food aversion (43.2 versus 16.9 percent) and to have poor weight gain (21.6 versus 6.6 percent). The patients with multiple triggers frequently reacted to HE, soy, grains (oat, rice, wheat, and barley), vegetable (sweet potato, legume), fruits (avocado, banana), and turkey but were less likely to have shellfish-related FPIES.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15042663"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical features of FPIES are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87555" href="/d/graphic/87555.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid10">10,12,23,37,60,61</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15042671"><span class="h2">Age of onset</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Symptoms of classic FPIES usually begin in early infancy, within one to four weeks following introduction of cow's milk (CM) or soy protein. In extreme cases, symptoms may begin within the first days of life. The first description of the disorder included nine infants who presented with severe vomiting and diarrhea, developing an average of 11 days after birth (range 4 to 27 days) [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. In the Israeli birth cohort previously discussed, all 44 infants with CM FPIES presented with symptoms within the first six months of life [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Delayed introduction of CM or soy in breastfed infants may result in later onset.</p><p>The mean age at onset of solid-food FPIES tends to be later than that of CM and soy FPIES, typically presenting when these foods are first introduced between the ages of four to seven months [<a href="#rid12">12,62</a>]. The development of FPIES upon introduction of foods after one year of age is rare, although onset of a non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food hypersensitivity similar to FPIES, most commonly triggered by shellfish, fish, and/or hen's egg (HE), has been observed in older children and adults [<a href="#rid23">23,62-64</a>]. (See <a class="local">'FPIES in adults'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15042686"><span class="h2">Chronic versus acute presentation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The disease typically presents in two phases [<a href="#rid10">10,12,60,61,65</a>]. The initial presentation of CM- or soy-induced FPIES in infancy is that of a chronic disease while the food antigen is ingested on a regular basis. This can be followed by an acute phase if the antigen is removed from the diet and subsequently reingested, with symptoms occurring approximately two hours after ingestion and lasting several hours. An acute presentation is also seen when the antigen is ingested intermittently. Young infants with FPIES due to CM- and/or soy-based formulas usually have a chronic presentation, whereas solid-food FPIES can have an acute or chronic presentation depending upon the frequency of ingestion of the offending food. In a retrospective review of 203 patients with FPIES, 180 had reported acute, 8 chronic, and 15 both acute and chronic FPIES. Oat (34.5 percent), rice (29.6 percent), and CM (19.2 percent) were the most common food triggers in acute FPIES, whereas, in chronic FPIES, 87 percent of cases were caused by CM and 21 percent by soy. The median age of onset of acute FPIES was older, 6.0 (interquartile range [IQR]: 5.0 to 7.0) months compared with the median age of onset of chronic FPIES of 0.4 (IQR: 0.0 to 1.7) months [<a href="#rid59">59</a>].</p><p>The following clinical vignette describes features of chronic and acute FPIES.</p><p>A full-term female infant who was initially exclusively breastfed was started on CM-based formula supplementation at four weeks of age.

Approximately 90 minutes after that feeding, she developed repetitive vomiting and became lethargic (acute FPIES episode). A full sepsis work-up, toxicology, and metabolic screening were done in the emergency department (ED). She received intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotics and was observed in the hospital for three days. Blood-tinged diarrhea was noted only the first hospital day. She tolerated an extensively hydrolyzed casein formula and was discharged after three days when cultures were negative.</p><p>She avoided CM strictly and tolerated several solid foods introduced from five to seven months of age without symptoms, until an infant jar food containing cheese was given. Similar to the previous episode, she developed repetitive vomiting and lethargy 90 minutes after ingestion and required intravenous fluid resuscitation (acute FPIES episode).</p><p>Nearly all patients present with vomiting, which is projectile, repetitive in the acute presentation, and intermittent in the chronic setting, and are commonly pale and ill appearing [<a href="#rid9">9,10,12,23,37,60,61</a>].

Other symptoms that can occur in both the chronic and acute presentations include diarrhea, abdominal distention, dehydration, pallor, and lethargy. In acute FPIES, repetitive emesis usually begins within 1 to 4 hours and diarrhea within 2 to 10 hours (mean onset 5 hours) of ingestion [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. Patients with acute presentations tend to be sicker and may develop pallor, hypotonia, hypotension/shock, and/or hypothermia; however, these symptoms resolve within hours of feeding.

There was a positive correlation among caregiver HRQoL, stress, worry, and anxiety, and these correlated negatively with food allergy self-efficacy. Avoiding a greater number of food groups was associated with lower caregiver HRQoL, lower food allergy self-efficacy, and higher total anxiety among preschoolers and elementary school-aged children.

Our diagnostic approach is consistent with international consensus guidelines on diagnosis and management of FPIES published in 2017 [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. There are no laboratory and radiographic findings specific to FPIES. However, obtaining a complete blood count with differential during an acute presentation may be useful in that an elevated white blood cell count with a left shift is suggestive of FPIES or sepsis. In addition, an elevated methemoglobin level in a child that appears ashen, gray, or cyanotic and very ill also suggests the diagnosis of FPIES. (See <a class="local">'Blood tests'</a> above and <a class="local">'Infections'</a> below and <a class="local">'Congenital methemoglobinemia'</a> below.)</p><p>Endoscopy and biopsy are not routinely performed but may be indicated to rule out other pathology of the gastrointestinal tract in cases where symptoms are unusually severe and do not resolve with bowel rest or amino acid-based formula.

Similarly, adults also report experiencing multiple reactions prior to diagnosis [<a href="#rid56">56,68</a>]. Nonspecific symptoms and lack of definitive diagnostic tests can contribute to the delay in diagnosis. Delayed diagnosis of solid-food FPIES may also be due to the perception that rice, oats, and vegetables have low allergenic potential and are not usually suspected as triggers of allergic reactions.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15042753"><span class="h2">Oral food challenge</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>OFC is the gold standard for diagnosis of FPIES.

Clinician-supervised OFCs are necessary, however, if the history is unclear and a specific food trigger has not been identified, if the time course symptoms are atypical (eg, severe emesis within minutes of food ingestion in the absence of food-specific IgE), or if the child has persistent symptoms on an allergen-restricted diet, with the goal in this case of identifying the relevant food(s) and avoiding unnecessary food restrictions.</p><p>An OFC for FPIES is generally considered a high-risk procedure. In a patient with prior severe FPIES reactions, an OFC should be conducted in a setting where intravenous access can be secured, rapid fluid resuscitation given if a reaction occurs, and prolonged observation can occur if necessary. An inpatient setting is the most appropriate for FPIES OFCs, but outpatient settings equipped with resuscitation capabilities and with access to a laboratory (for neutrophil counts) can be used. Performing FPIES OFCs in an intensive care unit is unnecessary unless the patient has a history of near fatality with an episode [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].

In the rare case of FPIES in the nursing infant, the mother should completely eliminate the triggering food(s) from her diet.

The concern is that baking does not alter sequential epitopes that would continue to be recognized by T cells, presumed to be the effector cells of allergic inflammation in FPIES.
