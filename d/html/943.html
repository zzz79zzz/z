         Tachyarrhythmias, defined as abnormal heart rhythms with a ventricular rate of 100 or more beats per minute (bpm), can result from a variety of pathologies and are frequently symptomatic. Signs and symptoms related to the tachyarrhythmia most commonly include palpitations or chest discomfort, but may also include shock, hypotension, heart failure (HF), shortness of breath, and/or decreased level of consciousness. Symptoms can sometimes be more subtle and may include fatigue, lightheadedness, or exercise intolerance. Some patients are truly asymptomatic; this may be more common in nonparoxysmal (incessant) tachycardias.

         This topic will provide a broad overview of the different causes of narrow QRS complex tachycardia and an approach to their evaluation and diagnosis. An overview of the acute management of tachyarrhythmias, along with detailed discussions of specific narrow complex tachycardias (eg, atrioventricular [AV] nodal reentrant tachycardia [AVNRT], AV reentrant (or reciprocating) tachycardia [AVRT], and atrial tachycardia [AT]) and a broad discussion of wide complex tachycardias, are presented separately.

         Tachycardias, with a ventricular heart rate exceeding 100 bpm, are broadly categorized based upon the width of the QRS complex on the electrocardiogram (ECG) [

         A narrow QRS complex (&lt;120 ms) reflects rapid activation of the ventricles via the normal His-Purkinje system, which in turn suggests that the arrhythmia originates above or within the His bundle (ie, a supraventricular tachycardia). The mechanism of tachycardia may be in the sinus node, the atria, the AV node, the His bundle, or some combination of these sites.

         A widened QRS (≥120 ms) occurs when ventricular activation is abnormally slow. The most common reason that a QRS is widened is because the arrhythmia originates below the His bundle in the bundle branches, Purkinje fibers, or ventricular myocardium (eg, ventricular tachycardia). Alternatively, a supraventricular arrhythmia can produce a widened QRS if there are either preexisting or rate-related abnormalities within the His-Purkinje system (eg, supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy), or if conduction occurs over an accessory pathway. Thus, wide QRS complex tachycardias may be either supraventricular or ventricular in origin. (See

         The term "paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT)" defines a subset of narrow QRS complex tachycardias that are intermittent, start and stop abruptly, and have a regular ventricular response. This term is usually reserved for tachycardias that are sustained (&gt;30 seconds). The term "incessant SVT" is used to describe an SVT that is unlikely to spontaneously terminate. AF, atrial flutter, and MAT have an irregular ventricular response and distinct clinical characteristics; these rhythms are not considered PSVTs and are described elsewhere. (See

          Features of paroxysmal SVTs
         </strong>
         – The prevalence of PSVT is similar in males and females (although it is slightly higher in males) and increases progressively with age. Among a prospective cohort of more than half a million United Kingdom residents, the prevalence of PSVT was approximately 29 per 10,000 persons under age 55 and increased to between 53 (females) and 74 (males) per 10,000 persons ≥65 years of age [

         PSVTs are often due to reentry, although the mechanisms of reentry vary  (

         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. Junctional ectopic tachycardia and nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia are rare in adults but can represent a larger portion of PSVTs in children. Brief runs of PSVT captured on Holter monitoring or other recording devices are usually due to AT.

         AVNRT is characterized by two pathways within the AV node or perinodal atrial tissue. (See

         AVRT is characterized by an extranodal accessory pathway connecting the atrium and ventricle. The ECG shows delta waves during sinus rhythm if there is antegrade conduction via the accessory pathway, leading to a diagnosis of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW). The delta waves are lost during an episode of orthodromic AVRT, the most common tachyarrhythmia in patients with WPW. Most patients with AVRT, however, have a concealed accessory pathway and do not have ventricular preexcitation during sinus rhythm. (See

         AT is the least common form of PSVT in patients with sustained PSVT. Most ATs in patients without prior surgery or ablation are due to a focal mechanism and can arise from anywhere in the atria, such as the crista terminalis, left atrial appendage, or near the tricuspid or mitral annulus, or can arise from a large vein such as the coronary sinus or a pulmonary vein. ATs in patients with atrial scar can be due to macroreentry. The reentrant circuit does not involve the AV node or an accessory pathway. AT can be paroxysmal or, at times, incessant. AT with 1:1 (or fixed 2:1, 3:1, etc) conduction into the ventricles is a regular tachycardia, but if there is variable conduction, the tachycardia can be irregular. (See

         Permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia (PJRT) is a syndrome of nearly incessant, relatively slow PSVT in a patient who can, at times, present with a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy and HF. The SVT mechanism in most patients with PJRT is AVRT due to a slowly conducting concealed accessory pathway, and the term PJRT is often used interchangeably with incessant, slow AVRT. However, a patient with PJRT can also have nearly incessant atypical AVNRT or AT. (See

         Reviewed briefly, reentry requires two distinct electrical conduction pathways or tissues with different electrophysiologic properties that are linked proximally and distally, forming an anatomic or functional circuit  (

         <a href="#rid1">
          1,4
         </a>
         ]. The reentrant circuit may become repetitively activated, producing a sustained reentrant tachycardia. The type of arrhythmia that ensues with narrow QRS tachycardias is determined by the characteristics and location of the reentrant circuit  (

         The response to a rapid heart rate can be quite variable depending on how fast the heart is beating, resultant blood pressure and tissue perfusion, underlying comorbidities, and the sensitivity of the individual patient to the symptoms. Patients with a narrow QRS complex tachycardia can present with a variety of symptoms, including:

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Most commonly, patients with a narrow QRS complex tachycardia present with palpitations, the sensation of a rapid or irregular heart beat felt in the anterior chest or neck. Usually the symptoms are abrupt in onset, although this may vary depending on the specific arrhythmia. Palpitations may be associated with diaphoresis, lightheadedness, or dizziness.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with a narrow QRS complex tachycardia may also report shortness of breath or chest discomfort. While shortness of breath or chest discomfort can occur in any patient, those with underlying cardiac comorbidities (eg, coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy or valvular heart disease with or without HF) are more likely to present in this fashion, particularly at higher heart rates (&gt;150 bpm).
        </p>
        <p>
         Syncope is a rare presentation for persons presenting with a narrow QRS complex tachycardia, since in most instances the heart rate is not so rapid as to impair ventricular function and cardiac output. However, a narrow QRS complex tachycardia with a very rapid ventricular rate (&gt;250 bpm, as might be seen in persons with AF or atrial flutter and an accessory pathway) may result in diminished cardiac output and syncope. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Atrial rate'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The physical examination in a patient with narrow QRS complex tachycardia reveals a rapid pulse which may be regular or irregular depending on the underlying cardiac rhythm. Cardiac auscultation also reveals a rapid heartbeat. While other physical examination findings may be present in situations where the tachycardia has led to or exacerbated another condition (eg, hypotension following syncope, lung congestion in a patient with HF), there are no other specific physical examination findings which are universally seen in patients with a narrow complex tachycardia.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The diagnosis of a narrow QRS complex tachycardia is usually suspected in a patient with palpitations when a pulse greater than 100 bpm is present on physical examination. The differentiation between narrow and wide QRS complex tachycardia requires only a surface ECG, which shows a heart rate greater than 100 bpm along with narrow QRS complexes that are less than 120 ms in duration. A variety of arrhythmias result in the ECG appearance of a narrow QRS complex tachycardia. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Types of narrow QRS complex tachycardia'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Once a narrow QRS complex tachycardia has been identified, further scrutiny of the ECG is required to identify the specific arrhythmia in a particular patient, as diagnostic evaluation and therapy will differ depending on the underlying arrhythmia. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Evaluation'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Invasive electrophysiology testing is not required to broadly make the diagnosis of a narrow QRS complex tachycardia, but on rare occasions it is needed to diagnose (and potentially treat with catheter ablation) the specific arrhythmia. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Electrophysiologic testing'

         The most important clinical determination to make when a narrow QRS tachycardia is noted is whether the patient is experiencing signs and symptoms related to the rapid heart rate. These can include hypotension, shortness of breath, chest pain suggestive of coronary ischemia, shock, and/or decreased level of consciousness  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109811" href="/z/d/graphic/109811.html" rel="external">

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Determining whether a patient's symptoms are related to the tachycardia depends upon several factors, including age and the presence of underlying cardiac disease. As an example, PSVT with a heart rate of 200 bpm may be tolerated by an otherwise healthy young adult with no or few symptoms (eg, palpitations). On the other hand, AF at a rate of 120 bpm may precipitate angina in an older adult patient with significant coronary heart disease.

         ), management should be focused on the underlying cardiac disorder and on treating any contributing cause of the rapid heart rate (such as coronary ischemia, respiratory or cardiac failure, cardiac tamponade, hypovolemia, anemia, fever, pain, or anxiety). In patients with ST and certain forms of heart disease, such as coronary disease or aortic stenosis, treatment may need to be directed at the heart rate itself. In such cases, cautious use of an intravenous beta blocker is appropriate (eg,

         Following the determination of hemodynamic stability, the next step in the assessment of a narrow QRS complex tachycardia is to determine if the rhythm appears to be regular or irregular  (

         In ideal circumstances, P waves can be easily seen on the surface ECG. However, due to the rapid rate of the tachycardia, P waves are often superimposed on other parts of the surface ECG. In cases where P waves cannot be clearly identified, the Valsalva maneuver, carotid sinus massage, or the administration of intravenous

         The Valsalva maneuver induces a temporary slowing of SA nodal activity and AV nodal conduction by stimulating baroreceptors in the aorta, which triggers a reflex increase in vagus nerve activity and sympathetic withdrawal. Patients must be cooperative enough to comply with instructions and must be continually monitored on a cardiac monitor in order for this maneuver to be successful. The process of performing and interpreting the hemodynamic responses to the Valsalva maneuver is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         The Valsalva maneuver is generally safe and well-tolerated, though it does require some effort on the patient's part to perform. While the Valsalva maneuver may not be as effective as

         in slowing the AV nodal conduction rate, it can often be accomplished while preparing for an adenosine challenge, especially in patients not eligible for carotid sinus massage. Additionally, the Valsalva maneuver may terminate some narrow complex tachycardias, although data regarding the effectiveness of the maneuver are inconclusive. In a 2013 Cochrane Review of three randomized trials (316 patients) that compared the Valsalva maneuver with other vagal maneuvers, there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of the Valsalva maneuver [

         Carotid sinus massage induces a temporary slowing of SA nodal activity and AV nodal conduction. External pressure on the carotid bulb stimulates baroreceptors in the carotid sinus, which triggers a reflex increase in vagus nerve activity and sympathetic withdrawal. The process of performing carotid sinus massage is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         is used for the intravenous management of paroxysmal narrow QRS complex tachycardias in which the AV node is involved. However, like the Valsalva maneuver and carotid sinus massage, adenosine can have both diagnostic and therapeutic effects, terminating some AV node dependent arrhythmias and producing transient AV nodal block that can clarify diagnoses such as atrial flutter or AT. Adenosine is cleared from the circulation extremely rapidly, with a half-life of less than five seconds, which reduces the likelihood of serious untoward effects [

         The most reliable way to determine if the P wave in a narrow complex tachycardia is consistent with an origin from the sinus node is to compare the P wave during the tachycardia to that from the same patient during sinus rhythm. Although sinus P wave morphology can vary slightly with changes in heart rates, the P wave during the tachycardia should be nearly identical to that seen on the baseline ECG in all 12 leads.
        </p>
        <p>
         If a baseline ECG is not available, characteristics of the P wave can still suggest origin from the region of the sinus node. A sinus P wave is usually upright in leads I, aVL, and the inferior leads II, III, and aVF, and negative in lead aVR. These features indicate that atrial activity is proceeding in a right-to-left and superior-to-inferior direction. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         At atrial rates greater than approximately 140 bpm or in the presence of first degree AV block, the P wave tends to merge into the preceding T or U wave, making P wave identification difficult  (

         The most common retrograde P wave morphology is associated with atrial activation that originates from the AV node and proceeds in an inferior-to-superior direction. Thus, the defining trait of a retrograde P wave is that it is negative in the inferior leads II, III, and aVF. Due to the central location of the AV node, atrial activation proceeds simultaneously leftward and rightward, so the P wave morphology in leads I, aVL, and aVR varies among patients, but it is often relatively narrow. In addition, because the AV node is posteriorly located, the activation is usually posterior-to-anterior, producing a narrow but positive P wave in lead V1.
        </p>
        <p>
         Retrograde P waves due to conduction via an accessory pathway can have a variety of morphologies, depending upon the site of the pathway. However, they are still usually negative in the inferior leads. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Because retrograde P waves are often associated with a short RP interval, they can blend with the terminal portion of the QRS. If a baseline ECG during sinus rhythm is available for comparison, a pseudo S wave in the inferior leads or a pseudo R' in V1 that is not present during sinus rhythm is often a retrograde P wave  (

         In patients with a retrograde P wave, the temporal relationship between the P wave and the R wave divides narrow complex tachycardias into two categories: short RP and long RP tachycardias. The RP interval is defined as the interval from the onset of the QRS to the onset of the P wave. Short RP tachycardias tend to be paroxysmal, while long RP tachycardias can be paroxysmal or incessant.

          14
         </a>
         ], reentry occurs in the AV node and perinodal tissues. Antegrade conduction occurs down the slow pathway and retrograde conduction up the fast pathway  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79760" href="/z/d/graphic/79760.html" rel="external">

         ). This slow-fast pattern gives rise to retrograde P waves that may be inapparent if obscured by the QRS complex  (

        <p>
         AVRT utilizing an accessory pathway can be either orthodromic or antidromic. Orthodromic AVRT is more common, and in this form of the arrhythmia, antegrade conduction occurs through the AV node, producing a narrow QRS complex, and retrograde conduction to the atrium occurs over an AV bypass tract  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71302" href="/z/d/graphic/71302.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In contrast, during antidromic AVRT, antegrade conduction occurs through the AV bypass tract and retrograde conduction occurs through the AV node or a second accessory pathway. This pattern of activation results in a wide QRS complex (thus, antidromic AVRT is not a narrow QRS complex tachycardia). (See

         Retrograde P waves – The combination of retrograde P waves and a long RP interval is usually caused by either "atypical" AVNRT or by AVRT with a slowly conducting accessory pathway (also known as permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia [PJRT]); this combination can also be seen in AT with a focus that is close to the AV node [

         Abnormal P wave morphology – The combination of abnormal P wave morphology and a long RP interval usually suggests some form of AT. However, this pattern can also occur in the atypical or uncommon form of AVNRT and in AVRT with a slowly conducting accessory pathway [

         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ], is characterized by antegrade conduction down a fast pathway and retrograde conduction through a slow pathway. As a result, the P wave occurs very late in the cardiac cycle (positioning it near to the next QRS complex)  (

         ]. Other possible rhythms are AF, AVRT, and junctional tachycardia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although AF is typically an irregularly irregular rhythm, when the ventricular rate is very rapid, it may appear to be more regular. Vagal maneuvers produce a transient decrease in the ventricular rate with AF, which may make the irregularity more evident.
        </p>
        <p>
         Junctional tachycardia is an arrhythmia arising from a discrete focus within the AV node or His bundle. In children, junctional tachycardia, also known as junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET), is usually associated with significant underlying heart disease. In adults, this rhythm, generally called nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia (NPJT), is seen with acute myocardial infarction, digitalis toxicity, and myocarditis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/82.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Atrial activity during junctional tachycardia is variable. Retrograde atrial activation may occur, with a P wave that either follows each QRS complex or is concealed in the QRS complex. If retrograde conduction does not occur, independent atrial activity may be seen, with complete AV dissociation that must be distinguished from AV dissociation due to complete heart block (in complete heart block, the atrial rate exceeds the ventricular rate).

         In some cases, narrow QRS complex tachycardias cannot be discriminated from each other using noninvasive testing. An electrophysiologic study (EPS) can provide a definitive diagnosis but is only used when a definitive diagnosis will influence therapy. [

         </strong>
         – Tachycardias, defined as abnormal heart rhythms with a ventricular rate of 100 or more beats per minute (bpm), can present with either a narrow or wide QRS complex. A narrow QRS complex (&lt;120 ms) reflects rapid activation of the ventricles via the normal His-Purkinje system, which in turn suggests that the arrhythmia originates above or within the His bundle (ie, a supraventricular tachycardia). The site of origin may be in the sinus node, the atria, the atrioventricular (AV) node, the His bundle, or some combination of these sites. (See

         <strong>
          Clinical manifestations
         </strong>
         – Most commonly, patients with a narrow QRS complex tachycardia present with palpitations, usually abrupt in onset. Other presenting symptoms may include syncope or presyncope, lightheadedness, dizziness, diaphoresis, chest pain, or shortness of breath. (See

          Diagnosis

         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         The diagnosis of a narrow QRS complex tachycardia requires only a surface ECG that shows a heart rate greater than 100 bpm along with narrow QRS complexes that are less than 120 ms in duration. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis'

          Types of narrow QRS complex tachycardia

         – The differential diagnosis of narrow QRS complex tachycardias is broad  (

          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – Evaluation of a patient with a narrow QRS complex tachycardia involves two primary components: assessment of the patient for symptoms and signs of hemodynamic stability (or instability), and assessment of the patient's ECG for clues to the type of tachycardia present. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Unstable patients
         </strong>
         – If a patient has clinically significant hemodynamic instability and the rhythm is not ST, or if there is any doubt that the rhythm is sinus tachycardia,
         <strong>
          urgent conversion
         </strong>
         to sinus rhythm is recommended  (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         If it is certain that the patient's rhythm is ST, and clinically significant cardiac symptoms are present, management should be focused on the underlying cardiac disorder and on treating any contributing cause of the rapid heart rate (such as myocardial ischemia due to coronary heart disease, respiratory or cardiac failure, hypovolemia, anemia, fever, pain, or anxiety).

         – In some cases, narrow QRS complex tachycardias cannot be discriminated from each other using noninvasive testing. An electrophysiologic study (EPS) can provide a definitive diagnosis but is only used when a definitive diagnosis will influence therapy. (See
