For such people, birth center care can result in greater satisfaction, cost savings, and the same or better outcomes as an in-hospital birth [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In the United States, nearly 22,000 of the approximately 3.6 million births (0.61 percent) in 2020 occurred at a freestanding birth center [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>This topic will provide a description of the birth center model of care and its outcomes. Planned home birth, which is an alternative type of out-of-hospital birth, is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4454.html" rel="external">"Planned home birth"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">THE BIRTH CENTER MODEL</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Definition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A birth center is a medical facility that provides a labor and childbirth experience in a family friendly, homelike environment for healthy, low-risk pregnant people. The facility may be freestanding or part of a hospital, such as a specific floor or set of rooms that are separate from the acute care obstetric unit. Freestanding birth centers provide antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum care, while those that are part of a hospital generally provide intrapartum, immediate postpartum, and neonatal care. Both types of birth centers are oriented toward care practices that support physiologic labor and birth.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H627519428"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As the location for childbirth moved from the home to the hospital in the United States in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the medical model of obstetric care was established. Medicalization of a normal physiologic process was due, in part, to the observation that outcomes of high-risk mothers and babies were improved by specialist care in hospitals. However, over time, increasing use of technological interventions without clear benefits led to a consumer-driven natural childbirth education movement that sought individualized, client-centered care in support of normal, physiologic birth. Although hospitals tried to respond to this consumer demand by relaxing restrictions on family participation, these changes were difficult to implement in the acute care setting.</p><p>In 1975, the Maternity Center Association, a voluntary health agency in New York City, established a demonstration birth center (The Childbearing Center) in an affluent urban setting [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. It was designed and operated to provide professional nurse-midwifery care in collaboration with obstetric specialists for carefully screened people anticipating a normal pregnancy and birth. If that expectation changed, birth center professionals referred or transferred the individual to the collaborating obstetric specialist and hospital for further evaluation and appropriate care. Childbirth education was an integral part of the program. The success of this pilot project prompted expansion of the birth center model of care. </p><p>The birth center model has steadily increased in popularity worldwide because of consumer demand and national and international efforts to improve maternal health. In recent years, physicians and hospitals have also recognized the need to avoid unnecessary interventions in people with low-risk pregnancies and the value of facilitating the physiologic labor process in this population [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. </p><p>In 2020, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) emphasized the need to promote research about the birth center model of care, in part to increase awareness about this type of birth setting among consumers and to support informed decision-making about place of birth [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Candidates for birth at a birth center</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>People with low-risk pregnancies are candidates for birth center care. There is no precise definition of low risk, but these individuals are generally healthy with a term singleton pregnancy in vertex presentation, and no medical or obstetric conditions that increase the risk for serious intrapartum, postpartum, or neonatal complications as defined by reasonable and generally accepted criteria. </p><p>Birth center care providers and the physicians who collaborate with them develop mutually agreed upon risk criteria for screening candidates for delivery at their birth center and excluding those perceived to be at increased risk. The screening process begins when a pregnant person enrolls in prenatal care to make sure that they are an appropriate candidate. Rescreening occurs at every prenatal visit, at the onset of labor (pre-admit screen), and continues throughout the intrapartum, postpartum, and neonatal course. </p><p>Initially low-risk people who go on to develop antepartum, intrapartum, or postpartum complications (eg, preeclampsia, noncephalic presentation, preterm or postterm labor, chorioamnionitis) are required to receive obstetric care and give birth in the acute obstetric care unit of the hospital, where their care is often managed collaboratively by a midwife and obstetric team.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1687098516"><span class="h3">Individuals with high body mass index or previous cesarean birth</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>High body mass index (BMI) and previous cesarean birth are two common issues in decision-making regarding birth site:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>While pregnant people with prepregnancy BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (ie, obese range) historically have been considered inappropriate for birth center care, an analysis of birth outcomes at freestanding birth centers reported no significant differences in complications between people with BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and no medical comorbidities compared with those with BMIs 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (ie, normal range) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. People with BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> had higher rates of nonemergency intrapartum transfers (30.3 versus 19.9 percent) and primary cesarean birth (11.1 versus 5.8 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Some birth centers, particularly those that are part of a hospital, allow a trial of labor after a previous cesarean birth with certain criteria, including no more than one previous cesarean, documented low transverse uterine incision, no history of incision extension or postoperative infection, history of a previous vaginal birth and/or previous vaginal birth after a cesarean birth, and third-trimester ultrasound excluding a placental attachment abnormality [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H202070412"><span class="h2">Informed consent</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Birth center clinicians provide thorough information with extensive discussion of prenatal and intrapartum care choices. This discussion should include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Specific pregnancy complications that would require an antepartum referral to the care of a collaborating physician.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Specific intrapartum, postpartum, and newborn complications that would require transfer of the mother and/or neonate to a hospital.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The concept that unforeseen events can occur during any childbirth and how they might be handled at the birth center as compared with a hospital.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The approximate time it may take to transfer the client to a hospital in emergency situations. Birth centers conduct regular emergency drills, including drills with area emergency teams, and thus can tell clients how an emergency transfer would proceed. All birth centers know their average emergency and nonemergency transport times and how they vary with the time of day, traffic, and weather/road conditions.</p><p></p><p>After this discussion has been completed, clients are asked to sign a document asserting that they understand the risks and benefits of labor and delivery at a birth center and have chosen to labor and give birth in the birth center. The following form is an example of one such document (<a class="graphic graphic_form graphicRef72798 graphicRef53826 graphicRef65561" href="/d/graphic/72798.html" rel="external">form 1A-C</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The birth center philosophy maintains that, for most people, pregnancy and birth are normal physiologic processes and important psychosocial events within a family. Although hospital-based caregivers may also have this philosophy, birth center providers tend to place greater emphasis on avoiding intervention and providing a relaxed, client- and family-centered atmosphere. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Antepartum</strong> – All of the standard prenatal tests are offered to clients by their birth center providers, as indicated, with discussion of the risks and benefits of each test. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/446.html" rel="external">"Prenatal care: Initial assessment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83303.html" rel="external">"Prenatal care: Second and third trimesters"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Prenatal care provided at a birth center is generally more time and education intensive than traditional prenatal care. In addition to the usual components, providers at a birth center focus on building their clients' confidence in having a normal birth and caring for their newborn.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Arrangements for access to a specialist and in-hospital care for mother and newborn, if needed, are reviewed periodically during antenatal care.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intrapartum</strong> – Intrapartum birth center care is a time-intensive, one-on-one approach. Because birth is considered a normal life event, the atmosphere of birth centers is relaxed, with few routines, and an environment that is more like a home than a hospital. For example, clients control who will be with them during labor and birth and generally have more options than in a hospital. They typically wear their own clothes instead of a hospital gown. They eat, drink, shower/bathe, and walk or change positions freely, whereas these choices may be limited on a traditional labor unit.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">One hallmark of intrapartum care in birth centers, continuous caregiver support, has been shown to be beneficial in randomized trials. These benefits (eg, increase in spontaneous vaginal births and maternal satisfaction, decrease in use of analgesia/anesthesia) are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4438.html" rel="external">"Continuous labor support by a doula", section on 'Evidence of the effectiveness of continuous labor support'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In accordance with a large body of research indicating that intermittent auscultation of the fetal heart rate is appropriate and safe for low-risk pregnancies, birth centers use intermittent auscultation rather than continuous electronic fetal monitoring to monitor fetal status during labor. If a condition in which continuous electronic monitoring is needed occurs, the mother is transferred to a hospital, as they are no longer appropriate for an out-of-hospital birth. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/418.html" rel="external">"Intrapartum fetal heart rate monitoring: Overview"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The primary approach to labor pain is use of nonpharmacologic interventions. Although some birth centers offer opioid analgesics for pain relief, pharmacologic pain relief is rarely needed and used sparingly only after nonpharmacologic methods have been tried. Many birth centers provide <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10086" href="/d/drug information/10086.html" rel="external">nitrous oxide</a> for labor analgesia [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], and immersion in water during labor is almost universally used. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4455.html" rel="external">"Nonpharmacologic approaches to management of labor pain"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9734" href="/d/drug information/9734.html" rel="external">Oxytocin</a> is not used for induction, as typically only clients in spontaneous labor can receive care in the birth center setting. Oxytocin augmentation also is not used, as true protraction and arrest disorders are indications for hospital transfer.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Standard guidelines for universal screening for group B <em>Streptococcus</em> and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis are followed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/438.html" rel="external">"Prevention of early-onset group B streptococcal disease in neonates"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Epidural analgesia is not offered in birth centers because additional medical interventions are sometimes or always needed (eg, intravenous infusion of fluids, continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring, frequent blood pressure monitoring, medication to treat hypotension, urinary bladder catheterization, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9734" href="/d/drug information/9734.html" rel="external">oxytocin</a> augmentation). Desire for an epidural indicates the need for transfer to a hospital.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Cesarean and forceps- or vacuum-assisted vaginal births are not performed in birth centers. Need for any of these procedures indicates the need for transfer to a hospital.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Episiotomies are rarely performed because data demonstrate no benefit from routine use. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4478.html" rel="external">"Approach to episiotomy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If complications that require medical or surgical intervention arise (eg, labor dystocia, chorioamnionitis, abnormal fetal heart rate, preeclampsia, excessive bleeding), care of the client and newborn is transferred to the collaborating clinician, most often an obstetrician (sometimes a family physician) or neonatologist at the collaborating hospital. Many birth center nurse-midwives also practice in the hospital and thus continue to manage their client's care in collaboration with obstetrician colleagues after transfer. Some birth centers transfer clients to care by hospital-based nurse-midwives. Compliance with strict transfer criteria has resulted in good outcomes for these clients, even when intrapartum complications arise [<a href="#rid9">9-11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Postpartum</strong> – Physical contact between the mother and newborn is initiated immediately after birth and maintained throughout the postpartum stay. The newborn is examined on the client's bed to enhance parental-newborn bonding, provide an opportunity to explain newborn behavior, and answer questions. Parents and newborns are rarely separated.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Prophylactic uterotonic drugs are not routinely administered, but many birth centers use at least some components of the active management of the third stage (eg, controlled traction of the umbilical cord, administration of a uterotonic medication before the placenta is delivered) for clients with risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage identified on admission, during labor and delivery, or soon after giving birth. If excessive bleeding occurs, then intramuscular <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9734" href="/d/drug information/9734.html" rel="external">oxytocin</a> and rectal <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9657" href="/d/drug information/9657.html" rel="external">misoprostol</a> are the medications given most commonly. Many birth centers also stock methergine, and some stock <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9203" href="/d/drug information/9203.html" rel="external">carboprost tromethamine</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10011" href="/d/drug information/10011.html" rel="external">tranexamic acid</a>, but if drugs other than oxytocin are needed, transfer to a hospital would be initiated. Intravenous fluids are also available for administration and stabilization during transfer. An increasing number of birth centers have implemented applicable portions of the OB Hemorrhage Toolkit from the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative, including postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) risk assessment, active third-stage management, simulation drills, and debriefing after a PPH event [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4437.html" rel="external">"Management of the third stage of labor: Prophylactic pharmacotherapy to minimize hemorrhage"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The midwife or other professional care provider monitors the condition of the mother and newborn closely during the immediate postpartum and neonatal periods, while also providing appropriate privacy. The minimum length of stay is four hours postpartum, and most clients are discharged by eight hours postpartum if maternal and newborn criteria for discharge are met.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Follow-up postpartum and newborn care may include telephone calls and other electronic communication, home visits, and breastfeeding support, as well as an office visit within the first two weeks. All clients have at least a telephone call and one in-person visit. They are required to have a pediatric care provider in place for ongoing follow-up of the newborn. Some birth centers provide well-baby care using pediatric nurse practitioners or family physicians. Clients who were transferred to a hospital during labor may be provided routine birth center follow-up, according to their preference.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2401250341"><span class="h2">Standards</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3785907707"><span class="h3">American Association of Birth Centers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The American Association of Birth Centers (AABC) first published the Standards for Birth Centers in 1987 [<a href="#rid13">13</a>], and the regularly updated document continues to be the only comprehensive tool for measuring the quality of services provided to childbearing people in United States birth centers. The AABC standards address all aspects of birth center operations, including evidence-based maternity and neonatal care, midwifery-model approach to care, business operations, facility safety, and continuous quality improvement. The AABC standards are used by the Commission for the Accreditation of Birth Centers (CABC) as the foundation for their Indicators of Compliance with Standards for Birth Centers [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2090110829"><span class="h3">Capabilities</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the United States, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists expects birth centers to have the following capabilities [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Capability and equipment to provide low-risk maternal and newborn care.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Availability of medical consultation at all times.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Readiness to initiate emergency procedures (eg, maternal and newborn resuscitation and stabilization) at all times to treat unexpected complications within the center and facilitate transport to an acute care setting when necessary.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clear understanding of the threshold at which transfer of clients to a facility with a higher level of care should occur.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An established agreement with a receiving hospital with policies and procedures for timely transport, including risk identification; determination of conditions necessitating consultation, referral, and transfer; and a reliable, accurate, and comprehensive communication system between participating facilities and transport teams.

In the United States, certified nurse-midwives (CNMs) attended 52 percent of births that occurred in birth centers in 2021, other midwives attended 39 percent, physicians attended 3.6 percent, and others or unspecified individuals attended the remainder [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. At least two professionals with competence in the care of obstetric clients and newborns should attend every birth [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. In addition, both individuals should be current in adult cardiopulmonary resuscitation training equivalent to American Heart Association (AHA) Basic Life Support [<a href="#rid17">17</a>] and neonatal resuscitation [<a href="#rid18">18</a>] endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the AHA.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Licensure and accreditation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The American Public Health Association (APHA) has published official "Guidelines for Licensing and Regulating Birth Centers" [<a href="#rid19">19</a>] and the AABC provides a toolkit addressing birth center regulation best practices [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Both are used by states to write or revise local regulations for licensing birth centers. As of 2023, birth centers were licensed in 41 states and the District of Columbia, either with birth center-specific regulations or licensure as another type of health care facility. Six states did not license or regulate birth centers but allowed them to operate [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].  </p><p>Accreditation is a voluntary process that includes self-evaluation of all the essential elements of the organization and management of birth center quality of care. It is designed as an educational process and is similar to the process used to accredit hospitals and other health care facilities.

Although all people who deliver at birth centers have low-risk pregnancies, they have self-selected this model of pregnancy care; if low-risk people are required to accept this model of care, they may not have similar outcomes. The study population for the AABC Strong Start Initiative was comparable to national childbearing demographics, with sociobehavioral risk factors similar to the national profile and with slightly higher rates of tobacco and drug use, domestic violence, and chronic stress [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. In spite of this risk profile, birth centers demonstrated lower rates of labor induction, low birth weight, preterm birth, and cesarean birth compared with the other Strong Start Initiative models and national rates.</p><p>The birth centers that participated in major studies, such as NBCS I and II, may not be representative of all birth centers operating in the United States. For example, only 53 percent of known birth centers participated in NBCS I, and birth centers providing data for NBCS II represented 32 percent of all United States birth centers. The birth centers participating in these studies may have a high level of organization, adherence to standards, and quality assurance that may not exist in all birth centers. Birth center providers in these studies varied; outcomes by type of attendant (eg, certified nurse-midwife, certified professional midwife, licensed midwife) were not evaluated. In addition, the impact of birth centers operating outside of an infrastructure of licensure, national standards, and an accreditation mechanism may be different from those reported in NBCS I and II. </p><p>In literature reviews, definitions in studies varied (eg, "antepartum" versus "intrapartum" versus "pre-admit intrapartum" transfer), and variations in birth center populations and practices limited generalizability. Furthermore, the data were collected over several decades during which frequencies of some pregnancy outcomes changed: baseline rates of episiotomy decreased in hospital settings, while epidural anesthesia and cesarean rates increased, making between-study comparisons difficult.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14173429"><span class="h1">COST-EFFECTIVENESS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Older studies that have examined the cost of care provided in birth centers compared with hospitals, including costs associated with transfer for a hospital delivery, have consistently found cost savings of 20 to 50 percent [<a href="#rid28">28,39-41</a>]. A major structural reason for this lower cost is that birth centers are paid far less than hospitals for the same services. There are no national standards for contracting and coding for birth centers; payments are often inadequate to cover the costs of providing midwifery care and facility services; newborn facility fees are included in maternal payment instead of being billed separately; and timing of payments is mismatched with the program of time-intensive, relationship-based care provided prenatally in birth centers [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. Process of care and clinical outcomes also impact the cost effectiveness of birth centers and include lower rates of preterm and low birthweight infants, lower rates of cesarean birth, and less use of some procedures, such as epidural analgesia and induction of labor. </p><p>The birth centers in the Strong Start Initiative for Mothers and Newborns had better outcomes at lower cost relative to other Medicaid participants with similar characteristics in the other models of care studied, with costs USD $2010 lower through birth and the following year for each mother-infant pair. Some of this cost savings resulted from fewer infant emergency department visits and hospitalizations [<a href="#rid43">43,44</a>]. In one study reporting these findings, the authors noted the potential for the birth center model to lower maternity care costs and improve outcomes and commented that increasing the use of birth centers would require broadening Medicaid-managed care networks, increasing payments, reducing state licensing barriers, and revising scope of practice regulations that limit how midwives can practice in some states.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H69393192"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/d/html/113525.html" rel="external">"Society guideline links: Labor"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Overview</strong> – A birth center provides a labor and childbirth experience in a family friendly, homelike environment for healthy, low-risk pregnant people. It may be freestanding or alongside a hospital (eg, a specific floor or set of rooms) but separate from the acute care obstetric unit. Freestanding birth centers provide prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care, while alongside birth centers generally provide intrapartum and immediate postpartum and neonatal care. (See <a class="local">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Philosophy</strong> – The birth center philosophy maintains that pregnancy and birth are usually normal and physiologic events and are important psychosocial milestones within a family. The approach to care in birth centers is based on this philosophy and highly individualized. (See <a class="local">'Antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum care'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Staffing</strong> – Birth centers are typically staffed by midwives. Accreditation is not required to operate in all jurisdictions but indicates that a birth center has met a high standard of evidence-based and widely recognized benchmarks for maternity care, neonatal care, business operations, and safety. (See <a class="local">'Standards'</a> above and <a class="local">'Choosing a specific birth center'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Care</strong> – Prenatal care is similar to that for pregnant people planning to give birth in a hospital but is usually more time and education intensive. Continuous caregiver support during labor is a hallmark of birth center intrapartum care. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9734" href="/d/drug information/9734.html" rel="external">Oxytocin</a> is not used for induction or augmentation of labor or routinely in the third stage as prophylaxis against hemorrhage. The primary approach to labor pain is use of nonpharmacologic interventions. The minimum postpartum length of stay is four hours, and most clients are discharged by eight hours. (See <a class="local">'Antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum care'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Candidates for birth at a birth center</strong> – Birth center care providers and the physicians who collaborate with them develop mutually agreed upon risk criteria for screening candidates for delivery at their birth center and excluding those perceived to be at increased risk. (See <a class="local">'Candidates for birth at a birth center'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Candidates for birth center care should have low-risk pregnancies. These individuals are generally healthy with a term singleton pregnancy in vertex presentation, and no medical or obstetric conditions that increase the risk for serious intrapartum, postpartum, or neonatal complications as defined by reasonable and generally accepted criteria. (See <a class="local">'Candidates for birth at a birth center'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Initially low-risk pregnant people who go on to develop antepartum, intrapartum, or postpartum complications (eg, preeclampsia, noncephalic presentation, preterm or postterm labor, chorioamnionitis) are required to transfer their obstetric care and give birth in the hospital, where their care is often managed collaboratively by a midwife and obstetric team. (See <a class="local">'Candidates for birth at a birth center'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Birth outcomes</strong> – The body of evidence from observational studies suggests that maternal and newborn outcomes for individuals planning to deliver at a birth center are equivalent to or better than those giving birth in hospitals or national averages. (See <a class="local">'Pregnancy outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1517815444"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The editorial staff at UpToDate acknowledge Judith P Rooks, CNM, MPH, MSc, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Swartz W, Jackson D, Lang J, et al.
