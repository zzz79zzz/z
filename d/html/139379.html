         Cranial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks occur when a dural tear or defect allows the passage of CSF from the subarachnoid space into the extracranial space. Patients with cranial leakage of CSF may present with clear rhinorrhea or otorrhea, as well as neurologic symptoms such as headaches, tinnitus, or meningitis. By contrast, patients with postural headaches and/or other neurologic symptoms from intracranial hypotension typically have a spinal source of CSF leakage.
        </p>
        <p>
         The etiologies, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of cranial CSF leaks will be reviewed here.

         Cranial CSF leak is a pathologic condition caused by an abnormal communication between the subarachnoid and extradural spaces. CSF flows externally down a pressure gradient to cause clear rhinorrhea or otorrhea, the leakage of CSF into the nose or ear. The condition was first described in 1899 by St Clair Thompson [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Extradural CSF leakage may also lead to neurologic symptoms from changes in intracranial volume and pressure. The most common causes of cranial CSF leaks are craniofacial trauma and intracranial surgical procedures. CSF leak may also be spontaneous, due to intracranial tumors, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), or congenital skull defects.
        </p>
        <p>
         CSF leaks causing spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) are typically due to a leak in the spinal canal. Causes of SIH are discussed separately. (See

         </span>
         Craniofacial trauma is the most common cause of CSF leak in adults, accounting for up to 90 percent of cases [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Posttraumatic CSF leaks most frequently present with CSF rhinorrhea from anterior skull base fractures. In case series, the most common fracture sites resulting in CSF leaks are the frontal sinus (31 percent), sphenoid sinus (11 to 31 percent), ethmoid sinus (15 to 19 percent), cribriform plate (8 percent), frontoethmoid sinus (8 percent), and sphenoethmoid sinus (8 percent) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. CSF leak has been reported as a rare complication of nasal and nasopharyngeal swab testing for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Temporal bone fractures more commonly present with CSF otorrhea due to rupture of the tympanic membrane but may also cause rhinorrhea from leakage down the Eustachian tube in the setting of an intact tympanic membrane.
        </p>
        <p>
         CSF leaks may occur immediately after trauma. More than 50 percent become apparent within the first two days, 70 percent within the first week, and almost all within the first three months [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Delayed leakage can be due to necrosis of the fractured bone edges, resulting in a widened pathway for leakage, resolution of the soft tissue edema that initially prevented leakage, and increases in intracranial pressure that translate into greater CSF hydrostatic forces.

         CSF leaks may occur as a complication of sinus surgery and other cranial neurosurgical procedures, representing approximately 16 percent of CSF leaks [
         <a href="#rid4">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         CSF leaks following functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) occur most commonly through defects in the ethmoid (62 percent), cribriform (18 percent), and frontal (8 percent) bones [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. In a retrospective review of nearly 79,000 FESS cases over a three-year period from California and Florida, the incidence of CSF leak and other skull base complications was 0.13 percent [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. The use of vascularized pedicled mucosal flaps has reduced the incidence of CSF leaks following FESS.
        </p>
        <p>
         CSF leaks following cranial neurosurgery are more common following skull base than procedures that involve the convexities, the dural membranes overlying the cerebral hemispheres. The rates of leakage following cranial neurosurgery range from approximately 3 percent of supratentorial procedures up to 6 percent of skull base procedures [

         </span>
         CSF leaks that occur in the absence of a traumatic or surgical inciting event are considered to be spontaneous. Spontaneous CSF leaks occur in conditions that lead to disruption of the dural membranes by direct invasion or by erosion of bone due to CSF pulsations in the setting of chronically increased intracranial pressure. Erosion of the temporal bone causes leakage of CSF into the middle ear or mastoid while erosion of the cribriform plate or bone over the paranasal sinuses causes CSF rhinorrhea. Several conditions can cause spontaneous CSF leaks.

          Idiopathic intracranial hypertension

         – Approximately 70 percent of cases of spontaneous CSF leak are associated with IIH [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-11
         </a>
         ]. Chronic elevation of intracranial pressure can occur in patients with IIH from reduced CSF resorption due to reduced cerebral venous return [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Impaired cerebral venous return can occur with reduced cardiac filling in the setting of elevated abdominal and intrapleural pressures in patients with obesity or directly with cerebral venous sinus stenosis [

          Obstructive sleep apnea

         – Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with spontaneous CSF leaks, with some studies reporting a prevalence among patients with OSA as high as 17 percent [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. CSF leaks may result from episodes of apnea-induced hypoxia and hypercapnia in OSA that lead to increased cerebral blood flow and secondary increased intracranial pressure. (See

         <strong>
          Intracranial tumors
         </strong>
         – Intracranial tumors may also cause spontaneous CSF leaks in a direct or delayed fashion, typically by dural invasion and breach. As examples, a pituitary adenoma can erode through the dura and sella turcica to allow CSF leakage into the sphenoid sinus. Alternatively, a durally invasive skull-based tumor that initially blocks the skull base defect it has created can lead to a CSF leak following stereotactic treatment or spontaneous necrosis [

          Other causes
         </strong>
         – Additional potential causes of spontaneous CSF leaks are congenital cranial defects that progressively expand over time, aberrant arachnoid granulations that erode the adjacent bone in response to CSF pulsations, and infections that erode through dura and adjacent bone [

         Cranial CSF leaks are uncommon, but precise estimates on prevalence are uncertain due to multiple possible underlying causes and underreporting of cases that resolve spontaneously. The incidence of CSF leaks in all head trauma patients is estimated to be 1 to 3 percent, while that following penetrating injury is almost 9 percent [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. In patients with fractures of the skull base, comprised of the temporal and anterior frontal bones, the incidence increases to 10 to 30 percent and overall.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a systematic review of the incidence of CSF leakage following elective cranial neurosurgical procedures, the overall rate was 3.8 percent [

         The signs and symptoms of cranial CSF leaks vary widely by underlying etiology as well as by location and severity of leak. While CSF leakage from an open fracture of the skull can be obvious, delayed or spontaneous CSF leaks can also present with isolated or mild symptoms. Many patients with closed fractures of the skull base, cranial surgical sites, or spontaneous CSF leaks present with isolated rhinorrhea or otorrhea. Other patients with intermittent or slow CSF leaks may present with auricular or other brainstem symptoms or meningismus.

         Patients with cranial CSF leaks frequently present with isolated unilateral clear, watery rhinorrhea. Patients able to give a history will typically report a postnasal drip that has a salty or sometimes sweet taste. Symptoms may be constant or, if intermittent, induced by tipping the head forward. Patients with posttraumatic cranial CSF leaks presenting with rhinorrhea most commonly have frontobasal skull fractures, including ethmoid or sphenoid bones [

         Headaches are common in patients with cranial CSF leaks and may be related to multiple factors. Patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) often have chronic headaches and may develop a cranial CSF leak as a secondary complication. Other patients who develop postoperative or tumor-related CSF leaks may have headaches due to activation of dural nociceptors. Those with iatrogenic CSF leaks following endonasal endoscopic surgery typically present with headaches along with rhinorrhea due to pneumocephalus. (See

         Some patients with a skull base cranial CSF leak may report postural headaches that worsen with prolonged upright positioning. However, postural headaches due to intracranial hypotension that occur and worsen reliably with upright positioning are uncommon with isolated skull base cranial CSF leaks. Such patients are likely to have a concurrent spinal CSF leak. Patients with postural headaches should undergo evaluation for a spinal source of CSF leak [

         For patients with a possible cranial CSF leak who present with bleeding from the ear or nose, such as those in an emergency department following head trauma or symptomatic postoperative patients, a bedside "halo test" can be used to help identify CSF in the discharge. A drop of fluid is placed on filter paper and the presence of CSF may be inferred if a ring of clear fluid develops around the blood. This pattern may also be seen on bedsheets.

         We suggest initial neuroimaging with either computed tomography (CT) of the anterior skull base and paranasal sinuses and/or temporal bones or high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the skull base to identify a cranial CSF leak.
        </p>
        <p>
         The selection of initial imaging modality varies by clinical scenario and suspected location of leak. We typically start with CT to identify an osseous defect for patients with suspected skull fracture or those who have undergone sinus surgery. For other patients, including those with suspected spontaneous CSF leak, we typically start with MRI-based imaging to identify a dural defect or associated soft tissue abnormalities. When either initial neuroimaging test is nondiagnostic, we perform the other test prior to considering invasive imaging options. Approximately 80 percent of cranial CSF leaks can be identified by one of these noninvasive neuroimaging techniques [

         High-resolution multidetector CT without contrast is the preferred initial imaging study to assess the osseous integrity of the paranasal sinus, skull base, and temporal bone structures. CT of the paranasal sinuses may be performed for patients with rhinorrhea or other symptoms following facial trauma or sinus surgery. CT of the temporal bones may be performed for patients with otorrhea, trauma or skull base surgery, or vestibulocochlear symptoms. CT imaging of both sinuses and temporal bones can be performed as a single study for patients with an uncertain location of CSF leak. Additional postcontrast imaging can be performed in selected cases to evaluate any associated soft tissue abnormality involving or adjacent to the skull base.
        </p>
        <p>
         An osseous defect with adjacent air-fluid level or opacification of the adjacent sinus or temporal bone is highly suspicious for CSF leak  (

         ). Of note, the site of a dural tear may be remote from the site of bony defects or other intracranial abnormalities, such as for patients with multiple skull fractures or pneumocephalus. In addition, some apparent bony defects identified on CT may not indicate a cranial CSF leak, such as bony scalloping seen with prominent arachnoid granulations [

         For patients with a suspected cranial CSF leak not found on initial noninvasive imaging, further imaging with intrathecal contrast is typically performed to confirm a dural defect or identify the leak site. Patients may need a combination of tests to determine the site of leak. In addition, neuroimaging with intrathecal contrast is typically required for patients diagnosed with a cranial CSF defect to guide surgical planning when initial imaging does not identify the specific site of the dural defect.
        </p>
        <p>
         Invasive neuroimaging for cranial CSF leaks involves the use of intrathecal injection of contrast material via image-guided lumbar puncture. A CSF leak may be demonstrated by the extrathecal location of intrathecally injected material. To optimize diagnostic yield, maneuvers to provoke the CSF leak or symptoms should be performed during imaging. These may include Valsalva maneuvers, Trendelenburg body position, or specific head positioning known to elicit symptoms.

         CT cisternography with intrathecal contrast is considered the gold standard for evaluating a cranial CSF leak. Precontrast imaging of the anterior skull base, paranasal sinuses, and temporal bones is obtained. Then, intrathecal injection of low-osmolar iodinated contrast is performed via lumbar puncture and the patient is placed in Trendelenburg positioning. Provocative maneuvers may be performed to exacerbate CSF leak and then imaging is obtained. The presence of contrast in an extradural location confirms a CSF leak. When the sinonasal cavities or temporal bone cavities demonstrate fluid prior to intrathecal contrast administration, an increase in Hounsfield units of 50 percent or more is considered positive for CSF leak  (

Radionuclide cisternography has largely been supplanted by CT and MR cisternography and is reserved for occult leaks that cannot be confirmed by other methods. For optimal sensitivity, pretreatment nasal cavity and nasopharyngeal pledgets are placed endoscopically and then collected for assessment several hours later.

         We suggest trial of conservative treatment for patients with a cranial CSF leak who do not have an indication for initial surgical management. Many postoperative leaks will resolve with nonsurgical treatment [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. Posttraumatic CSF leaks amenable to initial nonsurgical treatment include those due to blunt force injury causing a closed fracture of the skull convexity in the absence of brain compression and linear skull base fractures in the absence of any brain or visual system compression by skull fragments or hematomas. In a review of 81 patients with posttraumatic CSF leaks of at least 24-hour duration, 40 percent resolved with conservative measures alone [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The primary goal of the conservative management of posttraumatic CSF leaks is to enable the healing and closure of the dural and bony defects by decreasing and preventing transient spikes in intracranial pressure.

          Management of subgaleal fluid collections

         – For patients with a CSF leak contained to the subgaleal space following cranial surgery, fluid can be removed percutaneously to relieve mass effect, prevent dehiscence of the incision, and assess for evidence of infection. Additionally, the head may be wrapped with a compressive gauze, a combination treatment commonly referred to as "tap and wrap." When there is frank leakage of CSF through the incision, the scalp opening is oversewn to minimize the chances of an infection if not already present.

         give prophylactic antibiotics to patients with CSF leaks due to basilar skull fractures. A Cochrane database systematic review initially published in 2006 and updated in 2011 and 2015 examined the results of five clinical trials that enrolled a total of 208 subjects and found no benefit with prophylactic antibiotics for reducing meningitis frequency, all-cause mortality, meningitis-related mortality, or the need for surgical intervention [

         For patients with symptoms that fail to resolve after one week of conservative therapy, we pursue additional treatment options such as lumbar drain or surgical repair. Limited evidence suggests that patients with posttraumatic CSF leaks persisting greater than seven days have an 8- to 10-fold increased risk of developing meningitis [

         For patients without clear indications for surgical intervention, the failure of initial conservative therapies is generally followed by CSF diversion procedures such as lumbar drain placement or repeated lumbar punctures. In a single-center series of 81 patients with posttraumatic CSF leaks, 24 were treated with lumbar drainage for an average of seven days [

        <p>
         The risks of lumbar drainage include meningitis, for which patients should be closely monitored clinically, and CSF should be tested periodically, and over drainage, which can result in postural headaches and pneumocephalus. We typically drain patients at a rate of 10 cc/hour.

         Surgical repair of posttraumatic CSF leaks often requires managing infection risk and repairing displaced bone. Bone fragments, foreign bodies, or hematomas causing brain compression are removed, and potentially infectious material is washed out. The dura is then repaired either primarily or using a graft. The skull is reconstructed as needed if there are no concerns for increased intracranial pressure postoperatively, and the overlying soft tissues such as any muscles and the scalp are closed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Skull base fractures with larger bony and associated dural defects can be performed using an open transcranial approach or an endonasal endoscopic approach. Fibrin glue or vascularized pedicled mucosal flaps may be used to support effective closure of the dura.

          22

         <strong>
          Temporal skull base defects
         </strong>
         – Spontaneous CSF leaks that occur through defects in the temporal bone can be repaired via a mastoidectomy, middle fossa craniotomy, or combined transmastoid-middle fossa approach depending on the location and size of the defect and the relationship of the defect to the ossicles. The transmastoid approach is less invasive and is generally used for smaller defects. The middle fossa approach provides a greater exposure for the repair of larger defects and is more likely to preserve hearing but may require brain retraction and a longer hospital stay. The combined approach offers partial benefits of each individual approach. A variety of materials have been used to repair bony and dural defects including temporalis fascia, bone, fibrin glue, synthetic dura, fat, hydroxyapatite cement, cartilage, muscle, and titanium plates. The use of one material over another appears to be based on surgeon preference as no trials have been conducted comparing them.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In a systematic review that included 33 studies with a total of 873 procedures, similar success rates at &gt;95 percent were reported for transmastoid, middle fossa, or combined approaches [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41

        <p>
         The use of adjunctive therapies during or after surgical repair also appears to be largely dictated by surgeon preference or experience. Postoperative lumbar drains are more commonly placed following anterior than lateral skull base procedures. A drain would theoretically decrease intracranial pressure and promote postsurgical healing of the defect, but compelling evidence to confirm this hypothesis is unavailable [

          Definition and causes
         </strong>
         – Cranial CSF leak is a pathologic condition caused by an abnormal communication between the subarachnoid and extradural spaces within the cranial vault. The most common causes of cranial CSF leaks are craniofacial trauma and intracranial surgical procedures. CSF leaks may also be spontaneous, due to intracranial tumors, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, or congenital skull defects. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pathogenesis and etiologies'

         <strong>
          Clinical features
         </strong>
         – CSF leaks from an open fracture of the skull can be obvious; however, patients can also present with isolated clear rhinorrhea or otorrhea. Other patients with intermittent or slow CSF leaks may present with neurologic symptoms such as headaches, tinnitus, or vertigo, or with symptoms due to meningitis. (See

          Identifying CSF in rhinorrhea or otorrhea
         </strong>
         – For patients with rhinorrhea or otorrhea, we assess for CSF protein such as beta-2 transferrin or beta-trace protein in a collected sample of watery discharge to diagnosis a cranial CSF leak. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Assess for presence of CSF in patients with rhinorrhea or otorrhea'

          Neuroimaging
         </strong>
         – Neuroimaging is
         <strong>
          required
         </strong>
         to establish the diagnosis of a cranial CSF leak for patients presenting with rhinorrhea or otorrhea when CSF is not identified on initial testing and for all patients who present with isolated neurologic symptoms suggestive of a cranial CSF leak. Diagnostic imaging may demonstrate direct evidence of a dural defect or indirect evidence of extradural CSF  (

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Neuroimaging is also indicated for all patients with a cranial CSF leak to assess the location and extent of the leak, to evaluate for underlying causes, and to help guide management.

         <strong>
          Initial noninvasive imaging
         </strong>
         – We suggest initial noninvasive imaging to identify a cranial CSF leak. We typically start with CT of the anterior skull base, paranasal sinuses, and/or temporal bones to identify an osseous defect for patients with suspected skull fracture or those who have undergone sinus surgery. For other patients, including those with suspected spontaneous CSF leak, we typically start with high-resolution MRI of the skull base. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial noninvasive options'

         <strong>
          Invasive imaging
         </strong>
         – For patients with a suspected cranial CSF not found on initial imaging, CT-cisternography with intrathecal contrast is typically performed via lumbar puncture to confirm a dural defect or identify the leak site. Cisternography is often required for patients diagnosed with a cranial CSF defect to identify the specific site of the dural defect. (See

          'Invasive imaging options when initial testing is nondiagnostic'

         <strong>
          Initial conservative treatment for most patients
         </strong>
         – We suggest a trial of conservative treatment for stable patients with postoperative or uncomplicated posttraumatic cranial CSF leaks (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Posttraumatic CSF leaks amenable to initial nonsurgical treatment include those due a closed fracture of the skull convexity or linear skull base fractures in the absence of any brain or visual system compression by skull fragments or hematomas. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial conservative measures for other patients'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Conservative treatment typically includes bed rest with the head of bed elevated &gt;30 degrees. Patients are instructed to avoid straining, and medications including stool softeners as well as antiemetic, antitussive, and antihypertensive agents are given as needed.

         <strong>
          Surgical repair
         </strong>
         – We suggest surgical repair of a cranial CSF leak for patients with open skull fractures or other skull base fractures with bony and dural defects, patients with spontaneous CSF leaks, and those with persistent symptoms despite initial conservative therapy (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Skull base fractures with larger bony and associated dural defects can be performed using an open transcranial approach or an endonasal endoscopic approach.

         <strong>
          Meningitis prophylaxis
         </strong>
         – Supportive treatment consists of pneumococcal vaccination for all patients with a cranial CSF leak. Cranial CSF leaks are associated with an elevated risk for bacterial meningitis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'General measures for all patients'

         <strong>
          Prognosis
         </strong>
         – Limited data suggest most patients with a cranial CSF leak improve with treatment. The resolution of the leak and associated symptoms appears likelier in patients with posttraumatic or postoperative CSF leaks and an identified dural defect than those with a spontaneous CSF leak. (See
         <a class="local">
