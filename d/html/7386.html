It is caused by loss of part or all of an X chromosome [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the management of children and adolescents with this disorder. Treatment varies with the age of the patient and includes therapy for the short stature and estrogen deficiency, as well as identifying and managing the associated congenital anomalies and related comorbidities or complications  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60006" href="/d/graphic/60006.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Turner syndrome and management in adults are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7391.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Turner syndrome"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/116877.html" rel="external">"Management of Turner syndrome in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PRENATAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cases of Turner syndrome sometimes are discovered incidentally during chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis done for either advanced maternal age or for suspicion about congenital anomalies noted on fetal ultrasonography. Ultrasound findings that may be seen in a fetus with Turner syndrome include increased nuchal translucency, a good marker for fetal chromosomal defects, cystic hygroma, or fetal hydrops [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Finding a 45,X karyotype in a fetus with a large cystic hygroma or hydrops confirms the diagnosis of Turner syndrome [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In such cases, the likelihood for spontaneous abortion is high.</p><p>When a diagnosis of Turner syndrome is entertained prenatally, the parents should be provided detailed genetic counseling. Parents may, on their own, consider termination of the pregnancy, often prompted by their review of information available on the internet. Reliable genetic counseling may be challenging because it can be difficult to predict the exact phenotype of girls with prenatally diagnosed Turner syndrome. Retrospective studies suggest that many girls, and particularly those with 45,X/46,XX mosaicism [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], may have a milder phenotype than those diagnosed on the basis of clinical suspicion [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. It is important that some of the counseling be provided by health care professionals with direct experience caring for Turner syndrome patients throughout childhood and adolescence; these are often pediatric endocrinologists. Such clinicians are best suited to answer questions about available treatments and prognosis related to the Turner syndrome comorbidities (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/447.html" rel="external">"Sonographic findings associated with fetal aneuploidy", section on 'Monosomy X (Turner syndrome)'</a>). Finally, advanced methods of noninvasive prenatal testing using molecular sequencing may raise the possibility of Turner syndrome (either in the fetus or the mother), and additional testing plus genetic counseling will be needed. At this time, there is not enough evidence to recommend the routine use of noninvasive prenatal testing to diagnose Turner syndrome prenatally, whether performed by sequencing or single-nucleotide polymorphism array analysis of cell-free fetal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from maternal blood. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/458.html" rel="external">"Prenatal screening for common aneuploidies using cell-free DNA"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2851216749"><span class="h1">DISCLOSURE OF THE DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Providers should counsel parents about how to disclose diagnostic and other health-related information in a timely, caring, and age-appropriate manner. This is of great importance to the overall mental and physical health of the patient.</p><p>Many patients report that their Turner syndrome diagnosis or other important information was inappropriately withheld from them. In a study conducted in the United States, approximately one-third of patients with Turner syndrome reported that their families or health care providers had withheld all or part of the Turner syndrome diagnosis [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In particular, several patients were not informed of the infertility associated with the diagnosis.

Whenever possible, patients should be cared for in a multidisciplinary clinic dedicated to Turner syndrome or at least by a team of specialists with such expertise.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Cardiovascular anomalies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Congenital heart defects may occur in 23 to 50 percent of Turner syndrome patients. They are the most frequent cause of early mortality in this population. The incidence of such defects is higher in patients harboring a 45,X karyotype compared with those who have X chromosome mosaicism or structural X chromosome defects. The spectrum of cardiovascular comorbidities associated with Turner syndrome and guidance for monitoring and management are summarized in a statement from the American Heart Association [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. An approach to screening for cardiovascular anomalies is shown in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106468" href="/d/graphic/106468.html" rel="external">table 2A</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3299094870"><span class="h3">Initial evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>At the time of diagnosis, all infants and children with Turner syndrome should have a comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation by a pediatric cardiologist, including the following [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Measurements of blood pressure in both the upper and lower extremities.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Electrocardiography (ECG) to assess for conduction abnormalities (eg, prolonged QTc interval).

We suggest cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging as soon as the patient is old enough to tolerate the procedure without general anesthesia (typically around 12 years of age) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. CMR is valuable for both screening and surveillance, especially to detect abnormalities such as a dilated ascending aorta, an elongated transverse aortic arch (as well as other aortic phenotypes with milder aortic arch hypoplasia), and partial anomalous pulmonary venous return. Other cardiovascular anomalies in Turner syndrome are outlined in the table and reviewed separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60006" href="/d/graphic/60006.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8,9,11</a>].</p><p></p><p>Ideally, all patients with Turner syndrome, and especially those with identified cardiac anomalies, should have ongoing follow-up care with a cardiologist, preferably one who has expertise in congenital heart disease.

This is based on the 2007 American Heart Association guidelines on the prevention of bacterial endocarditis, which recommend that only patients with the highest risk for the development of endocarditis receive antimicrobial prophylaxis [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4139118786"><span class="h3">Monitoring for aortic dilatation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Repeat imaging with echocardiography and/or CMR is suggested periodically throughout life to monitor for the development and/or progression of ascending aortic dilation. Aortic dissection or rupture is an important cause of death in women with Turner syndrome, and the risk is predicted by a dilated ascending aorta (measured as the aortic diameter, normalized for body surface area with Turner syndrome-specific Z-scores or standard deviation [SD] units). Patients with known aortic dilation and those with risk factors for dissection (eg, hypertension, coarctation of the aorta, and/or bicuspid aortic valve) should undergo more frequent monitoring  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116820" href="/d/graphic/116820.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. However, routine surveillance is suggested for <strong>all</strong> women with Turner syndrome since aortic dissection can occur even in the absence of these risk factors. The protocol for women 16 years and older, and for those considering pregnancy, is discussed separately. Unfortunately, despite increased efforts, it appears that more than one-half of individuals with Turner syndrome are not adequately informed about the need for ongoing monitoring, even in the absence of cardiovascular symptomatology [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/116877.html" rel="external">"Management of Turner syndrome in adults", section on 'Cardiovascular health'</a>.)</p><p>If aortic dilatation is identified, patients should be evaluated to optimize medical treatment, as outlined in a statement from the American Heart Association [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Because hypertension is common in Turner syndrome, maintaining normal blood pressure may lower the risk of acute aortic events [<a href="#rid14">14-16</a>]. Management may include beta blockers, exercise restriction, and aggressive blood pressure control. Management of aortic dilatation is generally similar to the approach taken for patients with Marfan syndrome and other genetic aortopathies; clinical trials in individuals with Turner syndrome are lacking. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8151.html" rel="external">"Management of Marfan syndrome and related disorders"</a>.)</p><p>Prophylactic antihypertensive therapy may be started early in the course because aortic dissection may also occur earlier (at smaller aortic dimensions) in Turner syndrome than in nonsyndromic patients with aortic dilatation [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Elective surgical repair may be an option for some patients, particularly if aortic dilation is rapidly expanding (ie, an increase of &gt;+1 in Turner syndrome-specific Z-scores or an absolute increase of &gt;+0.5 cm in one year). The techniques used and perioperative care are similar to those used for other patients with aortic dilatation and dissection. (See <a class="local">'Hypertension'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8151.html" rel="external">"Management of Marfan syndrome and related disorders"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8189.html" rel="external">"Management of thoracic aortic aneurysm in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Any complaint of <strong>chest pain should</strong> <strong>be evaluated urgently</strong> by a specialist because it may be a symptom of early dissection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8190.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3371552569"><span class="h2">Hypertension</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Blood pressure should be monitored at every clinical visit. It is important to measure blood pressure manually because automatic blood pressure monitoring often results in falsely high readings.</p><p>Hypertension is common in Turner syndrome, although little has been documented about the diagnosis of hypertension in this population [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. A prevalence as high as 30 percent in children and 60 percent in adults has been suggested. This was confirmed in a group of Turner syndrome girls compared with a large cohort of healthy girls: The former had significantly higher diastolic and systolic blood pressures than did the reference population, with the diastolic measurements remaining higher even when corrected for body mass index. More than one-half of the Turner syndrome group had at least one blood pressure reading above the hypertension threshold [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Turner syndrome patients are more likely to have transiently elevated blood pressure measurements in the office ("white coat hypertension") due to their increased level of anxiety compared with normal peers. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7391.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Turner syndrome", section on 'Hypertension'</a>.)</p><p>If hypertension develops, it should be treated vigorously, including lifestyle modification and weight management. Early recognition of and treatment for systemic hypertension is particularly important for patients with Turner syndrome because of their increased risk for cardiovascular events. Patients should also be carefully evaluated for causes of hypertension such as kidney disease, obstructive uropathy, and coarctation of the aorta.</p><p>Most experts suggest starting therapy for blood pressures that are persistently in the hypertensive range and targeting a low-normal blood pressure [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Hypertension is defined as blood pressure &gt;130/80 mmHg for adults and children &gt;13 years, or &gt;95<sup>th</sup> percentile for younger children  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef114574" href="/d/graphic/114574.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]. Initial therapy usually consists of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, unless otherwise contraindicated, due to their favorable effect on aortic dilatation in Marfan syndrome, although evidence in Turner syndrome is limited [<a href="#rid8">8,9,17</a>]. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a reasonable alternative. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6131.html" rel="external">"Nonemergent treatment of hypertension in children and adolescents", section on 'Antihypertensive drugs'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2155490265"><span class="h2">Cognitive function and learning disabilities</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neuropsychology and allied behavioral health services should be integrated into the care for girls and women with Turner syndrome [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. This includes annual developmental and behavioral screenings until adulthood, with referrals as needed. Simple screening tools are also available for anxiety, one of the more common mood disorders observed in Turner syndrome girls, and can even be applied easily by nonmental health care providers who may see these girls in the office on a more frequent basis [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. In addition, neuropsychologic assessments should be performed at key transitional stages in schooling, such as entry into elementary, middle, and high school. Any learning or performance issues identified should be addressed with appropriate academic and occupational adjustments. Educational needs should be reevaluated periodically, depending on initial results and school performance (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/614.html" rel="external">"Specific learning disorders in children: Educational management"</a>). A review of the many neurocognitive features observed in individuals with Turner syndrome provides practical recommendations for the treatment of psychological and behavioral difficulties, as well as specific considerations for educational support for the school-aged child with Turner syndrome [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p>Most individuals with Turner syndrome have normal intelligence, but girls with a small ring X chromosome have a higher risk for significant intellectual disability. This is due to the ring X missing the X-inactivation site XIST at Xq13.2. The result is functional disomy of certain Xp loci that should normally be inactivated but instead leads to an atypical Turner syndrome phenotype [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Other patients with Turner syndrome may have attention hyperactivity deficit disorder (ADHD) and difficulties with visual-spatial organization, social cognition, and nonverbal problem-solving tasks such as mathematics. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7391.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Turner syndrome", section on 'Psychologic and educational issues'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3143214313"><span class="h2">Tympanometry and audiology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Regular monitoring of hearing, including serial audiology evaluations, is recommended throughout life, with an audiology evaluation every three years in children and every five years in adults [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>Children with Turner syndrome have high rates of conductive hearing problems due to recurrent otitis media and middle ear effusions, resulting from abnormalities of the Eustachian tubes and cranial base [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Progressive sensorineural hearing loss develops by adulthood in more than 50 percent of patients.

At a minimum, surveillance should include a physical examination for scoliosis (visual inspection and bend-forward test) annually and every six months during growth hormone therapy, with a consideration for additional radiographic assessment around school entry (five to six years of age) and during mid-puberty (12 to 14 years of age), or when concerns arise.

The growth hormone dose can then be adjusted as needed to maintain IGF-1 concentrations below +2 standard deviations (SD) above the mean for age and/or Tanner stage of pubertal development but ideally above the mean (approximately +1 SD). This is because a prolonged elevation of IGF-1 (eg, &gt;+3 SD) may be associated with toxicity, while a low IGF-1 suggests that the dose of growth hormone may be insufficient and may not achieve an optimal growth response.

This finding does not preclude an effect of growth hormone on HRQoL, since many girls experience significant improvement in adult height with growth hormone therapy compared with their untreated height projections and because HRQoL is compromised by the effects of multiple other comorbidities of Turner syndrome.

Depot estradiol at 0.2 to 0.4 mg intramuscularly monthly can be an alternative but is not often the patient's choice [<a href="#rid51">51,58</a>]. Some clinicians use an estradiol gel; potential disadvantages of this approach are that the gel is more difficult to dose in a small amount for pubertal induction, and there are only limited data concerning its use in Turner syndrome girls [<a href="#rid59">59</a>].

A typical adult dose is a transdermal <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13282" href="/d/drug information/13282.html" rel="external">estradiol</a> patch (100 mcg/day) applied weekly or twice weekly. This dose is also roughly equivalent to 2 mg of oral micronized estradiol, approximately 10 mcg of oral ethinyl estradiol, or 1.25 mg of oral <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13283" href="/d/drug information/13283.html" rel="external">conjugated equine estrogen</a>. Clinicians treating adult Turner syndrome patients can interchange between these formulations, but the transdermal route is preferred, as discussed in the following section [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. Most clinicians increase the dose every four to six months, with some variation based on the patient's clinical response  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62742" href="/d/graphic/62742.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). For girls whose epiphyses are still open, it may be useful to advance the estradiol dose more slowly to maximize growth potential. Some clinicians choose to measure serum estradiol concentrations and adjust the dose to a normal range for the patient's age, but the utility of this approach has not been demonstrated. The individual responsiveness to even small doses of estradiol is variable and also needs to be taken into account when escalating the estradiol replacement.</p><p></p><p>The rationale for the gradual increase in <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13282" href="/d/drug information/13282.html" rel="external">estradiol</a> dose is to mimic normal puberty and breast development. Although there are no available clinical data, many clinicians feel that this approach results in more normal breast development than when high doses are initiated. However, some girls do not think that their breast development is optimal even after appropriate estradiol therapy. This is hard to prove but could be due to poor development of breast anlage, widely spaced nipples, and the shield chest.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2540613036"><span class="h3">Route of administration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The best choice at this time is to use transdermal <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13282" href="/d/drug information/13282.html" rel="external">estradiol</a> if the patient is willing and able to use this dose form. The transdermal estradiol is administered via a patch, which can be cut to deliver a reduced dose for young patients, as outlined above. Potential advantages of transdermal administration compared with oral estrogens include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>More physiologic delivery, ie, into the systemic, rather than the hepatic, circulation.

Treatment is best individualized depending on the clinical situation, but the goal should first be to attempt using the transdermal preparations, primarily because of the lower risk for thromboembolic events. Based on a meta-analysis of many observational trials, women treated with oral estrogens have twice the risk for thromboembolic events compared with those treated with transdermal estradiol [<a href="#rid62">62</a>].

Estradiol replacement is usually begun at doses between one-tenth and one-eighth of the adult replacement dose and then increased gradually during the next two to four years  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62742" href="/d/graphic/62742.html" rel="external">table 5</a>).
