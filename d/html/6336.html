         <strong>
          Furuncle
         </strong>
         – A furuncle is a well-circumscribed, painful, suppurative inflammatory nodule involving hair follicles that usually arises from preexisting folliculitis. A furuncle can occur at any site that contains hair follicles, especially in regions that are subject to friction and maceration (eg, face, neck, axillae, groin, thighs, and buttocks). The lesion may extend into the dermis and subcutaneous tissues and often serves as a nidus for cellulitis and skin abscess.

          Skin abscess
         </strong>
         – A skin abscess is a collection of pus within the dermis and deeper skin tissues. Skin abscesses manifest as painful, tender, fluctuant, and erythematous nodules frequently surmounted by a pustule and surrounded by a rim of erythematous swelling  (

         <strong>
          Vascular mass
         </strong>
         – Abscesses located near major blood vessels must be differentiated from infected aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms, and vascular anomalies before incision and drainage is performed  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72536" href="/z/d/graphic/72536.html" rel="external">
          picture 4
         </a>
         ). Incision into a vascular structure that mimics an abscess, particularly an artery or arteriovenous malformation, can lead to fatal hemorrhage [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>

          Myiasis

         – Botfly myiasis is a skin infection caused by larvae of the botfly that should be suspected in travelers returning from Central or South America [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ]. Patients typically note an apparent insect bite that, instead of healing, slowly enlarges over time to a nodule measuring 1 to 3 cm in diameter  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54606" href="/z/d/graphic/54606.html" rel="external">

          Kerion
         </strong>
         – Patients with the fungal infection tinea capitis may develop a boggy, tender, exudative scalp mass called a kerion. This is an allergic inflammatory response to the fungal infection and not a true cutaneous abscess  (

         <em>
          Staphylococcus aureus
         </em>
         may be indicated, incision and drainage should
         <strong>
          not

          Herpetic whitlow
         </strong>
         – Herpetic whitlow (herpes simplex virus [HSV] infection of the finger) occurs as a complication of primary oral or genital herpes infection via a break in the skin. In addition to erythema, swelling, and pain, herpetic whitlow is characterized by the presence of vesicular or pustular lesions  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75510" href="/z/d/graphic/75510.html" rel="external">
          picture 8
         </a>
         ). Patients may also experience fever, lymphadenitis, and epitrochlear or axillary lymphadenopathy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8334.html" rel="external">
          "Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection", section on 'Cutaneous manifestations'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The diagnosis of herpetic whitlow is suspected by an exposure history as well as the presence of vesicles that, on Tzanck smear, reveal multinucleated giant cells. It is important to distinguish whitlow from felon; incision and drainage should not be performed in the former because it may lead to secondary bacterial infections that delay healing. (See

         In a patient with a clinically evident abscess on physical examination, incision and drainage without bedside ultrasound (US) is a reasonable initial option. In a patient with a skin and soft tissue infection that has equivocal physical examination findings for an abscess, the extent of the abscess is not apparent by examination, or adequate drainage cannot be achieved, we suggest bedside US (if equipment and a trained provider are available) to facilitate abscess drainage rather than physical examination alone.
        </p>
        <p>
         When performed by a trained and experienced provider, bedside US has high diagnostic accuracy for the presence of skin and soft tissue abscess  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef117838" href="/z/d/graphic/117838.html" rel="external">
          image 1
         </a>
         ) versus cellulitis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef117839" href="/z/d/graphic/117839.html" rel="external">
          image 2
         </a>
         ) and can identify abscess size, depth, and location. Bedside US can also determine the presence of multiple connected abscesses (a contraindication to simple incision and drainage, which does not provide adequate treatment of fistulas). In addition, it may occasionally identify abnormalities (eg, adjacent vessels or atypical findings suggesting an alternative diagnosis) that contraindicate simple incision and drainage in the emergency department (ED) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Contraindications'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Furthermore, even when the diagnosis of abscess is clinically apparent, limited evidence suggests that bedside US may reduce clinical failure. As an example, in a small trial of 107 adults undergoing abscess drainage in the ED, clinical failure rates 10 days after the procedure were lower in patients evaluated with physical examination and US compared with physical examination alone (4 versus 17 percent [risk difference 13 percent, 95% CI 0-19 percent, adjusted odds ratio 0.2, 95% CI 0.04-0.97]) [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. This result warrants confirmation in a larger study.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a meta-analysis of 14 studies (13 performed in EDs), bedside US use was associated with a correct change in management in 10 percent of patients (number needed to treat: 10) and an incorrect change in 0.7 percent of patients (number needed to harm: 142). Bedside US had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 95 and 85 percent, respectively [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. The gold standard in most studies was pus on incision and drainage. The greatest benefit for US was seen in children and patients with clinical findings that were equivocal for an abscess. In the largest prospective, observational study included in this meta-analysis (1200 adults with skin and soft tissue infections), US changed management in approximately 1 percent of patients when clinicians were certain about the presence or absence of an abscess, compared with 24 percent of patients when clinical findings were equivocal. Most changes were appropriate in both groups. [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Thus, bedside US appears to have the greatest benefit for patients with equivocal physical examination findings for abscess.

         Lack of adequate pain control is the most common limiting factor in achieving adequate incision and drainage [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,18
         </a>
         ]. Most patients can receive appropriate sedation and analgesia in the ED. Local anesthesia is sufficient for most simple abscesses in adolescents and adults. Young children and patients with large abscesses, especially those in the pilonidal region, frequently require parenteral sedation and analgesia in addition to local anesthesia to achieve adequate pain control and to permit successful completion of the procedure.

         To augment procedural sedation, use a regional block, if possible. Local infiltration is less effective than a regional block due to the lower pH of infected tissue, which reduces the proportion of anesthetic in the more active uncharged form. (See

         Make a simple linear incision through the total length of the abscess with the incision conforming to the natural folds of the skin. Avoid cruciate or elliptical incisions because they can cause unsightly scars.

         support primary closure after skin abscess drainage in pediatric patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         Closure by secondary intention is the traditional approach to abscess management and is based upon the principle of avoiding the placement of foreign bodies in contaminated wounds. Evidence for primary closure of abscesses is as follows:

         In one meta-analysis of seven trials (915 patients), primary vertical mattress closure of abscesses after drainage using nonabsorbable sutures had clinically significantly faster healing (8 versus 15 days) and fewer recurrences (8 versus 11 percent, although not statistically significant) than healing by secondary intention [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>

         <em>
          S. aureus

         and were judged to be of poor quality [

         In a more recent trial of 56 healthy adults undergoing incision and drainage for abscesses in the emergency department (ED), healing or treatment failure was not significantly different between primary or secondary closure (60 to 70 percent healing and approximately 30 percent treatment failures with both outcomes evaluated at seven days) [

         After probing and irrigation, pack the cavity to prevent closure of the wound margins. Avoid packing the cavity too tightly because excessive pressure may cause tissue necrosis [

        <p>
         Sterile gauze, iodoform gauze, or silver-containing hydrofiber (eg, Aquacel Ag) packing strips may be used to fill the abscess cavity. A tail of about 1 cm of packing can serve as a wick for drainage and facilitate subsequent removal of the packing material [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,18
         </a>
         ]. The wound is left open and an absorbent dressing is placed over it. In an unblinded trial that compared silver-containing hydrofiber versus iodoform gauze packing in 92 adults receiving incision and drainage in an ED, silver-containing hydrofiber was associated with decreased pain at 48 to 72 hours and more rapid reduction in the abscess cavity size [

         A Penrose drain or catheter may be preferred in patients with pilonidal abscesses and when follow-up is uncertain. In these circumstances, place a split Penrose drain or a balloon-tipped (eg, Foley) or flared-tipped (eg, Malecot) catheter into the cavity and secure it with an absorbable suture at the wound margin. Cut excess tubing approximately 2 cm above the skin surface. This technique is appropriate for any abscess, except ones located on the face [

         Limited evidence from a systematic review of one small trial and three observational studies (470 total patients) suggests that the failure rate of the loop drainage technique may be lower than for incision and drainage (4 versus 9 percent, respectively [OR 2.63; 95% CI 1.03-6.63]); however, the included studies had a moderate risk of bias) [
         <a href="#rid27">

         <a href="#rid32">
          32

         If reaccumulation has occurred, the sutures should be removed and the abscess irrigated to remove the pus. Small abscesses can be managed in the same manner as open wounds with no packing or drain as described above. Abscesses appropriate for packing (&gt;5 cm in diameter or pilonidal abscesses) should undergo packing and further management as described above. In one trial of primary versus secondary closure of abscesses, 6 of the 27 healthy patients who received primary closure after incision and drainage of an abscess required suture removal by 48 hours because of reaccumulation of pus [

         <a class="local">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In a patient with a clinically evident abscess on physical examination, incision and drainage without bedside ultrasound (US) is a reasonable initial option. If US equipment and a trained provider are available, bedside US can be used to differentiate a skin abscess  (

          image 2

         ). US may be particularly helpful if there are equivocal physical examination findings for an abscess, the extent of the abscess is not apparent by examination, or adequate drainage cannot be achieved. (See

          Analgesia
         </strong>
         – Most simple abscesses in adolescents and adults can be managed with local anesthesia. Young children and patients with large abscesses, especially those in the pilonidal region, frequently require parenteral sedation and analgesia in addition to local anesthesia to achieve adequate pain control and to allow for successful completion of the procedure. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Sedation and analgesia'

          Techniques

          table 2

         ). A list of the necessary equipment is provided in the text. (See

          figure 2
         </a>
         ) is an alternative to traditional incision and drainage that may be less painful for the patient, avoids packing, and may reduce the need for follow-up. This method also leaves less scarring and may prevent recurrence of the abscess, especially in children. (See

         <strong>
          Aftercare
         </strong>
         – The patient should be instructed to follow up for re-examination of the wound within 24 to 48 hours. Decisions about antibiotic therapy for skin abscesses are discussed separately (see
