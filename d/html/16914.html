DS manifests as a developmental delay with a characteristic spectrum of congenital malformations, which may include the heart (eg, atrioventricular septal defect), gastrointestinal tract (eg, duodenal stenosis or atresia, imperforate anus, Hirschsprung disease), musculoskeletal system, and other organs. </p><p>Hematologic abnormalities are common in children with DS. Among other hematologic disorders, neonates with DS may exhibit transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM), a preleukemic condition that is unique to infants with DS or mosaic trisomy 21. TAM was previously called transient leukemia or transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) of DS. TAM generally manifests as circulating blasts and is often accompanied by hepatomegaly; some children also have infiltration of blasts into skin or other organs. In a minority of cases, liver fibrosis/failure or other organ dysfunction causes early death. Some children with TAM later develop myeloid leukemia associated with DS (ML-DS) within the first four years of life. </p><p>TAM poses diagnostic challenges and requires an individualized approach to management that is stratified according to the risk of early death. The pathogenesis, natural history, and management of TAM are different from other DS-associated hematologic disorders, such as ML-DS and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). </p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of TAM are presented in this topic. </p><p>Myeloid leukemia associated with DS is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/139448.html" rel="external">"Myeloid leukemia associated with Down syndrome (ML-DS)"</a>.)</p><p>Also discussed separately are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clinical features and diagnosis of DS, including other DS-associated hematologic manifestations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2917.html" rel="external">"Down syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>General management of children with DS. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2938.html" rel="external">"Down syndrome: Management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2819136734"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>TAM is a preleukemic disorder unique to infants with DS or mosaic trisomy 21 that is manifest with circulating and/or tissue-infiltrating blasts that usually resemble megakaryoblasts [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. TAM resolves spontaneously in most patients, but 5 to 20 percent of affected children experience early death from complications. In addition, approximately one-fifth of children with TAM later develop myeloid leukemia associated with DS (ML-DS), a disorder that may present with cytopenias and low blast counts or as acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) with higher blast counts  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101461" href="/z/d/graphic/101461.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). </p><p>Central to the pathophysiology of both TAM and ML-DS is the presence of trisomy 21 and an acquired <em>GATA1</em> mutation in a progenitor cell of fetal (liver) hematopoiesis. Key aspects of the pathophysiology of TAM and ML-DS include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Trisomy 21 and</strong> <strong><em>GATA1</em></strong><strong> mutation</strong> – In the setting of constitutional trisomy 21, there is expansion of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor cells (MEPs) in the fetal liver [<a href="#rid2">2-5</a>]. Acquisition by a long-term hematopoietic stem cell of a somatic mutation of <em>GATA1</em> (which encodes a key transcription factor for erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis) appears to initiate development of TAM [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. <em>GATA1</em> mutations in TAM and ML-DS typically encode a patient-specific short insertion/deletion or point mutation in exon 2 (or, rarely, in exon 3) [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. The mutated gene encodes an amino-terminally truncated protein (GATA1s for short) that impairs megakaryocytic differentiation and leads to uncontrolled proliferation of a population of TAM blasts in the context of constitutional trisomy 21 [<a href="#rid3">3,9-11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The observation that TAM blasts are typically found in greater percentages in blood than in the bone marrow (the site of postnatal blood formation) is consistent with the origin of TAM in fetal liver hematopoietic cells [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. While the typical sequence of events underlying TAM and ML-DS is acquisition of a somatic <em>GATA1</em> mutation in the context of constitutional trisomy 21, rare instances of TAM or ML-DS have been described in which hematopoietic cells with a germline <em>GATA1</em> mutation subsequently acquired somatic trisomy 21 [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Liver failure/fibrosis occurs in a minority of patients and can cause early death in children with TAM. Liver fibrosis appears to be caused by secretion of fibrogenic cytokines (eg, PDGF-alpha and -beta, TGF-beta) by TAM blasts and/or expression of PDGFR-beta or MCP-1 in fibrotic tissue [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Spontaneous resolution</strong> <strong>of TAM</strong> – TAM resolves spontaneously within the first three months of life (or before birth) in the vast majority of affected children. The mechanisms that account for its regression are uncertain. Hypotheses for the disappearance of TAM blasts include the developmental transition from prenatal fetal liver hematopoiesis to postnatal bone marrow hematopoiesis, a response by the developing immune system, and/or a high rate of spontaneous apoptosis [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Development of ML-DS</strong> – Approximately 20 percent of children develop ML-DS months to years after resolution of TAM (usually before age four years). Subclinical persistence of TAM blasts, together with additional mutations (eg, in signaling molecules, cohesin complex, epigenetic modifiers) are required for development of ML-DS [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Details of the pathogenesis of ML-DS are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/139448.html" rel="external">"Myeloid leukemia associated with Down syndrome (ML-DS)"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H232746184"><span class="h1">TRANSIENT ABNORMAL MYELOPOIESIS (TAM)</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H119140297"><span class="h2">Incidence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>TAM occurs predominantly in children with DS or with mosaicism for trisomy 21. The incidence of TAM varies according to the method and timing of evaluation and the diagnostic criteria, which vary among research groups. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below.) </p><p>The incidence of TAM has been estimated at 10 percent, based on small studies that reviewed blood smear morphology of newborns with DS [<a href="#rid20">20-25</a>]. However, TAM may go undetected if a blood smear is not obtained within days of birth [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p>A prospective study detected circulating blasts in 98 percent of 200 neonates with DS (blasts ranged from 1 to 77 percent of nucleated blood cells) [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. This study also reported somatic <em>GATA1</em> mutations in 29 percent of newborns with DS; the presence of &gt;20 percent blasts on a blood smear was invariably associated with <em>GATA1</em> mutation, but <em>GATA1 </em>mutations were detected in only 8.5 percent of patients with &gt;10 percent circulating blasts. The additional 20 percent of DS neonates who had<em> </em>a<em> GATA1</em> mutation, but no clinical or hematologic features of TAM, were described as having "silent TAM." This entity is relevant because affected newborns are at risk of subsequent development of myeloid leukemia associated with DS (ML-DS). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/139448.html" rel="external">"Myeloid leukemia associated with Down syndrome (ML-DS)"</a>.)</p><p>Neonates with trisomy 21 mosaicism, who may not manifest clinical findings of DS, account for 7 to 16 percent of all cases of TAM [<a href="#rid28">28-31</a>]. In rare instances, trisomy 21 may even be limited to the population of blast cells [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H119140309"><span class="h2">Clinical presentation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most cases of TAM are detected soon after birth. The presentation can range from asymptomatic to life-threatening complications. Blood and liver are most often affected, but other organs can be involved. </p><p>Most newborns with TAM display features associated with DS; others may have trisomy 21 mosaicism, as described above. Clinical features of DS are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2917.html" rel="external">"Down syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Asymptomatic</strong> – Asymptomatic presentation (ie, laboratory abnormalities alone) has been reported in 10 to 38 percent of children with TAM. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The Children's Oncology Group (COG) A2971 study reported that 38 percent of the infants with TAM were asymptomatic [<a href="#rid12">12</a>], the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) group reported 10 percent of 146 newborns with TAM did not have clinical findings [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], and the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) 9481 study of 48 infants reported that 25 percent of neonates with TAM were asymptomatic [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Organ involvement</strong> – TAM often presents with involvement of liver, which can manifest as hepatomegaly, ascites, or liver failure. Less often, TAM affects spleen, skin, or other organs and may present with splenomegaly, pleural or pericardial effusions, vesicular skin rash, or other findings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Liver</strong> – Liver is most often affected, with hepatomegaly present in more than half of cases; massive hepatomegaly (extending below the umbilicus) is seen in 10 percent [<a href="#rid2">2,12,33</a>]. The high frequency of liver involvement is thought to reflect the origin of TAM from fetal liver hematopoiesis. (See <a class="local">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Hepatomegaly is a result of megakaryoblast infiltration and/or megakaryoblast-induced hepatic fibrosis. Hepatic involvement can be severe, with liver failure/fibrosis reported in 7 to 15 percent of cases [<a href="#rid2">2,12</a>]. Conjugated bilirubin was elevated in 13 to 63 percent of affected neonates, while alanine transaminase (ALT) was less frequently increased [<a href="#rid2">2,12,33</a>]. Bile stasis can be seen in the bile canaliculi and hepatocytes [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], which corresponds with the frequent elevation of conjugated bilirubin. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Skin</strong> – Skin involvement was reported in 5 percent of cases in the POG 9481 study [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. The rash most often involves the face, but there can be variable involvement anywhere on the body. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The rash is initially vesiculopustular, but it can become confluent and crusted with an erythematous base and it may resemble neonatal varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Biopsy reveals perivascular or dermal blasts and immature myeloid cells with infiltration into the epidermis [<a href="#rid34">34-37</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Other organs</strong> – Spleen, kidney, lungs, and heart can be affected. Splenomegaly was reported in 36 to 44 percent of neonates with TAM, pericardial and pleural effusions in 10 to 23 percent, and ascites in 8 to 21 percent [<a href="#rid2">2,12,33</a>]. Pleural or pericardial effusions due to TAM must be distinguished from those due to heart failure. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>TAM-associated complications</strong> – Severe, life-threatening complications have been reported in 22 to 42 percent of children with TAM [<a href="#rid2">2,11,12,33,38,39</a>]. Hyperleukocytosis, liver failure with coagulopathy, hydrops fetalis, multiorgan failure, ascites, and pleural or pericardial effusions are risk factors for early death, as described below. (See <a class="local">'Criteria for risk stratification of TAM'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Hyperleukocytosis</strong> – White blood cell (WBC) count &gt;100,000/microL (&gt;100 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L) can cause respiratory distress or neurological symptoms due to leukostasis. Hyperleukocytosis constitutes a medical emergency and is an<strong> </strong>indication for urgent treatment. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Liver failure</strong> – Liver failure or complications of liver enlargement (eg, respiratory failure from diaphragmatic elevation or renal failure from hepatorenal syndrome) are the most common cause of fatal complications from TAM [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Liver fibrosis can occur in newborns with few circulating blasts [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. In one study, none of the patients with documented liver fibrosis survived [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Hepatomegaly alone does not constitute an indication for treatment, unless it is accompanied by abnormal liver function.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Heart failure</strong> – Cardiopulmonary failure may be associated with pericardial and pleural effusions and is more prevalent in children with DS and a congenital heart defect [<a href="#rid2">2,11,12,33,38</a>]. Infiltration of the myocardium with myeloblasts has been described in post-mortem studies [<a href="#rid20">20,38</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Only effusions that are not explained by a cardiac cause are an indication for treatment. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Coagulopathy</strong> – Bleeding in infants with TAM may be caused by a coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5915.html" rel="external">"Disseminated intravascular coagulation in infants and children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Abnormal coagulation is seen in 20 percent and DIC in &lt;10 percent of affected children [<a href="#rid2">2,12</a>]. Management of hemorrhage may require platelet transfusions or coagulation factors (eg, fresh frozen plasma for coagulopathy and cryoprecipitate or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="106573" href="/z/d/drug information/106573.html" rel="external">fibrinogen concentrate</a> for severe hypofibrinogenemia). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5915.html" rel="external">"Disseminated intravascular coagulation in infants and children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS)</strong> – TLS, which is caused by massive cell death, can be seen in patients with TAM. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">TLS is characterized by hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, and renal insufficiency. TLS management includes hydration, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13339" href="/z/d/drug information/13339.html" rel="external">allopurinol</a>, and/or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12760" href="/z/d/drug information/12760.html" rel="external">rasburicase</a>, as described separately.
