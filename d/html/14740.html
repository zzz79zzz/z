It has since been modified for treating other mental illnesses, such as eating disorders [<a href="#rid4">4-8</a>]. Treatment of acute, low-weight anorexia nervosa often requires multiple interventions, including psychotherapy such as CBT [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. In addition, CBT can prevent relapse [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews CBT for treating anorexia nervosa.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14704.html" rel="external">"Anorexia nervosa in adults: Clinical features, course of illness, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H260343817"><span class="h2">Assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial clinical evaluation of patients with a possible diagnosis of anorexia nervosa includes a psychiatric and general medical history, mental status and physical examination, and focused laboratory tests [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. If the patient was previously treated with CBT, the clinician should determine which components were beneficial. In addition, the evaluation is used to assess motivation for change and to begin establishing a positive therapeutic relationship with the patient. The general assessment of patients with anorexia nervosa is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14704.html" rel="external">"Anorexia nervosa in adults: Clinical features, course of illness, assessment, and diagnosis", section on 'Assessment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14436547"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT FOR ANOREXIA NERVOSA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>First-line treatment for anorexia nervosa consists of weight restoration with nutritional rehabilitation (including supervised meals and proscribing binge-eating and purging) plus psychotherapy [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. Nutritional rehabilitation aims to restore a structured and consistent meal pattern that typically takes the form of three meals and two snacks per day [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. CBT usually includes nutritional rehabilitation and also addresses dysfunctional thoughts and problematic behaviors that maintain the disorder. Additional information about treating anorexia nervosa, including nutritional rehabilitation, is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14742.html" rel="external">"Anorexia nervosa in adults and adolescents: Nutritional rehabilitation (nutritional support)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14743.html" rel="external">"Anorexia nervosa in adults: Pharmacotherapy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2094.html" rel="external">"Eating disorders: Overview of prevention and treatment", section on 'Anorexia nervosa'</a>.)</p><p>Most acutely underweight patients with anorexia nervosa have symptoms of depressive disorders (eg, dysphoria, anergia, anhedonia, and insomnia) or anxiety disorders. These symptoms often resolve for the majority of patients as they gain weight. If depressive and anxiety disorders persist after weight and physical health (including menstruation) are restored, pharmacotherapy may be indicated. Comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14704.html" rel="external">"Anorexia nervosa in adults: Clinical features, course of illness, assessment, and diagnosis", section on 'Mental disorders'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with severe and enduring anorexia nervosa that persists for many years (eg, more than seven years), the goals of treatment are modified, such that less emphasis is placed upon weight gain and recovery, and more emphasis is placed upon harm reduction and maximizing quality of life and functioning. (See <a class="local">'Goals'</a> below and <a class="local">'Severe and enduring anorexia nervosa'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13320141"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CBT plus other interventions, including nutritional rehabilitation, is indicated for treatment of low-weight patients with anorexia nervosa [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. In addition, CBT is efficacious for preventing relapse [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Use of CBT requires sufficient motivation, cognitive capacity, emotional stability, and energy to participate in therapy and complete agreed upon tasks. It is not clear if there are specific subgroups of patients who benefit most from CBT. The use of CBT for anorexia nervosa is consistent with multiple practice guidelines [<a href="#rid9">9,16,17</a>].</p><p>Contraindications to treating anorexia nervosa with CBT include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>General medical instability (eg, heart rate less than 30 beats per minute)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Suicidal ideation or behavior</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Psychosis</p><p></p><p>Medical instability and suicidality need to be stabilized prior to commencing CBT; psychotic patients are not candidates for most psychotherapies including CBT (concurrent psychosis and anorexia nervosa is rare).</p><p>Although aspects of CBT may be useful for all patients with anorexia nervosa, clinicians should prioritize family therapy for adolescent patients [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. For adult patients, enlisting the support of family members by having a limited number (eg, three to five) of family sessions that provide psychoeducation can be helpful.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13320148"><span class="h1">THEORETICAL FOUNDATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The cognitive-behavioral model of therapy focuses upon the clinical features that maintain anorexia nervosa, rather than the factors that led to onset of the disorder [<a href="#rid8">8,11,18</a>]. The theory is that the cognitive and behavioral disturbances that are present in patients frequently become self-reinforcing and self-perpetuating, and eventually uncoupled from the original factors that cause anorexia nervosa.</p><p>The predominant maintaining mechanisms in anorexia nervosa are problems with self-evaluation and self-esteem, such that patients judge themselves primarily in terms of body weight and shape, and the ability to control them [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Patients pursue thinness because they believe this will provide a sense of control, mastery, and self-worth. These dysfunctional cognitions lead to behavioral problems such that patients restrict the quantity and variety of foods to become thin, and may also overexercise and purge (eg, self-induced vomiting and laxative abuse). Feelings of low self-esteem are mitigated as patients maintain strict dietary rules and a low weight. Starvation leads to increased food preoccupation, which patients view as a threat to controlling food intake; the result is increased efforts to restrict eating. As anorexia nervosa becomes more entrenched, control over eating, thinness, and low weight dominate the patient’s self-concept and sense of effectiveness.</p><p>The CBT model recognizes that predisposing biologic, environmental, and temperament factors increase the risk for developing anorexia nervosa [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>], and that patients can benefit from addressing these factors on a limited basis [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. As an example, the genetics of the disorder are discussed in the psychoeducational component of CBT, and clinicians work with patients to explore their perfectionism, anxiety, mood dysregulation, motivation, and interpersonal problems.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H173160193"><span class="h1">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CBT is a time-limited, structured, manual-based treatment that combines cognitive therapy and behavior therapy, and emphasizes changing dysfunctional cognitions (thoughts and beliefs about body weight and shape) and behavioral disturbances (eg, excessive food restriction) that perpetuate anorexia nervosa [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16424532"><span class="h2">Format and setting</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CBT is included in nearly all day hospital and inpatient programs for anorexia nervosa as one of several interventions and generally administered within group therapy. Outpatient CBT is usually administered as individual (one to one) therapy. Many inpatient and day treatment programs enable patients to gain weight, but continuing outpatient care is nearly always necessary to prevent weight loss and promote more complete resolution of the eating disorder. Outpatients should understand at the outset the clinical conditions that will require more intensive treatment in a partial hospital or inpatient program, and agree to follow the clinician’s recommendations. Alternative treatment for nonresponders is discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a class="local">'Nonresponders'</a> below.)</p><p>At least one session of individual CBT includes both the patient and family members (or significant others) who are regularly involved with the patient. The family meeting is used to discuss the patient’s progress, how the family can help, and identify problems such as negative comments about the patient’s shape or weight. In addition, it may be necessary to involve family members for patients who are deteriorating; this should be discussed and agreed upon at the beginning of therapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16424525"><span class="h2">Therapeutic relationship</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The therapeutic relationship in CBT for anorexia nervosa is based upon clinicians and patients collaborating to resolve the disorder [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Clinicians are generally active in structuring and directing treatment, especially at the beginning. However, the clinician does not lead treatment; rather, the clinician and patient work jointly on each component of treatment. This requires the clinician to be open, empathic, respectful, and flexible.</p><p>Some studies suggest that the therapeutic alliance between the patient and therapist affects treatment outcome [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. As an example, in an eight-month randomized trial that compared CBT with specialist supportive clinical management (n = 63 outpatients), the therapeutic alliance in the two groups was comparable, and follow-up assessments 12 months posttreatment found that a stronger therapeutic alliance was associated with greater improvement in body mass index and eating disorder psychopathology [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H679010935"><span class="h2">Goals</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goals of CBT include [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Weight gain</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Increasing food quantity and variety</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Changing distorted perceptions of body weight and shape</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reducing fears of becoming fat</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reducing the importance of thinness relative to other areas of life, such as family, work, friends, and recreation</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Improving interpersonal relationships</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Understanding the onset and maintenance of the eating disorder</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Developing problem solving skills</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Relapse prevention</p><p></p><p>However, for patients with severe and enduring anorexia nervosa, the goals of treatment are modified, such that less emphasis is placed upon weight gain and symptom recovery, and more emphasis is placed upon engaging patient in treatment, harm reduction, and maximizing quality of life and functioning (see <a class="local">'Severe and enduring anorexia nervosa'</a> below). Minimizing harm is important in this population, given that anorexia nervosa is associated with increased rates of all-cause mortality and suicide. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14704.html" rel="external">"Anorexia nervosa in adults: Clinical features, course of illness, assessment, and diagnosis", section on 'Mortality'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H260343048"><span class="h1">THERAPEUTIC PROTOCOL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For outpatient treatment of anorexia nervosa with individual CBT, we generally use a protocol that consists of four phases delivered in approximately 50 sessions over one year [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Shorter adaptations have been developed [<a href="#rid18">18</a>], but outcomes may be superior with longer treatment [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Although the phases are presented below in a sequence, the actual order is determined by the patient’s symptoms, and many elements (eg, motivational enhancement) are repeated throughout treatment as needed. In addition, if patients begin to lose weight, the focus of therapy returns to weight gain. (See <a class="local">'Weight gain protocol, meal planning, and preventing weight loss'</a> below.)</p><p>Each CBT session follows a structured sequence:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Weight is measured and discussed</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Self-monitoring diary of food intake (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67548" href="/d/graphic/67548.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) is reviewed</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Homework following the last session is reviewed</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Set an agenda for the current session and work on the agenda items</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Agree upon homework to be completed prior to the next session</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Summarize the session</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13320184"><span class="h2">Phase 1: Orientation to treatment and initial procedures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>After the initial assessment, the conceptual framework of CBT is tailored according to the patient’s clinical history to construct a case formulation that provides the rationale for therapy and informs ongoing treatment. The formulation focuses primarily upon cognitive and behavioral disturbances maintaining the eating disorder and secondarily on vulnerability factors that may have contributed to developing anorexia nervosa. Discussing the formulation with patients often helps them organize previously chaotic and poorly understood experiences. This discussion leads to an overview of treatment, in which clinicians explain the:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Principles of CBT</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Need to complete homework (usually daily behavioral experiments) in between sessions</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Logistics, including schedule for sessions and policies for tardiness, missed appointments, emergencies, and payment</p><p></p><p>Following the overview, the first priority generally is to enhance motivation for recovery, which is often an ongoing issue throughout treatment. The next priority is setting treatment goals focused upon normal eating, achieving a healthy weight, and reducing concerns about weight.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H29110781"><span class="h3">Motivation for change</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many patients with anorexia nervosa deny that they are ill and thus are ambivalent about and struggle with changing behavior that is egosyntonic (consistent with their ideal self-image). This ambivalence is addressed with motivational interviewing or enhancement, which first attempts to help patients acknowledge they have a problem, make a commitment to changing their behavior, and take action to change [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>]. Motivational interviewing is used intermittently throughout CBT to manage the patient’s resistance to change.</p><p>Motivational interviewing explores [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>How anorexia nervosa affects the patient’s life (physically, psychologically, and socially)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The function, value, and meaning of the disorder in the patient’s life</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The level of ambivalence about changing illness behaviors</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Goals in life, other than thinness</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Motivations for changing (ie, potential benefits)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The patient’s future without anorexia nervosa</p><p></p><p>Motivational interviewing relies on utilizing a Socratic method (asking questions) to help patients with anorexia nervosa explore and discover their beliefs, to problem solve, and increase their motivation and willingness to experiment with behavioral change. Additional information about motivational interviewing is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14612.html" rel="external">"Overview of psychotherapies", section on 'Motivational interviewing'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H173160068"><span class="h3">Self-monitoring and weight monitoring</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients use a diary (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67548" href="/d/graphic/67548.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) to monitor food intake by recording the food consumed and the location and social context for each meal, snack, and binge episode. In addition, inappropriate compensatory behaviors and thoughts and feelings while eating are recorded. Diary entries are discussed at the following session. For patients who find self-monitoring tedious, it should be adapted to make it valuable and keep patients motivated; the intent is to help patients communicate their experiences between sessions.</p><p>A regular schedule is established for patients to monitor their weight; initially this involves someone’s assistance.

Ultimately, the goal is a healthy weight, which typically requires a BMI ≥20 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>(<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/13478.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>). However, this amount is overwhelming to many patients, and thus a series of more manageable, step-wise weight gain goals is usually established during the course of treatment. As an example, an initial goal of gaining 2 to 3 kilograms is set, and once that is achieved, the next goal is set. The desired outcome is steady weight gain, even if the rate is slow. Weight monitoring is used to track progress with weight gain.</p><p>Developing meal plans can help patients with anorexia nervosa gain weight. The initial focus is upon meeting caloric goals, and caloric intake is gradually increased to enable patients to gain 0.5 to 1.0 kilogram per week. Subsequently greater emphasis is placed upon the quality and variety of food. For clinicians who lack expertise in teaching patients what, how much, and when to eat, we suggest referring the patient to a nutritionist. Self-monitoring is used to track eating and develop normal habits.</p><p>Once patients with anorexia nervosa achieve a healthy weight, treatment focuses upon weight maintenance. Most patients need to eat more than they expect to maintain their target weight. Relapse is thus common because many patients fear that healthy eating will cause excessive weight gain. Old eating patterns may be resumed, leading patients to shave calories, decrease portion size, and skip supplements and added fats (as well as increase exercise). Cutting back soon after restoring a healthy weight inevitably leads to weight loss, which is associated with relapse [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Clinicians should encourage patients to approach weight maintenance as an experiment, using weight monitoring to track weight and gather evidence about what happens if the meal plan is maintained.</p><p>Weight monitoring and self-monitoring are discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a class="local">'Self-monitoring and weight monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13320248"><span class="h3">Behavioral experiments</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with anorexia nervosa, CBT emphasizes experiments with different behaviors between sessions, beginning with actions that lead to healthy eating and weight gain. Subsequently, behavioral experiments address cognitive distortions and interpersonal relationships.</p><p>CBT includes tasks that occur outside of sessions. This “homework” is an integral component of therapy that is discussed and reviewed from session to session. The amount of effort that patients make to complete this work often depends upon how much attention it receives from clinicians. In addition, patients are more likely to value and complete homework that is developed collaboratively. Completed tasks are praised for the effort made, and tasks that are not completed prompt a discussion about the challenges and patient’s motivation.</p><p>The clinician and patient initially generate behavioral experiments to increase both food quantity and variety. In developing meal plans to increase food quantity for a particular meal, patients should not compensate by decreasing the quantity of food at other meals. Experiments to increase food variety begin with patients articulating a hierarchy of forbidden foods. As an example, lettuce may be the least feared food, with progressively more fear attached to cucumbers, apples, and bread, and the most fear attached to ice cream. Patients incorporate small quantities of the least feared foods into their meals and progressively increase the challenge. Failures are addressed during sessions, and successes provide the basis for the next incremental challenge until the food quantity and variety is sufficient to sustain a healthy weight and nutritional health. Success enables the patient to enjoy the range of social experiences involving food.</p><p>Behavioral tasks are subsequently designed to address other aspects of anorexia nervosa, including preoccupation with body weight and shape, excessive exercise, and social isolation. This includes finding alternatives to reading women’s fashion magazines (which often promote thinness as an ideal [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]) and visiting websites and social media that promote anorexia nervosa [<a href="#rid30">30-33</a>], as well as interpersonal challenges such as attending a party or initiating a social activity.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13320255"><span class="h3">Identifying and challenging dysfunctional thoughts</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients are encouraged to examine dysfunctional thoughts about themselves (eg, “I can’t eat anymore or I’ll become fat”) and substitute more functional thoughts (eg, “It’s hard for me to concentrate at work when I don’t eat enough”). This process begins with clinicians initially pointing out cognitive distortions as they emerge and then gradually working with patients to understand how dysfunctional thoughts and associated behavioral disturbances maintain anorexia nervosa. Clinicians typically ask a series of questions that test the logic of the thoughts, which helps patients learn to challenge the validity of maladaptive thoughts, examine the evidence for the thoughts, and explore alternative explanations for their situation. As an example, homework can include testing a faulty cognition by discussing it with friends. In addition, dysfunctional thoughts about body shape and weight are restructured by discussing the importance of shape and weight relative to other areas of life, including family, work, friends, and recreational activities.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13320269"><span class="h3">Addressing body checking and body avoidance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinical features associated with anorexia nervosa include [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Body checking – Excessively evaluating one’s physical appearance by repeatedly weighing oneself, measuring body parts, and looking in the mirror to assess shape</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Body avoidance – Refusing to view one’s physical appearance by refusing to be weighed, avoiding mirrors, and wearing baggy clothes to conceal one’s shape</p><p></p><p>Body checking and body avoidance can perpetuate dietary restraint and body image disturbance (thin patients thinking that they are overweight).

A randomized trial in patients receiving CBT found that a psychotherapy program, which was developed as an add-on treatment to specifically address excessive exercise, provided no additional benefit [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p>It is typically recommended that patients refrain from all exercise until they have maintained a minimum target weight for one to two months.

As an example, patients with anorexia nervosa may believe that they are unlovable, and if a friend declines an invitation to see a movie, it is because the friend views the patient as “no good.” The schema prevents the patient from considering alternative, rational possibilities for the friend’s behavior (eg, the friend has a prior commitment or has already seen the movie).</p><p>For patients with anorexia nervosa who achieve a stable, minimal target weight, clinicians can proceed with schema-based cognitive therapy that focuses upon the overriding belief that self-worth is predicated upon thinness and the ability to control weight. This cognitive schema explains why the psychopathology of anorexia nervosa is egosyntonic (consistent with the patient’s ideal self-image), in contrast to most other mental disorders. Patients with anorexia nervosa choose to starve themselves and maintain a low weight because they overvalue both. The schema operates automatically and without full awareness on the part of the patient, which partially accounts for the stability of the disorder and its resistance to change [<a href="#rid39">39,40</a>].</p><p>Schema-based work aims to make the self-schema (self-worth = thinness) and its assumptions explicit, and then to challenge its maladaptive components [<a href="#rid41">41,42</a>]. One component is the belief that "I am thin and must stay this way because it brings me control, mastery, and makes me special." Therapy attempts to separate the goals of achieving control, mastery, and importance from the means (eg, restricting food intake) used to achieve them. Clinicians support the desire for mastery and self-importance but question whether anorexia nervosa helps patients achieve these goals. The next step consists of finding more adaptive strategies for acquiring a sense of control, enhancing self-worth, and defining oneself.</p><p>In addition to the eating disorder self-schema, CBT addresses other maladaptive schemata involving interpersonal relationships. Patients may believe that they must please everyone, are responsible for a loved one’s problems, do not deserve the love of others, and must avoid conflict at all cost for fear that they will be rejected.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5722141"><span class="h3">Binge-eating and purging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many patients with anorexia nervosa binge eat (ie, eating an amount of food in a discrete period of time that is larger than most people would eat under similar circumstances) and purge (ie, use inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting, abusing laxative and diuretics, or excessive exercise) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Purging should be closely monitored because it increases the risk of medical complications (eg, gastrointestinal problems and electrolyte imbalances), which are exacerbated by low weight. CBT interventions for binge-eating in patients with anorexia nervosa are similar to the interventions used in patients with bulimia nervosa, which are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14746.html" rel="external">"Bulimia nervosa in adults: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)", section on 'Therapeutic techniques and content'</a>.)</p><p>Some patients with anorexia nervosa report subjective binge episodes that do not constitute objective binge-eating. For these patients, CBT focuses upon identifying and challenging the cognitive distortions that transform normal meals and snacks into subjective "binges." Treatment should continue to focus upon eating three meals per day along with snacks, rather than changing the behavior that the patient describes as a binge.</p><p>Inappropriate compensatory behaviors are driven by the same dysfunctional thoughts that drive the excessive dietary restraint of anorexia nervosa, namely, that thinness will provide a sense of control, mastery, and self-worth. Treatment focuses upon exploring the thoughts and behaviors that trigger compensatory behaviors, and patients are encouraged to experiment with changing their behavior so that they can gather accurate information that tests their beliefs.</p><p>Binge-eating, purging, and the medical complications of these behaviors and anorexia nervosa are discussed separately.

Many patients describe low self-esteem; feeling unworthy of love; problems with attachment, dependency, and autonomy in relationships; and excessive dependency and mistrust. The therapeutic relationship between the clinician and patient can be used to explore the patient’s feelings and assumptions about relationships in general. The clinician looks to identify dysfunctional schemas (core beliefs) that patients hold with regard to themselves or relationships and challenges these distortions.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14704.html" rel="external">"Anorexia nervosa in adults: Clinical features, course of illness, assessment, and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The initial clinical evaluation of patients with a possible diagnosis of anorexia nervosa includes a psychiatric and general medical history, mental status and physical examination, and focused laboratory tests. If the patient was previously treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), the clinician should establish which components were beneficial. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14704.html" rel="external">"Anorexia nervosa in adults: Clinical features, course of illness, assessment, and diagnosis", section on 'Assessment'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>CBT plus other interventions, including nutritional rehabilitation, is indicated for treatment of low-weight patients with anorexia nervosa. In addition, CBT is efficacious for preventing relapse. Use of CBT requires sufficient motivation, cognitive capacity, emotional stability, and energy to participate in therapy. Contraindications to CBT include general medical instability, suicidal ideation or behavior, and psychosis. (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> above and <a class="local">'Evidence of efficacy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Overview of treatment for anorexia nervosa'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2094.html" rel="external">"Eating disorders: Overview of prevention and treatment", section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The cognitive-behavioral model of therapy focuses upon the clinical features that maintain anorexia nervosa. The predominant maintaining mechanisms are problems with self-evaluation and self-esteem, such that patients judge themselves primarily in terms of body weight and shape, and the ability to control them. (See <a class="local">'Theoretical foundation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>CBT is a time-limited, structured, manual-based treatment that combines cognitive therapy and behavior therapy, and emphasizes changing current dysfunctional cognitions (thoughts and beliefs about body weight and shape) and behavioral disturbances (eg, excessive food restriction). (See <a class="local">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For outpatient treatment of anorexia nervosa with individual CBT, we generally use a protocol that consists of four phases delivered in approximately 50 sessions over one year. Phase 1 aims to orient patients to treatment, enhance motivation, and introduce self-monitoring. Phase 2 employs interventions to change maladaptive cognitions and behaviors; the primary goal is weight gain and preventing weight loss. Phase 3 addresses the core belief that self-worth is predicated upon thinness and the ability to control weight. Phase 4 focuses upon relapse prevention. (See <a class="local">'Therapeutic protocol'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>CBT can be adapted for severe and enduring anorexia nervosa, such that the principles and structure of CBT are retained, but the goals of treatment shift from weight gain and symptom recovery to harm reduction and maximizing quality of life.
