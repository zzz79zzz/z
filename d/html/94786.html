         Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) comprises a heterogeneous group of aggressive blood cell cancers that arise from clonal expansion of malignant hematopoietic precursor cells in the bone marrow. The leukemic cells interfere with production of normal blood cells, causing weakness, infection, bleeding, and other symptoms and complications.

         AML is the second most common category of leukemia in adults and the most common type of acute leukemia. Nevertheless, AML is relatively rare and it accounts for approximately 1 percent of adult cancers in the United States, but nearly 2 percent of cancer-related deaths [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The median age at diagnosis is approximately 68 years, and the incidence increases with age. There is a modest predominance in men and a higher incidence in non-Hispanic White Americans than other racial and ethnic groups. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4497.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia", section on 'Epidemiology'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         AML has been associated with environmental factors (eg, exposure to chemicals, radiation, tobacco, chemotherapy, retroviruses). In some patients, evolution to AML is preceded by evidence of clonal hematopoiesis manifest as a myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative neoplasms, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, aplastic anemia, clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate prognosis (CHIP), or clonal cytopenia of unknown significance (CCUS). The cause of the underlying somatic mutations is unknown for most cases of AML in adults. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4493.html" rel="external">
          "Acute myeloid leukemia: Pathogenesis"
         </a>

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In rare cases, AML in adults is associated with inherited genetic abnormalities, including mutations or loss of tumor suppressor and/or DNA damage repair genes (eg, trisomy 21; Fanconi anemia; Li-Fraumeni syndrome; Bloom's syndrome; familial mutations of
         <em>
          CEBPA

         ,
         <em>
          RUNX1
         </em>
         ). Familial disorders may be associated with a personal or family history of other hematologic disorders (eg, cytopenias, particularly thrombocytopenia; immune deficiencies), certain cancers and somatic syndromes, or other known genetic variants  (

         AML is a consequence of malignant transformation of myeloid precursor cells. This transformation results in one or more clones of abnormal cells that can proliferate but are blocked in their ability to differentiate into mature blood cells and to undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). AML is maintained by a pool of self-renewing leukemic stem cells or committed progenitor cells that are more immature than the bulk population of leukemic cells. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4493.html" rel="external">
          "Acute myeloid leukemia: Pathogenesis", section on 'Leukemic stem cells'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Specific chromosomal abnormalities can be identified in more than half of cases of AML, including recurrent translocations, rearrangements, and gain or loss of entire chromosomes or portions of chromosomes. Some of these chromosomal translocations generate chimeric (ie, fusion) oncogenes. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4502.html" rel="external">
          "Acute myeloid leukemia: Molecular genetics", section on 'Chromosomal translocations'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Point mutations, gene duplications, and gene deletions that are not detectable with routine karyotyping are seen in the great majority of cases. These also affect genes that regulate growth and/or differentiation. Examples include alterations of genes that encode transcription factors, epigenetic regulators, tumor suppressors, DNA repair, signaling molecules, regulators of apoptosis, and other mechanisms. (See

         Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a distinctive syndrome that should be suspected in patients who present with bleeding or bruising, thrombocytopenia, leukemic blasts with coarse or dense cytoplasmic granules, low white blood cell (WBC) count, hypofibrinogenemia and/or few circulating leukemic cells. APL is a medical emergency that requires distinctive and urgent management. Diagnosis and management of APL are discussed separately. (See

         AML should be suspected in any individual with circulating blast cells (immature myeloid cells), unexplained cytopenias (with or without related symptoms, such as bleeding, weakness, infection), or unexplained metabolic/oncologic emergencies (eg, tumor lysis syndrome, hyperleukocytosis). Patients suspected of having AML should be referred urgently for expert evaluation and management.

         The diagnosis of AML is based on infiltration of bone marrow or peripheral blood by ≥20 percent blasts that manifest characteristic morphologic, cytochemical, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic/molecular features. In some cases, even with &lt;20 percent infiltration of bone marrow or peripheral blood, AML can be diagnosed by the presence of myeloid sarcoma or specific chromosomal and/or molecular abnormalities: inv(16), t(16;16), t(8;21) and t(15;17) (or

         Laboratory studies should include complete blood count (CBC) with differential, coagulation studies, serum chemistries, and viral serologies. Bone marrow examination should include morphology, flow cytometry, karyotype, and molecular analysis to diagnose and classify AML. A chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram or MUGA scan to assess ejection fraction should be performed at baseline. Most patients will require a central venous access catheter. (See

         Older patients are more likely to have comorbid illnesses and adverse prognostic features (eg, prior myelodysplastic syndrome). Older patients are often defined as &gt;60 years of age for clinical trials of AML, but fitness for treatment is not strictly determined by chronologic age. Decisions regarding therapy must consider the goals of care, and the potential treatments available to older adult and/or frail individuals [

         Intensive remission induction therapy can be highly toxic and typically entails hospitalization for several weeks. Toxicities include cytopenias, infections, bleeding/coagulation abnormalities, tumor lysis syndrome, electrolyte imbalances, impaired nutritional status, and other complications. Treatment-related mortality increases with age. (See

         Depending upon age, patient selection, and various prognostic features, 60 to 80 percent of younger adults achieve a CR with such regimens, but only about one-third of patients overall are ultimately cured of AML. For patients who do not clear bone marrow blasts following induction therapy, a second, briefer course of remission induction therapy may be given. Most patients who achieve CR do so after one course of induction therapy, but up to one-third occur after two courses of therapy.

         HCT is preferred for most patients with intermediate or unfavorable prognosis AML, especially for those &lt;60 years of age. When a suitable donor can be identified, allogeneic HCT is preferable to autologous HCT or consolidation chemotherapy alone for these patients. Increasingly, allogeneic transplants using partially HLA-mismatched donors or umbilical cord blood stem cells has expanded the pool of potential donors. Allogeneic HCT induces an important graft-versus-leukemia effect that is not provided by other approaches but is complicated by short- and long-term toxicities, including acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which are countered by immunosuppression and other therapies.

         Patients are followed clinically after achieving complete remission (CR), but there is no consensus regarding an optimal schedule and protocol for monitoring disease status.

         Determining whether a patient in CR is destined to remain clinically disease-free after postremission therapy is limited by the insensitivity of routine tests on the bone marrow for detecting residual leukemia. Techniques employing real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and/or multiparameter flow cytometry are significantly more sensitive for detecting persistent AML and are being increasingly applied in selected clinical scenarios.

         Evaluation includes the pretreatment evaluation described above and should include human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing for all patients who may be candidates for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Decisions regarding further therapy are influenced by an estimation of the likelihood of attaining CR, comorbid illnesses (including active infections), eligibility for allogeneic HCT, and the presence of an appropriate HLA-matched donor. Specific approaches that are used to achieve remission for relapsed refractory AML are discussed separately. (See

         <strong>
          Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
         </strong>
         – AML is the most common acute leukemia in adults. AML comprises a heterogeneous group of cancers of blood cells that arise from genetic and epigenetic changes in hematopoietic stem and/or progenitor cells that exhibit abnormal growth and differentiation.
        </p>

         <strong>
          Clinical presentation
         </strong>
         – Most patients with AML present with findings of cytopenias (eg, fatigue, infections, bleeding), but some exhibit only laboratory abnormalities. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Others present with a clinical emergency, including hyperleukocytosis/leukostasis, tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) and require urgent management. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Complications/emergencies'

         <strong>
          Pathogenesis
         </strong>
         – AML is associated with characteristic non-random chromosomal abnormalities and genetic abnormalities, many of which are used to classify AML and are associated with response to therapy and prognosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Classification'

         <strong>
          Evaluation and diagnosis
         </strong>
         – AML should be suspected in patients with circulating blasts, unexplained cytopenia-related symptoms (eg, bleeding, weakness, infection), and medical complications/emergencies (eg, TLS, DIC). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Evaluation and diagnosis'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Diagnosis typically requires ≥20 percent blasts in marrow or blood, but it can also be established by specific chromosomal and/or molecular abnormalities or presence of a myeloid sarcoma.

         <strong>
          Classification
         </strong>
         – AML should be categorized according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system, based on morphology, immunophenotype, karyotype, molecular features, and clinical features  (

          Goals of care
         </strong>
         – Goal of care require shared decision-making by clinicians and the patient/family. For many patients, achievement of long-term disease control/cure is an appropriate goal. For some patients who are older, frail, or with severe comorbid conditions, lessening symptoms and/or prolonging life may be more appropriate. (See

         <strong>
          Management
         </strong>
         – Treatment decisions are informed by comorbid illnesses, age, AML category, and other factors. AML is rapidly lethal if untreated, but intensive treatment can achieve complete remission (CR) in more than two-thirds of younger adults and ultimately cure approximately one-third.
