         Most nonmalignant esophageal strictures result from long-standing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and management usually involves endoscopic dilation combined with medical therapy with acid-suppression. Some nonmalignant esophageal strictures are related to other underlying conditions such as radiation therapy, caustic ingestion, surgical anastomosis, or dermatologic disease (eg, epidermolysis bullosa, lichen planus, pemphigus). These conditions may result in long and narrow strictures that are more difficult to dilate, and in which dilation may be associated with a higher rate of complications.

         Simple strictures – Simple esophageal strictures are smooth-surfaced, short (&lt;2 cm in length), straight, concentric, and allow the passage of an endoscope (ie, diameter of stricture lumen &gt;10 mm). For example, peptic strictures are usually simple strictures that are related to chronic reflux esophagitis and are located in the distal esophagus.

         The cardinal symptom of an esophageal stricture is dysphagia. However, dysphagia may be caused by conditions other than a nonmalignant stricture, such as reflux esophagitis or infection (eg, esophageal candidiasis). The diagnostic evaluation for patients with dysphagia is discussed separately. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Endoscopic evaluation is performed for all patients prior to dilating an esophageal stricture. In practice, endoscopic visualization and subsequent esophageal stricture dilation are often performed during a single endoscopic session.

         In addition to diagnostic endoscopy, the following tests are obtained for selected patients:

         esophagram (also referred to as barium swallow) – For patients who are at risk for complex strictures (eg, post-radiation therapy, history of caustic ingestion) and for patients in whom a proximal stricture is suspected (eg, history of aspiration, nonacute severe dysphagia with difficulty swallowing liquids), we perform a barium esophagram prior to endoscopic evaluation to establish the location, length, diameter, and number of strictures and to identify associated pathology such as esophageal diverticulum [

         Mucosal biopsies – We do not typically obtain mucosal biopsies from simple strictures prior to endoscopic dilation. However, for patients with complex strictures identified during the initial endoscopy, we obtain biopsies from the stricture to exclude malignancy. If the stricture characteristics are suggestive of malignancy (eg, irregular mucosa, visible tumor), we typically await histology results to establish a diagnosis prior to endoscopic dilation. Endoscopic palliation of esophageal cancer is presented separately. (See

        <p>
         For patients with esophageal strictures in whom eosinophilic esophagitis is suspected (eg, young patients with history of food impaction), we obtain biopsies of the esophagus and the stricture to establish a diagnosis prior to endoscopic intervention. The diagnostic evaluation for patients with suspected eosinophilic esophagitis is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2243.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Mucosal biopsy of the esophagus prior to dilation carries the theoretical risk of causing a lead point for excessive mucosal tearing during dilation. However, limited data and clinical experience have suggested that obtaining mucosal biopsies prior to dilation is not associated with increased risk of complications. In a series of 48 patients who underwent esophageal dilation following mucosal biopsy, no complications related to the mucosal biopsy were observed [

         Large thoracic aortic aneurysm – For patients with a large thoracic aortic aneurysm (aortic diameter &gt;5.5 cm) who require esophageal dilation, we use through-the-scope (TTS) balloon dilators rather than push dilators, while published data to support this preference are lacking. The risk of aneurysm rupture increases with larger aortic diameter, and this is discussed separately. (See

         The goal of endoscopic intervention for patients with nonmalignant esophageal strictures is relief of dysphagia by increasing the diameter of the esophageal lumen [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. For most patients, this can be accomplished with esophageal dilation, although in cases of refractory strictures, additional endoscopic therapy may be required. (See

         The endpoint of dilation is primarily informed by patient symptoms. There is no evidence-based target for maximum luminal diameter following dilation. However, data and clinical experience have suggested that esophageal lumen size generally corresponds to symptoms and oral intake  (

         Number of dilations or size increments performed per session – For simple esophageal strictures, most endoscopists use no more than three push dilators of progressively larger diameter or, if using balloon dilators, no more than three incremental balloon inflation sizes during a single endoscopic session (referred to as the "rule of three"). This widely-accepted practice has been supported by expert consensus with the goal of reducing the risk of complications [

         For push (bougie) dilators, no more than three dilators of progressively increasing diameter are passed in a single session such that luminal diameter should be increased by no more than 2 mm (6 French) during the session (eg, if the initial dilation is performed with a 30 French push dilator, the maximum dilator size that is used should be no more than 36 French).

         For through-the-scope (TTS) balloon dilators, dilation is limited to no more than three incremental balloon inflation sizes (eg, sequential balloon inflations of 10, 11, and 12 mm or 12 to 13.5 to 15 mm).
        </p>

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         For complex strictures that are very narrow (ie, diameter ≤10 mm) and/or long (ie, &gt;2 cm), only one or two balloon dilations of 1 mm each should be performed per endoscopic session.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         However, some advanced endoscopists may perform dilations that exceed the limit of three successive dilators or size increments in one session for selected patients (eg, patients with complete stricture recurrence following initial dilation) [

         Frequency and total number of endoscopic sessions – For patients who require more than one endoscopic session for relief of dysphagia, the duration of time between endoscopic sessions is individualized and depends on the initial stricture diameter, lumen diameter following index dilation, and the patient's symptomatic response [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. For example, patients with a narrow, complex stricture (diameter ≤10 mm) may require multiple endoscopic sessions separated by one- to two-week intervals to achieve a lumen diameter &gt;13 mm. After achieving lumen size &gt;13 mm, the endoscopic sessions can be separated by longer time intervals (&gt;2 weeks).

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In general, the largest dilator used in the previous endoscopic session can be passed first during the subsequent endoscopic session. However, some degree of esophageal restenosis following dilation is expected. Thus, we visualize and reassess the stricture diameter prior to dilation. If there has been restenosis resulting in lumen diameter that is smaller than the largest dilator used during the previous endoscopic session, a smaller dilator is generally required initially.

         Push (bougie) dilators – Push (bougie) dilators are either wire-guided dilators or non-wire-guided dilators (tungsten-filled, weighted rubber bougies). Mechanical tapered push dilators exert both a longitudinal and radial force from the proximal to the distal end of the stricture [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Several versions of wire-guided push (bougie) dilators are available, but the Savary-Gilliard dilator has been commonly used because such dilators are flexible and easy to maneuver [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. The Savary-Gilliard dilator is made from plastic, has a tapered tip, and comes in multiple sizes. A similar system of push dilators is the American Dilatation System.

         Balloon dilators – TTS balloon dilators are passed directly through the biopsy channel of the endoscope and are available in a variety of balloon lengths and diameters. TTS balloon dilators typically provide gradual dilation in 1 to 1.5 mm increments with three sizes per balloon  (

          picture 1

         ). Balloons are inflated by pressure injection of liquid (eg, water) using a hand-held accessory device. Balloon dilators simultaneously deliver the dilating force radially over the entire length of the stricture, thus reducing shear stress.

         The efficacy and safety of wire-guided push (bougie) dilators and TTS balloon dilators have been comparable; thus, the choice of dilator is individualized and based on stricture type (simple or complex), endoscopist's preference, local expertise, and equipment availability. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Outcomes'

        </p>
        <p>
         However, we do not use non-wire-guided push dilators (Maloney dilators) for complex strictures because data have suggested that non-wire-guided push dilators have been associated with higher rates of esophageal perforation. In a study including 348 endoscopic sessions for esophageal dilation, Maloney dilators were associated with higher rates of esophageal perforation compared with balloon or wire-guided dilators (4 versus 0 and 0 percent, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. All perforations occurred when Maloney dilators were passed blindly into complex strictures.
        </p>
        <p>
         In some cases, the patient may be managed using a combination of dilators. As an example, a patient with a narrow distal esophageal stricture that cannot be traversed with the endoscope may undergo initial dilation using a wire-guided or balloon dilator. Once the lumen is sufficiently patent (and if there are no other complex features such as angulation), Maloney dilators may be used for further dilating sessions.

         For simple strictures, wire-guided push dilators can be used with or without fluoroscopic guidance based on endoscopist's preference. Fluoroscopy may help characterize the length and diameter of the stricture, as well as evaluate for fistulous connections with surrounding structures. During placement of the wire into the stomach, fluoroscopic guidance can be useful by demonstrating that the wire has passed through the stricture and has remained straight. However, some endoscopists pass a guidewire through an esophageal stricture using endoscopic visualization only, provided that the path into the stomach can be clearly seen and/or the stricture can be traversed with a smaller caliber gastroscope (outer diameter 5.4 mm) [

         Most esophageal strictures can be successfully dilated to a diameter of 14 mm over ≤5 endoscopic sessions at two-week intervals. Approximately 10 percent of patients with esophageal strictures have persistent dysphagia despite five endoscopic sessions, and such patients require further intervention [

         The diameter of the esophageal lumen following dilation has been associated with requiring fewer dilations and a longer dilation-free period [

          9,24

Some endoscopists use triamcinolone acetonide at concentrations of 20 mg/mL to 40 mg/mL and inject 0.5 mL aliquots. However, it can be difficult to inject a higher concentration of triamcinolone acetonide through a sclerotherapy needle due to its viscosity [

         Metal stents – Fully covered, self-expandable metal stents (FCSEMS) have a thin, flexible delivery catheter that can be easily operated and deployed within the esophagus. The fully covered nature of these metal stents facilitates stent removal, thus permitting their use in nonmalignant disease. FCSEMS are available with or without flared flanges (ie, "dog bone" design). Selection of a specific stent design is generally based on endoscopist's preference and stent availability. To secure the FCSEMS in place and prevent migration, an anchoring method such as endoscopic suturing or an over-the-scope clip may be used [

         Partially covered or uncovered self-expandable metal stents are not used for nonmalignant esophageal strictures because the exposed wire mesh may become embedded in hyperplastic esophageal mucosa and result in recurrent dysphagia [

         Biodegradable stents – Self-expandable biodegradable stents (not available in the United States) have been introduced as an alternative to fully covered metal or plastic stents for treating refractory nonmalignant esophageal strictures. Biodegradable stents are made from woven surgical suture material (polydioxanone) which is degraded by hydrolysis in 8 to 12 weeks. Thus, biodegradable stents do not require endoscopic removal [

Data have also suggested that no specific stent type has been more effective for refractory esophageal strictures. In a meta-analysis of 18 studies including 444 patients with refractory nonmalignant esophageal strictures, the pooled clinical success rate (defined as resolution of dysphagia without needing further intervention) was 41 percent [

         Limited data suggest that biodegradable stent placement may reduce the need for esophageal dilation in the short term for patients with refractory nonmalignant strictures; however, the long-term benefits of this approach are uncertain [

          33,37-41
         </a>
         ]. In a trial of 66 patients with nonmalignant esophageal strictures, patients with biodegradable stent placement required fewer endoscopic dilations during the initial three-month follow-up period compared with dilation alone (median number of dilations, zero versus one), but at six months, the need for dilation was similar in both groups [

         To maximize patient comfort and airway protection, anesthesia for procedures requiring dilation of proximal esophageal stricture is usually administered by an anesthesia clinician. Strictures in the upper esophagus are typically treated by using a dilator that is passed over a guidewire (eg, a Savary-Gilliard dilator) and fluoroscopic guidance. Through-the-scope balloon dilators generally cannot be used in patients with proximal strictures because to do so requires that the endoscope be maintained in the oropharynx during the dilation.

         Endoscopic evaluation is performed for all patients prior to dilating an esophageal stricture. In practice, endoscopic visualization and subsequent esophageal stricture dilation are often performed during a single endoscopic session. (See

         For patients with nonmalignant esophageal strictures, the goal of endoscopic intervention is relief of dysphagia by increasing the diameter of the esophageal lumen. For most patients, this can be accomplished with esophageal dilation. (See

         For simple esophageal strictures, most endoscopists use no more than three push dilators of progressively larger diameter or, if using balloon dilators, no more than three incremental balloon inflation sizes during a single endoscopic session (referred to as the "rule of three"). This widely-accepted practice has been supported by expert consensus with the goal of reducing the risk of complications. (See

         Most esophageal strictures can be successfully dilated to a diameter of 14 mm over ≤5 endoscopic sessions at two-week intervals. Approximately 10 percent of patients with esophageal strictures have persistent dysphagia despite five endoscopic sessions (ie, refractory strictures), and such patients require further intervention. (See
         <a class="local">

         For patients with refractory strictures, we suggest glucocorticoid injection and esophageal dilation rather than serial dilation alone (

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Refractory strictures are those that do not respond to at least five endoscopic dilation sessions. Glucocorticoid injection plus dilation resulted in lower risk of stricture recurrence and fewer endoscopic dilation sessions to achieve stricture resolution. (See
         <a class="local">
