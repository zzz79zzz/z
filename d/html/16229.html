Compared with the more common lateral ankle sprain, the high ankle sprain causes pain more proximally, just above the ankle joint, and is associated more often with significant morbidity. Diagnosis can be difficult and clinicians should consider the possibility of syndesmotic injury in athletes with pain or injury around the ankle or lower leg. Treatment too is different from typical ankle sprains and surgery may be necessary, making recognition important for optimal recovery.</p><p>The risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of high ankle sprains in the absence of any associated fracture is reviewed here. The common ankle sprain and other ankle-related injuries are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/189.html" rel="external">"Ankle sprain in adults: Evaluation and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6525.html" rel="external">"Foot and ankle pain in the active child or skeletally immature adolescent: Evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/227.html" rel="external">"Ankle fractures in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13793.html" rel="external">"Overview of foot anatomy and biomechanics and assessment of foot pain in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/190.html" rel="external">"Achilles tendinopathy and tendon rupture"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16375.html" rel="external">"Non-Achilles ankle tendinopathy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/82957.html" rel="external">"Talus fractures"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H36233261"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>High ankle sprains are much less common than the typical lateral ankle sprain. Using clinical diagnostic criteria (ie, not radiologic), the largest observational studies report that high ankle sprains comprise approximately 6 percent of acute ankle sprains without fracture. The incidence in the United States is 2.09 injuries per 100,000 person-years [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The incidence in United States collegiate American football players is about 2.5 per 10,000 athletic exposures [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p>In the general population presenting to an emergency department, 5.7 percent of acute ankle sprains without fracture are high ankle sprains [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. At the United States Military Academy, 6.7 percent of acute ankle injuries involve the syndesmosis, with an incidence rate of 4.8 per 1000 person-years [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. A smaller study at the Academy found 16 percent of acute ankle sprains involve the syndesmosis [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The incidence reported in other subpopulations varies widely. High ankle sprains comprised 4 percent of all acute ankle sprains among professional English soccer players [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], 24.6 percent among American college football players [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], and 73 percent among professional American hockey players [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Other studies confirm the relatively high rates among American football players and participants in other contact sports [<a href="#rid2">2,10</a>], especially wrestling and ice hockey [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The high, rigid ankle support of a hockey skate, which transfers forces proximally along the leg, likely plays a role in the higher rate of syndesmotic injury among hockey players, although the actual incidence is unlikely to be as high as that reported in the study cited above.</p><p>Among studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate injury patterns, prospective studies of acute ankle injuries without fracture presenting to emergency departments reported syndesmotic injuries in 8 to 13 percent of injuries [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. In other subpopulations, the proportion of acute ankle injuries with syndesmotic injury varies from 20 to 60 percent [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. This wide range is likely due to inconsistencies in the literature related to the different subpopulations studied. As examples, some studies have looked only at winter athletes while others include only patients with "severe" ankle sprains. </p><p>Risk factors for high ankle sprain in athletes include sports competition (higher rate than practice) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>], male sex (2.25- to 3-fold risk) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>] and intercollegiate sport participation (2.4-fold risk) [<a href="#rid5">5,15</a>]. Whether playing surface contributes to injury risk remains unclear [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Of major sports, American football, basketball, football (soccer), and lacrosse are most commonly involved [<a href="#rid10">10,15</a>]. Game play conferred a 14-fold risk compared with practice among American college football players, among whom 75 percent of injuries involved contact with another player [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Winter sports involving use of skis and skates may increase risk [<a href="#rid9">9,13</a>], presumably due to the high-energy external rotation forces exerted on the lower leg.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H36233267"><span class="h1">CLINICAL ANATOMY AND BIOMECHANICS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The bony ankle joint is comprised of the tibia and fibula articulating with the talus. Together the tibia and fibula comprise the ceiling, or "plafond," of the ankle joint, and the notch formed by this ceiling and the medial and lateral malleoli is called the mortise. Approximately 85 percent of body weight is supported by the tibia and the remainder by the fibula. Ligamentous stability is provided proximally by the ligaments comprising the tibiofibular syndesmosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77999" href="/z/d/graphic/77999.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101967" href="/z/d/graphic/101967.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>); laterally by the anterior talofibular ligament, calcaneofibular ligament (CFL), and posterior talofibular ligament (PTFL)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78924" href="/z/d/graphic/78924.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72462" href="/z/d/graphic/72462.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>); medially by the broad deltoid ligament  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61079" href="/z/d/graphic/61079.html" rel="external">figure 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51952" href="/z/d/graphic/51952.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>); and circumferentially by the joint capsule. Ankle anatomy is reviewed in greater detail separately; the tibiofibular syndesmosis and other structures of direct relevance to high ankle sprains are discussed below. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/227.html" rel="external">"Ankle fractures in adults", section on 'Clinical anatomy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16375.html" rel="external">"Non-Achilles ankle tendinopathy"</a>.)</p><p>A syndesmosis is defined as a fibrous joint formed by two adjacent bones linked by strong membranes or ligaments  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101843" href="/z/d/graphic/101843.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). The distal lateral tibia has a concavity of varying depth—the incisura tibialis—that houses the convex distal medial fibula. The tibiofibular contact zone is 3 to 9 mm long and 2 to 5 mm wide, and each surface is covered with thin hyaline cartilage continuous with that of the plafond. The distal or inferior tibiofibular syndesmosis is comprised of four ligamentous structures: the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL; sometimes referred to as the anterior tibiofibular ligament), the posterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (PITFL; sometimes referred to as the posterior tibiofibular ligament), the transverse ligament, and the interosseous membrane (IOM).</p><p>The wide, trapezoid-shaped AITFL is located immediately superior to the anterior mortise and traverses obliquely in a posteroinferior orientation from the tibia to the fibula. Approximately 20 percent of the inferior edge of the ligament is intraarticular. The similarly shaped PITFL is located immediately superior to the posterior mortise and traverses obliquely anteroinferiorly from the tibia to the fibula. Its lower part, the transverse ligament, is considered a separate structure and is a round, thick ligament that runs more horizontally from tibia to fibula. The IOM is of variable size and can be absent in some persons. It spans from tibia to fibula along a 2-cm length, lying between the AITFL and PITFL and blending into both [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p>The syndesmosis provides proximal stability to the ankle joint. It is strong but not completely rigid and normally has a small degree of motion. The IOM is more elastic and may act as a "spring" giving the syndesmosis slight flexibility during the late-stance phase of walking when the foot is dorsiflexed, bringing the widest part of the talus into the ankle mortise. The other ligaments provide more rigid stability at the endpoints of this movement [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The AITFL provides approximately 35 percent of this stability, 33 percent is provided by the transverse ligament, 22 percent by the IOM, and 9 percent by the PITFL [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. When the ankle is fully dorsiflexed, the syndesmosis is placed in tension, and when external rotation is added to this, these ligaments are placed at greater risk of rupture.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H36233273"><span class="h1">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>High ankle sprains typically occur during high-intensity athletic activities such as competitive American football, rugby, basketball, soccer (football), lacrosse, hockey, and other contact or collision sports, and downhill skiing. Player contact accounts for 46 to 75 percent of high ankle sprains [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. An external rotation or eversion force applied to a dorsiflexed ankle is the most common mechanism. This can happen when the leg is rotated forcefully against a planted foot or toe. Most such injuries occur during contact with other athletes either when the athlete is standing and the foot is forced into dorsiflexion and external rotation  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101955" href="/z/d/graphic/101955.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>), or when the athlete is prone on the ground and another athlete steps or lands on their posterior leg while the foot is externally rotated [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Other possible mechanisms may include abduction (lateral shift) or eversion (lateral tilt) of the foot, or hyper-dorsiflexion at the ankle [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p>In all mechanisms, the lateral force of the talus pressed against the distal fibula applies tension across the syndesmosis. This tension causes a sequence of injuries depending upon the degree of force involved. Rupture of the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL) is the first injury, followed by a tear of the IOM, and, rarely, the posterior inferior tibiofibular ligament PITFL. If the force causing the injury is sufficiently great, there may also be disruption of the deltoid ligament medially, a spiral fracture of the proximal fibula (Maisonneuve fracture  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80672" href="/z/d/graphic/80672.html" rel="external">image 1</a>)), or both. In cadaver studies where the syndesmotic ligaments are sectioned and the foot placed in various positions of stress, isolated AITFL rupture resulted in the fibula externally rotating and sometimes displacing posteriorly [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. However, weight-bearing did not increase the degree of displacement in these studies.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H36233279"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND EXAMINATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26135173"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The patient with a high ankle sprain typically describes a clear injury to the ankle. Some may recall a mechanism involving forceful external rotation or eversion of a dorsiflexed ankle, as described immediately above. In an observational study with 26 high ankle sprains, an ankle eversion mechanism correlated closely with syndesmotic injury [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Pain is usually focused along the anterolateral ankle but may be more diffuse and severe if medial ligaments are disrupted. Athletes with milder injuries may be able to continue playing through the pain, but often with reduced speed and agility. Those with more severe injuries are usually unable to continue sport activity due to severe pain with weight bearing.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26135179"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>On examination, common findings in patients with a high ankle sprain include antalgic gait or inability to bear weight, lateral and possibly anterior ankle edema, as well as tenderness over the anterior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66111" href="/z/d/graphic/66111.html" rel="external">picture 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102840" href="/z/d/graphic/102840.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>) and possibly more proximally along the interosseous membrane (IOM). According to a small prospective study using MRI as the gold standard, local tenderness over the syndesmosis ligaments had a sensitivity of 92 percent and specificity of 29 percent for syndesmotic injury [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Medial and lateral ankle ligaments may be tender depending on the extent of injury.</p><p>Bony tenderness may indicate fracture. At a minimum, bony palpation should include the proximal fibula, distal tibia and fibula, and talus. In patients with severe pain and disability, it is reasonable to obtain plain radiographs to assess for fracture prior to performing any further examination maneuvers.</p><p>To the extent possible based on the patient's symptoms and injuries, ankle range of motion and strength should be assessed in all planes of ankle motion (dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, inversion, and eversion). Stability testing should include tests of the lateral ankle ligaments, including the drawer test for the anterior talofibular ligament  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58891" href="/z/d/graphic/58891.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>) and the talar tilt test for the calcaneofibular ligament (CFL)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51938" href="/z/d/graphic/51938.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>). Neurovascular status should be assessed to determine the presence of complications and associated conditions.</p><p>Tests of the syndesmosis include the single-leg hop, squeeze, dorsiflexion-external rotation, Cotton, and fibular translation tests. Systematic reviews of clinical tests for ankle syndesmosis injury found that clinicians cannot rely on any single diagnostic maneuver to definitively diagnose syndesmosis injury [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. However, a prospective, blinded study of 87 patients with acute syndesmosis injury confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that a combination of sensitive signs (tenderness over the AITFL, inability to perform a single-leg hop, and a painful dorsiflexion-external rotation test) plus one specific sign (painful squeeze test) resulted in a high degree of diagnostic accuracy [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. We believe that performing this combination of four tests is a sensible approach to the examination when syndesmotic injury is a major consideration. However, if this approach is unrevealing but clinical suspicion remains high, it is best to perform diagnostic imaging.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26135185"><span class="h2">Special tests</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H36233285"><span class="h3">Dorsiflexion-external rotation test</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The dorsiflexion-external rotation test reproduces pain at the syndesmosis by recreating the forces involved in a common mechanism of injury  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107748" href="/z/d/graphic/107748.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>). It is performed with the patient seated and the leg hanging off the examination table at a 90-degree angle. The leg is stabilized by grasping the upper calf or front of the knee with one hand. The other hand grasps the foot, dorsiflexes the ankle to its endpoint, and then gently but firmly externally rotates the foot. During foot rotation the knee should remain facing forward. Pain reproduced at the AITFL location is considered a positive test [<a href="#rid19">19,24,26</a>]. In isolation, this maneuver showed a sensitivity of 71 percent and specificity of 63 percent in a prospective study of 87 patients of whom 38 had a syndesmotic injury [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. It is best used in conjunction with another sign with high sensitivity, such as localized tenderness over the AITFL, to "rule out" a syndesmosis injury if the test is negative.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H36233291"><span class="h3">Squeeze test</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The squeeze test attempts to reproduce pain at the syndesmosis. It is performed with the patient seated and the leg hanging off the examination table at a 90-degree angle  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102841" href="/z/d/graphic/102841.html" rel="external">picture 7</a>). The examiner squeezes the upper half of the calf in an anteromedial-to-posterolateral direction. Biomechanically, this maneuver causes widening of the distal tibiofibular space. Pain reproduced at the AITFL location is considered a positive test [<a href="#rid20">20,27</a>]. In isolation, this test showed a sensitivity of 26 percent and specificity of 88 percent in a prospective study of 87 patients of whom 38 had a syndesmotic injury [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Given its high specificity, it is best used to "rule in" a syndesmosis injury after other signs with higher sensitivity are found to be positive. </p><p>Other tests include fibular translation and talar translation maneuvers. However, these examination tests have not been rigorously tested for sensitivity, specificity, or clinical accuracy [<a href="#rid28">28</a>] and have poor interrater reliability [<a href="#rid24">24</a>], and therefore are not recommended.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H36233309"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H36233316"><span class="h2">Approach to imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Standard plain radiographs of the ankle  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86799" href="/z/d/graphic/86799.html" rel="external">image 2</a>) are recommended for the evaluation of suspected high ankle sprains due to the association of this injury with joint instability. In acute ankle injury, the Ottawa criteria should be used to determine who warrants evaluation with radiographs. However, regardless of these criteria, if the dorsiflexion-external rotation test is performed prior to imaging and elicits pain, indicating possible syndesmotic injury, plain radiographs should be obtained because a positive test is associated with ankle fracture and diastasis may be apparent on radiograph [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Guidance about the views to obtain and how to assess them is provided below. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/189.html" rel="external">"Ankle sprain in adults: Evaluation and diagnosis", section on 'Ottawa ankle rules'</a> and <a class="local">'Plain radiographs'</a> below and <a class="local">'Dorsiflexion-external rotation test'</a> above.)</p><p>If plain radiographs identify diastasis (see <a class="local">'Plain radiographs'</a> below) between the distal tibia and fibula but no fracture, a grade 3 syndesmotic injury is present and the patient is referred to an orthopedic surgeon for management.

All unstable injuries and complex fractures require orthopedic referral. The evaluation and management of ankle and leg fractures are discussed separately.

(See <a class="local">'Distinguishing between grade 1 and grade 2 injuries'</a> below.)</p><p>Stress radiographs are of uncertain usefulness; decisions about whether to obtain them should be deferred to surgical consultants. Musculoskeletal ultrasound appears to be an accurate tool for determining injury grade, although published evidence is limited, and study quality depends upon the skill of the clinician performing the examination. Another approach is to forego additional imaging if concern about major injury is relatively low based on the clinical assessment and to allow the patient a trial of conservative therapy following an appropriate period of immobilization. Alternatively, when there is greater concern for a more severe (ie, grade 2) injury or a definitive diagnosis is required (eg, high demand sport or occupation), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study can be obtained. MRI is the best advanced imaging technique for assessing high ankle sprain severity and detecting concomitant injury. However, a clear relationship between MRI findings and clinical outcomes has yet to be established in patients with grade 2 injuries. (See <a class="local">'Stress radiographs'</a> below and <a class="local">'Ultrasound (US)'</a> below and <a class="local">'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)'</a> below.)</p><p>Computed tomography (CT) may have some value for detecting occult fractures and syndesmotic injury, but it is not as useful as MRI for detecting soft tissue injury [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].

Bilateral weight-bearing views are optimal in order to increase the sensitivity for ligamentous instability, but these may cause too much pain to obtain [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. AP and lateral views of the entire tibia and fibula should be obtained if there is tenderness proximal to the malleoli. Plain radiographs will detect most ankle and leg fractures but are less sensitive for detecting injuries to the syndesmosis, even when tibiofibular diastasis is present [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p>In addition to identifying fractures, clinicians should assess radiographs carefully for signs of ligamentous instability, which may require surgical management. Widely used but poorly validated parameters (best evaluated on the mortise view  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66441" href="/z/d/graphic/66441.html" rel="external">image 3</a>)) are the width of the medial clear space (MCS) (the distance between the medial border of the talus and the lateral border of the medial malleolus measured 5 mm below the talar dome)  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74769" href="/z/d/graphic/74769.html" rel="external">image 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef132673" href="/z/d/graphic/132673.html" rel="external">image 5</a>) and the tibiofibular clear space (TFCS) (the distance between the posterolateral tibia and medial fibula measured 10 mm above the tibial articular surface)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103263" href="/z/d/graphic/103263.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>) [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Based on small studies using MRI correlation, a TFCS on a mortise view radiograph greater than 5.3 mm in non-weight-bearing subjects is approximately 82 percent sensitive and 75 percent specific for syndesmotic injury, and a MCS greater than 2.8 mm is approximately 73 percent sensitive and 59 percent specific for syndesmotic injury and instability [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Any widening of the MCS should be viewed as significant and likely involves concomitant rupture of the deltoid ligaments  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74769" href="/z/d/graphic/74769.html" rel="external">image 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef132673" href="/z/d/graphic/132673.html" rel="external">image 5</a>).

Relative widening of the TFCS of 2 mm or more compared with the uninjured side is suggestive of unstable syndesmotic injury [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. While absolute distance of the TFCS exceeding 6 mm was traditionally the main determinant of syndesmosis widening [<a href="#rid34">34</a>], this is a poor predictor of syndesmotic injury and need for surgical management, as it can miss up to 57 percent of unstable syndesmotic injuries [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. There is significant individual and gender variation in the absolute clear space distance in uninjured ankles, so absolute distance is less useful than relative difference [<a href="#rid36">36-38</a>].

Stress images are obtained by applying a standard external rotation force of 7.5 N to the ankle in neutral position and obtaining an AP or mortise view.

High ankle sprains are suspected when a person (usually an athlete) sustains an injury by a mechanism involving forced dorsiflexion and external rotation or eversion of the ankle and complains of pain just proximal to the ankle joint. Pain is usually present along the lateral half of the distal leg, but not as distal or lateral as the more common anterior talofibular ligament and calcaneofibular ligament (CFL) injuries. Sensitive findings include inability to perform a single-leg hop, localized tenderness over the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL), and pain at that location induced by the dorsiflexion-external rotation test. Pain at the syndesmosis with the squeeze test is a specific finding. Radiographs are obtained to rule out fracture and frank syndesmotic diastasis. MRI is obtained when a definitive diagnosis is required or the extent of injury must be determined, as concomitant injuries are frequently present. Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) are useful when MRI is not available.

Tenderness is present at the medial ankle just distal to the medial malleolus.

Tenderness may occur in the same location as the syndesmosis but is more often isolated to the joint line just at or distal to the AITFL. Pain is reproduced by forced ankle dorsiflexion, which impinges the injured Bassett's ligament between the talus and ankle plafond. No signs of instability of the syndesmosis are apparent on radiographs.

By this time, most swelling has resolved and more definitive protection or immobilization can be used. The patient should be immobilized initially with a removable fracture boot that prevents any ankle motion, using crutches for non-weight-bearing or partial weight-bearing as determined by pain and the clinical scenario, for one to three weeks [<a href="#rid50">50,51</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H36233487"><span class="h2">Rehabilitation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once partial weight-bearing is painless, the patient may progress to full weight-bearing. Weekly follow-up with the treating physician is recommended in order to determine the earliest safe time to discontinue immobilization. Once the fracture boot is discontinued, we suggest early referral to physical therapy to expedite functional recovery. However, protection should be maintained for several weeks using an off-the-shelf stirrup brace or articulated ankle-foot orthosis during weightbearing activity until full function is regained.</p><p>High quality evidence pertaining to physical therapy for syndesmotic injury is limited, but one prospective observational study involving 60 consecutive high level United States collegiate athletes with a clinical diagnosis of high ankle sprain describes the aggressive, accelerated implementation of a standard treatment protocol that resulted in a rapid return to play (average 13.4 days) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. All participants had radiographs showing no fracture or diastasis, and the rehabilitation program required close supervision in the training room. Athletes were immobilized and kept non-weight-bearing for only four days. On days 4 to 5 they began partial weight-bearing while protected with an ankle brace and performed range of motion, isometric strength, and light proprioceptive exercises. From day 6 onward they performed full weight-bearing and continued progressive motion, strength, and proprioceptive exercise. When they were able to perform 10 single-leg hops on their toes without noticeable difficulty, they were allowed to begin progressive functional and sport-specific training while protected in an ankle splint. During their return to sport, athletes had their ankles taped and wore an ankle splint for protection. Fifty-three of the 60 athletes treated were polled six or more months after injury, and 66 percent rated their outcome as "excellent," while the other 34 percent rated it as "good."</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H36233493"><span class="h2">Surgical treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Those patients with acute grade 2 or grade 3 injuries treated with surgery undergo reduction of the syndesmosis and fixation with cortical screws or suture buttons. Surgical technique depends on any concomitant fractures, concomitant ligament injuries (eg, deltoid ligament), surgeon preference, and patient needs [<a href="#rid51">51,54</a>]. Subacute injuries (six weeks to six months) with instability typically undergo ligament reconstruction and syndesmosis fixation, whereas chronic injuries (older than six months) are often treated with syndesmotic fusion [<a href="#rid54">54</a>].

No difference in ankle function or symptoms at long-term follow-up was noted in one small retrospective study of patients who developed HO, but ankles with HO were associated with higher rates of recurrent lateral ankle sprain [<a href="#rid55">55</a>].</p><p>Chronic ankle symptoms such as pain, stiffness, and swelling occur in approximately 20 to 40 percent of patients, even after a grade 1 high ankle sprain [<a href="#rid6">6,55</a>].

In a 2022 meta-analysis, the mean time for return to sport was 52 days, with an average of 39.3 days in patients treated nonsurgically and 70.9 days in those requiring surgical repair.

In a prospective study of 20 Division I American collegiate football players with clinically diagnosed, stable, high ankle sprains, the mean time for RTP was 15.5 days (range 2 to 30 days) [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]. If ultrasound showed an intact AITFL, RTP averaged 3.3 days; if ultrasound showed a ruptured AITFL, RTP averaged 19 days. Length of tenderness along the interosseous membrane (IOM) also correlated with RTP, with players whose tenderness extended more proximally requiring more time before RTP.</p><p>Close supervision by athletic trainers or physical therapists and frequent follow-up likely minimizes the time needed for recovery.

Players with involvement of only the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL) missed two practices and 0.25 games on average. Players with involvement of the AITFL and IOM missed 8.2 practices and 1.6 games. Players with injured AITFL, IOM, and posterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (PITFL) missed 21.1 practices and 3.8 games.

Syndesmotic ankle injury is much less common than the typical ankle sprain but is associated more often with significant morbidity and the need for surgical treatment. Syndesmotic injury is more common among athletes playing high level sport. Participants in American football and ice hockey appear to be at increased risk. Relevant ankle anatomy is reviewed in the text. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above and <a class="local">'Clinical anatomy and biomechanics'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mechanism of injury</strong> – Syndesmotic ankle injury typically occurs during high-intensity athletic activities such as American football, soccer (football), ice hockey, and other contact sports, and downhill skiing. An external rotation force applied to a dorsiflexed ankle is the most common mechanism. This can happen when the leg is rotated forcefully against a planted foot or toe. Most injuries occur during contact with other athletes either when the athlete is standing and the foot is forced into dorsiflexion and external rotation  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101955" href="/z/d/graphic/101955.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>), or when the athlete is prone on the ground and another athlete steps or lands on their posterior leg while the foot is externally rotated. (See <a class="local">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>History and examination</strong> – Pain is usually focused along the anterolateral ankle but may be more diffuse and severe if medial ligaments are disrupted. Athletes with severe injuries are usually unable to continue activity due to severe pain with any weight bearing. Common findings include antalgic gait or inability to bear weight, lateral and possibly anterior ankle edema, and tenderness over the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66111" href="/z/d/graphic/66111.html" rel="external">picture 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102840" href="/z/d/graphic/102840.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>) and possibly more proximally along the interosseous membrane (IOM). Sensitive signs for syndesmotic injury include tenderness over the AITFL, inability to perform a single-leg hop, and a painful dorsiflexion-external rotation test. A painful squeeze test is a specific finding  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102841" href="/z/d/graphic/102841.html" rel="external">picture 7</a>). (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation and examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic imaging</strong> – Plain radiographs of the ankle are the initial studies obtained if a syndesmotic injury is suspected. If plain radiographs identify a fracture or diastasis between the distal tibia and fibula but no fracture (ie, grade 3 syndesmotic injury), the patient is referred to an orthopedic surgeon. The best approach to subsequent imaging for patients with a clinical diagnosis but normal plain radiographs remains controversial.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Stress radiographs are of uncertain usefulness and decisions whether to obtain them should be deferred to surgical consultants. Musculoskeletal ultrasound appears to be accurate for determining injury grade. When there is concern for a severe injury, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study is the best technique for assessing sprain severity and detecting concomitant injury. (See <a class="local">'Injury grade'</a> above and <a class="local">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above and <a class="local">'Approach to imaging'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – An algorithm summarizing our approach to diagnosis and management is provided  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef122417" href="/z/d/graphic/122417.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Definitive diagnosis is made by MRI, but this is often unnecessary, and a clinical diagnosis can generally be made based on the history and examination findings. Distinguishing between grade 1 (partial tear of AITFL; treated conservatively) and grade 2 (complete tear of AITFL; generally treated surgically) injuries can be difficult. Evidence pertaining directly to the evaluation of these injuries is limited and any of several reasonable approaches may be used. These are described in the text. (See <a class="local">'Distinguishing between grade 1 and grade 2 injuries'</a> above and <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications for surgical referral</strong> – Referral to a knowledgeable orthopedic surgeon is indicated for grade 2 and grade 3 syndesmosis injuries and any grade 1 injury associated with a fracture. (See <a class="local">'Indications for orthopedic consult or referral'</a> above and <a class="local">'Injury grade'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> – The differential diagnosis for syndesmotic injury includes ankle fracture (eg, fibula, tibia, talus), ligament sprain (eg, ATFL, CFL, PITFL, deltoid), anterior ankle impingement, and acute compartment syndrome of the leg (a surgical emergency). Key clinical features that help to distinguish among these diagnoses are provided in the text. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/358.html" rel="external">"Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – Basic initial care, including non-weightbearing, is provided for all injuries. Subsequent management depends upon the extent of injury  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef122417" href="/z/d/graphic/122417.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Isolated grade 1 injuries are treated with physical therapy; injuries of grade 2 or 3 and those associated with fractures or other significant soft tissue injury are referred to an orthopedic surgeon.
