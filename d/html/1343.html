The mechanism by which stress induces these lesions is unclear. It has been speculated that this might be the disease entity responsible for historical descriptions of religious stigmata.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of psychogenic purpura are discussed here. Related discussions are presented in separate topic reviews:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Approach to a suspected bleeding disorder</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1367.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with a suspected bleeding disorder"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis of von Willebrand disease</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1307.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of von Willebrand disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) </strong>– (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14826.html" rel="external">"Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) in adults: Terminology, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Somatic symptom and related disorders</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112997.html" rel="external">"Somatic symptom disorder: Assessment and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4028891896"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY AND GENERAL CONCEPTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Psychogenic purpura describes one or more episodes of purpura (confluent areas of superficial, non-blanching skin bleeding) that are not due to an underlying bleeding disorder or trauma to the affected area. Images are included with the discussion below. (See <a class="local">'Painful purpura'</a> below.)</p><p>Psychogenic purpura is a diagnosis of exclusion. Before making the diagnosis, clinicians should rule out bleeding disorders; skin, soft tissue, and vascular conditions; trauma; and self-inflicted injury due to psychiatric conditions. The extent of the evaluation is individualized depending on the severity of bleeding and other patient characteristics, as described below. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Clinicians may reasonably wonder when the diagnosis of psychogenic purpura is appropriate, given that it is extremely rare and unexplained. There is no simple answer, as the condition is poorly understood. However, there is a reasonably well-stereotyped syndrome described in the literature and we believe this is an appropriate diagnosis in rare, selected cases that match the patterns discussed herein and are not explained by another diagnosis. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Psychogenic purpura is not classified by name in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and it does not fit any broad DSM-5 diagnosis. The following psychiatric disorders may help in conceptualizing the underpinnings of some cases of psychogenic purpura, although this is not meant to imply that patients with psychogenic purpura require a psychiatric diagnosis:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>"Conversion-like disorder"</strong> – Psychogenic purpura shares features with functional neurological symptom disorders (conversion disorders), which are classified in the DSM-5 as disorders with one or more neurologic symptoms that are incompatible with a medical or neurologic disease. Examples include psychogenic nonepileptic seizures or functional movement disorders. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Psychogenic purpura does not have neurologic features and thus does not meet the definition of functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder). However, psychogenic purpura manifests in clinical signs that are presumed not to be intentionally produced by the patient, and its mechanism of action is unknown. Thus, psychogenic purpura can be understood as a "conversion-like disorder." </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">While stress is part of the definition of psychogenic purpura, proximate stressors are no longer seen as necessary to the manifestation or diagnosis of functional neurological symptom disorder. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14826.html" rel="external">"Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) in adults: Terminology, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/85765.html" rel="external">"Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) in adults: Clinical features, assessment, and comorbidity"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Somatic symptom and illness anxiety disorders</strong> – Psychogenic purpura may sometimes have features<em> </em>that overlap with somatic symptom disorder (SSD). SSD is defined by maladaptive illness behaviors rather than by the absence of a discernable etiology. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112997.html" rel="external">"Somatic symptom disorder: Assessment and diagnosis"</a> and <a class="local">'Level of distress and/or psychiatric comorbidities'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The overlap between psychogenic purpura and somatic symptom and illness anxiety disorders may be observed at the differential diagnosis or postdiagnosis stage of care. In somatic symptom disorder, a provider might note and separately address distress (cosmetic concern, pain response) that is disproportionate to objective signs or far in excess of that seem of most "typical" patients. In illness anxiety disorder, the provider's attention would be drawn to a patient's excessive fears about underlying causes of the illness or need for caution to avoid injury.</p><p></p><p>In functional neurological symptom disorder, patients are no more or less distressed by their symptoms than patients with analogous organic diagnoses. In contrast, somatic symptom and illness anxiety disorders are defined by the nature and expression of patients' illness behaviors. Some individuals with psychogenic purpura are distressed by their symptoms and others are not (or appear not to be). (See <a class="local">'Level of distress and/or psychiatric comorbidities'</a> below.)</p><p>If there is strong suspicion or proof that the patient is intentionally producing symptoms or signs for immaterial or material gain, their presentation should be identified as factitious disorder or malingering, respectively, rather than psychogenic purpura. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>It may be useful to think of psychogenic purpura analogously with other conditions in which physical changes are documented in individuals who have no underlying medical etiology for these findings.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pseudocyesis</strong> – Pseudocyesis (also called false pregnancy) refers to the appearance of signs and symptoms of pregnancy in an individual who is not pregnant; it is classified in DSM-5 under somatic symptom and related disorders. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14201.html" rel="external">"Pseudocyesis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Stress-induced (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy</strong> – Stress-induced cardiomyopathy (including takotsubo cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome) refers to transient global left ventricular dysfunction in the absence of significant coronary artery disease or other explanations for wall motion abnormalities. Like psychogenic purpura, takotsubo cardiomyopathy may be caused by emotional or physical stress. Unlike psychogenic purpura, takotsubo cardiomyopathy has a proposed mechanism involving catecholamine effects. Stress-induced cardiomyopathy is not classified in the DSM-5. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3494.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of stress (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1762871174"><span class="h1">POSSIBLE MECHANISMS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pathophysiology of psychogenic purpura is not understood, and the rarity of the condition and lack of preclinical model systems make studies of its mechanisms difficult to conduct. It is even difficult to definitively state that psychogenic purpura is a homogenous category rather than the observed manifestation of multiple different pathophysiologies. Nonetheless, stress-induced hemostatic changes and immunologic effects may play a role [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1613083593"><span class="h2">Hemostatic changes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is possible that psychologic stress alters the levels of certain proteins involved in the hemostatic process. The following observations apply generally to hemostasis and are not specific to psychogenic purpura:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stress-induced increases in endogenous glucocorticoids are known to occur [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], and therapeutic doses of glucocorticoids are known to cause thinning of the skin and increased skin bleeding. However, changes in circulating glucocorticoid levels have not been demonstrated in psychogenic purpura, and the timing of steroid-induced cutaneous atrophy in individuals on long-term glucocorticoid therapy does not match with the rapid appearance of purpura seen in psychogenic purpura. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7988.html" rel="external">"Major adverse effects of systemic glucocorticoids", section on 'Dermatologic effects and appearance'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Antifibrinolytic proteins such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) may contribute to bleeding. In one report, an increased intradermal tPA concentration could be shown in immunoassays of sites of psychogenic purpura [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. There is speculation that tPA release from endothelial cells is triggered by neuropeptides in the skin [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. However, the patients in some case reports that demonstrated fibrinolytic defects also described significant bleeding (eg, joint bleeding), calling into question that the diagnosis was actually psychogenic purpura [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF) have been observed to increase when an individual is under stress (physiologic or emotional). This change would be expected to <strong>reduce</strong> rather than increase bleeding. However, it raises the possibility that other coagulation factors might be co-regulated in the opposite direction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1307.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of von Willebrand disease", section on 'Repeat testing in individuals with borderline or discordant clinical and laboratory findings'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A few case reports have described abnormal platelet aggregation studies in individuals with psychogenic purpura. As an example, a publication from 2005 described a 16-year-old female with menorrhagia and episodic painful bruising on the neck and back [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Platelet function studies revealed a prolonged closure time to epinephrine on platelet function assay (PFA)-100 testing and impaired platelet aggregation to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and collagen. She was treated with estrogen-containing oral contraceptives and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">desmopressin</a> (DDAVP), and symptoms improved. One year later she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Unusual abnormalities of platelet function might underlie some cases of psychogenic purpura and suggest possible directions for future research.</p><p></p><p>None of these observations fully explain the appearance of purpura in individuals under psychologic or physiologic stress. The contribution of psychiatric disorders to psychogenic purpura also remains unclear.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3631115350"><span class="h2">Histologic findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Biopsy findings have not clarified the pathophysiology of psychogenic purpura and are rarely helpful in evaluating or treating individuals with unexplained purpura, and we do not perform biopsies in suspected psychogenic purpura unless there is another indication. (See <a class="local">'Skin testing (generally not recommended)'</a> below.)</p><p>However, case reports have described histopathology of skin lesions, which may help explain the underlying process. Biopsies have shown intradermal hemorrhage and various degrees of edema with scant perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In the Mayo Clinic series, 28 individuals underwent skin biopsy [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The most common finding was dermal, epidermal, or subcutaneous hemorrhage. Other patients had signs of nonspecific inflammation and other nonspecific findings. We do not advocate biopsy unless there is an alternative diagnosis that is likely enough to justify a biopsy. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3158556669"><span class="h2">"Autoerythrocyte sensitization" or immune changes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The phrase "autoerythrocyte sensitization" refers to the mechanism that Gardner and Diamond originally ascribed to psychogenic purpura in which there appeared to be sensitivity to extravasated red blood cells that resulted in a painful ecchymotic area [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. They performed intradermal injection of autologous blood or washed autologous red blood cells, which resulted in an ecchymotic lesion, whereas injection of control blood (eg, from an allogeneic donor or even animal blood) or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> did not [<a href="#rid9">9-11</a>]. We do not support this mechanism.</p><p>This finding has been observed in some subsequent case reports and found to be absent in others. Further testing of immune sensitivity such as searches for autoantibodies or cytotoxic T-lymphocytes directed against the individual's own erythrocytes have never been detected. Thus, the phenomenon of immune sensitivity to autologous erythrocytes remains a theoretical idea with limited to no evidence of an actual causal relationship.</p><p>One case report described painful ecchymoses in a 22-year-old female who had the symptoms for approximately seven years and experienced an exacerbation when a copper-containing intrauterine device (IUD) was placed [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. There was a strong family history of atopy. Immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels were increased with her initial episode of purpura. After the IUD was placed, she had frequent episodes of purpura, and intradermal injection of her own blood caused an immediate pruritic wheal and flare, followed by pain after six hours, followed by a bruise that resembled spontaneous bruises. Bruising ceased after the IUD was removed.</p><p>A number of other mechanisms and disorders have been postulated as underlying or exacerbating psychogenic purpura. However, because these have been reported infrequently, their relationship to psychogenic purpura may be completely coincidental. It is also possible that the symptoms in these individuals were due to an underlying bleeding disorder rather than psychogenic purpura. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H115184349"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The true incidence of psychogenic purpura is unknown, but the condition is thought to be extremely rare. Most available information comes from case reports and very small series. In a review of patients seen at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota from 1976 to 2016, only 76 cases were identified over a period of 40 years [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Many clinicians believe psychogenic purpura is most likely to occur in White women, but this has not been rigorously evaluated. The majority of cases reported were in females, although cases in males have been reported. (See <a class="local">'Patient characteristics'</a> below.)</p><p>The typical age is in adolescence or early adulthood. Occasionally, older individuals or children with the condition have been described, such as a series of six girls referred to the Hospital for Sick Children in Ontario, Canada over a five-year period [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2605144798"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FINDINGS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1720939937"><span class="h2">Patient characteristics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is no typical or classic presentation of psychogenic purpura. Many affected individuals are White females; however, the disorder has also been described in children, adolescents, and adult males [<a href="#rid6">6,13-24</a>].</p><p>In many cases, affected individuals appear to have severe or acute emotional stress, although this is speculative. Affected individuals may have one or more concomitant psychiatric diagnoses; however, not all affected individuals have a psychiatric condition. (See <a class="local">'Assessment for psychiatric disorders (all patients)'</a> below.)</p><p>Most cases of religious stigmata appear to have occurred in individuals of the Roman Catholic faith. Many are members of Catholic religious orders, and 90 percent are female. Well-known historical cases demonstrating religious stigmata might include Saint Catherine of Siena and Saint Francis of Assisi. In historical yet questionable reports of religious stigmata, the term "religious ecstasy" was used to describe the individual's condition, which some have regarded as an acute psychotic state. Other cases, however, are believed to be "pious fraud" [<a href="#rid3">3,25-27</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1362863336"><span class="h2">Bruising pattern</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is no typical bleeding pattern that characterizes psychogenic purpura. However, certain features such as painful purpura are consistent with the diagnosis, whereas others, such as petechiae, internal bleeding (eg, bleeding occurring in joints, muscles, or visceral organs), or abnormalities of hemostatic testing, are inconsistent with psychogenic purpura. (See <a class="local">'Painful purpura'</a> below and <a class="local">'Findings that are inconsistent with the disorder'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H111179309"><span class="h3">Painful purpura</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Painful purpuric lesions are the characteristic finding in psychogenic purpura  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105524" href="/d/graphic/105524.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). These include ecchymoses (bruises) and/or cutaneous hematomas, with bleeding into the skin or an edematous reaction sufficient to cause induration or a raised area. In many cases, patients have described a sensation of burning, stinging, or pain some hours or up to a day before the appearance of the skin lesions [<a href="#rid2">2,28</a>]. It is also possible that the lesions cause discomfort that is not reported by the patient as pain.</p><p>The lesions generally appear as confluent areas of purpura of various sizes; some can be quite large (taking up the entire ventral thigh) whereas others are smaller (similar to the size of a thumbprint). In some cases, skin folds and hair follicles may be spared  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109195" href="/d/graphic/109195.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. The lesions are not at sites of trauma (if they were, they would likely be attributed to injury of self-harm). Pain and swelling may be sufficiently severe to cause immobilization of the affected extremity. However, if the extremity is immobilized due to hemarthrosis, a bleeding disorder is probably present, not psychogenic purpura. (See <a class="local">'Findings that are inconsistent with the disorder'</a> below.)</p><p>Purpura, which is due to extravasated red blood cells, should be distinguished from erythema, which may reflect flushing or hives caused by dilated arterioles and/or localized swelling; flushing and hives are much more clearly linked to emotional discomfort or stress. In some cases, purpura may be accompanied by local inflammation, but inflammation in the absence of purpura is not consistent with the diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2782.html" rel="external">"Approach to flushing in adults", section on 'Emotional flushing'</a> and <a class="local">'Findings that are inconsistent with the disorder'</a> below.)</p><p>The bleeding lesions in patients with psychogenic purpura often occur on the extremities rather than the trunk or back; occasionally, they are seen on the head. Some observers have likened them to "religious stigmata," a term that refers to bleeding and/or sensations of pain in locations corresponding to the crucifixion wounds of Jesus Christ [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. These include wounds from nails in the hands and feet and from a lance in the side. Other reports include wounds to the forehead ("crown of thorns"), tears of blood or sweating blood, wounds to the back as from whipping, or wounds to the shoulder as from bearing a cross [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H441501041"><span class="h3">Time-course and natural history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>According to some patients, bruises occur either spontaneously or after trauma or surgery at other sites of the body. One patient, for example, had a wrist fracture and a subsequent carpal tunnel syndrome requiring intervention [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. This was accompanied by severe emotional disturbance; spontaneous bruises began three weeks later on the same arm and hand. While some patients can describe the exact onset of purpura, others are unable to do so even after precise questioning.</p><p>The resolution of purpura depends on the size of the lesions, the extent of extravasated blood, and whether new bleeding is superimposed on older bleeding. Typically, resolution takes days to weeks.</p><p>The overall time-course and chronicity of the disorder is variable. Some individuals have a single episode that resolves and does not recur [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Others have lesions at all times or episodes of recurrent lesions that come and go over the course of years (chronic or relapsing and remitting). In the series from the Mayo Clinic, 28 individuals had follow-up information available in the medical record for a year or more [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

However, such descriptions are highly subject to recall bias and reporting bias, and the role of a triggering event (psychologic or physical) is not well characterized.

However, the presence or amount of stress cannot be used to support or refute the diagnosis because stress is also a marker of many of the other conditions in the differential diagnosis of psychogenic purpura including abuse and psychiatric disorders. (See <a class="local">'Terminology and general concepts'</a> above and <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>In one documented case, a large area of "bruising" was noted over the patient's chest when told of hospital discharge that she considered premature; the lesions' area reduced significantly within hours of the patient being told that discharge was postponed [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. In another case, a 16-year-old began having bruising during a period of time when her mother lived in a different city and the patient was sexually abused by her father [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The distinction between traumatic stress and downstream physiologic consequences of stress is not always straightforward. It is also possible for stress to serve as a trigger for self-harming behaviors, factitious disorder, or factitious disorder by proxy.

In the series of 76 patients from the Mayo Clinic, 21 had results of autoerythrocyte skin testing reported, and results were very mixed [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The testing was positive in eight, negative in eight, and inconclusive in five. In an earlier series of 71 patients from University Hospitals of Cleveland, the authors reported that the proportion of positive tests declined after they began to lose confidence in the test's validity, perhaps reflecting the patients' inference that the test results were not well correlated with the syndrome [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>We do not use this test, and we recommend that it not be used in the evaluation. Other means of making the diagnosis of psychogenic purpura such as those discussed above, all of which depend on clinical judgment, should be used.</p><p>The test involves injection of approximately 0.1 mL of the patient's blood and a control (animal blood, blood from another individual, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a>) into the patient's skin (intradermally) and observation for the development of purpura around the injected autologous blood but not the control.

The intensity of the evaluation is tailored to the patient's presentation, as discussed above (see <a class="local">'Evaluation'</a> above). In general, diagnosis of one of these conditions is sufficient to exclude the diagnosis of psychogenic purpura.</p><p>Like psychogenic purpura, individuals with bleeding disorders may report a history of surgery or trauma (a bleeding challenge) prior to the initial bleeding episode, and bleeding may not become clinically apparent until adolescence or adulthood. Like some bleeding disorders, initial tests of hemostasis (prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], and platelet count) may be normal in some cases.</p><p>Unlike psychogenic purpura, bleeding disorders generally cause bleeding with trauma or invasive procedures, and spontaneous serious bleeding (mucosal, gastrointestinal, joint, or deep tissue bleeding) can occur. In bleeding disorders, laboratory testing eventually reveals the type of hemostatic defect, even if initial screening tests were unrevealing. In inherited bleeding disorders, the family history may be positive, and in acquired bleeding disorders, there is often an underlying disease responsible (eg, rheumatic, connective tissue, or malignant disorder).</p><p>Details of specific bleeding disorders and the testing that identifies them are summarized above and outlined in more detail in separate topic reviews.

If presenting at the behest of others (eg, a parent), one should be sure to interview them alone and nonjudgmentally inquire about possible involuntary or "compulsive" self-injury.

In malingering, illness is feigned or exaggerated for an external, tangible incentive (substances, housing/hospitalization, disability benefits).
