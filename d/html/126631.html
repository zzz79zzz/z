However, some of these cancers may also benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. The magnitude of benefit from chemotherapy depends on the baseline risk of recurrence, which may be estimated from clinical features including the stage and grade of the tumor, as well as biologic features of the tumor, including gene expression. Key aspects of the decision-making are discussed here.</p><p>Other relevant topics, including the choice of chemotherapy for hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer; endocrine therapy for HR-positive breast cancers; neoadjuvant management of HR-positive breast cancers; and prognostic and predictive factors in early breast cancer, are discussed elsewhere.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/788.html" rel="external">"Selection and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/749.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant endocrine and targeted therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/120706.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/98345.html" rel="external">"Neoadjuvant management of newly diagnosed hormone-positive breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/122902.html" rel="external">"Choice of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/782.html" rel="external">"Prognostic and predictive factors in early, non-metastatic breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1377199206"><span class="h1">BENEFITS AND RISKS OF ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Overall, adjuvant chemotherapy decreases risk of recurrence and improves survival, but the absolute benefits in patients with a low risk of recurrence may be small. Therefore, the decision to offer chemotherapy must take into account risk factors of the disease as well as patient age and comorbidities. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/788.html" rel="external">"Selection and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer", section on 'Indications for treatment'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/788.html" rel="external">"Selection and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer", section on 'Older women'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4252365215"><span class="h2">Benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The data to support adjuvant chemotherapy (versus no treatment) and specifically, the administration of anthracycline and taxane therapy in the adjuvant setting come from the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG).</p><p>In the 2012 EBCTCG meta-analysis, the use of an anthracycline-containing regimen compared with no treatment resulted in the following outcomes [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decreased risk of recurrence from 47 to 39 percent (relative risk [RR] 0.73, 95% CI 0.68-0.79)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decreased breast cancer mortality from 36 to 29 percent (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72-0.85)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decreased overall mortality from 40 to 35 percent (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.78-0.91)</p><p></p><p>Compared with no treatment, the use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a> (CMF) was also associated with comparable improvement in these outcomes at 10 years. Outcomes according to tumor receptor status were not available, in this analysis. A comparison of CMF and anthracycline-containing regimens is described elsewhere.

Immunosuppression associated with chemotherapy may also lead to severe infections in some. Taxanes are associated with neuropathy, which generally resolves weeks to months after treatment, but may be incomplete in severe cases. Longer-term toxicities also include the risks of cardiotoxicity associated with anthracyclines and the rare risk of chemotherapy-related leukemia [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Additionally, the Amsterdam 70-gene profile (MammaPrint) may be useful in select cases [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. However, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network is more conservative, noting that although several <strong>prognostic</strong> assays are available to estimate recurrence risk, only the RS has been validated for <strong>predicting</strong> the benefit of adding adjuvant chemotherapy to further reduce the risk of recurrence [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Recurrence Score'</a> below and <a class="local">'Other genomic tests'</a> below.)</p><p>Further information on prognostic versus predictive factors is found elsewhere.

The prognostic and predictive value of these assays in regard to response to chemotherapy is discussed in the sections below. A separate discussion regarding their utility in predicting response to extended endocrine therapy is found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/749.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant endocrine and targeted therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer", section on 'Duration of endocrine treatment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1715922606"><span class="h1">NODE-NEGATIVE DISEASE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1228888552"><span class="h2">Approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among patients with node-negative, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative disease, our approach to decisions regarding chemotherapy is as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with T1aN0 disease, we typically do not administer chemotherapy, as these patients have an excellent prognosis with endocrine therapy alone. As such, we do not obtain a gene expression profile in these patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We use gene expression profiles in women in whom the decision regarding whether or not to use chemotherapy is unclear. For example, we typically use gene expression profiles to guide decisions regarding chemotherapy in patients with T1b to T3, node-negative tumors  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131640" href="/d/graphic/131640.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).

We do not use gene expression profiles, as the primary role of these assays is to determine which clinical situations warrant chemotherapy, and in these situations, the results would not alter management. This might include patients with absolute contraindications to chemotherapy due to baseline health concerns or frailty, or women who for other reasons will not consider chemotherapy.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H846681548"><span class="h2">Preferred gene expression profile</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1211153993"><span class="h3">Recurrence Score</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among the gene expression profiles, the Oncotype DX 21-gene Recurrence Score (RS) is the most well validated, providing a prognostic signature for outcome with endocrine therapy alone and a predictive signature for whether chemotherapy reduces recurrence. The RS was developed by identifying the 250 most promising candidate genes described in the literature [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Investigators then used a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-based method for generating quantitative expression levels of these genes in fixed tissue from 447 patients collected from three datasets. A mathematic formula that includes 16 genes (plus five reference genes) was then generated to optimize prediction of distant relapse despite <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a> therapy. The sum of this calculation is known as the RS.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H620968788"><span class="h4">Validation in node-negative, HR-positive disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The RS has been validated both as a prognostic as well as a predictive tool, by which to identify those patients with node-negative, hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer whose prognosis is so favorable that the absolute benefit of chemotherapy is likely to be very low. Patients with ER-positive cancers that are node negative derive substantial benefit from chemotherapy if the 21-gene RS is high (typically ≥26). By contrast, if the score is low or midrange (≤25), there is no benefit to adding chemotherapy to endocrine treatment for women &gt;50 years old, although younger women may experience some benefit  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131640" href="/d/graphic/131640.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Special considerations for those with intermediate RS'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15781.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient following treatment for breast cancer", section on 'Components of follow-up'</a>.)</p><p>The RS has been prospectively validated as a prognostic tool [<a href="#rid22">22-24</a>]. For example, the TAILORx study evaluated outcomes in 9719 women with HR-positive, HER2-negative, T1 to T2 axillary node-negative breast cancer [<a href="#rid20">20,22,23</a>]. At nine years:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among approximately 1600 women with low RS (≤10), all of whom received endocrine therapy without chemotherapy, the rate of invasive disease-free survival (DFS) at nine years was 84 percent [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among 6700 women with midrange RS (11 to 25), those randomly assigned to endocrine therapy alone had the same invasive DFS outcomes as those randomized to chemotherapy and endocrine therapy (83 versus 84 percent at nine years; hazard ratio 1.08, 95% CI 0.94-1.24) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Rates of distant recurrence and overall survival (OS) were also similar between both groups (95 and 94 percent, for endocrine versus chemoendocrine therapy, respectively).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among almost 1400 women with a high RS (≥26), all of whom received chemotherapy (typically taxane- and/or anthracycline-containing regimens), the invasive DFS was 76 percent at nine years, and the rate of freedom from distant recurrence was 87 percent [<a href="#rid20">20,25</a>]. These results are better than what has been observed in other trials of endocrine therapy alone in similar patients (60 to 70 percent for invasive distant recurrence-free survival rates, in the initial validation studies of the RS assay) [<a href="#rid18">18,26</a>]. Observational data also support an OS benefit for the addition of chemotherapy to endocrine therapy in this subset [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p></p><p>Although the TAILORx trial did not include patients with T3 tumors, the RxPonder trial, discussed below, did include this subset. (See <a class="local">'Node-positive disease'</a> below.)</p><p>The overall results from TAILORx are similar to those from the PlanB trial [<a href="#rid22">22</a>], as well as earlier retrospective evaluations of the NSABP B-20 clinical trial specimens ("prospective-retrospective" studies) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. In the NSABP B20 trial including 651 patients, the addition of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a>, plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a> (CMF) to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a> resulted in a higher rate of distant DFS at 10 years among patients with a high RS (&gt;30) compared with treatment with tamoxifen alone (88 versus 60 percent, respectively; relative risk 0.26, 95% CI 0.13-0.53) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. However, there was no evidence of a benefit with the addition of CMF among those with a low (&lt;18) or an intermediate RS (19 to 30). It should be noted that the cutoff for low, intermediate, and high RS differed between the TAILORx and NSABP B-20 studies.</p><p>It has been argued that RS can be supplanted by improvements in pathologic grading and quantitative HR scoring. However, the NSABP B-20 study suggests that this may not be true.

At the other end of the risk spectrum, most women with stage III breast cancers will warrant adjuvant chemotherapy because of their risk of recurrence and the likely benefits of chemotherapy treatment. The majority of cases of ER-positive breast cancer fall in between these two extremes, and decisions regarding the addition of chemotherapy to adjuvant endocrine therapy are individualized based on patient and disease factors. (See <a class="local">'Clinical features that guide the use of chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Node-negative disease</strong> – For patients who are candidates for chemotherapy and have T1b to T3, node-negative, HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors, we use the Oncotype DX 21-gene Recurrence Score (RS) to guide adjuvant chemotherapy decisions. Although the RS is the most well-validated and widely used assay in the United States, we note that other assays (eg, the Predictor Analysis of Microarray 50 [PAM50]) may also be acceptable. (See <a class="local">'Overview of gene expression profiles'</a> above and <a class="local">'Other genomic tests'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For women with HR-positive, HER2-negative, node-negative breast cancer  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131640" href="/d/graphic/131640.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Who are of any age and have an RS ≤15, or for those &gt;50 years with an RS ≤25, we typically suggest <strong>not</strong> using chemotherapy (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Who are ≤50 years and whose RS is 16 to 25, some UpToDate experts do not suggest chemotherapy (instead opting for the addition of ovarian suppression to endocrine therapies for premenopausal women in this subset who have high-risk factors for recurrence). Other UpToDate experts suggest chemotherapy to select patients in this subset, particularly those who have either high-intermediate scores (21 to 25) or high clinical risk.

Some contributors suggest chemotherapy, given demonstrated benefit to this approach from a randomized trial, and lack of available data regarding ovarian suppression as an alternative; others use a gene expression profile to guide treatment decisions (offering ovarian suppression with aromatase inhibition for RS ≤25, and chemotherapy for RS ≥26). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Choice of chemotherapy regimen</strong> – Discussion on the selection of chemotherapy regimen and its administration is found elsewhere.
