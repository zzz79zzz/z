Persistent viral infection with high-risk HPV genotypes causes virtually all cancers of the cervix. The high-risk HPV genotypes (or "types") 16 and 18 cause approximately 70 percent of all cervical cancers worldwide, and types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 cause an additional 20 percent. HPV types 16 and 18 also cause nearly 90 percent of anal cancers and a significant proportion of oropharyngeal cancer, vulvar and vaginal cancer, and penile cancer. HPV types 6 and 11 cause approximately 90 percent of anogenital warts. </p><p>Vaccines have been developed to protect against acquisition of HPV infection and development of subsequent HPV-associated disease. This topic will cover issues related to routine immunization recommendations, vaccination in special patient populations, and vaccine safety. </p><p>The natural history, epidemiology, and disease associations of HPV infection and virology of HPV are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8314.html" rel="external">"Human papillomavirus infections: Epidemiology and disease associations"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8031.html" rel="external">"Virology of human papillomavirus infections and the link to cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5967752"><span class="h1">AVAILABLE VACCINES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Three different vaccines, which vary in the number of HPV types they contain and target, have been clinically developed, although not all are available in all locations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Human papillomavirus quadrivalent vaccine (Gardasil) targets HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="98713" href="/d/drug information/98713.html" rel="external">Human papillomavirus 9-valent vaccine</a> (Gardasil 9) targets the same HPV types as the quadrivalent vaccine (6, 11, 16, and 18) as well as types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8779" href="/d/drug information/8779.html" rel="external">Human papillomavirus bivalent vaccine</a> (Cervarix) targets HPV types 16 and 18.

In the United States, the 9-valent vaccine is specifically approved for prevention of cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, oropharyngeal, and other head and neck cancers, anogenital precancerous and dysplastic lesions, and genital warts in females and for prevention of anal, oropharyngeal, and other head and neck cancers, anal precancerous and dysplastic lesions, and genital warts in males [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p>Therapeutic vaccines, designed to induce regression of existing HPV-associated lesions, are in development but are not clinically available [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H812147299"><span class="h1">RATIONALE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1124668043"><span class="h2">Females</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Vaccination with human papillomavirus 9-valent, human papillomavirus quadrivalent, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8779" href="/d/drug information/8779.html" rel="external">human papillomavirus bivalent vaccine</a> provides a direct benefit to female recipients by safely protecting against cancers that can result from persistent HPV infection. This preventive effect is most notable and best studied with cervical cancer, which is one of the most common female cancers worldwide. HPV types 16 and 18, which are targeted by all three HPV vaccines, cause approximately 70 percent of all cervical cancers worldwide, and HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, which are additionally targeted by the 9-valent vaccine, cause an additional 20 percent. HPV types 16 and 18 also cause nearly 90 percent of anal cancers and a substantial proportion of vaginal, vulvar, and oropharyngeal cancers. Vaccination with the quadrivalent or 9-valent HPV vaccine also protects against anogenital warts (90 percent of which are caused by HPV types 6 and 11); although they are benign lesions, they are associated with physical and psychological morbidity and have a high rate of treatment failure. The adverse effects of HPV vaccination are generally limited to mild local reactions. Vaccine efficacy and safety are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Efficacy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Vaccine safety'</a> below.) </p><p>Details on HPV-associated diseases and the burden of HPV infection among females are found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8314.html" rel="external">"Human papillomavirus infections: Epidemiology and disease associations"</a>.)</p><p>Various modeling studies have outlined the potential benefits of HPV vaccination, which appear to be cost effective for the recommended age range [<a href="#rid3">3-7</a>]. One study suggested that vaccination of the entire United States population of 12-year-old girls would annually prevent more than 200,000 HPV infections, 100,000 abnormal cervical cytology examinations, and 3300 cases of cervical cancer if cervical cancer screening continued as currently recommended [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In settings where there has been high uptake of vaccine among females there is also evidence of herd immunity among males of similar age, reflected by a reduction in genital warts [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2421053152"><span class="h2">Males</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HPV vaccination provides a direct benefit to male recipients by safely protecting against cancers that can result from persistent HPV infection. HPV types 16 and 18 cause nearly 90 percent of anal cancers and substantial proportion of oropharyngeal and penile cancers. Vaccination with human papillomavirus 9-valent or human papillomavirus quadrivalent vaccine also protects against anogenital warts (90 percent of which are caused by HPV types 6 and 11). The overall burden of HPV-associated cancers and precancers among males is less than the burden of cervical cancer in females. Nevertheless, despite a smaller direct absolute benefit of HPV vaccination in males compared with females, the overall benefit of vaccinating males outweighs its potential risks because of additional population benefits from herd immunity and the documented safety of HPV vaccines. (See <a class="local">'Vaccine safety'</a> below and <a class="local">'Efficacy'</a> below.). </p><p>Details on HPV-associated diseases and the burden of HPV infection among males are found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8314.html" rel="external">"Human papillomavirus infections: Epidemiology and disease associations"</a>.)</p><p>Various models have indicated that vaccinating both males and females is more beneficial in reducing HPV infection and disease than by vaccinating only females, although male vaccination is less cost effective than female vaccination [<a href="#rid9">9-15</a>]. However, cost-effectiveness analyses are limited by uncertainty regarding different variables that affect the impact of male vaccination. These include vaccine efficacy and duration of protection, vaccine coverage of females, the effect of herd immunity, the range of health outcomes included, and the effect of HPV-associated diseases on quality of life [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. </p><p>In particular, models have found that the cost-effectiveness of male vaccination is higher in the setting of lower levels of female coverage. This is because there would be less herd protection from female vaccination, and thus males would have more direct benefit from vaccination. In one study that used population data from the Netherlands, the burden of HPV-associated cancers in males could be reduced by an estimated 37 and 66 percent if vaccine uptake among girls and young women reached 60 and 90 percent, respectively, but vaccine uptake among females is considerably less than 60 percent in many locations [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Furthermore, even if vaccine uptake were sufficiently high among females to confer protection against males, this would have minimal effect on men who have sex with men, who have substantially higher rates of HPV-associated anal cancer and precursor lesions than heterosexual males. </p><p>In resource-limited settings, expert groups recommend that public health efforts focus primarily on vaccinating young females, the group in which the absolute benefit and cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination is the highest. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4034047598"><span class="h1">ADMINISTRATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4094871935"><span class="h2">Indications and age range</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In accordance with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in the United States, we recommend routine HPV vaccination for all females and males in the following age ranges [<a href="#rid17">17-20</a>]: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Routine HPV vaccination is recommended at 11 to 12 years. It can be administered starting at 9 years of age.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For adolescents and adults aged 13 to 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the vaccine series, catch-up vaccination is recommended. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For adults 27 years and older, catch-up vaccination is not routinely recommended; the ACIP notes that the decision to vaccinate people in this age group should be made on an individual basis. The likelihood of prior exposure to HPV vaccine types increases with age, and thus the population benefit and cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination is lower among older patients [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. However, for some individuals in this age group, such as those with no prior sexual experience or with a limited number of prior sexual partners, the risk of prior HPV exposure may be very low. We offer HPV vaccination to such individuals if they are deemed to have a future risk of HPV exposure (eg, expected new sexual partners). Although supporting data are limited, we also suggest HPV vaccination for health care workers who may be at risk for occupational exposure to HPV, even if they are older than 26 years. (See <a class="local">'Health care workers at risk for occupational exposure'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Studies have suggested that HPV vaccination is immunogenic, efficacious, and safe in females older than 25 years [<a href="#rid22">22-25</a>]. However, clinicians and patients should be aware that HPV vaccination of individuals older than 26 years may not be covered by insurance providers or other payers, and this may affect the decision to vaccinate. In the United States, the HPV vaccine is approved through age 45. It is possible that some individuals over the age of 45 years may also benefit from vaccination, but the benefit has not been well studied, and reimbursement for vaccination of such individuals is even less likely. </p><p></p><p>These recommendations are largely consistent with those of other expert groups in the United States and Europe, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Cancer Society (ACS), and the International Papillomavirus Society [<a href="#rid26">26-32</a>]. These are also largely consistent with recommendations for resource-rich settings from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines on cervical cancer prevention [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. However, the ACS specifically encourages clinicians to start offering vaccination at age 9 or 10 years and does not endorse shared decision-making for catch-up vaccination in adults 27 years or older because of the limited public health benefits in this age group and uncertainties around identifying those most likely to benefit [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p>Recommendations from other expert groups for resource-limited settings are somewhat different. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the primary target of HPV vaccination programs be females aged 9 to 14 years and that local public health programs should recommend vaccination of older females only if it is affordable and cost effective and does not divert resources from vaccinating the primary target population or screening for cervical cancer [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. ASCO recommendations for resource-limited settings are similar [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3964746356"><span class="h2">Optimal timing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Within the recommended age range, the optimal time for HPV immunization is prior to an individual's sexual debut. Clinical trial data of vaccine efficacy in males and females suggest that immunization with HPV vaccine is most effective among individuals who have not been infected with HPV (eg, patients who are "HPV-naïve"). None of the available HPV vaccines treat or accelerate the clearance of pre-existing vaccine-type HPV infections or related disease. Vaccination at a younger age is also supported by observational studies suggesting that it is associated with greater reductions in cervical cancer incidence than later vaccination [<a href="#rid34">34,35</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Indications and age range'</a> above and <a class="local">'Cervical, vaginal, and vulvar disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Individuals who are sexually active should still be vaccinated consistent with age-specific recommendations. A history of an abnormal Papanicolaou test, genital warts, or HPV infection is NOT a contraindication to HPV immunization [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. However, immunization is less beneficial for those who have already been infected with one or more of the HPV vaccine types. (See <a class="local">'Pre-existing HPV-associated disease'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2114784834"><span class="h2">Choice of vaccine</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Not all HPV vaccines are available in all locations. If cost and availability are not an issue, we recommend the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="98713" href="/d/drug information/98713.html" rel="external">human papillomavirus 9-valent vaccine</a>. In the United States only the 9-valent vaccine is available (since 2017). The greater HPV-type coverage provided by the 9-valent compared with the human papillomavirus quadrivalent and human papillomavirus bivalent vaccines protects against additional cervical cancers. Although it is not clear that greater HPV-type coverage by vaccinating males with the 9-valent rather than quadrivalent vaccine would substantially improve male cancer prevention, it would likely further reduce the risk of cervical cancer in females indirectly through herd immunity.</p><p>In general, the same formulation should be used to complete the series, if possible. However, if the HPV vaccine formulation initially used is unknown or unavailable, or if the 9-valent vaccine is being introduced into the formulary, a different HPV vaccine formulation can be used to complete the series [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1664119832"><span class="h2">Immunization schedule</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the United States, the recommended dosing schedule depends on the age of the patient at vaccine initiation [<a href="#rid17">17,20</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Individuals initiating the vaccine series at 9 to 14 years of age</strong> – Two doses of HPV vaccine should be given at 0 and at 6 to 12 months. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If the second dose was administered less than five months after the first, the dose should be repeated a minimum of 12 weeks after the second dose and a minimum of five months after the first. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Individuals initiating the vaccine series at 15 years of age or older</strong> – Three doses of HPV vaccine should be given at 0, 1 to 2 (typically 2), and 6 months. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The minimum intervals between the first two doses is four weeks, between the second and third doses is 12 weeks, and between the first and third dose is five months. If a dose was administered at a shorter interval, it should be repeated once the minimum recommended interval since the most recent dose has passed. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Immunocompromised patients</strong> – Three doses of HPV vaccine should be given at 0, 1 to 2, and 6 months regardless of age. (See <a class="local">'Patients with HIV or immunocompromising conditions'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>This ACIP recommended vaccination schedule is the same as that recommended by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunizations (SAGE) of the World Health Organization (WHO) [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. The two-dose series is similarly recommended in many other countries. Practitioners outside the United States should consult local guidelines for the recommended immunization schedule in their country. </p><p>HPV vaccine can be safely administered at the same time as other age-appropriate vaccines at a different anatomic site. Administering HPV vaccine at the same time as certain other vaccines (ie, tetanus, acellular pertussis, and diphtheria vaccine and inactivated <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9787" href="/d/drug information/9787.html" rel="external">poliovirus vaccine</a>) does not appear to adversely affect the immune response to either the HPV vaccine or the concomitant vaccine [<a href="#rid37">37,38</a>].</p><p>Although the initial clinical efficacy studies evaluated a three-dose schedule (see <a class="local">'Efficacy'</a> below), subsequent studies found that two vaccine doses in young individuals have similar or greater immunogenicity compared with three doses in older females (the group in whom vaccine efficacy was established in clinical trials) [<a href="#rid39">39-46</a>]. Observational evidence additionally suggests that fewer than three doses are still associated with reductions in cervical neoplasia [<a href="#rid47">47,48</a>]. For the quadrivalent vaccine, furthermore, two doses appear comparably effective as three doses for prevention of genital warts [<a href="#rid49">49,50</a>]. Three doses of HPV vaccine are still recommended for individuals 15 and older because of the lower immunologic response to HPV vaccination in this population.</p><p>As an example of supportive evidence for the two-dose schedule, a trial of 1518 participants randomly assigned to receive the 9-valent vaccine at different dosing schedules demonstrated that antibody titers for HPV vaccine types were consistently higher among females and males aged 9 to 14 years who received two vaccine doses spaced 6 or 12 months apart compared with females aged 16 to 26 years who received three vaccine doses over six months [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. One cohort of females aged 9 to 14 years in this trial was also assigned to receive three vaccine doses; among females in this age group, antibody responses were generally comparable with two- versus three-vaccine doses, and many vaccine-type titers trended higher with two doses. </p><p>While no efficacy trials have been conducted to directly evaluate a two-dose schedule, a post hoc analysis of data from two trials of the bivalent HPV vaccine in young females (aged 15 to 25 years) who had no HPV type 16 or 18 infection at baseline suggests that two vaccine doses can effectively protect against HPV infection [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. Of those with at least 12 months of follow-up, vaccine efficacy against six-month persistent infection with HPV types 16 and 18 was no different in females who received the intended three doses compared with those who received only two (89 and 90 efficacy, respectively).</p><p>Randomized controlled trials have also been conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy of a single dose of HPV vaccine [<a href="#rid52">52,53</a>]. As an example, in a multicenter trial of 2275 women aged 15 to 20 years who received either the bivalent HPV vaccine, nonavalent HPV vaccine, or the meningococcal vaccine (that acted as a control), incidence of HPV 16 and HPV 18 infection at 18-month follow-up was 0.17 per 100 woman-years in the bivalent and nonavalent HPV group compared with 6.83 per 100 woman-years in the control group [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. </p><p>Observational studies have examined effectiveness by number of doses, but are difficult to evaluate primarily because of a number of unmeasured confounders.

In the setting of HIV infection, data show that HPV vaccination is safe, but some, although not all, studies suggest a less robust and shorter-lived immune response [<a href="#rid45">45,58,59</a>]. Specifically, HPV quadrivalent vaccine has demonstrated safety and immunogenicity in adult males with HIV [<a href="#rid60">60</a>], females aged 16 to 23 years with HIV [<a href="#rid61">61,62</a>], and children aged 7 to 12 years with HIV [<a href="#rid45">45,63</a>].

No cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer were detected in females with normal baseline cytology. </p><p>Beyond issues related to immunosuppression, patients with HIV infection also have a higher prevalence of HPV infection than the general population, which may impact vaccine effectiveness.

The decline in cervical disease was greatest among females vaccinated at an earlier age and in countries with high routine vaccination coverage. Nevertheless, reductions in cervical disease have also been observed where vaccine uptake has been suboptimal. As an example, in a study from New Mexico in the United States, where vaccine uptake ranged from 17 to 40 percent, the incidence of CIN continually decreased among females aged 15 to 19 years between 2007 and 2014 (10 and 40 percent reduction annually for CIN2 and CIN3, respectively) [<a href="#rid94">94</a>]. </p><p>As expected, it has taken longer to demonstrate reductions in cervical cancer with vaccination because of the longer lag time from initial HPV infection to cancer compared with the time to CIN2 or CIN3. Observational studies provide the first evidence that the reductions previously observed in CIN2 and CIN3 are also occurring for cervical cancer, as projected. These studies also show greater reductions associated with vaccination at an earlier age. In a nationwide study from Sweden that included over 1.6 million females aged 10 to 30 years, HPV vaccine receipt was associated with a reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer (47 versus 94 cases per 100,000 among those who had not been vaccinated; adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.37, 95% CI 0.21-0.57) [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].

There was no increased risk of Guillain-Barré Syndrome compared with other vaccines in similar age groups [<a href="#rid129">129</a>].</p><p>There does appear to be an increased risk of syncope with the quadrivalent vaccine, but whether this is unique to this vaccine is unclear. In the United States, a disproportionate number of syncopal events following quadrivalent vaccine administration had been reported to the VAERS [<a href="#rid129">129</a>]. Among the 1896 syncopal events reported, 15 percent resulted in a fall or injury. Similarly, in an industry-sponsored study of almost 190,000 females in a large health care system who received at least one vaccine dose, emergency department visits or hospitalizations were higher during the postvaccine period compared with a subsequent control period for 10 of 265 diagnostic categories evaluated, including viral, bacterial, and skin infections and congenital anomalies [<a href="#rid131">131</a>]. An independent safety committee concluded that same-day syncopal events (OR 6.0, 95% CI 3.9-9.2) and local skin infections within two weeks of vaccination (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.4) were the only adverse events likely associated with vaccine administration. The incidence of syncope among adolescents has increased overall with the introduction of other routine immunizations as well, such as meningococcal vaccine [<a href="#rid129">129,130</a>].</p><p>A number of other adverse events have been described or reported to the VAERS following administration of HPV vaccine, although causality is difficult to establish based on isolated reports. In many cases, an association between vaccination and the specific adverse event was not substantiated by further study [<a href="#rid129">129,132,135-137</a>]. Examples include the following: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Although venous thromboembolism (VTE) rates reported to the VAERS in the United States were higher for quadrivalent vaccine than other vaccines, of the 31 patients with thromboembolism reported through 2008, 28 (90 percent) had a known risk factor (ie, estrogen-containing birth control pills or a family history of clotting disorder) [<a href="#rid129">129</a>]. In a study of adverse events following over 600,000 quadrivalent vaccine doses administered to females in seven large managed care organizations, there was a nonsignificant increase in the risk of VTE following vaccination among females aged 9 to 17 years, but individual review of the eight potential VTE cases indicated that only five met the standard case definition and all had other known risk factors for VTE (eg, oral contraceptive use, coagulation disorders, smoking, obesity, or prolonged hospitalization) [<a href="#rid132">132</a>]. Additionally, in a study of 1.6 million Danish females, of whom 30 percent had received quadrivalent HPV vaccine, there were over 4000 cases of incident VTE, but there was no association between vaccine receipt and VTE [<a href="#rid138">138</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anaphylaxis had also been reported following administration of the quadrivalent vaccine [<a href="#rid129">129,139</a>], although this risk has not been confirmed in other studies. In a mass school-based national vaccination program in Australia, the incidence of anaphylaxis was 2.6 per 100,000 doses [<a href="#rid139">139</a>]. However, some of those cases were subsequently thought not to have represented anaphylaxis and other studies from Australia did not confirm this high rate [<a href="#rid140">140,141</a>]. In the United States VAERS surveillance system, only 10 cases met predefined criteria for anaphylaxis; the overall risk ratio was 0.1 case per 100,000 doses distributed [<a href="#rid129">129</a>].

These occurred slightly more often than with the quadrivalent vaccine.

As an example, in one trial of more than 18,000 females aged 15 to 25 years, there were no differences in serious adverse events between vaccine and placebo recipients. Post-licensure data are sparse from the United States, where almost all HPV vaccine used through 2015 was quadrivalent vaccine. In the United States, there were 52 reports to VAERS of adverse events following administration of bivalent vaccine through September 2011, and 98 percent were considered nonserious.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1772308"><span class="h2">Behavioral impact</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some surveys of parents of adolescent girls identified a concern for sexual disinhibition following HPV vaccine receipt, particularly among older parents or caregivers and those belonging to underrepresented groups [<a href="#rid143">143,144</a>].

In a retrospective study of preteenage girls enrolled in a large health care system, the combined incidence of pregnancy testing, chlamydia testing, and contraception counseling was determined among those girls who did (n = 493) and did not (n = 905) receive at least one HPV vaccine dose [<a href="#rid145">145</a>].

In the United States, uptake of HPV vaccination has been suboptimal [<a href="#rid152">152-154</a>]. In 2015, based on results of a national survey among adolescents who had provider-reported vaccination records, estimated vaccine coverage among females and males aged 13 to 17 was 63 and 50 percent for at least one dose and only 42 and 28 percent for at least three doses (at a time when three doses was the recommended schedule for all recipients) [<a href="#rid155">155</a>]. In an earlier survey, parents who did not intend to have their daughters vaccinated gave the following as their top five reasons: the vaccine was not needed, the vaccine was not recommended, concern about vaccine safety, lack of knowledge about the vaccine or disease, and lack of sexual activity by their daughter [<a href="#rid134">134</a>]. This highlights a lack of understanding about the rationale for HPV vaccination on the part of the parent or caregiver and the important role of the health care provider in consistently and clearly educating parents or caregivers about vaccination. Other studies have also identified an association between direct provider recommendation and vaccine receipt [<a href="#rid156">156,157</a>]. </p><p>Lack of opportunity does not appear to be a major reason for low vaccine coverage. Of the unvaccinated females in the survey described above, 84 percent had at least one medical visit at which they were given a different vaccine but not the HPV vaccine [<a href="#rid134">134</a>]. Vaccination rates may be particularly low among certain demographic subgroups. As an example, in a survey of 3253 females aged 15 to 25 years, only 29 percent reported initiating HPV vaccination despite 84 percent being aware of it [<a href="#rid158">158</a>]. Among self-described lesbians, only 9 percent of those aware of HPV vaccination had received it.</p><p>The implications of these findings are significant. Some experts estimate that by increasing complete-dose HPV vaccination coverage (with either bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine) to 80 percent in females, approximately 53,000 additional cases of cervical cancer could be prevented in the United States over the lifetimes of those currently aged ≤12 years [<a href="#rid159">159</a>]. More cervical cancers would conceivably be prevented with similar coverage with the 9-valent vaccine.</p><p>Attempted community- or practice-based interventions to improve uptake of HPV vaccine include patient reminders, physician-focused interventions (auditing and feedback or alerts to remind physicians to offer vaccination), school-based vaccination programs, and social marketing strategies. In a systematic review of studies evaluating the efficacy of such interventions, most suggested an improvement in at least one HPV vaccination outcome (eg, initiation or completion of greater number of doses) with these strategies [<a href="#rid160">160</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27"><span class="h1">IMPORTANCE OF CANCER SCREENING</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5967530"><span class="h2">Cervical screening</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinicians should be aware that HPV immunization is not effective in clearing HPV infection, genital warts, or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia that is already present, and the vaccine does not protect against 100 percent of types known to cause cervical cancer.

Quadrivalent and 9-valent vaccine also protect against anogenital warts. Although the burden of HPV-associated disease is lower in males than females and thus the direct absolute benefit to males is smaller, the indirect benefit to males from vaccinating females only is incomplete and vaccinating males provides additional population benefits from herd immunity.
