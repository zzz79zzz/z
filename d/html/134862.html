While most patients are asymptomatic, some may occasionally present with fever, fatigue, and/or jaundice.</p><p>Elevations in liver enzymes typically occur 8 to 12 weeks after initiation of treatment.

Clinicians should also evaluate for the presence of jaundice or scleral icterus. ICI-mediated hepatitis typically occurs acutely, so signs suggestive of chronic liver disease (such as ascites or other stigmata of liver disease) may indicate an alternative etiology.

Further details on the indications and specific laboratory testing for patients with abnormal aminotransferases are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3576.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests", section on 'Evaluation of markedly elevated aminotransferases'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3612.html" rel="external">"Enzymatic measures of hepatic cholestasis (alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase)"</a>.)</p><p>We do not routinely obtain serologies for autoimmune disease. Although some guidelines suggest obtaining antinuclear, antismooth muscle, antimitochondrial antibodies, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, low titers of these autoimmune antibodies are prevalent in many chronic liver diseases. Moreover, their presence in the serum does not appreciably change management of ICI hepatotoxicity and their clinical significance in patients on ICI therapy is unclear.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H758639013"><span class="h3">Abdominal imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We obtain cross-sectional abdominal imaging to exclude other potential etiologies based on the pattern of the abnormal liver biochemical testing. In patients with ICI hepatotoxicity, imaging findings are typically nonspecific and include mild hepatomegaly, attenuated liver parenchyma, periportal edema, and/or periportal lymphadenopathy [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with elevations in serum ALT and/or AST who have not had a recent computed tomography (CT) scan (eg, within the past four weeks) we obtain CT abdomen with contrast to assess for liver metastases. In patients with impaired kidney function, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver with gadolinium contrast or abdominal ultrasound are alternative imaging modalities.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients who demonstrate a cholestatic pattern of liver injury (elevated alkaline phosphatase and/or total bilirubin), options to assess for bile duct obstruction include abdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), or CT abdomen with contrast.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is not routinely performed to evaluate for suspected ICI hepatotoxicity in patients with a cholestatic pattern of injury. However, ERCP is warranted if initial imaging demonstrates a specific indication for this procedure, such as malignant biliary obstruction, choledocholithiasis, or acute cholangitis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/632.html" rel="external">"Overview of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in adults", section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3601356967"><span class="h3">What is the role of liver biopsy?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The role of liver biopsy in the diagnosis of patients with ICI hepatitis is controversial, and clinical practice is variable and based on institutional expertise. Our general approach is to initiate empiric treatment for ICI hepatotoxicity with glucocorticoids in most patients with a hepatocellular pattern of liver injury who have no other identifiable causes of liver disease. We reserve liver biopsy for the following situations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients who fail to respond to initial immunosuppressive therapy (ie, glucocorticoids) for ICI hepatotoxicity. (See <a class="local">'Refractory hepatotoxicity'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients whose diagnosis remains unclear despite a thorough evaluation. For example, some patients may exhibit a predominantly cholestatic pattern of liver injury (ie, elevated alkaline phosphatase and/or total bilirubin) with no identifiable cause, such as biliary obstruction on imaging studies; this could indicate a rare alternative diagnosis to ICI hepatotoxicity, such as an infiltrating malignancy [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Some, but not all, UpToDate experts offer a liver biopsy prior to starting glucocorticoids in patients with grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity who hope to restart ICI therapy upon resolution of hepatotoxicity, due to limited alternative cancer treatment options. The purpose of the liver biopsy is to evaluate for rare alternative diagnoses (eg, infiltrating malignancy), which could alter the decision to restart ICIs. Clinicians should also offer such patients a risk-benefit discussion on the potential complications of liver biopsy [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Our approach to liver biopsy is generally consistent with guidance from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), but it differs from other guidelines. For example, the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) advises liver biopsy in patients with "more severe hepatic reactions" [<a href="#rid17">17</a>], while the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) suggests that a liver biopsy should be considered in patients with grade ≥2 hepatotoxicity who may require systemic glucocorticoids or potential discontinuation of ICIs [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>It is unclear if liver biopsy can reliably distinguish ICI hepatotoxicity from other causes of drug-induced liver injury since the histologic changes associated with ICI hepatotoxicity are generally nonspecific. However, a liver biopsy could potentially distinguish ICI hepatotoxicity from noninflammatory causes of liver injury, such as malignancy. The more common histologic findings of ICI hepatotoxicity include panlobular inflammation with milder portal involvement and, occasionally, fibrin ring granuloma [<a href="#rid13">13,19</a>]. A primary biliary injury pattern with mild portal mononuclear infiltrate around proliferated bile ductules also has been reported [<a href="#rid12">12,20</a>].</p><p>There are limited data on the utility of liver biopsy in patients with suspected ICI hepatitis. In one retrospective observational study of 213 patients treated with ICI therapy who developed a grade 3 or 4 liver injury, the 107 patients who underwent liver biopsy had a longer time to initiation of appropriate glucocorticoid therapy and did not exhibit faster resolution of hepatotoxicity [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Among the 107 patients who underwent liver biopsy, only 12 patients (eleven percent) were determined to not have ICI hepatitis; four had malignant biliary obstruction, four had liver injury from a contemporaneous drug, two had diffuse malignant infiltration, and two remained without a clear diagnosis. Patients without ICI hepatitis on biopsy were also more likely to present with elevated bilirubin levels. Life-threatening procedural complications occurred in two patients (2 percent), including splenic biopsy and hemothorax [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H733660443"><span class="h2">Pretreatment assessment and monitoring</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients on ICI should be routinely monitored for liver test abnormalities. A baseline ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin should be obtained prior to initiation of ICI therapy and prior to each infusion. Patients with elevated baseline liver tests should undergo evaluation for potential causes of liver injury prior to initiation of ICI therapy. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>Prior to initiating any systemic cancer therapy, all patients should also undergo pretreatment screening for the hepatitis B virus  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef129226" href="/z/d/graphic/129226.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Patients with chronic hepatitis B receiving any systemic cancer therapy (including ICIs) should receive antiviral prophylactic therapy during and for at least one year after cancer therapy [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Although ICI therapy does not appear to have an adverse effect on underlying viral infection [<a href="#rid22">22</a>], undetected chronic hepatitis B can also complicate immunosuppression administered for the management of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Such immunosuppressive agents can trigger reactivation of hepatitis B and result in serious liver injury and delayed cancer treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2837.html" rel="external">"Chemotherapy hepatotoxicity and dose modification in patients with liver disease: Conventional cytotoxic agents", section on 'HBV screening and management'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2660027871"><span class="h2">Management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The management of ICI hepatotoxicity depends on the severity of the hepatobiliary injury, based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade severity  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77533" href="/z/d/graphic/77533.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Treatment generally involves the administration of systemic glucocorticoids. Other immunosuppressive agents (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9670" href="/z/d/drug information/9670.html" rel="external">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, calcineurin inhibitors) typically are reserved for patients with glucocorticoid-refractory ICI hepatotoxicity.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3357205397"><span class="h3">Initial therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our approach to the initial management of ICI hepatotoxicity is based upon the severity of the liver injury, as defined by CTCAE  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77533" href="/z/d/graphic/77533.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3635803903"><span class="h4">Grade 1 hepatotoxicity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ICI therapy can be continued without interruption. We advise patients to temporarily hold hepatotoxic medications (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a>, statins if possible) and discontinue alcohol intake. Patients require laboratory monitoring of liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin) one to two times weekly to assess for worsening hepatotoxicity.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3054339618"><span class="h4">Grade 2 hepatotoxicity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with grade 2 ICI hepatotoxicity, treatment with the ICI should be held and other hepatotoxic medications discontinued. Clinical practice varies for the administration of immunosuppression. Our approach is as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients who received ICI therapy and have no other identifiable causes of liver disease, some UpToDate experts administer glucocorticoids such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> 0.5 to 1 mg/kg per day or an equivalent agent. Liver function tests are generally monitored every three to four days.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Alternatively, other experts prefer a period of initial observation rather than immediate administration of glucocorticoids, especially for patients with pre-existing liver metastases and those who received an ICI in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic cancer medications (eg, chemotherapy, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGFR] inhibitors, and small molecule inhibitors). For the latter, one approach is to also hold the additional cancer therapy, perform imaging studies (if not already obtained) to assess for new or progressive liver metastases, and monitor liver function tests.

(See  <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/z/d/html/134785.html" rel="external">"Society guideline links: Management of toxicities due to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2454971947"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical presentation of</strong> <strong>ICI hepatotoxicity</strong> – Hepatotoxicity due to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy often presents as a hepatocellular pattern of liver injury consisting of asymptomatic elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) that are identified on routine monitoring. A cholestatic (ie, elevated alkaline phosphatase and/or total bilirubin) or mixed pattern of injury is less common. (See <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic evaluation of ICI hepatotoxicity</strong> –<strong> </strong>The diagnosis is confirmed clinically by history and physical exam and by excluding other causes of abnormal liver function tests such as infection (eg, viral hepatitis) and noninfectious etiologies (eg, hepatic metastases, biliary obstruction, alcohol use, or drug-induced liver injury from an alternative agent). (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a class="local">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Laboratory evaluation</strong> – Serologic evaluation for hepatitis A, B, and C should be obtained to exclude acute or reactivation of viral hepatitis. Testing for hepatis E, Epstein-Barr (EBV) virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) may also be indicated. (See <a class="local">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Other tests to exclude noninfectious etiologies include 5' nucleotidase for patients with an isolated alkaline phosphatase; and creatinine kinase (CK) if myositis or muscle damage is suspected. We do not routinely obtain serologies for autoimmune disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Imaging </strong>– For patients with elevations in serum ALT and/or AST who have not had a recent CT scan, we obtain CT abdomen with contrast to assess for liver metastases. In patients with impaired kidney function, MRI of the liver with gadolinium contrast or abdominal ultrasound are alternative imaging modalities. (See <a class="local">'Abdominal imaging'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">For those who demonstrate a cholestatic pattern of liver injury (elevated alkaline phosphatase and/or total bilirubin), options to assess for bile duct obstruction include abdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), or CT abdomen with contrast.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Is there a role for liver biopsy?</strong> – The role of liver biopsy is controversial, and clinical practice is variable and based on institutional expertise. (See <a class="local">'What is the role of liver biopsy?'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Our general practice is to initiate empiric treatment for ICI hepatotoxicity with glucocorticoids in most patients with a hepatocellular pattern of liver injury who have no other identifiable causes of liver injury.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>We reserve liver biopsy for patients who fail to respond to initial immunosuppressive therapy and/or those whose diagnosis remains unclear despite a thorough evaluation (eg, a cholestatic pattern of liver injury with no identifiable cause).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management of ICI hepatotoxicity </strong>– Management is based on disease severity, as defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading for hepatobiliary toxicity  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77533" href="/z/d/graphic/77533.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Grade 1</strong> – Continue ICI therapy. Hold hepatotoxic medications temporarily, if possible. Monitor liver function tests one to two times weekly. (See <a class="local">'Grade 1 hepatotoxicity'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Grade 2</strong> <strong>or higher</strong> – For most patients with grade ≥2 or higher hepatotoxicity, we suggest initiation of systemic glucocorticoids (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Specific details regarding our stepwise approach are as follows:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Grade 2</strong> – Hold ICI therapy and discontinue other hepatotoxic medications. For patients who received ICI therapy alone and have no other identifiable causes of liver disease, some UpToDate experts administer glucocorticoids such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day or an equivalent agent and monitor liver function tests every three to four days. Alternatively, other experts prefer a period of initial observation rather than immediate administration of glucocorticoids, especially for patients with pre-existing liver metastases and those who received an ICI in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic cancer medications. (See <a class="local">'Grade 2 hepatotoxicity'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Grade 3 or 4</strong> – Hold ICI therapy and discontinue other hepatotoxic medications. For patients with a predominantly hepatocellular pattern of liver injury and no other identifiable cause, administer <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9639" href="/z/d/drug information/9639.html" rel="external">methylprednisolone</a> at 1 mg/kg per day or an equivalent agent. Monitor liver tests and basic metabolic panel every one to two days for grade 3 hepatitis and daily for grade 4 hepatitis. Refer to a hepatologist or gastroenterologist with expertise in ICI hepatitis. (See <a class="local">'Grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Refractory hepatotoxicity</strong> – For patients who do not respond to glucocorticoid therapy, we suggest the addition of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9670" href="/z/d/drug information/9670.html" rel="external">mycophenolate</a> mofetil rather than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9026" href="/z/d/drug information/9026.html" rel="external">azathioprine</a> to glucocorticoids (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>), due to better tolerability and faster onset of action. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9971" href="/z/d/drug information/9971.html" rel="external">Tacrolimus</a> is used for the rare patient who is unresponsive to both steroids and mycophenolate mofetil. The use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8984" href="/z/d/drug information/8984.html" rel="external">infliximab</a> is limited since this agent is ineffective for ICI hepatitis and is associated with a risk of hepatotoxicity. (See <a class="local">'Refractory hepatotoxicity'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Resuming ICI therapy</strong> – The approach to resuming ICI therapy is based upon the severity of the initial ICI hepatotoxicity, the ability to taper glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive therapy, and whether ICI therapy was combined with other systemic cancer agents. (See <a class="local">'Resuming immunotherapy after prior toxicity'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pancreatic toxicities</strong> – The most common exocrine pancreatic toxicities associated with ICIs include asymptomatic hyperlipasemia (elevations in lipase) and acute pancreatitis. (See <a class="local">'Pancreatic toxicities'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Asymptomatic hyperlipasemia</strong> – We typically observe and do not treat with glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive medications. (See <a class="local">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Acute pancreatitis</strong> – Patients should be managed using a similar treatment approach to those with acute pancreatitis due to other causes. We reserve the use of systemic glucocorticoids for patients who have severe pancreatitis or who do not improve rapidly with supportive care. (See <a class="local">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rare GI toxicities</strong> – Rare GI toxicities related to ICIs include celiac disease, esophagitis, motility disorders such as gastroparesis, and acute cholecystitis.
