         Although restless sleep in children is a common clinical symptom and has been noted in the medical literature for decades, restless sleep disorder (RSD) was first defined as a specific disorder of sleep in children in 2018 [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. Consensus diagnostic criteria for RSD emphasize a core clinical complaint of restless sleep accompanied by frequent large body movements on polysomnography, clinically significant impairment, and a lack of other causes for the restlessness [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. While recognition of RSD was too recent to be considered for inclusion in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, third edition [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ], multiple publications provide substantial information on this disorder.
        </p>
        <p>
         Data on pathophysiology, comorbidities, and treatment options are emerging. RSD has distinct features that separate it from other sleep-related movement disorders of childhood, such as restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, or sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder, and is therefore presented as a separate disorder.

         RSD has been studied and identified in children ages 6 to 18 years. It may also occur in younger children, but research is lacking. Restless sleep as a symptom has been described in adults, but restless sleep as a disorder has not [
         <a href="#rid5">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         RSD incidence, population prevalence, and remission rates are unknown. In a pediatric sleep clinic referral population, RSD accounted for 7.7 percent of diagnoses, with no difference in prevalence between males and females [
         <a href="#rid6">

         <strong>
          Iron deficiency
         </strong>
         – Children with RSD typically have low or low-normal serum ferritin levels, with mean or median values between 16 and 22 mcg/L [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,7,8
         </a>
         ]. These values are similar to or lower than those observed in children with restless legs syndrome (RLS) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,9
         </a>
         ] and slightly higher than typical levels in iron deficiency anemia (&lt;15 mcg/L). While there is not consensus about ferritin levels in non-anemic iron deficiency, most data support the view that iron deficiency in the absence of anemia can occur with ferritin levels of 15 to 30 mcg/L [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5925.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Iron deficiency, with or without anemia, alters neuronal dopaminergic neurotransmission in early development, impacting motor activity both during the day and at night [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. These observations, together with studies showing that iron supplementation improves nighttime and daytime symptoms in children with RSD, support a brain iron deficiency hypothesis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Iron supplementation'

         <strong>
          Sleep instability
         </strong>
         – Cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) has long been recognized as a physiologic marker of sleep instability [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Studies in children with RSD suggest changes in the CAP A3 subtypes [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ], shorter duration of the B phase of the CAP cycle, and shorter CAP cycle [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16
         </a>
         ]. Interestingly, CAP events overlap with arousals [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ] and contribute to sleep disruption [

         <strong>
          Sympathetic activation
         </strong>
         – Heart rate variability (HRV) provides information about balance in the autonomic nervous system and has been widely studied in sleep disorders to assess the interaction between the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The analysis of HRV includes two domains: the time domain and the frequency domain, which is further subdivided into high-frequency band (HF, a marker of parasympathetic activity) and low-frequency band (LF, a marker of sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation) [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Studies in children with RSD demonstrate a higher predominance of sympathetic activity during sleep compared with controls, particularly during rapid eye movement (REM) and N3 sleep, whereas no difference is found during wakefulness [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. In the time domain, the RR interval during stage N3 is longer in children with RSD than in children with RLS. In the frequency domain, the LF band during N3 is higher in RSD compared with that in controls. During REM sleep, the LF/HF ratio is higher in both RSD and RLS compared with controls.

         <strong>
          Restless sleep
         </strong>
         – All children with RSD must have a concern of restless sleep reported by the patient’s parent, caregiver, or bed partner or by the patient [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,21
         </a>
         ]. Commonly used phrases include "moving all night," "all over the bed," "trashing the bed," and "moving like a helicopter" [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The child may be found in different positions, the bed sheets may end up on the floor, and sometimes the child may fall out of bed.

          Large body movements

         – Frequent, visible body movements are reported during sleep [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,21,22

          Functional impairment
         </strong>
         – Daytime concerns associated with RSD include daytime sleepiness, irritability, fatigue, mood disturbance, impaired concentration, and impulsivity [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Parents and caregivers may report behavioral problems, poor school performance, or attention problems.

         <strong>
          Frequency and chronicity
         </strong>
         – Parents state that the movements occur almost every night and at any hour of the night. It may be reported that the child with RSD "has never been a good sleeper" [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Comparison of the child with RSD to siblings may be helpful since the parent may recognize that the child with RSD sleeps differently than siblings.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Surprisingly, insomnia symptoms are not the chief complaint. Although there are frequent movements and repositioning, children with RSD rarely wake up in the middle of the night and typically do not have difficulty falling asleep [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>

         The criteria for RSD recommend video polysomnography (at least one video frame per second) performed in agreement with the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) Scoring Manual standard [
         <a href="#rid26">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         To score large muscle movements with video polysomnography, careful video analysis must reveal clearly visible large body movements lasting for at least three seconds [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Movement types can include isolated arm or leg movements (not meeting the criteria for periodic limb movements of sleep [PLMS]); combined arm and leg movements without body repositioning; body position change; and head movements with or without limb movement. Movements must be scored, and an index per hour must be generated. PLMS should be marked and excluded before visual detection and measurement of large body movements.
        </p>
        <p>
         To score large muscle movements when video is not available, criteria published by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) might be a good alternative [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. In this case, the technician uses the AASM-recommended leads for polysomnography. The movement must satisfy all of the following: present in at least two leads; EMG or movement artifact is at least twice the amplitude of the background signal amplitude; duration is ≥3 seconds with a maximum of 30 seconds for children and 45 seconds for adults; ends with return of amplitude to below twice the baseline signal amplitude for &gt;1 second in the last of the channels involved.
        </p>
        <p>
         In our practice, we score large muscle movements only when there is suspicion of RSD.

         We suggest evaluating the iron status of all children with RSD because of the association between RSD and iron deficiency. Serum ferritin is the best single measure of iron stores. However, serum ferritin is an acute phase reactant, and false elevation can occur for up to four weeks after febrile illness [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. As a result, we wait four weeks after acute illness before performing this test. If there is suspicion of chronic inflammation, we measure C-reactive protein (CRP). Less sensitive iron measures such as percent iron saturation (transferrin saturation) and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) may also be helpful.

         We recheck serum ferritin in two to three months and adjust treatment as needed to target serum ferritin levels between 50 and 100 mcg/L. This range generally reflects optimal body iron stores, unless the value is falsely elevated by an inflammatory state. For treatment of RSD, it appears to be important to target optimal iron status rather than typically defined "normal" ranges for tests of iron sufficiency.

         Once iron stores have been replenished, we continue to monitor the child’s iron status by checking serum ferritin periodically. In many children, it may be difficult to attain and maintain a serum ferritin level &gt;50 mcg/L due to growth, decreased iron absorption once levels get to the low-normal range, and blood loss with menses in adolescent girls. In some children, we continue therapeutic doses of oral iron in anticipation of growth spurts.

         There is no evidence that medications used to treat other pediatric sleep-related movement disorders are effective in treating RSD. No medications have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for pediatric RSD. This is also true for other pediatric sleep disorders, despite evidence of long-term negative impact when sleep problems in children are not treated [

         As a recently described sleep disorder, RSD requires further research in several key areas. Large muscle movement indices are needed for the diagnosis of RSD in children younger than 6 years of age and adults older than 18 years of age. Other diagnostic methods should be explored, such as home video or activity monitors. There is more to learn about the natural history of RSD across the lifespan, and treatment options beyond iron supplementation need to be studied.

          Epidemiology
         </strong>
         – Restless sleep disorder (RSD) has been identified and characterized in children ages 6 to 18 years. The disorder was first described in 2018, and incidence and population prevalence are not yet known. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Pathophysiology
         </strong>
         – Iron deficiency, sleep instability, and sympathetic activation have been implicated in the pathophysiology of RSD. Low or low-normal serum ferritin levels have been consistently identified in children with RSD. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Clinical features
         </strong>
         – The hallmarks of RSD are restless sleep, large body movements during sleep, and associated impairment of function. Children present with daytime symptoms of sleepiness, inattention, behavioral problems, or poor sleep performance. (See

         <strong>
          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – All children suspected of having RSD should undergo a history and physical examination, polysomnography, and serum iron studies. History and polysomnography help to exclude other disorders that can cause restless sleep, such as sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). (See
