         The clinical presentation of myocardial ischemia is most often acute chest discomfort. The goal of emergency department evaluation is to determine the cause of such discomfort or other related symptoms (eg, dyspnea, weakness) and to initiate appropriate therapy promptly. It is essential that initial assessment and management be rapid but methodical and evidence based.
        </p>
        <p>
         Diagnostic evaluation emphasizes distinguishing between the following potential, life-threatening causes of chest pain:

         Nonischemic chest pain, including potentially life-threatening conditions such as aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, and esophageal rupture  (

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of acute coronary-related ischemia depends upon the characteristics of the chest pain (if present), specific associated symptoms, abnormalities on electrocardiogram (ECG), and levels of serum markers of cardiac injury. A patient with a possible ACS should be evaluated and treated rapidly. Thus, initial management steps must be undertaken before or during the time the diagnosis is being established.

         The initial management of the patient likely to have an ACS will be reviewed here. Discussions of related subjects are found separately:

         The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) recommend that all hospitals establish multidisciplinary teams to develop guideline-based, institution-specific written protocols for triaging and managing patients who present with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia. The management of diagnosed ACS is discussed in detail separately. (See

         Immediate cardiology consultation should be available for cases in which the initial diagnosis and treatment plan are unclear or are not addressed directly by available protocols. A number of life-threatening conditions can cause chest pain and dyspnea. It is important to avoid premature diagnostic closure. (See

         Clinicians should consider the possibility of ACS in any adult who presents to the emergency department complaining of chest discomfort or dyspnea. A personal or family history of ACS or other cardiovascular disease, older age, diabetes, dyslipidemia, cigarette smoking, hypertension, or cocaine use all increase the likelihood. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1506.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of established risk factors for cardiovascular disease"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Characteristic presentations (as described below) heighten concern, but clinicians must keep in mind that many patients with ACS present with symptoms such as dyspnea or malaise, either alone or in addition to chest pain. Females are more likely to have associated dyspnea than males, and patients who are older or have diabetes are more likely to present with dyspnea without chest pain. (See

         Pain from coronary-related ischemia is more often characterized as non-focal chest discomfort or pressure rather than pain, is generally gradual in onset, and is exacerbated by activity. Discomfort that radiates, particularly to either or both arms, should increase suspicion for ACS.

         In the emergency department, patients presenting with chest pain or other symptoms possibly due to ACS (eg, dyspnea) should be rapidly evaluated to determine if their symptoms are suggestive of acute ischemia or some other potentially life-threatening illness. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical presentation'

        <p>
         If ACS is the leading diagnosis, initial assessment and interventions must be performed rapidly. The attached algorithm provides a simple approach to risk stratification while the table provides a concise outline of the immediate interventions needed to manage ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and unstable angina  (

         Caution should be employed in evaluating possible ACS in older adults and patients with diabetes, who are more likely to present with symptoms such as dyspnea or weakness without chest pain even in the presence of acute coronary-related ischemia [

        </p>
        <p>
         The institution's specific chest pain protocol should be implemented if the history or symptoms are suggestive of acute ischemia. The time for initial assessment, including ECG, and preliminary management of a patient with possible acute coronary-related ischemia is ideally 10 minutes from presentation. Large observational studies report that ECG acquisition is frequently delayed and that females are significantly less likely to be assessed within the recommended 10 minutes or to receive testing with a cardiac biomarker [

          Initial history and exam

          DETERMINING WHO NEEDS AN ELECTROCARDIOGRAM

         </span>
         In general, a resting electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained in all adults with chest discomfort that does not have an obvious noncardiac cause. An ECG is also obtained routinely in older adults or patients with diabetes with symptoms of unclear etiology, such as dyspnea, nausea, or malaise; patients with syncope; and patients with symptoms or signs consistent with an arrhythmia. However, identifying at triage or early in the emergency department evaluation which younger adult patients should be evaluated with an ECG is occasionally difficult. Keep in mind that a substantial number of patients ultimately diagnosed with an ACS, particularly older patients and those with diabetes, present with complaints other than chest discomfort or do not manifest clear signs of ischemia in their initial ECG. Such presentations are discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Atypical presentations'
         </a>
         below and

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         One research group has proposed the following rule for identifying patients at high risk for ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who should be evaluated with an ECG [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8

         <span class="glyph">

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Any patient over 80 with abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         This rule was derived and validated using information from over three million emergency department visits included in a state-wide health surveillance database. Included in the database were 6464 cases of STEMI diagnosed during 2007 to 2008 that provided the dataset for the study. When applied to the validation sample (3294 STEMI cases), the rule had a sensitivity of 91.9 percent (95% CI 90.9-92.8) and a specificity of 76.2 percent (95% CI 76.1-76.2).
        </p>
        <p>
         This proposed rule should not replace clinical judgement (in fact, the authors encourage clinicians to obtain an ECG based upon such judgement). As an example, a patient in whom a noncardiac diagnosis is likely (eg, younger patient with obvious zoster [shingles] lesions and no other symptoms) may not need an ECG. Nevertheless, this study provides some evidence for clinicians trying to devise appropriate triage protocols for the emergency department or to determine for which patients, including those not presenting with chest pain, an ECG assessment is needed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prospective validation of this decision rule in other patient populations is needed before widespread adoption can be recommended. Among the rule's limitations are its relatively low sensitivity and the age cutoffs, which may be too high in some settings. It is worth reiterating the importance of paying close attention to older patients and those with diabetes with symptoms consistent with ACS and using a low threshold for obtaining an ECG in such patients.

         If the initial ECG is not diagnostic but the patient remains symptomatic and clinical suspicion for ACS remains high, the ECG should be repeated at least every 15 to 30 minutes. Patients whose repeat ECGs are diagnostic for or strongly suggestive of either STEMI or NSTEMI should be managed for those diagnoses. (See

         diagnostic in patients with ACS. In two series, the initial ECG was nondiagnostic in 45 percent and normal in 20 percent of patients subsequently shown to have an acute myocardial infarction [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,11
         </a>
         ]. In the early hours of infarction, peaked, hyperacute T waves may be the only abnormality. In addition to evolution of the ECG, an uncommon source of error is pseudonormalization of baseline T wave inversion [

         Ischemic pain has a number of features that tend to distinguish it from noncardiac pain. These characteristics are described below using the OPQRST mnemonic. Symptoms associated with the highest relative risk of myocardial infarction include radiation to an upper extremity, particularly when there is radiation to both arms, and pain associated with diaphoresis or with nausea and vomiting [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19-21
         </a>
         ]. An important question is whether current pain is reminiscent of prior myocardial infarction. Of note, no one pain characteristic has sufficient positive or negative predictive value to definitively diagnose or exclude ACS.

          Quality
         </strong>
         – Ischemic pain is often characterized more as a discomfort than pain, and it may be difficult for the patient to describe. Terms frequently used by patients include squeezing, tightness, pressure, constriction, crushing, strangling, burning, heartburn, fullness in the chest, band-like sensation, knot in the center of the chest, lump in throat, ache, heavy weight on chest (elephant sitting on chest), like a bra too tight, and toothache (when there is radiation to the lower jaw). It is generally not described as sharp, fleeting, knife-like, stabbing, or like "pins and needles" [

          Radiation

         – Ischemic pain often radiates to other parts of the body including the upper abdomen (epigastrium), shoulders, arms (upper and forearm), wrist, fingers, neck and throat, lower jaw and teeth (but not upper jaw), and not infrequently to the back (specifically the interscapular region). The old dictum that "pain above the nose or below the navel is rarely cardiac in origin" still holds. Pain radiating to the upper extremities is highly suggestive of ischemic pain [

         – Ischemic pain is not felt in one specific spot; rather, it is a diffuse discomfort that may be difficult to localize. The patient often indicates the entire chest, rather than localizing it to a specific area by pointing a single finger.

         ). It is essential to consider these alternate diagnoses to avoid potentially dangerous errors in management, such as the administration of antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or thrombolytic therapy to a patient with an aortic dissection.

         Some patients with ACS present with symptoms other than chest pain. In a review of over 430,000 patients with confirmed acute myocardial infarction from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction II, one-third had no chest pain on presentation to the hospital [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. These patients often present with symptoms such as dyspnea alone, weakness, nausea and/or vomiting, epigastric pain or discomfort, palpitations, syncope, or cardiac arrest. They are more likely to be older or have diabetes [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20,32-34

         ]. (See

        <p>
         The absence of chest pain has important implications for therapy and prognosis. In the Registry report, patients without chest pain were much less likely to be diagnosed with a confirmed myocardial infarction on admission (22 versus 50 percent in those with chest pain) and were less likely to be treated with appropriate medical therapy and to receive thrombolytic therapy or primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI; 25 versus 74 percent) [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. Not surprisingly, these differences were associated with an increase in in-hospital mortality (23.3 versus 9.3 percent, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.21, 95% CI 2.17-2.26).

         A patient whose presentation raises concern for coronary-related ischemia but who does not manifest ST elevations on electrocardiogram (ECG) is suspected of having a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or possibly unstable angina. The management of patients with NSTEMI is discussed separately. The accompanying table provides a concise summary of the immediate treatment interventions needed in these patients  (

         Unstable angina and NSTEMI comprise part of the spectrum of ACS. Angina is considered unstable if it presents in any of the following three ways:

         <span class="glyph">

        <p>
         NSTEMI is distinguished from unstable angina by the presence of elevated serum biomarkers. ST segment elevations and Q waves are absent in both unstable angina and NSTEMI. As a result, unstable angina and NSTEMI can be indistinguishable at initial evaluation since an elevation in serum biomarkers may not be detectable for two to four hours after a myocardial infarction with contemporary troponin assays and one to three hours with high-sensitivity assays, and at least 12 hours are required to detect elevations in all patients.

         be administered to patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI unless subsequent ECG monitoring documents ST segment elevations that persist. Repeat ECGs are an essential part of management in these patients. (See

         For patients without STEMI, the ECG remains a critical component in determining risk for adverse outcomes in ACS. The patient's hemodynamic status, serum biomarkers, and historical risk factors, as well as available hospital resources, should also be used to determine appropriate disposition. Cardiology consultation is useful generally and for any case in which the diagnosis or treatment plan are unclear. The utility of epidemiologic risk factors in determining acute, individual risk has been questioned [

         This patient is typically admitted to an intensive care unit, coronary care unit, or monitored cardiac unit depending upon the persistence of symptoms and evidence of hemodynamic compromise. Those with persistent pain or hemodynamic compromise generally undergo urgent angiography and revascularization. Others with resolution of symptoms and stable hemodynamics are typically referred for early elective angiography and revascularization if appropriate.
