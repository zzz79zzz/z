         Patients with suspected fractures require urgent and sometimes emergency evaluation to determine if serious complicating conditions exist. Such conditions, including any neurovascular injury, often require immediate surgical consultation [
         <a href="#rid1">

         ]. Nevertheless, many fractures are uncomplicated and can be managed effectively in a nonsurgical setting.

         The acute management of uncomplicated fractures is reviewed below and involves the following steps:

         The clinician begins the assessment of any patient who has sustained significant trauma by looking for life- or limb-threatening injuries using the basic approach outlined in Advanced Trauma Life Support. Patients presenting to a clinic following major trauma or who appear to have sustained significant injury are best transferred to the emergency department for thorough evaluation.

         For patients without apparent life- or limb-threatening injuries who appear appropriate for office management, assessment begins with a focused history. Analgesia is sometimes needed before a history can be obtained.

         Details of the mechanism of injury and an understanding of the injury patterns associated with particular mechanisms are important. Injury patterns guide the examination and choice of radiologic studies. Often they help the clinician to consider less obvious associated injuries to bones, ligaments, or tendons.
        </p>
        <p>
         As an example, falling onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH) is most often associated with a distal radius fracture but may also cause an occult metacarpal or scaphoid fracture. Any patient with radial-sided wrist pain after FOOSH requires careful examination of the entire hand and wrist, including the scaphoid bone. Specific scaphoid radiographs are performed on any patient with "snuffbox" tenderness (ie, tenderness over the scaphoid in the area between the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis longus). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/219.html" rel="external">
          "Distal radius fractures in adults"

         Although extremity fractures are associated with domestic violence less frequently than some other injuries, a significant number of patients presenting to clinics with fractures sustained their injuries from such violence [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, it is important to ask patients whether this is the case and to provide appropriate referral as needed. (See

         While the patient's history and injury mechanism guide the examination, a general assessment of the involved region should always be performed. This includes evaluating neurovascular function and looking for signs of soft tissue damage and breaks in the skin over the area of injury, which suggests the presence of an open fracture. The neurovascular examination includes palpating distal pulses, measuring capillary refill, and testing motor function, sensation, and two-point discrimination distal to the fracture site.
        </p>
        <p>
         Palpate the entire area around the fracture site to exclude adjacent injuries. This includes the entire bone in question, adjacent bones, and at least one joint above and below the injury site. Avoid testing passive range of motion or manipulating the affected area or limb until radiologic assessment is completed in order to prevent exacerbating fracture displacement, soft tissue damage, or neurovascular compromise [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The general rule of fracture immobilization is "splint it where it lies." The major exception to this rule occurs when distal neurovascular function is not intact. If pulses are undetectable, motor function is absent, or other signs of significant distal neurovascular compromise exist, the physician should promptly reduce any apparent dislocation or reposition the injured extremity. If neurovascular function improves following repositioning, the injury should be splinted in this new position, neurovascular status verified following splint application, and emergent surgical consultation obtained so definitive care can be provided. If neurovascular status does not improve despite repeated attempts at reduction or repositioning, the injury is splinted in the position of maximum neurovascular function and immediately transferred for definitive care.

         In skeletally immature patients, the clinician must be alert to the possibility of physeal injury. Proper identification and treatment of growth plate fractures is essential to minimize the risk of growth arrest or asymmetric bone growth [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,6,7

         A basic discussion of how to describe fractures and bone radiographs is found separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/220.html" rel="external">

         Three guidelines are helpful when obtaining radiographs of a potential fracture site:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Obtain multiple and orthogonal views – "One view is no view" is a common radiologic maxim. Two orthogonal views are the absolute minimum needed for adequate assessment.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Ensure radiographs are of high quality (proper angle, technique, and exposure) and include the entire bone or joint in question.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Obtain advanced imaging when clinical findings suggest fracture, but plain radiographs are unrevealing.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Orthogonal views are radiographs taken at 90 degrees to each other; most often these consist of an anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral view. However, in some situations, AP and lateral views alone are insufficient to diagnose obscure fractures and radiographs using particular perspectives are needed. As examples, a scaphoid view may reveal a scaphoid fracture not seen on a standard AP radiograph of the wrist, while a fracture of the hook of the hamate may be apparent only on a carpal tunnel view. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/197.html" rel="external">
          "Scaphoid fractures"
         </a>
         and
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/203.html" rel="external">
          "Hamate fractures"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Fractures can sometimes be difficult to see on the best of radiographs. Hence, radiographs that are over- or underpenetrated, improperly angled (eg, not true laterals), omit important anatomy, or contain overlying shadows can hinder diagnosis and should not be accepted. Radiographs of a specific bone or joint should include the entire structure. Plain radiographs of the joint directly proximal and directly distal to the site of injury should be obtained if indicated by clinical examination findings; they should not be ordered reflexively.
        </p>
        <p>
         Stress fractures, scaphoid fractures, physeal fractures, hip fractures in the elderly, and many other bony injuries may not appear on initial plain radiographs. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveal occult fractures in many such cases [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,8
         </a>
         ]. An alternative approach is to assume the presence of a fracture, treat the injury accordingly, and obtain follow-up radiographs a week or two later. Many occult injuries become apparent on subsequent radiographs.

         </span>
         Although musculoskeletal ultrasound is not the primary imaging modality used to diagnosis fractures, it is being used more often in particular settings as an alternative method due to its portability, availability, and lack of ionizing radiation. It is often used to make rapid assessments and assist treatment decision-making in emergency departments, sports medicine clinics, military settings, and other urgent care locations such as ski resort medical stations.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to a systematic review of three meta-analyses and 25 primary studies evaluating the efficacy of fracture assessment by emergency physicians using point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), the sensitivity of ultrasound to detect an extremity fracture ranges from 89 to 100 percent, with outliers being middle and proximal phalanx fractures, sensitivity of 79 percent, and scaphoid fractures, sensitivity of 40 percent [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Specificity ranges from 83 to 100 percent. These results correlate with those of a similar systematic review of eight studies involving varying methods and different extremity fractures, which reported the sensitivity of ultrasound to detect an extremity fracture to range from 85 to 100 percent, with specificity ranging from 73 to 100 percent [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Individual studies of POCUS for metacarpal and phalanx fractures in both pediatric and adult populations have reported lower sensitivities and specificities — 92 and 87 percent (metacarpal); 79 and 90 percent (proximal/middle phalanx) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. POCUS may be useful for identifying some non-extremity fractures such as rib fractures and pediatric skull fractures [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Given the increasing availability of ultrasound and its other advantages, it is reasonable to assess low-risk fractures with ultrasound. In cases where the clinical and sonographic findings are consistent, the risk for displacement or other significant complication is low, and the patient is unlikely to be harmed by immobilization, no further imaging beyond ultrasound may be necessary. However, all potential fractures not meeting these criteria should be evaluated with plain radiographs, and any potential high-risk fracture requires more definitive imaging than POCUS alone.

         Fracture immobilization is of benefit in the great majority of cases. It prevents fracture displacement or loss of reduction, protects the area from further injury, and reduces pain. Several methods can be used to immobilize uncomplicated fractures, including splinting, casting, bracing, buddy taping, and sling and swathe  (

         In the acute setting, splinting is the preferred method for immobilizing fractures that are at low risk for displacement primarily because of the soft tissue swelling that develops around most fracture sites. A cast applied to the site of an acute injury cannot accommodate such swelling, and can lead to tissue ischemia, pressure-related injury, and even iatrogenic compartment syndrome [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Conversely, a cast applied to an already swollen extremity may become loose as swelling subsides, providing inadequate support and immobilization. Additional benefits of splinting include the relative ease of application, lower risk of skin breakdown, and improved hygiene [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Certain unstable fractures may require acute casting or operative fixation to prevent displacement. Such fractures may include those that required reduction, fracture dislocations, segmental or spiral fractures, and simultaneous fractures of both the ulna and radius [
         <a href="#rid1">

         Adequate analgesia is an important aspect of acute fracture management. Fracture immobilization, ice, elevation of the affected limb, and analgesic medications all reduce pain. Splinting prevents motion at the fracture site, which is a major source of pain. The noncircumferential nature of splints allows ice to be placed in nearly direct contact with the injured tissue. Additional reduction in swelling and pain may be achieved by elevating the fracture site above the level of the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
         Initially, analgesics are often required for effective pain control. For minor fractures,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen
         </a>
         or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) is often sufficient for adequate analgesia. The potential adverse effects of NSAIDs on fracture healing are discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7991.html" rel="external">
          "Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects", section on 'Possible effect on fracture healing'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Severe pain associated with an acute fracture can require treatment with opioids. Short-acting opioids used in combination with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen
         </a>
         or NSAIDs cause fewer side effects and allow lower doses of opioid to be used [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. We prefer this approach. In addition to the well-known potential adverse effects of opioids such as respiratory depression and addiction, animal studies and retrospective studies in humans suggest that opioid use may increase rates of fracture nonunion [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Clinicians should discuss the risks associated with opioid therapy with the patient.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because of the potential complications, opioids should be used in the lowest effective dose and for the shortest possible duration (48 to 72 hours is optimal). Retrospective observational studies report that the risk for new opioid dependence is increased by larger cumulative doses of opioid initially and possibly with more complicated fractures requiring prolonged healing [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19
         </a>
         ]. Care should be taken when dosing opioid medications in patients with impaired renal clearance, particularly older patients. If the necessary resources are available, regional nerve blocks provide an effective means of controlling pain for some fractures while avoiding unwanted systemic side effects [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20,21
         </a>
         ]. Pain management in older patients with significant trauma, including major fractures, and nerve blocks are discussed separately. (See

        <p>
         Acute fracture pain lasts from a few days to a week. The need for significant pain medication beyond five days is unusual. Pain that persists or increases after this initial period may represent a complication and should be investigated. Such complications may include acute compartment syndrome, pressure-related injuries of the skin and soft tissue, and movement or displacement at the fracture site due to inadequate immobilization [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Assuming no such complications have developed, acute fracture pain that persists longer than five to seven days should prompt referral to a pain management specialist to minimize the risk for new opioid dependency [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19
         </a>
         ]. (See

        <p>
         Delayed complications related to a cast or splint may also manifest as worsening pain. Any patient with a splint or cast who complains of new or worsening pain in that region should be urgently assessed. Fracture care providers must ensure that patients have 24 hour access to facilities where casts can be removed and fractures evaluated.

         Once a fracture and any associated injuries have been stabilized, the clinician must provide clear instructions for injury care and monitoring, including cast or splint care, and a follow-up plan must be in place.

          Physical examination
         </strong>
         – The history and injury mechanism guide the physical examination of patients with a possible fracture. A general assessment of the involved region should always be performed, including evaluation of neurovascular function and investigation for signs of soft tissue damage and breaks in the skin over the area of injury, which suggests an open fracture. Palpate the entire area around the fracture site, including the entire bone in question, adjacent bones, and at least one joint above and below the injury site. (See

          Immobilization of fracture

          Pain management
         </strong>
         – Adequate analgesia is an important aspect of acute fracture management. Fracture immobilization, ice, elevation of the affected limb, and analgesic medications all reduce pain. For minor fractures,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen
         </a>
         or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) is often sufficient for adequate analgesia; opioids may be required but should be used for the shortest possible duration and in combination with other medications whenever possible. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pain management'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Patient education and follow-up care
         </strong>
         – After initial evaluation and treatment is completed, the clinician must provide clear instructions for injury care and monitoring, including cast or splint care, and a follow-up plan must be in place. For uncomplicated fractures, a return visit should take place within three to seven days. Earlier follow up may be necessary if a cast was applied. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Patient education and follow-up care'
