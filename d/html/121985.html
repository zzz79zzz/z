In most cases, clinical evaluation and appropriate testing identify an underlying cause. Some cases of unexplained cytopenias are associated with clonal hematopoiesis (CH; ie, a population of related blood cells with an acquired gene mutation), but there is no other clinical or pathologic evidence of a hematologic malignancy. When cytopenias remain unexplained despite an appropriate evaluation, they may be described as one of the following (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122233" href="/z/d/graphic/122233.html" rel="external">table 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance (CCUS)</p><p></p><p>This topic will discuss the diagnosis and management of unexplained cytopenias in adults.</p><p>Evaluation of the adult with pancytopenia is discussed separately.

This mutation distinguishes the clonal cells from other blood and bone marrow cells which, instead, have the corresponding inherited ("germline") genotype. The normal version of the gene may be referred to as "wild-type." Other useful terms related to clonality are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2898.html" rel="external">"Genetics: Glossary of terms"</a>.)</p><p>CH is a characteristic of hematologic malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, CH may also be found in individuals who have no detectable hematologic malignancy. Clinically, CH is most often detected by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of DNA. For clinical purposes, CH is reported when the variant allele frequency (VAF; ie, the percentage of mutated DNA sequencing reads at a given genetic locus) exceeds a given threshold, which varies between laboratories (eg, 2, 5, 10 percent). The VAF roughly corresponds to the size of the clone of hematopoietic cells. <em>DNMT3A, TET2, </em>and <em>ASXL1 </em>are the genes that are most often mutated in CH, and these genes are also commonly mutated in MDS, MPNs, AML, and other hematologic malignancies [<a href="#rid1">1-5</a>]. Further description of detection and characterization of CH is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/107866.html" rel="external">"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) and related disorders of clonal hematopoiesis", section on 'Clonality'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1236125067"><span class="h2">Unexplained cytopenia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>"Unexplained cytopenia" refers to a condition characterized by peripheral blood cytopenia whose origin is not attributable to causes detectable with conventional tests or due to concomitant diseases. Evaluation of a patient with cytopenias is described separately.

Some patients with unexplained cytopenias have clonal hematopoiesis (CH) with no other clinical or pathologic evidence of a hematologic malignancy. Evaluation of an adult patient with cytopenias and further discussion of CH are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13938.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with pancytopenia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/107866.html" rel="external">"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) and related disorders of clonal hematopoiesis", section on 'Clonality'</a>.)</p><p>The prevalence of cytopenias rises with age, but the causes are incompletely understood and they likely represent a diverse set of disorders. For some patients, unexplained cytopenias and/or CH may represent an occult malignancy, such as a myelodysplastic syndrome without diagnostic levels of dysplasia or evolving acute myeloid leukemia with a low level of myeloblasts. However, such an assumption is not appropriate for all patients with unexplained cytopenias. Even when CH is detected, the clonal mutation may not actually be responsible for the cytopenias; as an example, the patient could have CH plus a reactive phenomenon, such as the anemia of chronic inflammation.</p><p>Unexplained cytopenias and disorders associated with CH may be envisioned as existing on a spectrum that extends from normalcy to overt malignancy. However, most individuals with unexplained cytopenias do not ultimately develop a hematologic malignancy. The epidemiology and classification of conditions of unexplained cytopenias and their distinction from other hematologic disorders are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> below and <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> below and <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Recognition is important because some of these disorders are associated with an increased risk for transformation to hematologic malignancies, and some are associated with cardiovascular complications, as discussed below and separately. (See <a class="local">'Outcomes'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/107866.html" rel="external">"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) and related disorders of clonal hematopoiesis", section on 'Outcomes'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H936945604"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prevalence of cytopenias increases with age, but less than one-third of cases remain unexplained after an appropriate evaluation. The likelihood of finding mutations associated with myeloid malignancies (ie, clonal hematopoiesis; CH) is higher in a cytopenic population compared with an age-matched population [<a href="#rid2">2,5,6</a>].</p><p>In a large population-based survey, no cause for anemia could be identified in approximately one-third of older adults; however, the current percentage of unexplained anemia is likely lower because this study (1988 to 1994) predated contemporary cytogenetic and molecular analyses [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. There is less information about the prevalence of unexplained leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. The prevalence of anemia in association with aging is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7133.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to anemia in adults", section on 'Older adults'</a>.) </p><p>In a single institution study, 154 of 683 patients referred for evaluation of unexplained cytopenia were given a provisional diagnosis of ICUS, based on cytopenia in ≥1 lineage that did not meet the criteria for myelodysplastic syndromes and could not be explained by any other hematologic or non-hematologic disease [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Among those patients, 56 of 154 (36 percent) carried one or more mutations identified using a panel of 40 myeloid malignancy-associated genes. Patients with these mutations would be classified as CCUS. Descriptions of ICUS and CCUS are provided below.

Our approach follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If a bone marrow examination is planned to evaluate cytopenias (eg, to exclude a hematologic malignancy or aplastic anemia) or for staging purposes (eg, for multiple myeloma), a specimen of either blood or marrow should be sent for NGS testing.

It is also important to note that some gene panels do not detect all mutations associated with hematologic malignancies, so a negative result on an assay for somatic mutations of a solid tumor (eg, Foundation One testing) does not rule out CH.</p><p>Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia are presented separately.

In general, the protocol for follow-up depends on the severity of the cytopenias and associated symptoms and/or complications, the extent and nature of clonal hematopoiesis (CH; reflected by a higher variant allele frequency [VAF]), and concerns on the part of patient and clinician.

We suggest <strong>not</strong> routinely repeating next-generation sequencing testing due to the expense and because at present there are no indications for intervention based on changes in VAF. We also suggest <strong>not</strong> routinely repeating a bone marrow examination in the absence of another indication to perform the procedure, such as worsening cytopenias.</p><p></p><p>It is important to emphasize that CH-associated mutations are acquired (ie, not heritable) and to recognize the emotional burden to patients of knowing they have potential cancer-associated mutations in blood cells. It is important to discuss the risk of developing a hematologic malignancy and the importance of modifying risk factors for cardiovascular complications, as discussed separately. It is unclear whether cytopenias modify the cardiovascular risk seen with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential.
