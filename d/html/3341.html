Chronic daily headache types of long duration (ie, four hours or more) include chronic migraine, chronic tension-type headache, medication overuse headache, hemicrania continua, and new daily persistent headache.</p><p>Medication overuse headache (MOH) is a common problem in clinical practice that needs to be properly managed in order to increase the likelihood of successful chronic daily headache treatment.</p><p>This topic will review the treatment and prognosis of MOH. Other clinical aspects of MOH are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3340.html" rel="external">"Medication overuse headache: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>The remaining subtypes of chronic daily headache are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3333.html" rel="external">"Chronic daily headache: Associated syndromes, evaluation, and management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2132121616"><span class="h1">TREATMENT APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our approach to the management of MOH starts with patient education on the rationale for treatment. Pharmacotherapy involves initiating effective preventive therapy and discontinuing the overused medication [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. For most patients, we start preventive therapy at the same time as or prior to discontinuing the overused medication and add a temporary symptomatic (rescue) medication for breakthrough pain [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Follow-up to monitor efficacy of treatment is important to help prevent relapse.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">PATIENT EDUCATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinicians must educate patients about the detrimental effects of medication overuse [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Patients need to understand that some medications used for the acute treatment of headache have the potential to cause MOH and that overuse can potentially worsen headache symptoms and lead to medication adverse effects or toxicities [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Since most people are not aware of MOH, primary prevention via education and advice is essential [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. A national awareness campaign conducted in Denmark reached 10 percent of the population and improved knowledge about MOH [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Several small studies have demonstrated the importance of MOH patient education for reducing medication intake [<a href="#rid5">5-9</a>]. One of these was a prospective, unblinded trial of 120 patients with migraine plus MOH who were randomly assigned to either strong advice to discontinue the overused medication or to a structured inpatient or outpatient detoxification program [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Patients in all three groups were instructed to stop the overused medication, and all were permitted to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or triptans not more than two days a week for symptomatic relief. Approximately 75 percent of patients in all groups successfully discontinued the overused medications. The trial excluded patients who overused agents containing opioids, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates, and those with coexisting medical or psychiatric illness, and the results may not be generalizable to all patients with MOH.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">DISCONTINUATION OF THE OVERUSED MEDICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Discontinuation of the overused medication or a substantial reduction in the frequency of taking the overused medication is a key component of treating MOH. In a meta-analysis of 17 studies and 1101 patients with MOH, 72 percent reported no headache at all or a reduction in headache days of &gt;50 percent within one to six months following withdrawal therapy [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1223095766"><span class="h2">Weaning strategies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with MOH, discontinuation or substantial reduction of the overused medication is a key goal [<a href="#rid1">1,3</a>]. Preventive (prophylactic) therapy aimed at the suspected background primary headache disorder (eg, migraine) is an integral component of the treatment strategy [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. There are several transitional strategies that may be used to help discontinue the overused medication and reduce headache burden.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Switch from the overused medication to an alternative symptomatic therapy </strong>– A rapid wean may be achieved by stopping the overused medication while starting or optimizing preventive therapy and offering an alternative symptomatic medication to be used ≤2 days each week. This strategy may be appropriate for patients at risk for toxicity from the overused medication who are not at risk for withdrawal with abrupt discontinuation. In a systematic review of treatment strategies for MOH, low-quality evidence supported early discontinuation of the overused medications with use of alternative symptomatic and preventive medications [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. This approach is also supported by evidence from open-label clinical trials [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Continue the overused medication during initial treatment</strong> – Adding effective preventive therapy while initially continuing the overused medication may be appropriate for some patients unable or unwilling to stop the overused medication. This strategy is used when there are not immediate concerns for toxicity or adverse events related to the overused medication. In an open-label trial, 726 patients with MOH were treated with preventive medications and randomized either to continue the overused medication or to switch to another class of medication used ≤2 days/week for symptomatic management [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. At baseline, patients had a mean of 13 moderate to severe headache days over 4 weeks. By weeks 9 to 12, both groups had fewer moderate to severe headache days. The frequency of moderate to severe headache days was similar for patients who continued the overused medication and those who were switched to a different medication (9.3 versus 9.1). The frequency of moderate to severe headaches during the first two weeks was also similar between groups. However, the prevalence of medication overuse and the mean frequency of days using symptomatic medication by week 12 was lower in the group that was switched to a different medication. Adverse events were similar for both groups.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Add additional temporary medication (bridge therapy) </strong>– Bridge therapy consists of adding a medication to reduce the frequency and severity of headaches that occur during the initial period following discontinuation of the overused medication. It is typically used to provide additional symptomatic relief during the initial transition for patients with severe or frequent headaches who are felt to be unlikely to succeed with a treatment plan consisting of discontinuing the overused medication along with symptomatic and preventive therapy. (See <a class="local">'Bridge therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Bridge (transitional) therapy may be useful to reduce the detrimental effects of analgesic overuse, although there are only limited supportive data. Screening and intervening for comorbid psychiatric and substance use disorders may also help guide therapy [<a href="#rid11">11,15,16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Discontinue the overused medication before starting prophylactic treatment </strong>– Stopping the overused medication for two months without the use of preventive medication is an alternative strategy that has been observed to improve headache burden. We do not use this strategy because patients may have worsening headaches after acutely stopping the overused medication and may be unable to adhere to the protocol.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In an open-label controlled trial, patients with MOH undergoing detoxification over two months were randomly assigned to receive either no acute headache medication or acute medication restricted to two days per week [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Of 58 patients who completed six-month follow-up, patients assigned to no acute treatment had a greater reduction in headache days per month (46 versus 22 percent) and a higher rate of reversion to episodic headache (70 versus 42 percent) compared with patients assigned to limited acute treatment two days per week. The number of patients who initiated preventive treatment was similar in both groups. Detoxification without acute treatment was assessed to be the most effective detoxification strategy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Some observational data suggest that discontinuing acute headache medications may result in a responsive state amenable to prophylactic intervention [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In an uncontrolled prospective study of 175 patients with probable MOH who discontinued acute headache medications and complied with a two-month medication-free period before starting prophylactic treatment, approximately one-half had a significant reduction in headache frequency [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The remaining 50 percent of patients who showed no initial response at two months improved after onset of prophylactic therapy with a reported 26 percent reduction in headache frequency. However, in several randomized trials, concomitant prophylactic therapy was similarly effective for patients who were overusing medications and those who were not [<a href="#rid18">18-25</a>].</p><p></p><p>After treatment of MOH, an ongoing headache treatment regimen is needed for acute and preventive therapy since most patients will continue to have intermittent headaches. Close follow-up after discontinuation of the overused medications is imperative to evaluate progress and prevent relapse. (See <a class="local">'Follow-up and relapse prevention'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Outpatient and inpatient settings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Withdrawal of overused acute medications can be accomplished on an outpatient or inpatient basis [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Most patients can be managed as outpatients. Outpatient discontinuation is particularly appropriate for patients who are highly motivated and are not taking frequent barbiturates, opioids, or other potentially addictive medications [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p>A multicenter observational study of patients with MOH compared inpatient detoxification from the overused medication plus administration of alternate medications with outpatient detoxification plus prescription medications [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. At six months, among those completing the study (n = 257), two-thirds of patients were no longer overusing acute medications and had reverted to an episodic headache pattern (ie, fewer than 15 headache days per month). Inpatient and outpatient strategies were both effective, though there was a higher dropout rate in the outpatient group.</p><p>Significant complications may occur as a consequence of drug dependency when withdrawing from opioids, benzodiazepines and barbiturates, and the choice between outpatient and inpatient withdrawal of these agents remains an area of debate [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Some experts favor inpatient withdrawal with close observation and medical monitoring in the first several days [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. However, it is often reasonable to try outpatient treatment first unless serious withdrawal problems develop or are considered likely.</p><p>In addition to the number and type of overused substances, variables influencing the choice between outpatient and inpatient management include social support structure, patient motivation, medical stability, presence of coexisting medical illness, psychological and psychiatric comorbidities, and need for patient monitoring during administration of medical therapies [<a href="#rid15">15,29</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3931437820"><span class="h3">Discontinuation of medications other than barbiturates, opioids, or benzodiazepines</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our suggested outpatient approach for discontinuation of overused medications other than for patients using frequent barbiturates, opioids, or benzodiazepines includes [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Start preventive therapy or optimize existing preventive therapy and do one of the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Discontinue the overused medication and switch to an alternative medication from a different class. Limit the use of acute medications to no more than two days per week, <strong>or</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Taper the acute medication gradually as the headache frequency decreases in response to effective preventive therapy</p><p></p><p>For patients who are expected to be unsuccessful with the strategy of preventive therapy combined with discontinuing the overused medication either by slow taper or by switching to alternative symptomatic therapy, bridge therapy with a long-acting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or steroid can be added to the treatment regimen. (See <a class="local">'Bridge therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H792094785"><span class="h3">Discontinuation of barbiturates, opioids, or benzodiazepines</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>With overuse of barbiturates, opioids, or benzodiazepines, the pace of discontinuation depends on the amount and frequency of usage. Abrupt outpatient withdrawal is routinely done in clinical practice if dosage of the offending agent is not very high. However, we suggest a gradual taper when these agents are being used frequently or at high doses. The taper can usually be accomplished in two to four weeks. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients discontinuing butalbital, we suggest a <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9763" href="/d/drug information/9763.html" rel="external">phenobarbital</a> taper for seizure prophylaxis, particularly when butalbital is stopped abruptly or when high doses are being used. Our preferred regimen is 30 mg of phenobarbital per day for every 100 mg of butalbital that was being used, given that each 100 mg of butalbital is pharmacologically equivalent to 30 mg of phenobarbital. Assuming the total daily dose of butalbital is no higher than 300 mg, the recommended maximum, the initial phenobarbital dose should not exceed 90 mg and can be tapered by 30 mg every three to seven days [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When there is concern for opioid withdrawal symptoms, treatment with a once-weekly transdermal <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9285" href="/d/drug information/9285.html" rel="external">clonidine</a> patch (0.1 to 0.2 mg/24 hours) for one to two weeks may help.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bridge therapy with a long-acting NSAID daily and initiation or optimization of preventive therapy is suggested to accompany discontinuation of these agents.

In addition to increased headache, withdrawal symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, restlessness, anxiety, nervousness, and disturbed sleep [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. Withdrawal symptoms typically last 2 to 10 days [<a href="#rid10">10</a>] but occasionally can persist for as long as two to four weeks [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>The duration and severity of withdrawal headache depends on the type of overused analgesic. In one prospective study of 95 patients, the mean duration of withdrawal headache was 4.1 days for triptans, 6.7 days for ergots, and 9.5 days for analgesics (most of which were combined with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9291" href="/d/drug information/9291.html" rel="external">codeine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9213" href="/d/drug information/9213.html" rel="external">caffeine</a>, or barbiturates) [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Overall, withdrawal from triptan-induced MOH was less severe than withdrawal from other analgesics.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">BRIDGE THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bridge therapy, also known as transitional therapy, is used to reduce the frequency and severity of headaches that occur during the initial period following discontinuation of the overused medication. Bridge therapy is typically used to provide additional symptomatic relief during the initial transition for patients with severe or frequent headaches who are felt to be unlikely to succeed with a treatment plan consisting of discontinuing the overused medication along with symptomatic and preventive therapy. Although there are inadequate published data to confirm that bridge therapy is effective, strategies that may have some merit include the short-term use of certain oral (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9682" href="/d/drug information/9682.html" rel="external">naproxen</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9999" href="/d/drug information/9999.html" rel="external">tizanidine</a>, glucocorticoids) and intravenous (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9363" href="/d/drug information/9363.html" rel="external">dihydroergotamine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9816" href="/d/drug information/9816.html" rel="external">prochlorperazine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10035" href="/d/drug information/10035.html" rel="external">valproic acid</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>) medications.</p><p>The data supporting these strategies are largely from case series, retrospective chart reviews, prospective uncontrolled studies, and expert opinion [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Discontinuation of the overused medication'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a study with prospective data collected from 240 patients with MOH who were treated with drug withdrawal and preventive therapy, the one-year rate of treatment success (defined as absence of chronic headache and medication overuse) was 57 percent [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]. Independent predictors of unfavorable treatment outcome at one year were a higher frequency of primary headache, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9416" href="/d/drug information/9416.html" rel="external">ergotamine</a> overuse, and a greater degree of headache-related disability at the time of MOH diagnosis. Similarly, a longitudinal study of hospitalized patients with chronic migraine and MOH undergoing withdrawal therapy found that a high baseline headache frequency predicted MOH relapse requiring another withdrawal treatment at one year [<a href="#rid60">60</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a prospective study of 96 patients with MOH, complete data sets at four years were available for 75 patients [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. The relapse rate at six months, one year, and four years was 31, 41, and 45 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. Patients with underlying migraine headache had a lower relapse rate than those with tension-type headache or combined migraine and tension-type headache, but small numbers prevent definitive conclusions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a retrospective report that analyzed outcomes for 67 patients with MOH after multidisciplinary headache treatment at a tertiary center, the reduction in total headache frequency for those with underlying tension-type headache and those with underlying migraine was 50 and 72 percent [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]. These findings suggest that patients with background migraine have a better outcome following withdrawal from MOH than those with underlying tension-type headache.</p><p></p><p>Outcome at one year after MOH treatment may be a reliable predictor of long-term remission and could be an important time to detect those at risk of MOH relapse. In a prospective cohort study at a specialized headache center, 240 patients with MOH were treated and included in a one-year follow-up study and then subsequently followed for up to 10 or more years (median follow-up 3 years) [<a href="#rid63">63</a>]. At the end of follow-up, approximately 43 percent were in remission. The most important predictors of remission were lower number of headache days per month at one year (hazard ratio [HR] 0.94, 95% CI 0.88-0.99) and efficient initial drug withdrawal (HR 0.14, 95% CI 0.04-0.44).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10184582"><span class="h1">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, "The Basics" and "Beyond the Basics." The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on "patient info" and the keyword(s) of interest.) </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Beyond the Basics topics (see  <a class="medical medical_patient" href="/d/html/720.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Headache treatment in adults (Beyond the Basics)"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment approach </strong>– Our approach to the management of medication overuse headache (MOH) involves patient education on the rationale for treatment, initiation of effective preventive therapy, discontinuation of the overused medication, and follow-up to prevent relapse. (See <a class="local">'Treatment approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Strategies for discontinuing the overused medication </strong>– For patients with MOH, discontinuation or substantial reduction of the overused medication is a key goal. In most instances, the choice of discontinuation strategy depends on patient preference and involves shared decision-making. (See <a class="local">'Discontinuation of the overused medication'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Abrupt discontinuation involves stopping the overused medication while starting or optimizing preventive therapy and offering an alternative symptomatic medication to be used ≤2 days each week. This strategy may be appropriate for patients at risk for toxicity from the overused medication who are not at risk for withdrawal with abrupt discontinuation. (See <a class="local">'Weaning strategies'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A slow taper may be used after a transition of initially continuing the overused medication until symptoms improve with effective preventive therapy. This strategy may be appropriate for patients unable or unwilling to stop the overused medication when there are not immediate concerns for toxicity or adverse events and for patients taking barbiturates, opioids, or benzodiazepines who are at risk for withdrawal with abrupt discontinuation. (See <a class="local">'Weaning strategies'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">For patients taking barbiturates, opioids, or benzodiazepines frequently or at high doses, we suggest a slow taper over two to four weeks rather than abrupt discontinuation (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). For patients discontinuing butalbital, we use <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9763" href="/d/drug information/9763.html" rel="external">phenobarbital</a> at 30 mg daily for each 100 mg of butalbital that was being used and taper phenobarbital by 30 mg every two to three days. For patients discontinuing opioids who are at risk for withdrawal symptoms, we used a <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9285" href="/d/drug information/9285.html" rel="external">clonidine</a> patch for one to two weeks. (See <a class="local">'Discontinuation of barbiturates, opioids, or benzodiazepines'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bridge therapy </strong>– For patients with severe and/or frequent headaches who are unlikely to be successful with discontinuing the overused medication when combined with preventive and symptomatic therapy, we suggest adding bridge therapy (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Bridge therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For outpatients, our preferred choices for bridge therapy are long-acting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9682" href="/d/drug information/9682.html" rel="external">naproxen</a>) or oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a>. (See <a class="local">'Naproxen'</a> above and <a class="local">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For inpatients, our preferred choices for bridge therapy are intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9363" href="/d/drug information/9363.html" rel="external">dihydroergotamine</a> plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9642" href="/d/drug information/9642.html" rel="external">metoclopramide</a>, intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9816" href="/d/drug information/9816.html" rel="external">prochlorperazine</a>, intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10035" href="/d/drug information/10035.html" rel="external">valproate</a>, or intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9639" href="/d/drug information/9639.html" rel="external">methylprednisolone</a>. (See <a class="local">'Dihydroergotamine'</a> above and <a class="local">'Prochlorperazine'</a> above and <a class="local">'Valproate'</a> above and <a class="local">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preventive therapy </strong>– For patients with MOH, we suggest starting preventive treatment before or at the same time as withdrawing the overused medication (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Preventive therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preventing relapse </strong>– To prevent MOH relapse, triptan, ergotamine-dihydroergotamine, or combination analgesic use should be limited to nine or fewer days a month on average and NSAIDs to 14 or fewer days a month. Butalbital-containing analgesics and opioids should be avoided because of their high risk for MOH.
