         Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a class of medications used for analgesic and antiinflammatory benefits. NSAIDs can induce several different forms of kidney injury including hemodynamically mediated acute kidney injury (AKI); electrolyte and acid-base disorders; acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), which may be accompanied by the nephrotic syndrome; and papillary necrosis  (

         Adverse kidney events occur in approximately 1 to 5 percent of all patients using NSAIDs [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Because of the large number of patients who take NSAIDs (estimates of more than 70 million prescriptions and 30 billion over-the-counter doses annually in the United States), this translates to upwards of 2.5 million patients experiencing a nephrotoxic event annually [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Use of NSAIDs increases the risk of AKI by nearly twofold [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ], and the risk diminishes after cessation of the drug [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. AKI can occur with any class of traditional, nonselective NSAID or cyclooxygenase (COX) 2-specific NSAIDs [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-10
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in a nested, case-control study that included 121,722 older patients, an increased risk of hospitalization for AKI within 30 days was associated with initiation of

          10

          Chronic kidney disease –
         </strong>
         Chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially stage 3 or worse (ie, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         ), is a major risk factor for NSAID-induced AKI. The important role of preexisting CKD in the relationship between NSAID use and GFR was illustrated by an observational study of 1522 patients with CKD stages 3, 4, and 5 that quantified increases in mean eGFR after NSAID discontinuation [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. In this study, implementation of mandatory reporting of eGFR to clinicians was accompanied by a 10 percent reduction in NSAID prescriptions, which in turn was associated with increases in mean eGFR. The improvements in eGFR were greatest for those with more severe CKD at baseline (from 46 to 47 among patients with eGFRs of 30 to 59, from 24 to 27 among patients with eGFRs of 15 to 29, and from 12 to 26 among patients with eGFRs of &lt;15 mL/min/1.73 m

         – Patients with effective arterial volume depletion due to heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, or cirrhosis are also at higher risk for NSAID-induced AKI. In a nested, case-controlled study of 386,916 patients, those who used NSAIDs and had heart failure had a higher risk of AKI compared with those who used NSAIDs but did not have heart failure (RRs of 7.63 and 3.34, respectively) [

         – The risk for AKI is also elevated when NSAIDs are combined with maintenance calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) therapy in recipients of solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplants. AKI occurred in 5 of 41 patients exposed to CNIs and NSAIDs compared with 7 of 126 transplant recipients only given CNIs (12 versus 6 percent) [

          16,17

         NSAID inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes with subsequent reduction in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis can lead to reversible kidney ischemia, a decline in glomerular hydraulic pressure (the major driving force for glomerular filtration), and AKI [

         In the kidney, COXs are locally produced at many sites, including glomerular and vascular endothelium, the medullary and cortical collecting tubules, and medullary interstitial cells. COX-1 is expressed ubiquitously in most tissues, while COX-2 expression is low at basal levels but increases with stimulation in the setting of acute or chronic inflammation [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23

         Kidney PGs are primarily local vasodilators. In the setting of hypotension and reduced kidney perfusion from vasoconstriction stimulated by angiotensin II, norepinephrine, vasopressin, or endothelin, PG synthesis is increased to maintain kidney perfusion and minimize ischemia [

          25-28
         </a>

         Hemodynamically mediated AKI due to NSAIDs occurs via attenuation of PG-mediated renal vasodilation. In healthy patients, PGs play little role in renal hemodynamics. However, PG synthesis is increased in the setting of prolonged renal vasoconstriction, which serves to protect the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). PG synthesis is increased in conditions associated with NSAID-induced AKI  (

          'Risk factors'

         Patients with hemodynamically mediated AKI due to NSAIDs generally present with an increase in the plasma creatinine that is usually detected incidentally during an evaluation of an unrelated problem. The increase in the plasma creatinine concentration usually occurs within the first three to seven days of NSAID use, which is the time required for attainment of steady-state drug levels and therefore maximum inhibition of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis [
         <a href="#rid40">

         NSAID-mediated AKI should be suspected in any patient with AKI and a history of recent NSAID use. Among such patients, the objective of the initial evaluation is to establish whether NSAID use is the likely cause of AKI and, if so, to assess the type of NSAID-induced AKI. In patients who present with an increased plasma creatinine in the setting of NSAID use, hemodynamically mediated AKI is the most common cause. However, AKI can be caused by or complicate other NSAID-associated kidney lesions such as acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), membranous nephropathy, or minimal change disease.

         <strong>
          Assess for other causes of AKI
         </strong>
         – Because AKI is not always due to NSAIDs, patients should be evaluated thoroughly for other potential causes of AKI using the same approach as that for patients without NSAID exposure. For example, a history should assess for potential exposure to other nephrotoxins and for any recent volume-depleting illness, and a physical examination should determine current volume status. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

          Evaluate timing of NSAID use and AKI
         </strong>
         – It is important to establish the chronicity of NSAID use and the duration of the increased plasma creatinine, if possible. For individuals who have been on a stable dose of NSAIDs and have not developed a recent condition predisposing to AKI, hemodynamically mediated AKI is less likely than AIN. Hemodynamically mediated AKI due to NSAIDs is acute, whereas AIN may present with a more subacute, or even chronic, course.

         – The urinalysis may distinguish between NSAID-induced hemodynamically mediated AKI and other causes of NSAID-related AKI. Whereas the urine sediment is generally bland among patients with hemodynamically mediated AKI, urine white blood cells (WBCs) and WBC casts are suggestive of AIN. A urinalysis also may identify a superimposed acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Among patients with ATN, the sediment may contain renal tubular epithelial cells, renal tubular epithelial cell casts, or muddy brown granular casts.

          Kidney ultrasound

         A kidney biopsy is generally reserved for patients whose kidney disease violates the natural history of NSAID-induced AKI or for patients who have features of AIN or a glomerular lesion, such as nephrotic-range proteinuria, hematuria with dysmorphic red blood cells, and/or red blood cell casts.

         The diagnosis of hemodynamically mediated AKI due to NSAIDs is suggested by the history of recent NSAID use, the absence of significant proteinuria (&lt;500 mg/day), and a bland urine sediment. The diagnosis is confirmed when recovery of kidney function occurs after NSAIDs are discontinued.
        </p>
        <p>
         The time course to recovery can be dependent on underlying kidney disease and any additional confounding kidney injury (such as ATN). If AKI is truly hemodynamic in nature and due to NSAID use, recovery should begin within 24 to 72 hours. Failure to recover or progression despite removal of NSAIDs suggests an alternate diagnosis.

         In individuals without kidney disease, NSAIDs should generally be avoided in those with volume depletion, heart failure, cirrhosis, and/or hypercalcemia. These high PG states are especially strong risk factors for hemodynamically mediated AKI.
        </p>
        <p>
         In those without kidney disease who have other risk factors for NSAID-induced AKI  (

          table 2
         </a>
         ), NSAIDs should be used with caution. If such patients take NSAIDs long term (ie, ≥ seven days), a serum creatinine should be checked two to three weeks after starting NSAIDs and then every three months afterward. An increase in creatinine should prompt NSAID discontinuation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinicians and patients also need to be aware of medications that may increase the risk of AKI when used concomitantly with NSAIDs. Patients should not take NSAIDs prior to the administration of other nephrotoxic drugs or before procedures involving radiocontrast. In one retrospective observational study, a large number of patients who developed contrast-associated AKI had been taking NSAIDs prior to contrast exposure [

         Topical NSAIDs are a reasonable option for the treatment of musculoskeletal or arthritic pain in patients who should not take oral NSAIDs because of an elevated risk of NSAID-mediated AKI. The exceptions are for patients with nephrotic syndrome or for those with a history of NSAID-induced acute interstitial nephritis (AIN); in such patients, we avoid all formulations of NSAIDs. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Nephrotic syndrome'

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients who have stages 4 and 5 CKD, volume depletion, heart failure, cirrhosis, or hypercalcemia, we monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes closely after the initiation of topical NSAID therapy. If these laboratory parameters remain stable after several weeks of topical NSAID use, monitoring can return to the usual interval.
        </p>
        <p>
         Topical NSAID formulations are safer than oral NSAIDs for patients with CKD and other risk factors for hemodynamically mediated AKI because only approximately 1 to 2 percent of topical NSAIDs are systemically absorbed [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44

          45,46
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, in a population-based cohort study of older patients (mean age 74 years) with high rates of CKD and diuretic and ACE inhibitor/ARB use, AKI occurred at higher rates in topical NSAID users compared with nonusers (approximately 15 versus 10 percent) [

         Treatment of NSAID-associated hemodynamically mediated AKI is no different than that of other forms of AKI. The offending agent needs to be stopped immediately. Volume resuscitation should be provided in states of hypovolemia and continued based on reassessment of volume status including blood pressure/pulse, urine output, and other parameters. Kidney replacement therapy is rarely required but may be needed initially when severe AKI has occurred and there are serious electrolyte and acid-base disturbances present.

         </span>
         In addition to hemodynamically mediated AKI, it has been proposed that long-term, regular NSAID use may be associated with an increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), perhaps due to papillary necrosis or chronic interstitial nephritis similar to that seen with other analgesics.
        </p>
        <p>
         Long-term NSAID use also may accelerate the progression of preexisting CKD. Among older patients with CKD, NSAID users are more likely to have deterioration of kidney function over time compared with patients who do not use NSAIDs chronically, and higher doses of NSAIDs are associated with a greater risk of a decline in kidney function [

         – Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a class of medications used for analgesic and antiinflammatory benefits. NSAIDs can induce several different forms of kidney injury including hemodynamically mediated acute kidney injury (AKI); electrolyte and acid-base disorders; acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), which may be accompanied by the nephrotic syndrome; and papillary necrosis  (

          Risk factors for hemodynamically mediated AKI
         </strong>
         – All nonselective NSAIDs or cyclooxygenase (COX) 2-specific NSAIDs may cause AKI via the attenuation of renal vasodilation. Higher doses of NSAIDs are associated with a greater risk of AKI. Additional risk factors include chronic kidney disease (CKD); volume depletion from aggressive diuresis, vomiting, or diarrhea, or effective arterial volume depletion due to heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, or cirrhosis; a variety of medications and radiocontrast; older age; and hypercalcemia  (

          Clinical presentation
         </strong>
         – Patients generally present with an incidentally detected increase in the plasma creatinine. Urinalysis is usually negative for hematuria, pyuria, and proteinuria. The urine sediment may contain hyaline casts and, if acute tubular necrosis (ATN) has developed, renal tubular epithelial cell casts, renal tubular epithelial cells, or granular casts. (See

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Among all patients with AKI, we generally obtain a kidney ultrasound to exclude possible urinary tract obstruction. If the history is overwhelmingly consistent with NSAID initiation or subacute or chronic use, we avoid other costly tests as generally the diagnosis of hemodynamically mediated AKI is made when recovery of kidney function occurs after the NSAID is discontinued. Failure to recover within three to seven days or progression despite removal of NSAIDs warrants a biopsy. Kidney biopsy may also be done in patients who have features of AIN or a glomerular lesion, such as nephrotic-range proteinuria or hematuria with dysmorphic red blood cells or red blood cell casts.
