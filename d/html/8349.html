          Nurse-delivered brief behavioral treatment for insomnia (October 2023)

        <p>
         A growing body of evidence supports the use of brief, behaviorally-focused treatments for insomnia, which involve fewer sessions than traditional cognitive behavioral therapy and can be delivered by clinicians with varied levels of expertise. In an open-label randomized trial in England involving nearly 650 adults with insomnia disorder recruited from 35 general practices, four sessions of nurse-delivered sleep restriction therapy (

        <p>
         In patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), weight loss is likely to improve functional status and quality of life, but achieving weight loss in this group of patients is difficult. In a recent trial of more than 500 patients with HFpEF, patients randomly assigned to treatment with

          Low awareness of meat allergy caused by "alpha-gal syndrome" (September 2023)

        </p>
        <p>
         Allergy to galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose, a carbohydrate allergen found in all mammalian meat except that of primates, causes allergic reactions to meats like beef, pork, and lamb, as well as to an array of other products, medications, and medical devices made with mammalian tissues. This allergy, first reported in 2009 and termed "alpha-gal syndrome," develops following the bites of certain ticks and causes reactions that are uncharacteristically delayed (ie, several hours after ingestion). A common presentation is anaphylaxis developing in the middle of the night after a meat-containing evening meal. Although the prevalence is increasing worldwide, a web-based survey of 1,500 health care professionals in the United States revealed that 42 percent had never heard of the disorder [

        <p>
         Current guidelines from the American Heart Association and World Health Organization recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity weekly. Two recent studies suggest that how one exercises matters more than when. In one prospective cohort of over 500,000 individuals, combining twice-weekly muscle strengthening activity to at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was associated with optimal reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [

         ]. In a separate study of nearly 90,000 individuals, among those who had at least 150 minutes of weekly physical activity, "weekend warrior" patterns of exercise (at least 50 percent of activity occurring over one to two days) and "regular" patterns (physical activity distributed more evenly during the week) were associated with similar reductions in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation compared with inactivity [

Mpox vaccine has also been added and is recommended for adults of all ages who are at risk for infection. Other changes include updates to COVID-19, polio, and meningococcal vaccine recommendations.

In a placebo-controlled randomized trial of 4800 children (age 5 to 36 months) in four African countries, 12-month efficacy of a three-dose vaccine series against clinical malaria was 75 percent at sites with seasonal transmission and 68 percent at sites with year-round transmission; these data are under peer review prior to publication [

Together with the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine (recommended by the WHO in 2021), this approval is expected to facilitate sufficient vaccine supply to benefit all children living in areas where malaria is a public health risk.

In addition, the ACIP now states that egg allergy alone no longer necessitates additional safety measures for influenza vaccination, including with egg-based vaccines, beyond those recommended for any recipient of any vaccine, regardless of severity of previous reaction to egg. All vaccines should be administered in settings where personnel and equipment needed for prompt recognition and treatment of acute hypersensitivity reactions are available. This is consistent with our previous guidance. (See

         Major depressive disorder is a leading cause of disability in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 20 percent; however, it remains underdetected and undertreated.

In a 2023 study in over 54,000 women 70 years and older who had recently undergone screening, the percent of overdiagnosed breast cancer cases increased with age from 31 percent among women aged 70 to 74 years to 54 percent among women aged 85 years and older [

        <p>
         In patients who participate in competitive athletics and have a diagnosis that increases the risk of fatal arrhythmias, return to sport participation may provoke an arrhythmia or risk damage to an internal cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). In a recent single-center report of 76 patients with a genetic cardiomyopathy that increased the risk of sudden death (32 percent with an ICD) who underwent tailored treatment and a shared decision-making process before returning to elite sport participation, there were four arrhythmic events and no fatalities during 200 patient-years of observation [

In patients with an increased risk of fatal arrhythmias, we advise against participation in competitive sports, but some athletes may choose to participate based on their values and preferences following a shared decision-making process.

         There is evidence from several randomized trials that early initiation of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for select patients with high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor ischemic stroke reduces the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke. The evidence comes from trials that started DAPT within 12 to 24 hours of symptom onset.

         Major depressive disorder is a leading cause of disability in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 20 percent; however, it remains underdetected and undertreated. Updated guidelines from the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommend screening for depression in adults (ages 19 years and above), including pregnant and postpartum women, based upon a systematic review that suggested a net benefit from screening [

         The psychedelic psilocybin is being evaluated for treatment-resistant unipolar major depression and may provide a relatively rapid and durable response. In a trial of 104 patients, a single dose of psilocybin resulted in greater improvements in depressive symptoms than a single dose of niacin (the active placebo control); this effect occurred as early as day 8 and persisted until the end of the trial, at day 43 [

Additional trials are necessary to determine who is most likely to benefit from psychedelics, the optimal dose and number of psilocybin sessions, type of patient preparation, whether and what type of accompanying psychotherapy should be administered, and how long the benefit persists.

Also promoted was ambulatory management in select patients with adequate outpatient support. We agree with these recommendations. (See

         Endometrial ablation is an alternative to hysterectomy in selected premenopausal patients with heavy menstrual bleeding. Most ablations are performed using a non-resectoscopic technique; however, the long-term efficacy of this approach is unclear. In a meta-analysis of 53 studies including over 48,000 patients managed with non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation (NREA), the rates of subsequent hysterectomy were 4 percent at 12 months, 8 to 12 percent at 18 to 60 months, and 21 percent at 120 months [

         Cerebral blood flow may increase in chronically hypoxemic fetuses to compensate for the decrease in available oxygen and can be assessed by the cerebroplacental ratio (CPR; middle cerebral artery pulsatility index divided by the umbilical artery pulsatility index). However, increasing evidence indicates that use of the CPR does not reduce perinatal mortality in low-risk pregnancies. In a randomized trial comparing fetal growth assessment plus revealed versus concealed CPR in over 11,000 low-risk pregnancies at term, knowledge of CPR combined with a recommendation for delivery if the CPR was &lt;5th percentile did not reduce perinatal mortality compared with usual care (concealed group) [

         Intrauterine balloon tamponade and vacuum-induced uterine compression are the most common devices used for intrauterine postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) control in patients with atony, but it is unclear which device is superior as few comparative studies have been performed.

In a multicenter, cluster-randomized trial including over 20,000 patients with one prior cesarean birth, a multifaceted intervention (patient decision support, use of a calculator to assess chances of a vaginal birth after cesarean [VBAC], sonographic measurement of myometrial thickness, clinician training in best intrapartum practices during TOLAC) reduced perinatal and major maternal morbidity composite outcomes compared with usual care [

         It is well established that contemporary neuraxial labor analgesia does not increase the overall risk of cesarean or instrument-assisted vaginal delivery. However, a new retrospective database study of over 600,000 deliveries in the Netherlands reported that epidural labor analgesia was associated with an increased risk of emergency delivery (cesarean or instrument-assisted vaginal) compared with alternative analgesia (13 versus 7 percent) [

         Intrauterine tamponade (with a balloon, packing, or vacuum) may be used to manage patients with postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) resulting from uterine atony that is not controlled by uterotonic medications and uterine massage. However, outcome data regarding vacuum-induced tamponade are limited. A study of data from a postmarketing registry of over 500 patients with PPH and isolated atony treated with vacuum-induced tamponade reported that the device controlled bleeding without treatment escalation or bleeding recurrence in 88 percent following cesarean birth and 96 percent following vaginal birth, typically within five minutes [

In a recent well-designed randomized trial of over 500 patients with cervical length &lt;20 mm, placement of an Arabin pessary at 16 to 23 weeks of gestation also demonstrated no benefit over usual care; the rate of PTB or fetal death &lt;37 weeks was nearly the same for both groups [

        <p>
         Perinatally acquired hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the United States has increased sharply since 2010. New guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends early testing for infants with perinatal exposure to HCV (

         ● Test for HCV RNA during early infancy after two months of age, and ideally before six months of age.
        </p>
        <p>
         ● After 18 months of age, test any infant who has not previously been tested by measuring anti-HCV antibodies, with reflexive testing for HCV RNA.
         <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         A negative HCV RNA result at any time point after two months of age virtually excludes HCV infection and further testing is not required. Children with a positive HCV RNA test before three years of age should have repeat testing for HCV RNA before initiating antiviral therapy to determine whether they have spontaneously cleared the infection. This new guidance is consistent with our previous recommendations for early testing for infants with perinatal exposure to HCV. (See

         There are few large-scale studies of pelvic avulsion fractures in children. A retrospective review of over 700 children with pelvic or hip avulsion fractures from a single tertiary care hospital reported the average patient age was just over 14 years and nearly 80 percent were sustained by males [

Most injuries were sustained while the patient was running or kicking during sport, most often football (soccer).

          Ultrasound guidance for lumbar puncture in children (August 2023)
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         Previous studies suggest that ultrasound guidance for lumbar puncture (LP) in children increases the chance of success. In a meta-analysis of seven randomized trials (over 700 infants and children), overall LP success rate was higher with ultrasound guidance compared with the use of external landmarks and palpation alone, but the difference was not significant  [
         <a href="#rid72">
          72
         </a>
         ]. Subgroup analysis of five studies (over 520 children) demonstrated significantly higher first attempt success in infants undergoing ultrasound guidance, but not in older children. The overall quality of the evidence was considered low. Based on these findings, when performed by a trained provider, ultrasound guidance prior to LP may be useful in infants. Ultrasound guidance in older children is also reasonable, but evidence of benefit in these patients is lacking. (See

         Evidence is limited for the risk of invasive bacterial illness (IBI) in febrile young infants &lt;60 days old with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In one cohort study of 163 well-appearing febrile infants ≤60 days old (36 neonates) who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by multiplex viral panel testing, none had IBI compared with 0.5 percent of 448 infants with other viral infection (none had meningitis) and 1.3 percent of 320 infants with no viral infection on testing (one with meningitis) [
         <a href="#rid73">
          73
         </a>
         ]. For well-appearing febrile infants ≤60 days old with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2, the risk of IBI appears to be low. For well-appearing infants 29 to 60 days, we suggest, at minimum, urinalysis and urine culture. It is also reasonable to obtain additional studies according to the American Academy of Pediatric Clinical Practice Guideline (

          Infertility and autism spectrum disorder (December 2023)

        <p>
         Patients with infertility often ask about the impact of the disorder and its treatment on risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. In a large population-based cohort study comparing ASD risk among children whose parents had subfertility (an infertility consultation without treatment), infertility treatment, or neither (unassisted conception), children in the subfertility and infertility treatment groups had a small increased risk of ASD compared with unassisted conception but the absolute risk was low (2.5 to 2.7 per 1000 person-years versus 1.9 per 1000 person-years with unassisted conception) [
         <a href="#rid74">
          74
         </a>
         ]. The increased risk was similar in the subfertile and infertility treatment groups, suggesting that infertility treatment was not a major risk factor. Obstetrical and neonatal factors (eg, preterm birth) appeared to mediate a sizeable proportion of the increased risk for ASD. (See

         Patients with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) have historically been advised to delay midurethral sling (MUS) surgery until after childbearing because of concerns for worsening SUI symptoms following delivery. In a meta-analysis of patients with MUS surgery who were followed for a mean of nearly 10 years, similar low SUI recurrence and reoperation rates were reported for the 381 patients with and the 860 patients without subsequent childbirth [
