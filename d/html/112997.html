In addition, the symptoms cause significant distress and/or dysfunction. The somatic symptoms may or may not be explained by a recognized medical condition.</p><p>The diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder was introduced with publication of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) in 2013 [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. In addition, DSM-5 eliminated the diagnoses of somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriasis, and pain disorder; most of the patients who previously received these diagnoses are now diagnosed in DSM-5 with somatic symptom disorder.</p><p>This topic reviews the assessment, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder.

The clinical features and diagnostic criteria are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/109552.html" rel="external">"Somatic symptom disorder: Epidemiology and clinical presentation", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a class="local">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below.)</p><p>The DSM-5 diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder has largely consolidated and supplanted the diagnoses of somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriasis, and pain disorder, which were included in the prior edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) and were collectively referred to as somatoform disorders [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>]. The somatoform disorders were eliminated in DSM-5.</p><p>Most of the patients who previously received the DSM-IV-TR somatoform diagnoses are now diagnosed in DSM-5 with somatic symptom disorder [<a href="#rid1">1,4</a>]. As an example, the term hypochondriasis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68413" href="/z/d/graphic/68413.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) in DSM-IV-TR described patients who misinterpreted one or more bodily symptoms and believed that they had a serious disease or were preoccupied with fear of a disease, despite appropriate medical evaluation and reassurance [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Among patients previously diagnosed with hypochondriasis, it appears that most are subsumed under the DSM-5 diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder (if physical complaints are prominent) and fewer under the DSM-5 diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder (if physical complaints are minimal or nonexistent) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A retrospective study identified patients who initially received a DSM-IV diagnosis of hypochondriasis (n = 58); post-hoc application of DSM-5 criteria found that 76 percent met criteria for somatic symptom disorder and 24 percent met criteria for illness anxiety disorder [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A prospective study of 59 patients who met DSM-IV criteria for hypochondriasis found that somatic symptom disorder was present in 56 percent, illness anxiety disorder in 36 percent, and comorbid somatic symptom disorder plus illness anxiety disorder in 8 percent [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p>Additional information about illness anxiety disorder, including its diagnostic criteria  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef104206" href="/z/d/graphic/104206.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14827.html" rel="external">"Illness anxiety disorder: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>A review by the workgroup that developed the DSM-5 diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder found that the construct, descriptive, and predictive validity of somatic symptom disorder were superior to the validity of the DSM-IV somatoform disorders [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In addition, inter-rater and test-retest reliability for somatic symptom disorder are good to very good [<a href="#rid2">2,6,7</a>].</p><p>Although the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder has been criticized as overinclusive and fraught with the potential for false positives [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], it appears that somatic symptom disorder may be a more restrictive diagnosis than the DSM-IV-TR somatoform diagnoses that it replaced. A study of patients with symptoms that were deemed “medically unexplained” (n = 325) found that twice as many patients fulfilled diagnostic criteria for a somatoform disorder than for somatic symptom disorder (93 versus 46 percent) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In addition, the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder requires that patients exhibit excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms, and thus identifies a group with greater mental impairment, compared with somatoform disorders [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>The DSM-IV-TR somatoform disorders included the criterion that somatic symptoms were medically unexplained. However, the reliability for medically unexplained symptoms is poor [<a href="#rid4">4,11</a>] because it is difficult to prove that a symptom is medically unexplained (prove a negative) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. By contrast, DSM-5 somatic symptom disorder can be diagnosed in patients with known general medical disorders.</p><p>DSM-5 includes somatic symptom disorder in the category called somatic symptom and related disorders, which are diagnoses characterized by prominent somatic concerns, distress, and impaired functioning [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Patients with somatic symptom and related disorders typically present to primary care clinicians and general medical specialists rather than psychiatrists.</p><p>The World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases, 10<sup>th</sup> Revision (ICD-10) still retains the term “somatoform disorders” as a category, as well as the specific diagnoses of somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriacal disorder, and persistent somatoform pain disorder [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2323925455"><span class="h1">SCREENING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although screening instruments can facilitate diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder, screening is not standard practice. Patients who screen positive need to be interviewed in sufficient depth to determine if diagnostic criteria are satisfied to verify the diagnosis. In addition, it is not known whether screening improves outcomes. Based upon studies of major depression, screening is beneficial only if follow-up is available to provide diagnostic interviews and treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83887.html" rel="external">"Screening for depression in adults", section on 'Improved depression outcomes'</a>.)</p><p>For clinicians who want to screen for somatic symptom disorder, we suggest self-report measures, which can save interviewer time. However, self-report instruments are more prone to false-positives than clinician-administered instruments.</p><p>A core feature of somatic symptom disorder is the presence of one or more current somatic symptoms that are long-standing and cause distress or psychosocial impairment. Self-administered instruments that screen for physical symptoms include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient Health Questionnaire – 15 Item (PHQ-15)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef112606" href="/z/d/graphic/112606.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) – The PHQ-15 is the most widely used instrument to assess the number of distressful somatic symptoms, due to its well-established psychometric properties, brevity, and availability in multiple languages [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. It comprises 15 somatic symptoms that are commonly encountered in primary care, with each symptom scored 0 ("not bothered at all"), 1 (“bothered a little”) or 2 ("bothered a lot") [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The total score provides an index of severity; higher scores are associated with poorer functioning (occupational, social, and physical), increased health care utilization, and more symptoms of depression and anxiety. PHQ-15 scores and somatic symptom severity are as follows:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>0 to 4 – minimal</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>5 to 9 – low</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>10 to 14 – moderate</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>15 to 30 – high</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Somatic Symptom Scale-8 – The Somatic Symptom Scale-8 was derived from the PHQ-15 and is an eight-item measure that quantifies the burden of somatic symptoms [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. The eight items are stomach or bowel problems; back pain; pain in your arms, legs, or joints; headaches; chest pain or shortness of breath; dizziness; feeling tired or having low energy; and trouble sleeping. Each of the eight items is rated as follows:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Not at all – 0</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A little bit – 1</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Somewhat – 2</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Quite a bit – 3</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Very much – 4</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A total score of 0 to 3 indicates no to minimal burden, 4 to 7 low burden, 8 to 11 medium burden, 12 to 15 a high burden, and a score of 16 to 32 indicates a very high burden. The reliability and validity of the scale is comparable to that of the PHQ-15 [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p>The other core feature of somatic symptom disorder is excessive thoughts, worrying, or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or to health concerns. Self-administered instruments that screen for this feature include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The seven-item Whiteley Index  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef104207" href="/z/d/graphic/104207.html" rel="external">table 4</a>), which is the most widely studied measure for health anxiety. It has acceptable psychometric properties, and includes validated subscales that assess illness worrying (items number two, four, and six; sensitivity 0.37, specificity 0.70, and positive predictive value 0.41) and illness conviction (items number three, five, and seven; sensitivity 0.63, specificity 0.87, and positive predictive value 0.73) [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The 12-item Somatic Symptom Disorder-B Criteria Scale  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106446" href="/z/d/graphic/106446.html" rel="external">table 5</a>), which assesses excessive thoughts, worrying, or behaviors related to somatic symptoms, has good to excellent psychometric properties and was developed specifically for the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]. Higher scores on this scale are associated with greater general medical comorbidity and increased health care utilization [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The 15-item Somatic Symptoms Experiences Questionnaire  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106448" href="/z/d/graphic/106448.html" rel="external">table 6</a>), which asks about health worries, experience of illness, problems interacting with physicians, and consequences of illness. The instrument is valid and reliable, and was developed specifically for the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The 14- and 18-item versions of the Short Health Anxiety Inventory [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>] and the 29-item Illness Attitude Scales (particularly the three-item Bodily Preoccupation subscale) [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>].</p><p></p><p>Combining either the PHQ-15 or the Somatic Symptom Scale-8 with the Somatic Symptom Disorder-B scale considerably improves identification of people at risk for somatic symptom disorder [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3356131635"><span class="h1">ASSESSMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3441083009"><span class="h2">When to suspect the disorder</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In primary care or general medical settings, the presence of somatic symptom disorder is suggested by the following clues [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of present illness is vague and inconsistent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Health care concerns are rarely alleviated despite high utilization of medical care – Reassurance and explanation by clinicians that the symptoms are not caused by a serious general medical condition provides only temporary relief, or is viewed as a sign that the clinician does not understand the patient’s symptoms and is not taking them seriously.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Multiple courses of standard treatment fail to mitigate the symptoms.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Attributing normal physical sensations to medical illnesses.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Repeatedly checking one’s body for abnormalities.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoiding physical activity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unusually high sensitivity to medication side effects.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Seeking care from multiple doctors for the same somatic symptom(s).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clinicians find themselves feeling frustrated.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Refuses to grant permission to speak with other clinicians.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4130417707"><span class="h2">General approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The evaluation of a patient presenting with possible somatic symptom disorder includes taking a general medical history with a full review of systems (not just the presenting symptom), taking a psychiatric history, performing a physical examination and a mental status examination, reviewing laboratory data, and communicating with other clinicians [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. A thorough physical examination will help the clinician and patient feel comfortable that no important diagnosis will be missed. Ancillary laboratory testing should be conservative (see <a class="local">'Laboratory tests'</a> below). A general medical illness may be present but not recognized because of insufficient attention to the history, physical examination, or laboratory tests; insufficient use of contemporary diagnostic techniques; the medical illness is due to iatrogenic adverse effects; or the medical illness represents a new disease that has yet to be identified [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p>To make the diagnosis in children and adolescents, we suggest obtaining information about the symptoms from the patient, family, and potentially other sources (eg, school teachers) [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Engaging both the patient and parent/caregiver during evaluation and management is key, because the parents’ interpretation of and response to the somatic symptoms may influence the child’s level of emotional distress; the extent of medical evaluation, tests, and interventions; and time away from school and play.</p><p>Both a general medical and a psychiatric etiology for the patient's symptoms should be explored simultaneously so that the patient has confidence that medical needs are being addressed, and because somatic symptom disorder can be a maladaptive response to a serious medical illness. In addition, patients who present with a new general medical illness may be more willing to discuss psychosocial concerns at the onset of their evaluation, rather than after all medical examinations have failed to identify a cause for their symptoms [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Many of these patients will have previously seen several other clinicians and been dissatisfied.</p><p>Establishing trust and minimizing the chance that the patient feels rejected or humiliated are essential. Patients need to feel respected and understood. It is counterproductive to tell patients that there is nothing wrong with them or that they are making too big a deal out of their symptoms.</p><p>The Health Preoccupation Diagnostic Interview is a structured, interviewer-administered instrument that is available for diagnosing somatic symptom disorder, but is seldom used in routine clinical care. The instrument enables the interviewer to clarify ambiguous or contradictory responses, and can help differentiate the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder from illness anxiety disorder, and differentiate patients with somatic symptom disorder from normal controls. Reliability was demonstrated in a study of persons with clinically significant health anxiety (n = 52) and healthy controls (n = 52) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. However, structured instruments are labor intensive and generally reserved for specialized evaluation, treatment, or research settings.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3030279800"><span class="h2">History of present illness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinicians taking a history should assess [<a href="#rid29">29,33-36</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Which somatic symptoms trigger health anxiety and how the patient responds to the anxiety.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Whether the patient manifests persistent thoughts and anxiety related to the somatic symptoms.

As an example, both coronary artery disease <strong>and</strong> somatic symptom disorder are diagnosed in a patient who has had an uncomplicated myocardial infarction and has been advised by his clinician that he may resume normal work, exercise, and sex, but instead constantly monitors his chest sensations, possible shortness of breath, and pulse; limits his activities to the level he was at when discharged from the hospital; and reads about coronary disease for hours on the internet.</p><p>Somatic symptom disorder may be underdiagnosed in older adults [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

Directly challenging the patient's belief that symptoms are caused by a medical condition may undermine the relationship with the patient. It is more reasonable for clinicians to explain there is no evidence of a life-threatening illness and to present this as good news. In addition, we tell patients that they have a common, well-described, although not well-understood, condition that results in the set of current symptoms [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].</p><p>For patients with somatic symptom disorder that occurs in the context of an identified medical disorder, clinicians should not tell patients that they are blowing their symptoms out of proportion, which can leave patients feeling discounted and disrespected. A better approach starts with an empathic reflection back to the patient about the clinician’s recognition that the somatic symptoms are a significant burden on the patient, followed by an explanation of how sensitivity to pain (or other somatic symptoms) is affected by stress and coping style.
