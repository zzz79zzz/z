Perioperative anaphylaxis tends to be more severe than anaphylaxis in other settings, with respiratory or cardiovascular compromise at presentation. This topic will discuss the evaluation of an adult or child who has experienced perioperative anaphylaxis and strategies to prevent recurrence. The prevalence, etiologies, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of perioperative anaphylaxis are discussed separately (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2077.html" rel="external">"Perioperative anaphylaxis: Clinical manifestations, etiology, and management"</a>). The treatment of anaphylaxis is reviewed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/392.html" rel="external">"Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3611531469"><span class="h2">Terminology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some clinical investigators use the term "hypersensitivity reactions" or "systemic reactions" to include milder forms of perioperative allergic reactions, reserving anaphylaxis only for those with severe cardiovascular or respiratory compromise. In this topic review, we will consider these terms interchangeable. In addition, we will use "anaphylaxis" to refer to both immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated and non-IgE-mediated reactions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2077.html" rel="external">"Perioperative anaphylaxis: Clinical manifestations, etiology, and management", section on 'Mechanisms of anaphylaxis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The evaluation of a patient who has experienced suspected perioperative or perianesthetic anaphylaxis involves a clinical history, review of records of the event, analysis of laboratory tests obtained at the time, and skin testing or in vitro serum-specific IgE testing if the reaction was believed to be IgE mediated. The complexity of medications used for anesthesia and surgery present challenges when attempting to identify the cause, but critical interpretation of clinical information and select testing leads to better recognition of culprit drugs [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>There are three goals of this evaluation:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Collection of evidence to support or refute that the adverse perioperative event was mast-cell mediated (ie, anaphylaxis).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identification of the culprit agent so that the agent can be avoided in the future. Not identifying the responsible agent necessitates the use of multiple second-line agents, a strategy that is not without risk to the patient.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identification of alternative agents to which the patient has no evidence of hypersensitivity.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H103756"><span class="h2">Referral</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Skin testing and challenge procedures to identify drug allergy should be performed by allergy specialists and/or anesthesiologists trained in the safe performance and accurate interpretation of these tests and challenges.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients usually cannot provide much information about reactions that occurred during anesthesia. However, questioning the patient about prior anesthesia may be helpful in identifying previous exposures as well as agents that were tolerated in the past.</p><p>An initial step in evaluating a patient with suspected perioperative anaphylaxis is verification that the reaction was clinically consistent with anaphylaxis. Wheezing and urticaria are helpful in distinguishing anaphylaxis from other disorders. The characteristic signs and symptoms of perioperative anaphylaxis are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2077.html" rel="external">"Perioperative anaphylaxis: Clinical manifestations, etiology, and management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Records of the procedure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In many cases, the evaluating allergy specialist must rely solely upon anesthesia and perioperative records and perhaps a verbal account from clinicians who were present. A review of drug administration records is essential to determine temporal relationships between the administration of various agents and the onset of symptoms or signs. Operative notes may be helpful for identifying potential exposures to latex (eg, symptoms that began shortly after an internal organ was extensively manipulated and handled).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Tests for mast cell mediators</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Serum or plasma tryptase and/or histamine elevations measured during or shortly after the reaction should be analyzed. If serum tryptase is elevated, a repeat measurement should be performed when the patient has recovered to assure that levels are not persistently elevated. An increase from baseline is highly suggestive of anaphylaxis, although a normal tryptase level does not exclude anaphylaxis. A serum tryptase of 1.2 x baseline + 2 ng/mL immediately after the reaction is considered sufficient to determine that mast cell/basophil degranulation occurred and that the episode was indeed anaphylaxis, although it does not provide information about the mechanism (eg, IgE mediated or other) of anaphylaxis or the culprit trigger.</p><p>In fatal cases, blood collected before death should be analyzed but interpreted with caution, as nonspecific increases in these mediators can occur immediately after death. The interpretation of these tests is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/389.html" rel="external">"Laboratory tests to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis"</a>.)</p><p>If these tests were not obtained at the time of the event, but blood samples were drawn for other purposes, it may still be possible to measure serum tryptase (although not histamine), as tryptase is stable in frozen serum for up to one year or up to five days when stored at 8°C [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>The utility of elevated tryptase in perioperative anaphylaxis is illustrated in the following studies:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In one large series, the estimated positive predictive value of tryptase elevations in 259 subjects with anesthesia-associated anaphylaxis was 93 percent, and the estimated negative predictive value of normal tryptase levels was 54 percent [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Another study compared 75 subjects who were resuscitated for perioperative-allergic cardiopulmonary arrest and 25 control subjects who were resuscitated for nonallergic cardiopulmonary arrest [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of an elevated tryptase or histamine were 90 to 92 percent for identifying an allergic cause. The cutoff values were 7.35 mcg/L (7.35 ng/mL) for tryptase and 6.35 nmol/L for histamine.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A survey from Belgium identified 180 subjects with tryptase data from a total of 532 subjects with perioperative anaphylaxis, collected over 15 years at a single academic medical center. Of the 180 subjects, 139 (77 percent) with anaphylaxis and tryptase data showed an increase of tryptase greater than 1.2 x baseline + 2 mcg/L. Subjects with increased tryptase were more likely to have experienced severe anaphylaxis and to have detectable specific IgE to the culprit drug. Absence of an increase in tryptase did not exclude specific IgE as the cause of the anaphylaxis [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p>Patients with persistent elevations above 20 ng/mL, even after completely recovery from the reaction, should be evaluated for the rare disorder systemic mastocytosis. Patients with systemic mastocytosis may react to multiple unrelated drugs and agents. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4784.html" rel="external">"Mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic) in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15715.html" rel="external">"Mast cell disorders: An overview"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Skin testing</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2668894009"><span class="h3">Important concepts</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Skin testing may be considered if the suspect agent is known to cause IgE-mediated reactions (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60805" href="/d/graphic/60805.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. Skin testing is more sensitive than in vitro testing in most cases, although the negative and positive predictive values of skin testing for drugs other than penicillin are unknown.</p><p>Immediate prick/percutaneous and intradermal skin testing has no utility in the evaluation of anaphylaxis resulting from non-IgE mechanisms, although other forms of skin testing, such as patch and delayed intradermal testing, may be of value in assessment of non-anaphylactic, delayed adverse reactions to materials and drugs used at the time of surgery (eg, contact dermatitis and delayed-onset drug eruptions). These reactions typically develop in the days following exposure and do not present clinically as perioperative anaphylaxis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16691.html" rel="external">"Patch testing"</a>.)</p><p>The groups of agents that have most often been implicated in IgE-mediated perioperative anaphylaxis include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Neuromuscular-blocking agents (NMBAs)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Certain antibiotics (particularly beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin or cephalosporins)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Latex (approved in vitro testing is available in the United States and other parts of the world; approved skin test reagents are not available in the United States but are in other countries)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Blue dyes (also called supravital dyes, including isosulfan blue, patent blue V, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9636" href="/d/drug information/9636.html" rel="external">methylene blue</a>)</p><p></p><p>Skin testing has also been described for streptokinase, chymopapain, barbiturates, and insulin, although these agents are rarely implicated in anaphylaxis [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9244" href="/d/drug information/9244.html" rel="external">Chlorhexidine</a>, an antiseptic commonly used in dental rinses, surgical scrubs, and sterilizing solutions, may cause anaphylaxis, and skin testing as well as in vitro-specific IgE testing are described in the literature [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>Suggested concentrations for intradermal skin testing of the most commonly implicated agents are provided below and are generally consistent with a 2019 European guideline [<a href="#rid2">2,11</a>]. Nonspecific irritant reactions are possible with some drugs, although these should be less likely if the recommended intradermal concentrations are not exceeded. Testing with higher concentrations may result in nonspecific positive responses, even in people who have not had adverse reactions to the drug, making the test of no value. (See <a class="local">'Skin testing to specific agents'</a> below.)</p><p>We generally test a patient with each of the medications that were administered prior to or during the adverse reaction, placing priority on those agents most likely to cause anaphylaxis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2077.html" rel="external">"Perioperative anaphylaxis: Clinical manifestations, etiology, and management", section on 'Etiologies'</a>.)</p><p>For those agents that have been implicated in causing anaphylaxis through multiple mechanisms (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60805" href="/d/graphic/60805.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), particularly NMBAs, we also perform skin testing for one or two potential alternative drugs that are available to the anesthesiologist involved in the case. Alternative agents may be the only option if challenges cannot be performed with agents producing a positive test, since the testing has not been validated for anesthetic drugs. Challenges can be problematic, particularly with agents restricted to the operating room, such as neuromuscular blocking agents or induction drugs. Test negative alternatives may assist in planning for future anesthesia. (See <a class="local">'Neuromuscular-blocking agents'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Timing of skin testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Skin testing is usually delayed for four to eight weeks after the reaction, since false-negative results may be more likely immediately following anaphylaxis [<a href="#rid12">12-16</a>]. It is hypothesized that mast cells in the skin may be relatively unresponsive immediately after an episode of widespread hives or flushing, for reasons that are not fully defined. However, testing may be performed sooner if repeat anesthesia is necessary, as positive tests are still meaningful. This approach is supported by a study that compared the results of skin testing at two time points in patients with perioperative anaphylaxis; the first within four days of the reaction and, the second, four to eight weeks after the reaction [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Of patients with positive skin test results implicating a specific drug, 15 had positive results at the first testing, 22 at the second testing, 12 at both, 3 at only the first testing, and 10 at only the second testing. Until an evaluation has been completed, the agents statistically more likely to have caused the reaction should be avoided.</p><p>Beyond the initial four to eight weeks after the reaction, skin testing should be performed as promptly as possible, as sensitization to some drugs can be transient, and skin testing years after a reaction is less likely to reveal a culprit drug. However, if the patient is referred years after a reaction, we perform the same evaluation but with the understanding that the sensitivity of retrospective identification of culprits may be lower.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Techniques and safety</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Allergy skin testing ideally should only be performed by allergy specialists with training in the technique. Skin testing is considered safe for most patients, although it is not without risk. It is recommended that emergency equipment and medications, including <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> (1 mg/mL), be available for treatment of the rare yet potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis that can arise from the testing. A general review of skin testing techniques is found separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5541.html" rel="external">"Overview of skin testing for IgE-mediated allergic disease"</a>.)</p><p>Prick-puncture testing (also called epicutaneous or skin prick testing [SPT]) is safer than intradermal testing (IDT) and is preferred for the initial testing. If SPT is negative, IDT can safely proceed, although it is important to understand that there are rare reports of IDT resulting in anaphylaxis even when SPT was negative, which has been noted with testing with macrogols (eg, polyethylene glycol) or emulsifiers (eg, polysorbates) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. IDT is more sensitive than SPT and thus provides maximal reassurance that the agent in question was not responsible for the adverse event. In general, the maximal concentration used for IDT is 10- to 1000-fold more dilute than that used for SPT. However, these concentrations are often arbitrary. If the concentration is too high, testing can induce either an irritant response or anaphylaxis. Both of these adverse outcomes are more likely with IDT, so a reduction in concentration from that of the SPT is employed. The concentration(s) chosen are dependent upon prior experience, perceived risk of anaphylaxis or published case series, and rarely on controlled trials.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the literature provides a nonirritating concentration for IDT, the same concentration can be used for initial SPT as a safety precaution, since it is roughly equivalent to IDT at 1:100 to 1:000 dilution. If SPT is negative, then IDT can be performed, as IDT is more sensitive.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If there is no recommended testing concentration available in the literature, we begin SPT with a 1:100 to 1:100,000 dilution of the concentration associated with the original reaction. The initial test concentration is based upon the severity of the reaction and the likelihood that the drug in question was responsible. A more dilute concentration may be used for the initial steps of testing if the patient's reaction was particularly severe. Repeat testing is performed with 10-fold increases in concentration until a positive SPT result or the clinically utilized concentration is reached. If all SPTs are negative, then IDT is performed starting at 1:100 to 1:1000 of the maximum SPT concentration [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Dilutions should be made with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with added human albumin to preserve isotonicity and solubility. Serial tests with 10-fold progressive increases in concentration are subsequently performed. The time required for testing may be reduced by using fewer dilutions (eg, 1:100, 1:10, and undiluted) first for SPT, followed by the same dilutions for IDT. Some experts are comfortable with this efficiency, while others prefer the additional safety of using more dilute starting solutions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Appropriate positive and negative controls are always required. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5541.html" rel="external">"Overview of skin testing for IgE-mediated allergic disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A false-positive irritant reaction may occur with both SPT and IDT but is more likely with the latter. If a positive SPT or IDT result is obtained with a substance for which there are no specific published concentration recommendations, we advise testing several controls (eg, the clinician and a few volunteers) to verify that the concentration does not cause a nonspecific, irritant response. The positive and negative predictive values are very limited when performing testing with drugs not rigorously studied, but this is often the only option to provide some guidance with respect to safety if no alternative choices for anesthesia are available.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2784452666"><span class="h3">Accuracy and interpretation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The interpretation of skin testing requires clinical expertise, because the positive and negative predictive values for skin testing with most medications have not been systematically defined, with the notable exception of penicillin. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2073.html" rel="external">"Penicillin allergy: Immediate reactions"</a>.)</p><p>Despite these limitations, a positive skin test to an agent that is known to cause IgE-mediated reactions, with appropriate positive (histamine) and negative (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a>) controls, is usually interpreted as indicative of allergic sensitization.</p><p>A negative skin test to an agent that is known to cause IgE-mediated reactions means that the patient is either not sensitized to that agent (if skin testing protocols are well-defined) or that testing is not able to demonstrate the sensitization (if the agent is less commonly implicated or is not well-studied). In cases in which the culprit is not clearly identified, drug challenge could be performed, but this is often difficult outside of specialty centers due to the unique physiologic actions of drugs used in anesthesia, the limited availability of these agents in outpatient settings, and the limited experience of most allergists in administering them [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Limited role of in vitro testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In vitro tests are limited in availability for drugs in general.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>IgE immunoassays</strong> – Immunoassays for allergen-specific IgE (the current form of in vitro testing using enzyme-linked methodology [ELISA] and historically performed with radioallergosorbent testing [RAST]) may be helpful in identifying the causative agent in IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, although these are available commercially only for a limited number of allergens: penicillin and a limited number of other beta-lactam antibiotics, latex, gelatin, and alpha-gal. (See <a class="local">'Latex'</a> below and <a class="local">'Colloids'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Of note, some tests that are offered commercially are not validated and/or involve drugs that have never been shown to induce IgE antibodies. Thus, skin testing is usually more reliable, in part because skin testing is more sensitive for detecting specific IgE. Neither type of testing has utility in the evaluation of anaphylaxis resulting from mechanisms other than IgE.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Basophil activation test</strong> – The basophil activation test (BAT) is an in vitro method of assaying the effects of mixing blood-containing basophils with suspected culprit agents. This test is not widely utilized in the United States, although its application is growing in the medical literature as an aid in the diagnosis of allergy and anaphylaxis.

In series from the United States, antibiotics are the most common cause of perioperative anaphylaxis, followed by NMBAs. NMBAs can cause anaphylaxis through both IgE-mediated and direct mast cell activation, although severe, life-threatening reactions are usually IgE mediated (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57346" href="/d/graphic/57346.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].

Some of the NMBAs (those derived from steroids) may induce a wheal-and-flare skin test response due to direct action on blood vessels. This has been confirmed by almost 50 percent of normal volunteers showing a positive skin response. Since skin tests may be used to document NMBAs as a cause of anaphylaxis, the false-positive rate with certain agents may result in an exaggeration of the risk, particularly if more concentrated solutions are used for intradermal testing [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>].</p><p>Alternatively, there may be epidemiologic differences between Europe and the United States that explain the difference.

As in other studies, neuromuscular-blocking agents (NMBAs) and beta-lactam antibiotics were the most common causes. If a culprit drug could not be identified, a plan was formulated for avoidance of drugs with the highest probability of causing anaphylaxis. In two of the three cases with repeat anaphylaxis, inadequate information had been supplied in the initial anesthesia report, and the evaluation had not included the culprit agents (the disinfectant <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9244" href="/d/drug information/9244.html" rel="external">chlorhexidine</a> and the colloid gelofusine).

In these cases, future management involves avoidance of high-risk agents and adherence to the general precautions discussed in this section. The disadvantage of this approach is that the patient is restricted to receiving multiple second-line agents. In other cases, a positive skin test result may be obtained to more than one agent, raising the possibility that one or more results are false positives.

Serum total tryptase should be repeated when the patient has fully recovered as a screen for rare mast cell disorders. An elevated tryptase level after recovery, when the patient is in their baseline state, should prompt referral to an allergist for evaluation of a possible mast cell disorder. Patients with mast cell disorders may react to multiple unrelated drugs and agents. (See <a class="local">'Tests for mast cell mediators'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Skin testing for agents that cause IgE-mediated reactions</strong> – Perioperative anaphylaxis can result from more than one mechanism, and it is important to understand which mechanisms are associated with each agent, as well as what type of testing is relevant for that mechanism (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60805" href="/d/graphic/60805.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). IgE-mediated reactions are most common with neuromuscular-blocking agents (NMBAs) (muscle relaxants), antibiotics (particularly penicillins and cephalosporins), latex, blue dyes, and barbiturate induction agents. Skin tests can be performed for each of these agents. Skin testing should be performed by allergy specialists. (See <a class="local">'Skin testing'</a> above and <a class="local">'Skin testing to specific agents'</a> above and <a class="local">'Referral'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Limited role of in vitro tests</strong> – In vitro tests for allergen-specific IgE are available for latex and a very limited number of other agents (eg, penicillin and NMBAs in some countries). In vitro testing is generally less sensitive than skin testing. (See <a class="local">'Limited role of in vitro testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Utility of allergy evaluations</strong> – In several series of patients with perioperative anaphylaxis who subsequently underwent an allergy evaluation and then required anesthesia again, repeat anaphylaxis occurred in up to 8 percent of individuals. (See <a class="local">'Outcomes of repeat anesthesia after allergy evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Options for future anesthesia</strong> – The safest management approach for a patient with past anaphylaxis is the definitive identification and complete avoidance of the trigger. However, sometimes evaluation is not possible or a culprit drug/agent cannot be identified. In these situations, future management is based upon avoidance of high-risk agents and implementation of several precautionary measures. Precautionary measures for future anesthesia include optimal preoperative control of asthma, slow administration of antibiotics and other high-risk agents, and avoidance (when possible) of beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and drugs that cause direct histamine release from mast cells/basophils. Spinal or epidural anesthesia may be an option in some cases. (See <a class="local">'Approach to future anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Laguna JJ, Archilla J, Doña I, et al.
