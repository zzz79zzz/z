Care is often delivered by providers untrained in pregnancy management. This topic will discuss obstetric care during the emergency phase of a disaster.</p><p>Issues specific to gynecologic care in disaster settings and environmental health are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/117435.html" rel="external">"Disaster settings: Care of gynecologic problems"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5447.html" rel="external">"Overview of occupational and environmental risks to reproduction in females"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2749.html" rel="external">"Overview of occupational and environmental health"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the terms "woman/en" or "patient(s)" as they are used in the studies presented. However, we encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling and treatment needs of transgender and gender diverse individuals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1572536007"><span class="h1">DEFINITION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A disaster is defined by the World Health Organization as a situation or event that overwhelms local capacity and seriously disrupts the functioning of a community or society, necessitating a request to national or international level for external assistance [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Disasters are typically classified into two groups, natural and man-made [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Natural disasters</strong> – Natural disasters encompass physical phenomena caused by events which can be geophysical (eg, earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, volcanic activity); hydrological (eg, avalanches, floods); climatological (eg, extreme temperature, drought, wildfires); meteorological (eg, cyclones, storms); or biological (eg, disease epidemics, insect/animal plagues). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Man-made disasters</strong> – Man-made disasters (also called human-made disasters) describe events that are caused by humans and occur close to or in human settlements. Such disasters may be accidental (ie, technological) or intentional (ie, terrorism). These include complex emergencies and/or conflicts, famine, displaced populations, industrial accidents, and transport accidents. Disasters may also arise out of a combination of political conflict and instability. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2093504642"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Natural disasters kill on average 45,000 people per year globally, which represents approximately 0.1 percent of global deaths [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Population displacements have increased significantly over time, with ongoing wars and internal conflicts particularly negatively impacting the health of women and children [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Impact of disaster on pregnancy outcomes</strong> – One in five women of childbearing age is pregnant in a disaster setting, and the obstetric needs of women are constant within the backdrop of the various phases of response and recovery. Studies suggest an association between disaster and poor pregnancy outcomes. Observed outcomes following disasters include early pregnancy loss, birth defects (possibly related to toxic exposure or lack of preventive measures such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8475" href="/d/drug information/8475.html" rel="external">folic acid</a> supplementation), low birth weight, preterm birth, and placental abruption [<a href="#rid5">5-8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Examples include: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Maternal and child mortality</strong> – Maternal and child mortality is reported to be 10 to 30 percent higher in humanitarian contexts compared with nondisaster settings [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. It is estimated that 50 percent of global maternal deaths occur in conflict or disaster zones [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. Pregnant women are at increased risk of maternal death because of limited or no access to prenatal care, assisted delivery, emergency obstetric care, and family planning services [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. Increased rates of peripartum infection have also been reported [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The increased mortality rates result from a complex interplay of factors  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116779" href="/d/graphic/116779.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). In a systematic review of health outcomes after floods, mortality rates in general increased up to 50 percent in the first year after the event [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. In this study, one of the mechanisms of death was an increase in infectious diseases such as hepatitis E, gastrointestinal diseases, and leptospirosis. These diseases may also play a role in adverse pregnancy outcomes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Unintended pregnancy and induced abortion</strong> – Increased unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions have been reported [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Spontaneous abortion</strong> – Increased spontaneous abortions and birth defects have been documented following disasters, which contribute to decreased fecundity, presumably secondary to traumatic or toxic exposures [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Preterm birth</strong> – Preterm birth rates appear to increase following disaster exposure during the index pregnancy and for years later. While the mechanism for poorer pregnancy outcomes is unclear, the intensity of the disaster experience appears to be a risk factor. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Pregnancy during disaster event</strong> – In a prospective study of 301 pregnant women who experienced Hurricane Katrina, preterm birth increased threefold in women with high exposure compared with low exposure (preterm birth rates of 14 versus 5 percent) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. There was no significant difference in preterm birth for women with or without posttraumatic stress disorder or depression. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Pregnancy years after disaster event</strong> – In a study of over 73,000 Chinese pregnant persons, exposure to the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake years before conception was associated with increased risks of adverse outcomes compared with unexposed individuals, including still birth (2.00 versus 1.33 percent), preterm birth (14.14 versus 7.32 percent), low birth weight (10.82 versus 5.76 percent), and small for gestational age (11.32 versus 9.52 percent) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Underlying medical morbidity and poor birth outcomes</strong> – A study that compared maternal and neonatal outcomes before and after the 1997 Red River flood in North Dakota reported an increase in underlying maternal medical morbidities (eg, anemia, lung disease, uterine bleeding), low birth weight, and preterm delivery following the event [<a href="#rid17">17,20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Policy to reduce impact disaster risk</strong> – Due to rising mortality from disasters, international stakeholders, led by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, adopted the Sendai Framework, which is a 15-year agreement that recognizes the responsibility of states, local government, private sectors, and other stakeholders to aim for the substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods, and health as well as in the economic, physical, social, cultural, and environmental assets of persons, businesses, communities, and countries [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1238821311"><span class="h1">ESTABLISHING AN OBSTETRICS FIELD HOSPITAL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>During a disaster response, both basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care must be established as soon as possible. The planning for a minimum initial service package (MISP) for managing reproductive health during crises is provided <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fiawgfieldmanual.com%2Fmanual%2Fmisp&amp;token=69DxJwqArGHo2Y5NvO0DsVfteJTSPcyiegx6DmsXxRl3GbK%2BVTQ%2FIOGLAwQE4Pbi&amp;TOPIC_ID=114518" target="_blank">elsewhere</a>. A systematic review of 141 articles on health emergency systems in natural disasters and human conflict identified the importance of telecommunication, coordination with other disaster responders, planning for supplies, and staff training in disaster protocols [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Overall planning is crucial and pertinent to the care of pregnant individuals in disasters as they make up about 20 percent of victims treated at field hospitals [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. </p><p>The <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fiawg.net%2Fresources%2Frh-kits-calculator&amp;token=VikyJkYdnIkR5MSfOo57TpLl6HiXrp61QFLfxJy3UzLlTddpYP9pFdcveaJBeVXHv4XsszzetRRbUAvc85vjWA%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=114518" target="_blank">MISP calculator</a> helps workers anticipate the reproductive health needs of a population.

Use of the MISP calculator helps determine estimated number of pregnant women, the anticipated number of women who will deliver or miscarry, and the resultant number of Inter-Agency Working Group (IAWG) reproductive health kits to order. That kits can only be ordered by United Nations agencies, funding systems, or nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that have a memorandum of understanding further emphasizes the importance of providing disaster relief efforts within an established organization. Information for ordering IAWG reproductive health kits is available <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fiawg.net%2Fresources%2Fminimum-initial-service-package-distance-learning-module%2Funit-nine-ordering-reproductive-health-kits&amp;token=S6QkG46D23j2yE4ogPA4AYRFkMdFu1KN5YnzHkwPobhNMziJ%2Fcz0ibfQMF5RbYnWQV9G7mml%2BCjpKflcAMUCRoaVsjh6pBf678CCal3ScHQz08RB%2BAR%2BgXB2KL95hq9Tv%2BzUCAPNu6BW7scWhqORsg%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=114518" target="_blank">online</a>. Kits are ordered per 10,000, 30,000, or 150,000 anticipated people. Regardless of the estimated need, during the disaster, a robust supply chain must be in place to ensure proper replacement of equipment, medications, and supplies.</p><p>In disasters, the facility may be fixed or erected by the medical team. The Obstetrics and Gynecology specialist should take a leadership role in assessing the availability and set-up of all necessary reproductive health care resources. In our experience, the minimum medications for an obstetric pharmacy cache include <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9734" href="/d/drug information/9734.html" rel="external">oxytocin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9657" href="/d/drug information/9657.html" rel="external">misoprostol</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10011" href="/d/drug information/10011.html" rel="external">tranexamic acid</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9585" href="/d/drug information/9585.html" rel="external">magnesium sulfate</a>. As clean water may not be available, an alcohol-based cleanser or similar should be included. Portable ultrasound is invaluable. When no other options are available, tarps can be hung or erected to provide some patient privacy. If the environment is unsafe (structure or environment), the pregnant patient is ideally transported to a safer zone whenever possible. </p><p>An example of human and material resources that were used to provide reproductive care to the 1.4 million women and adolescent girls during the Nepal earthquake of 2015 is presented in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116906" href="/d/graphic/116906.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H538631140"><span class="h2">Impact of disaster setting on pregnancy and trauma care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Disasters cause acute resource scarcity and providers must consider availability of resources to safely facilitate procedural and postprocedural care. For instance, the indications for cesarean delivery in a field hospital, with increased risk of infection and blood loss and limited ability to address complications, may be narrower and differ from traditional practices. Thus, clinicians must prioritize procedures for those who need immediate <strong>maternal life-saving</strong><em> </em>interventions, followed by fetal interventions. In a disaster setting, the health and wellbeing of the mother is the primary consideration. For instance, the decision to perform a cesarean delivery for a breech presentation may be deferred in favor of cesarean deliveries only for women with abdominal trauma in which the procedure will aid maternal resuscitation. Potential contingencies and decisions such as these must be discussed before the team is deployed.</p><p>Examples of applying differing criteria to the same procedure in response to the austerity of the environment can be found in the trauma literature. In a qualitative interview of 11 women who were pregnant during Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Katrina disrupted pregnancy plans and led to tremendous anxiety and uncertainty [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. However, none of these women were physically injured. Three of them safely underwent cesarean delivery, as indicated by usual obstetric criteria. For comparison, in the first two weeks after the Haitian earthquake, the United States disaster team evaluated 60 pregnant women [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. The environment was austere; all women who delivered were homeless and living under tarps in a violent and insecure setting. There were several cases of adult and neonatal tetanus. The team delivered 12 women vaginally; the gestational ages ranged from 34 to 40 weeks. No cesarean deliveries were performed, in part because the benefit-to-risk ratio for vaginal delivery far outweighed that of cesarean delivery. In addition, successful vaginal delivery was facilitated by having an experienced obstetrician on the team and the ability to perform active labor management with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9734" href="/d/drug information/9734.html" rel="external">oxytocin</a>. This report also highlights the need for including a skilled obstetric provider on disaster relief teams. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3791761996"><span class="h2">Triage and response considerations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Disaster triage is the most important and, psychologically, the most difficult mission of disaster medical response in mass casualty incidents. The objective of disaster triage is to do the greatest good for the greatest number of patients. Determinants of triage in disasters are based on three parameters: severity of injury/disease, likelihood of survival, and available resources. Disaster medical triage may be conducted at three different levels depending on the level of casualties to capabilities (resources):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Field triage</strong> – Acute (nonambulatory) versus nonacute (ambulatory). This is often the first level used in disasters.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Medical triage</strong> – Medical triage involves a rapid (less than one minute) assessment of impacted individuals to identify life-threatening injuries, determine those with the best chance of survival, and allocate care in settings of insufficient resources. While several systems exist for this purpose  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79522" href="/d/graphic/79522.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef90283" href="/d/graphic/90283.html" rel="external">algorithm 1A</a>), outcomes-based data are limited [<a href="#rid27">27-29</a>]. One commonly used system is called <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cert-la.com%2Fdownloads%2Feducation%2Fenglish%2Fstart.pdf&amp;token=AU7Gp9NfqxZvKJcqfzHJff2UIBxMtaIjvpAKhTGge7AN4oSBhD8%2FSHCqQYQ4SgmJvjJbm7NuWxIo90jolpQT%2Fg%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=114518" target="_blank">START (Simple Triage and Rapid Assessment Treatment</a>) and was developed by Hoag Hospital and the Newport Beach Fire Department in Newport Beach, CA  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef129155" href="/d/graphic/129155.html" rel="external">algorithm 1B</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evacuation triage</strong> – Often used in austere environments.</p><p></p><p>The ethical principles of nonmaleficence, beneficence, justice, and respect for autonomy form the basis for establishing health services during disaster relief [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. During the acute phase of a disaster, timeliness is the most important response factor for saving lives and doing no harm. When triaging the distribution of limited medical supplies and resources, the principles of beneficence and justice are used to guide allocation of goods and services [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. According to the World Medical Association (WMA) Statement on Medical Ethics in the Event of Disasters, "In selecting the patients who may be saved, the physician should consider only their medical status, and should exclude any other consideration based on nonmedical criteria" [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Patients whose conditions cannot be treated by the available resources may be classified as "beyond emergency care." According to WMA, "It is ethical for a physician not to persist, in treating individuals 'beyond emergency care.'" Although clinicians are expected to make every effort to begin and sustain available treatments, resource allocation requires that triage be performed initially by providers trained in triage management. </p><p>Information on different triage techniques can be found at:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.who.int%2Fpublications%2Fi%2Fitem%2Fbasic-emergency-care-approach-to-the-acutely-ill-and-injured&amp;token=UdRc7SSiYtM2UKmTjXbTrF2eUFk4Y%2F2f5CGZhSeGRk1cfKeBlwYkxM8QwtYOWetWwe41hSO7nSNDX1VQMZc6OJ6J33LQiwr11LhyAn3wo2THk5dZy3mnndOPQEh48oDb&amp;TOPIC_ID=114518" target="_blank">WHO-ICRC Basic Emergency Care: approach to the acutely ill and injured</a> – This compilation of all World Health Organization documents relative to emergency and trauma care also provides clinical guidelines for emergency care in low resource settings.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3649841715"><span class="h1">EVALUATING THE PREGNANT PATIENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The type of disaster, phase of the disaster response, the available physical resources, availability of interpreters, and the coexisting medical and surgical conditions of the pregnant patient all impact the health care provider's ability to obtain a history, perform a physical examination, and make an assessment. To the degree possible, a safe and physically protected location is used to conduct the interview and perform the examination.

For confirmation, we perform a sterile speculum examination and look for pooling fluid in the vaginal or leaking from the cervical os with Valsalva. Evaluation also involves excluding intraamniotic infection and evaluating for potential cord prolapse.

Prior to 34 weeks, expectant management is recommended, unless there is evidence of intraamniotic infection or poor maternal/fetal status. In the presence of intraamniotic infection, IV antibiotics are administered and labor induction is advised regardless of gestational age. Induction of labor is not an emergency procedure and should be done in a CEmONC facility to allow rapid intervention in the event of complications.

In the setting of unstoppable preterm labor, delivery is typically rapid. Prior to delivery, we advise collecting the necessary supplies, preparing for infant warming (ie, skin-to-skin contact) and newborn resuscitation. Discussions of managing labor and delivery are presented separately.

Other causative factors include pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders, multiple pregnancy, and malnutrition. Management involves evaluating for underlying infection (eg, rapid diagnostic testing for malaria, evaluation of diarrheal disorders, and exclusion of urinary tract infections) and immediately treating identified causes. Expectant management is advised in the settings of gestational age ≥34 weeks, life-threatening maternal conditions, or intrauterine fetal death. Otherwise, administration of antenatal corticosteroids with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a> IM 6 mg every 12 hours for 48 hours is advised. If chorioamnionitis is not likely and severe maternal trauma is not present, tocolytic therapy can be started, if available, for gestations less than 34 weeks of age. However, in the authors' experience, most cases of preterm labor are associated with maternal infection and/or trauma, and thus tocolytic therapy is not usually initiated. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6761.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous preterm birth: Overview of risk factors and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6798.html" rel="external">"Preterm labor: Clinical findings, diagnostic evaluation, and initial treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6742.html" rel="external">"Inhibition of acute preterm labor"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2576457691"><span class="h3">Limit of fetal viability</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In a crisis situation, the resources available for neonatal resuscitation and support must be assessed, and the estimated age of viability may need to be considered against the risks and benefits of available interventions.

In addition, neonatal care providers are often of limited availability. In deciding whether to perform an operative vaginal delivery, these risks must be weighed against the risks of cesarean delivery (if available) and postoperative maternal recovery.

This conversation will help anticipate the challenges that will be encountered at the point of care [<a href="#rid79">79</a>]. Specific to cesarean delivery, the clinician must consider the risks/benefits for the mother and the infant in the given context of available resources for each. The risks to the mother should be evaluated in the short term (death, infection, thromboembolism, etc) and the medium/long term (risk of future uterine rupture, placenta previa or accreta during another pregnancy, etc).

The rationale for PMCD in maternal cardiac arrest is that 25 to 40 percent of cardiac output generated by chest compression cannot overcome the reduction of functional residual pulmonary capacity due to diaphragmatic displacement by the gravid uterus plus occlusion of the inferior vena cava. Cesarean delivery restores blood flow and respiratory capacity. For this reason, PMCD to improve outcomes in maternal cardiac arrest is only indicated for uterine sizes greater than 24 weeks.

There are four general phases of disaster response and recovery. The obstetric needs of women are constant within the backdrop of these various phases of response and recovery. (See <a class="local">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Impact on maternal and neonatal health</strong> – Such crises are associated with increased maternal and neonatal deaths, owing to limited or no access to reproductive health services as well as to increased adverse obstetric outcomes, such as early pregnancy loss, birth defects, low birth weight, and preterm births. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinician training for disaster response</strong> – Clinicians interested in providing care during disasters should first obtain proper training on caring for themselves and others in austere environments. Training information is available online through the American Red Cross's <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redcross.org%2Ftake-a-class%2Fdisaster-training&amp;token=%2Fc0XajFzMQLV1CpQOxAsnpKk0uJg3w4KBbgW%2BDaDVqxVtQJSY6SevcgPCKQbIY0I5VRdBsHffyaJNsDEIt3KOA%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=114518" target="_blank">website</a> and the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.futurelearn.com%2Fcourses%2Fhealth-crises&amp;token=DzPMsBhauzgvZzN%2FvOiltS%2FTlq18vB3vvRPa7AE0eSaWdi4K93xhRK4T4FbfrHiIeCKpjVaL1lE7HJNmDiYRkA%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=114518" target="_blank">London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</a>. (See <a class="local">'Disaster training'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation of pregnant trauma patient</strong> – The evaluation of pregnant trauma patients follows established trauma principles  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef90283 graphicRef129155" href="/d/graphic/90283.html" rel="external">algorithm 1A-B</a>). The primary objective is caring for the mother; the needs of the fetus are addressed once the mother is stabilized. Clinicians must prioritize procedures for those who need immediate <strong>maternal life-saving</strong> interventions, followed by fetal interventions. (See <a class="local">'Impact of disaster setting on pregnancy and trauma care'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Common obstetric issues</strong> – Common obstetric issues that will continue to present in disaster settings include vaginal bleeding  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef88947" href="/d/graphic/88947.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef110390" href="/d/graphic/110390.html" rel="external">algorithm 3</a>), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, prelabor rupture of membranes (which may also occur at premature gestations), and intrauterine fetal death. In a crisis situation, the resources available for neonatal resuscitation and support must be weighed in light of resource scarcity and balanced against the maternal and neonatal risks and benefits. (See <a class="local">'Common obstetric issues'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Transfer of laboring patients</strong> – If possible, laboring women should be referred to an appropriate health care facility for delivery. These are typically divided into Basic Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care and Complete Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care units. (See <a class="local">'Referral to health care facility'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Role of perimortem cesarean delivery</strong> – This rare but potentially life-saving intervention is performed for pregnant individuals in extremis from massive trauma, cardiac arrest, and/or active uterine hemorrhage or in situations where the mother has died but there is a viable fetus. PMCD should be performed within four minutes of cardiac arrest  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef129985" href="/d/graphic/129985.html" rel="external">algorithm 4</a>); maternal CPR is continued during the surgery [<a href="#rid81">81</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Risk of maternal mortality</strong> – In crisis settings, both mothers and their newborns are extremely vulnerable during the postnatal period. An estimated 65 percent of all maternal deaths occur after delivery, and almost 50 percent of these postpartum deaths occur within the first 24 hours after delivery.
