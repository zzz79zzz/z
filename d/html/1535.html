The most common indications for oral anticoagulant are atrial fibrillation (AF), venous thromboembolism, and valvular heart disease. Indications for one or two antiplatelet agents include stable CAD (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> alone), recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS; aspirin plus a P2Y<sub>12 </sub>inhibitor), or recent coronary artery stent placement (aspirin plus a P2Y<sub>12 </sub>inhibitor). Individuals who require anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy are a clinical challenge with regard to the need to balance the benefit and risk from intensive antithrombotic therapy.</p><p>The use of two antiplatelet agents is referred to as dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT); DAPT plus anticoagulant has been referred to as "triple oral antithrombotic therapy" or "triple therapy" for short. The term "combined antithrombotic therapy" is also used. The use of three antithrombotic agents reduces the risk of cardiac ischemic events but also increases the risk of bleeding compared with one or two antithrombotic agents. While triple therapy has been the practice for many years, evidence supports the use of two antithrombotic agents (an oral anticoagulant plus a P2Y<sub>12 </sub>inhibitor) in most cases after initial short-term triple therapy of up to one week. </p><p>This topic will provide the clinician with a guide for choosing a reasonable antithrombotic regimen for CAD patients with an indication for combined antithrombotic therapy after coronary artery stenting. Patients with an ACS treated medically (no stenting) who need oral anticoagulation are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/101.html" rel="external">"Acute coronary syndrome: Oral anticoagulation in medically treated patients"</a>.)</p><p>Other related topics include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1572.html" rel="external">"Long-term antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery stenting in stable patients", section on 'Our approach'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/101552.html" rel="external">"Periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy in patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulation and undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention", section on 'Elective patients'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/104830.html" rel="external">"Anticoagulation for prosthetic heart valves: Management of bleeding and invasive procedures", section on 'Cardiac catheterization'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1340.html" rel="external">"Anticoagulation therapy for venous thromboembolism (lower extremity venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) in adult patients with malignancy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1690630613"><span class="h1">ASSESSING PATIENT RISKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients who are candidates for combined antithrombotic therapy, the first step in choosing the antithrombotic regimen is to assess thrombotic and bleeding risks and assign the patient to one of four groups, which are discussed below. The type and duration of combined antithrombotic therapy should take into account this assignment. (See <a class="local">'Our approach'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thrombotic risk</strong> – Risk factors for a thrombotic (or ischemic) event (eg, myocardial infarction [MI], stroke that is often secondary to AF, need for repeat revascularization, or resuscitated out of hospital cardiac arrest) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) include recent acute coronary syndrome or stroke; complicated, multivessel CAD, particularly in patients with diabetes; a suboptimal result at the time of PCI; the need to prematurely stop antithrombotic therapy; age ≥65 years; prior stent thrombosis; and chronic kidney disease. In contrast, patients with stable disease, less complex coronary lesions, and optimal PCI results are felt to be at low risk of a subsequent thrombotic event. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bleeding risk</strong> – All patients taking oral anticoagulants (OAC) are at relatively high bleeding risk. We use the terms "low bleeding risk" and "high bleeding risk" to subdivide patients who are taking OAC. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Risk factors that increase the bleeding risk from high to very high after PCI include age ≥65 years, prior history of bleeding, and hypertension. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/119889.html" rel="external">"Risks and prevention of bleeding with oral anticoagulants"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/108359.html" rel="external">"High bleeding risk patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention", section on 'Definition of high bleeding risk'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Assessing the bleeding risk in patients with concomitant antiplatelet therapy and OAC is an important part of care. Risk prediction models are available to help categorize the patient [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Bleeding risk is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/108359.html" rel="external">"High bleeding risk patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention", section on 'Assessing individual patient risk'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In an analysis of the ISAR TRIPLE population [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], an enhanced platelet inhibition delivered by <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> is associated with an increased risk for major bleeding and death in patients with concomitant antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The role of platelet function testing to help identify those with a high bleeding risk where a less aggressive antithrombotic therapy is needed remains uncertain, and we do not think is routinely indicated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6684.html" rel="external">"Clopidogrel resistance and clopidogrel treatment failure", section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Based on an evaluation of thrombotic and bleeding risk, the patient taking OAC should be assigned to one of the following groups:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Low thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Low thrombotic risk and high bleeding risk</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>High thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>High thrombotic risk and high bleeding risk</p><p></p><p>Some patients will not fit easily into one of these four broad categories, and the clinician should use clinical judgement and patient preferences to guide the choice of antithrombotic therapy.

Many patients will fall between the ends of the benefit and risk spectrums for thrombosis and bleeding. </p><p>The relevant studies (see <a class="local">'Efficacy and safety'</a> below) provide a framework on which recommendations are made. However, differences between studies and individual study limitations prevent us from being able to make strong recommendations, particularly with regard to the duration of any antithrombotic combination, as well as the specific antithrombotic drugs.</p><p>There are three time periods that are discussed directly below: procedure to one month, discharge to 12 months, and after 12 months. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2401244949"><span class="h2">Procedure to one month</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients who are on triple therapy, we discontinue <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>, usually within the first week to one month following PCI. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4175003"><span class="h2">Discharge to 12 months</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The first step in choosing the antithrombotic regimen at the time of discharge is to assess thrombotic and bleeding risks and assign the patient to one of the following four groups. (See <a class="local">'Assessing patient risks'</a> above.)</p><p>The following points apply to most patients:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We discharge patients on a direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC; also referred to as non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [NOAC]) plus a P2Y<sub>12 </sub>inhibitor plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>. In most patients, we continue aspirin for up to one week based on how the randomized trials discussed below were carried out.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>During the first 12 months, any new ischemic or bleeding episode (or change in bleeding risk) should lead to a reevaluation of antithrombotic therapy in all four of the groups below. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the four patient groups below, we usually choose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> as the P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor. (See <a class="local">'Antiplatelet specifics'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>At 12 months, antithrombotic therapy should be reevaluated. (See <a class="local">'After 12 months'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1968314371"><span class="h3">Low thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We discharge patients not at the highest bleeding risk on a DOAC plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>. We continue aspirin for up to one week. This recommendation to continue aspirin after discharge is based on a high risk for early stent thrombosis in patients who discontinue aspirin early after PCI. Subsequently, we continue DOAC plus clopidogrel for 12 months. It is important to remember that early stent thrombosis should tip people off to the fact that there was residual disease not optimally treated by the stent.  </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1653709395"><span class="h3">Low thrombotic risk and high bleeding risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For these patients at high bleeding risk, we prefer to continue <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> for up to one week after discharge but consider discontinuing it at discharge in patients at highest risk of bleeding, provided that the angiographic result is optimal. Subsequently, we generally treat with DOAC plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> for 12 months. In patients at the very highest bleeding risk, we consider stopping the P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor at six months. It should be noted that a consensus document from the American College of Cardiology allows for discontinuation of the P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor at three months; in most cases, we are reluctant to stop the P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor at three months [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Recommendations of others'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2541166035"><span class="h3">High thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We discharge most patients on DOAC plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>. We usually continue aspirin for one month, at which time it is discontinued. We treat with DOAC plus clopidogrel for a total of 12 months after discharge. (See <a class="local">'After 12 months'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2173611"><span class="h3">High thrombotic risk and high bleeding risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We discharge these patients on DOAC plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> and continue the aspirin, if possible, for one month. We then continue DOAC plus clopidogrel for 12 months after discharge. However, it is difficult to make a single recommendation regarding the duration of antiplatelet therapy for patients in this group, as there is a tension between the two risks. Individualized patient decision-making is essential. The consensus document from the American College of Cardiology allows for treatment with DOAC plus clopidogrel for six months and then discontinuation of clopidogrel; we believe stopping clopidogrel at six months is too early. (See <a class="local">'After 12 months'</a> below.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2222624094"><span class="h2">After 12 months</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients in the four groups discussed above will be treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> plus DOAC for one year after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). After that time, antithrombotic therapy should be reevaluated and a long-term antithrombotic strategy put in place. </p><p>Although the AFIRE trial presented below argues for DOAC monotherapy, we think that either DOAC monotherapy or DOAC plus a single antiplatelet agent (either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a>) is a reasonable strategy after one year. We would like to see additional evidence to support the use of DOAC monotherapy before we make a broad recommendation for its use. (See <a class="local">'Long-term therapy studies'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients at the end of the spectrum where bleeding risk is high and ischemic risk is low, long-term DOAC monotherapy is reasonable. On the other hand, for patients at high ischemic risk and low bleeding risk, DOAC plus a single antiplatelet agent makes sense. For those patients committed to DOAC plus a single antiplatelet agent, the choice between <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> is also determined by consideration of bleeding and ischemic risks. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2492969741"><span class="h2">Anticoagulant specifics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most patients who require combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy, we choose a DOAC rather than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a>; an exception is for patients that have a mechanical value and who are taking warfarin. This choice is based on studies in the broad population of patients with AF for whom DOACs are preferred to warfarin for stroke prevention and the recent trials in which patients received DOAC in one arm and warfarin in the other [<a href="#rid5">5</a>] (see <a class="local">'Efficacy and safety'</a> below). The rates of major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage in particular are lower for all DOACs compared with warfarin, including studies of patients with AF post-PCI. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1031.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation in adults: Use of oral anticoagulants"</a>.)</p><p>Our preference for DOAC rather than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> may necessitate that some patients will need to have their OAC switched. In these patients, more detailed education is important to avoid confusion. From a clinical standpoint, some patients still need to switch from one DOAC to another because of their insurance coverage and deductibles. (See <a class="local">'Discharge to 12 months'</a> above.) </p><p>The following are specific anticoagulant recommendations: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We prefer DOAC rather than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> for most patients. For patients taking warfarin whose international normalized ratio (INR) has been relatively easy to maintain and who prefer to continue warfarin after having heard an explanation of the potential benefits of DOACs, it is reasonable to continue taking warfarin. In these patients, consideration should be given to home monitoring of INR to reduce variability in INR. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For these patients taking <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> and antiplatelet therapy, the INR should be monitored closely and ideally kept within the 2.0 to 2.5 range. For patients whose INRs have been difficult to manage for reasons other than compliance or in whom the risk of bleeding is thought to be high, switching to a DOAC is reasonable. A patient who has difficulty having blood drawn is an example. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When a DOAC is chosen, most of our experts use a dose or doses tested in randomized trials and approved by regulatory agencies. These trials are presented below (see <a class="local">'Efficacy and safety'</a> below). For all agents, attention to dose adjustment based on renal function, weight, and age is important. The specific DOAC chosen varies depending on patient characteristics, availability, and cost of the specific drug. Avoiding an incorrectly too-low dose is important as it leads to decreased efficacy, often without improving bleeding. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8926" href="/d/drug information/8926.html" rel="external">dabigatran</a>, this includes both the 150 mg twice daily dose and the 110 mg twice daily dose.
