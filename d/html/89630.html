         </span>
         Schizophrenia and addiction are both chronic disorders with serious complications, consequences, and costs for individuals and society. These conditions, which are also known as “dual diagnoses,” are associated with poor adherence to treatment and poorer outcomes when the co-occurring disorder is present.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some of the symptoms of schizophrenia overlap with symptoms of intoxication, chronic use, or withdrawal from alcohol or other drugs. Family history and the temporal relationship of symptoms can help to distinguish patients with a substance use disorder (SUD) alone from co-occurring schizophrenia and SUD.
        </p>
        <p>
         The psychiatric diagnoses in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), substance abuse and substance dependence, were replaced by one diagnosis, SUD, in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Although the crosswalk between DSM-IV and DSM-5 disorders is imprecise, substance dependence is approximately comparable to SUD, moderate to severe subtype, while substance abuse is similar to the mild subtype.
        </p>
        <p>
         Psychosocial interventions for patients with co-occurring schizophrenia and SUD are described here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, diagnosis, and pharmacotherapy for co-occurring schizophrenia and SUD are described separately. Psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia occurring alone and specific substance use disorders occurring alone are also discussed separately.

          OVERVIEW

         Treatment for co-occurring schizophrenia and substance use disorder (SUD) typically involves a combination of psychosocial intervention(s), described here, and pharmacotherapy, described separately. There is wide variability across the United States and internationally in the availability and content of psychosocial interventions for these disorders. In addition to the psychosocial interventions described here, treatment of SUD generally includes addiction counseling or psychotherapy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106146.html" rel="external">
          "Pharmacotherapy for co-occurring schizophrenia and substance use disorder"

          "Continuing care for addiction: Implementation"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with the co-occurring disorders, an intervention that reduces substance use can have secondary benefits on symptoms of schizophrenia (and vice versa). As examples, a patient with SUD who maintains abstinence may have better adherence to antipsychotic medication and thus fewer exacerbations. A patient with schizophrenia who is experiencing fewer psychotic symptoms may be better able to focus on and maintain abstinence.

         Interventions described in this topic are organized by the primary disorder they were developed to address; those that are used principally to treat schizophrenia include (see

         Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been modified and applied effectively to treat schizophrenia individually and SUD individually. Assertive community treatment (ACT) is used for patients with serious mental illness at risk of hospitalization or homelessness; a co-occurring SUD places individuals at increased risk and is an indication for ACT. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Modified CBT'
         </a>
         below and

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         We suggest an integrated, multimodal approach to treatment of patients with co-occurring schizophrenia and SUD, using psychosocial interventions described here and pharmacotherapy, described separately [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106146.html" rel="external">
          "Pharmacotherapy for co-occurring schizophrenia and substance use disorder", section on 'Integrated treatment'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Psychosocial strategies for these patients should be selected and individualized based on patients’ deficits and needs, and the treatment foci of the interventions described below. They should be delivered to this population with a low-stress and harm reduction approach that enhances motivation and effective interpersonal and coping skills, and enlists social supports [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinicians should seek to understand the personal experiences of health and lifestyle of schizophrenia patients, for whom dignity, relationships, acceptance of their illness, and fear of losing control of psychotic symptoms may play a role in persistence of substance use and lack of motivation for abstinence [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. All individuals with schizophrenia should be offered psychosocial interventions that include educational discussion of reasons to change and training in cognitive-behavioral strategies to reduce use, manage cravings and stress, and avoid relapse [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Principles of continuing care for SUD describe patient indications for adding additional treatment modalities to SUD care as including greater SUD severity, risk of relapse, response to prior treatment, and willingness to engage in additional treatment.

         </span>
         In our clinical experience, the specific interventions described below can be effective in patients with schizophrenia and co-occurring substance use disorder (SUD).
        </p>
        <p>
         However, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have not found clear evidence of the efficacy of psychosocial interventions [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. As an example, a Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of 41 clinical trials including 4024 individuals with co-occurring severe mental illness (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and psychosis) and substance use or SUD did not find evidence that any one psychosocial treatment improved outcomes related to remaining in treatment, reduction in substance use, or mental or global state compared with standard care [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Although limited support for motivational interviewing, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and contingency management on selected outcomes was reported in single studies, there was little evidence suggesting that integrated, nonintegrated, or skills-based training programs is superior to standard care. The quality of the clinical trials was rated poor due to sources of potential bias and methodologic limitations, including high attrition rates and varying interventions, outcome measures, treatment settings, and sample characteristics. However, these interventions have shown efficacy in noncomorbid schizophrenia and noncomorbid SUD.
        </p>
        <p>
         The absence of a robust evidence base for any one psychosocial treatment does not mean that particular treatments do not help on an individualized basis, but rather that the limited evidence found in currently available controlled trials needs further study to support their use. A strong consensus among clinicians and researchers with expertise in the subject supports the use of psychosocial interventions in addition to pharmacotherapy for patients with co-occurring schizophrenia and SUD with clinical needs/deficits targeted by the intervention [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,8

         Skills training has been found to reduce deficits in social interactions and independent living skills in patients with noncomorbid schizophrenia [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. However, data supporting the use of skills training in individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) and comorbid SUD are limited. Nevertheless, despite these limited data, our clinical experience supports the use of skills training in individuals with schizophrenia and comorbid SUD.
        </p>
        <p>
         Remediable skill deficits include difficulties with personal care, cooking, laundry, paying bills, and use of public transportation [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         An analysis of pooled data from two trials including 94 individuals with SMI and SUD treated with skills training versus usual treatment did not find a difference in outcomes as measured by global assessment of functioning [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Other studies investigating skills training for individuals with SUD and SMI have shown some benefits; however, the sample sizes are small and the quality of the evidence is low. As examples:

         A study of 31 outpatients with schizophrenia who met criteria for alcohol and/or cannabis use disorder were randomized to 18 months of cognitive enhancement therapy or usual care [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Cognitive enhancement therapy is a form of cognitive remediation combining computer-based individual and social-educational group therapy. Among patients who were able to engage, intent-to-treat efficacy analyses showed improvements in neurocognition, social cognition, and social adjustment with cognitive enhancement therapy. Further, individuals treated with cognitive enhancement therapy were more likely to reduce alcohol (but not cannabis) use. However, while participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the therapy, there were significant challenges with recruitment, retention, attrition and engagement in this comorbid population.
        </p>

         In a study of vulnerability to victimization and criminal abuse, 250 individuals with dual diagnosis were randomly assigned to usual care plus a manual-based skills program designed to develop skills in emotional regulation, conflict resolution, and street-wise safety (Self-wise, Other-wise, Streetwise [SOS] training) versus usual care [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. SOS training resulted in greater response rate (defined as at least a 50 percent reduction in the number of past year victimization incidents at 14-month follow-up) versus control group (68 versus 54 percent; odds ratio 1.78, 95% CI 1.02-3.11).

         Family-based educational treatment is focused on teaching family members and patients about co-occurring disorders and their treatment in order to help them make informed treatment decisions and to access clinical or community services.

         A clinical trial of 108 patients with serious mental illness (77 percent schizophrenia spectrum disorders) and their families compared treatment as usual with treatment with a brief family educational program, and with a longer and more intensive family program (Family Intervention for Dual Disorders [FIDD]) [

         Assertive community treatment (ACT) is a high-intensity, integrated model for delivering clinical and social services to patients in the community rather than in traditional clinical settings. ACT is intended for individuals with SMI at risk of hospitalization or homelessness. A co-occurring SUD, which often places schizophrenia patients at an elevated risk, is a clinical indication for ACT.

         ACT has been found to reduce hospitalization and homelessness in patients with co-occurring SMI and SUD [

          17

As an example, case managers may help patients with management of their finances, particularly those who binge heavily on substances after a monthly government disability check arrives, and suffer consequences of insufficient funds for the remainder of the month. Fiduciary assistance ensures that funds are applied to meet essential needs, such as rent and food, before money is released to the patient for discretionary spending.

         Our clinical experience supports the use of motivational interviewing in individuals with schizophrenia and comorbid SUD who lack readiness to participate actively in substance-related treatment for the SUD. Clinical trials have found motivational interviewing in patients with co-occurring severe mental illness and SUD to be effective on several measurements; however, the trials were of low quality, with small sample sizes, brief interventions, and short follow-up [

         Mutual help groups such as 12-step programs (eg, Alcohol Anonymous [AA]) provide peer support in identifying triggers for relapse, coping with negative emotions, and providing emotional, cognitive, and social tools for preventing relapse and maintaining sobriety.
        </p>
        <p>
         We typically encourage individuals with schizophrenia and SUD to participate in mutual help groups after their psychotic symptoms are reasonably well stabilized. Participation would not be recommended for patients with prominent paranoid or persecutory delusions. Many psychiatric facilities and community mental health programs offer specialized dual focus 12-step groups for patients with co-occurring disorders. These programs offer a similar peer group and often address psychiatric and substance use symptoms [

         We favor a multimodal approach to treatment of patients with co-occurring schizophrenia and substance use disorder (SUD). Patients with these dual diagnoses often have multiple clinical needs/deficits that psychosocial interventions address. Evidence from clinical trials is insufficient to favor specific sequences or combinations of interventions.

         Principles of continuing care for addiction, described separately, suggest increasing the intensity and/or number of interventions (such as motivational interviewing, contingency management, mutual help groups, and cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]) when lesser treatment fails to reduce substance use or prevent relapse. The overall complexity of the patient’s treatment plan, however, must be weighed against the patient's cognitive and self-care capacities, willingness to participate, and capacity for adherence. More intensive protocols may require external support from family, friends, or professional caregivers. (See

         In another randomized trial of 404 patients with first-episode psychosis, 52 percent of whom met criteria for SUD, NAVIGATE (a team-based early intervention service comprising personalized medication management, psychoeducation, resilience-focused therapy, and education and employment support) did not reduce self-reported substance use over two years [

         A six-month trial of 129 outpatients with substance use and serious mental illness (39.5 percent with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) randomly assigned patients to a multimodal intervention, the Behavioral Treatment for Substance Abuse in Severe and Persistent Mental Illness program, which included motivational interviewing, contingency management, social skills training, psychoeducation, collaborative goal setting, and relapse prevention or a manualized control condition [

         We suggest multimodal, integrated care for patients with co-occurring schizophrenia and substance use disorder (SUD) rather than traditional, parallel treatment (ie, where schizophrenia is treated by mental health clinicians and SUD is treated by clinicians in the addictions sector) (

        </p>

         Multimodal care generally includes pharmacotherapy and one or more psychosocial interventions. When integrated treatment is not available, clinicians treating the co-occurring disorders and using different modalities should closely coordinate care. (See

         Despite the absence of compelling support from clinical trials, these interventions are strongly supported by a consensus among clinicians and researchers with expertise on the subject. Clinical trials do not provide adequate information to guide the sequencing or combinations of interventions that would lead to superior clinical outcomes. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Specific interventions'

         Selection among psychosocial interventions is based on the patient’s clinical needs and deficits, the clinician and patient’s prioritization among them, and response to prior interventions. A higher severity of illness and and/or risk of relapse favor more intensive treatment (eg, more sessions, additional interventions); however, the overall complexity of the patient’s treatment plan must be weighed against the patient's cognitive and self-care capacities, willingness to participate, and capacity for adherence.
