         Relapsing polychondritis (RPC) is a systemic inflammatory disease that can potentially compromise the structural and functional integrity of cartilage, organs of special sense, and the cardiovascular, renal, and nervous systems  (

         </span>
         The diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis (RPC) is established by recognition of a specific pattern of organ involvement, based on clinical findings combined with laboratory data and imaging (see
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnostic criteria'
         </a>
         below). There is no blood test that is specific for RPC.

         Two sets of criteria are available to make the diagnosis of RPC; however, these criteria were based on small samples and have not been validated in larger cohorts.

         The diagnosis of RPC is challenging because of the relapsing nature of the disease, lack of diagnostic tests, and the absence of clear clinicopathologic criteria for establishing the diagnosis. Furthermore, patients may have only some of the classic clinical features; for example, patients may present with only unilateral auricular chondritis or isolated nasal chondritis.

         The most important tool to achieve the diagnosis of RPC is the clinical history. A complete and detailed review of systems is critical to establish the diagnosis. Laboratory testing is used mainly to rule out other conditions that can mimic RPC. Biopsy is not necessary when the clinical diagnosis is evident.

         Additional studies are required to establish the extent and severity of disease and organ damage. (See

         <strong>
          History
         </strong>
         – A detailed review of systems is crucial to understand the degree of organ involvement over time. It is important to elicit specific characteristics, such as symptom onset, triggers, duration, and associated symptoms. For example, a patient presenting with ear chondritis should be asked about associated symptoms, such as erythema and swelling, and whether ear tenderness is triggered by minimal trauma. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5606.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical manifestations of relapsing polychondritis", section on 'Clinical manifestations'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Features of associated conditions that may heighten suspicion of RPC, such as a past medical history of an established autoimmune syndrome or symptoms of an early antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, are also important in the evaluation. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5606.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Physical examination
         </strong>
         – The physical examination should pay particular attention to the external ears, auditory canals, nasal contour, eyes, skin, and joints (including the costochondral joints). The cardiopulmonary examination should include auscultation for stridor, wheeze, regurgitant heart murmurs and abdominal bruits. (See

          To exclude other condition
         </strong>
         – There are no specific laboratory blood tests used to diagnose RPC. However, some testing may be required to exclude other conditions that may mimic RPC, such as a complete blood count and differential and a C-reactive protein (CRP) if infection is suspected. In a patient with unilateral chondritis, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is often normal in patients with active RPC. In male patients with ear, nose chondritis, thrombocytopenia, and macrocytic anemia, it is important to rule out vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic (VEXAS) syndrome. (See

         Biopsy is not necessary for the diagnosis of RPC when the diagnosis can be established based on clinical findings (see
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnostic criteria'
         </a>

         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         need a confirmatory biopsy. Biopsy may be useful when infection is highly suspected or in cases when the clinical diagnosis is uncertain (eg, without a clear multiorgan cartilaginous inflammatory syndrome or nonresponse to
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">
          prednisone
         </a>
         ). For individuals who have unilateral auricular inflammation that does not respond to antibiotics or a trial of prednisone, biopsy should usually be performed to rule out an infiltrating disorder of the skin, such as leukemia cutis or cutaneous lymphoma. (See

         – In patients with cough, dyspnea, stridor, or wheezing, pulmonary function tests (PFTs; including flow-volume loops) and computed tomography (CT) of the chest (including inspiratory and expiratory images) should be obtained. The main reason for obtaining PFTs is to exclude alternate conditions (eg, asthma), although, in select patients, they may be useful for tracking progression of disease affecting the large airways. PFTs may fail to demonstrate upper airway collapse; thus, a chest CT is also recommended in patients with respiratory symptoms.

         Relapsing polychondritis (RPC) is distinguished from other diseases that can mimic one or more of its features by the coexistence of usually widespread and (in some cases) destructive inflammatory lesions involving cartilaginous structures throughout the body, sensory organs, and the cardiovascular system. However, the variable, unpredictable expression of clinical features over time may make the diagnosis difficult to distinguish from other conditions with overlapping features. The differential diagnosis depends upon the region involved clinically. (See

Biopsy to distinguish GPA from RPC is usually not necessary due to other systemic manifestations that may be present that respectively characterize each condition and the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), which characterize GPA. Rarely, isolated subglottic stenosis may be the sole manifestation of limited GPA, and biopsy confirming the presence of granulomatous inflammation can be helpful. (See

          Other studies

         – Other studies have been used in the evaluation of patients with RPC, particularly for the assessment of pulmonary and cardiac involvement, but are not widely available for general clinical use or have not been sufficiently tested to determine how to use them optimally in clinical practice. These include fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and other studies. (See

         Additional testing is determined by the clinical presentation of the patient. At least half of patients with RPC have another associated inflammatory disorder. Testing would be based upon the requirements for monitoring the other illness, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Behçet syndrome or an ANCA-associated vasculitis. One subset of patients who present an ongoing diagnostic challenge are older patients with a refractory anemia not responding to antiinflammatory therapies. Eventual diagnosis of a myelodysplastic syndrome may require years of follow-up and ongoing reassessment by hematologists.

         Functional and anatomical evaluation for upper and lower airway disease is essential in the evaluation and management of RPC.

         PFT may show varying degrees of inspiratory and/or expiratory obstruction; the magnitude varies with the location and character of the pathologic process [

          10

         A CT scan of the large airways provides more detail than plain radiography and should be performed at baseline in all patients with a diagnosis of RPC. CT scanning is more useful than conventional tomograms and laryngotracheograms in evaluating laryngotracheal bronchial wall thickening, luminal narrowing, and cartilaginous calcification [
         <a href="#rid11">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Attention to the technique of performing the CT scan may be important. Changes in the caliber of the tracheobronchial tree may be missed if the CT scan is only performed during inspiration (which is the usual method). This was illustrated in a report of 18 patients with RPC who were referred for airway imaging [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. The majority of patients exhibited expiratory CT abnormalities, but only one-half had abnormalities on routine inspiratory CT scans. Thus, selected slices covering at least the major airways should be obtained in expiration  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80171" href="/z/d/graphic/80171.html" rel="external">
          image 1

         ). A three-dimensional reconstruction of the tracheobronchial images may be useful.

         The CT scan is partially limited by its inability to distinguish fibrosis from inflammation.

         MRI, with its multiplanar imaging capability and superior soft tissue contrast, is particularly useful for evaluating the trachea and larynx in patients with RPC. It distinguishes fibrosis from inflammation (in contrast to CT) and inflammation from edema, even in the presence of subclinical disease [

        </p>
        <p>
         There are two potential limitations to MRI. The length of time required for imaging may create a problem in the patient with respiratory compromise, and there may be low anatomical resolution due to image degradation caused by respiratory motion. The utility of MRI for follow-up in a patient with inflammation documented on bronchoscopy has not been established.

Further research with this technique is warranted prior to its use in routine clinical practice. Another limitation of PET/CT is that, at times, it may also fail to reveal changes evident by other techniques, including bronchoscopy. However, unlike CT scanning, PET/CT has the advantage of noninvasive detection of active laryngotracheal inflammation [

          Disease definition

         – Relapsing polychondritis (RPC) is a systemic inflammatory debilitating disease process that may potentially compromise the structural and functional integrity of cartilage, sensory organs, and the cardiovascular and nervous systems  (

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis is based on empirically derived clinical diagnostic criteria, which rely upon the presence of a combination of a sufficient number of key clinical features, such as auricular, nasal, and/or respiratory tract chondritis; seronegative nonerosive inflammatory polyarthritis; ocular inflammation; cochlear and/or vestibular dysfunction  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef110028" href="/z/d/graphic/110028.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). There is no single reliable diagnostic laboratory test for RPC. Biopsy is not necessary when the diagnosis can be established on clinical grounds, but it may be useful to rule out other diagnoses. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Differential diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The differential diagnosis for RPC is broad and depends on the specific clinical manifestations present (eg, auricular inflammation, saddle nose deformity, airway narrowing, ocular inflammation, systemic inflammation, aortitis, or chest wall pain). (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – The initial diagnostic evaluation for RPC should include a thorough medical history and physical examination, with particular attention to the ears, nose, eyes, skin, joints, and cardiopulmonary examination. We also suggest evaluation by an otolaryngologist for all patients (including hearing tests) due to the prominent involvement of the ear, nose, and respiratory tract in RPC.

         There are no specific blood tests used to diagnose RPC. Tissue biopsy is generally used to exclude other diagnoses, such as infection. (See

          Post-diagnostic studies

         – For all patients with RPC, we suggest baseline pulmonary function tests (with flow-volume loops), chest CT (with inspiratory and expiratory views), transthoracic echocardiogram, serum creatinine, urinalysis, complete blood count, and an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) panel.
