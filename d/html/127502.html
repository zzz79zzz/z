         The table summarizes major considerations for the clinician reviewing the genetic test results  (

          table 1

         ). These include the importance of obtaining a hard copy or digital report rather than a verbal statement, confirming which person was tested, and determining whether the test evaluated a targeted panel of common variants or the entire

        </p>
        <p>
         Testing used to guide clinical care should be performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory or other nationally or regionally certified laboratory. If not done initially and results are to be used in clinical decision-making, testing should be repeated in a certified clinical laboratory. Decision-making may be affected by positive results (expected or unexpected) or negative results in an individual at risk for carrying a disease variant. (See

         encodes the alpha subunit of beta-hexosaminidase A (also called hexosaminidase A), an enzyme in lysosomes that breaks down gangliosides (glycolipids derived from neuronal membranes).
        </p>
        <p>
         When enzyme activity is deficient, gangliosides accumulate inside neuronal lysosomes, causing neuronal cell death and progressive neurodegeneration. Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is the resulting disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         Absence (or near absence) of enzyme activity is required to damage neurons; neurons that have approximately half-normal activity are unaffected. Thus, TSD is autosomal recessive, requiring
         <em>
          HEXA

         disease variant(s) on both paternally and maternally inherited genes (homozygosity or compound heterozygosity)  (

         TSD is a neurodegenerative lysosomal disease and a form of hereditary ataxia.
        </p>
        <p>
         The age of presentation varies but is typically in infancy. In the classical infantile presentation, motor development is normal during the first few months of life, with symptom onset at approximately five to six months of age.
        </p>
        <p>
         Symptoms include incoordination, exaggerated startle response, loss of muscle tone, progressive neurologic deterioration, functional decline, and loss of previously-attained developmental milestones; the median survival is approximately four years [
         <a href="#rid7">

          picture 1
         </a>
         ) typically develops between 3 and 12 months of age. It is caused by accumulated glycolipids in neuroretinal cells surrounding the macula. The spot is the normal color of the macula; pallor surrounding the macula creates the appearance. The cherry red spot is not specific for TSD; it can be seen in other neuronopathic lysosomal diseases. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6234.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Juvenile and adult-onset (also called late-onset) forms of TSD are less common. Typical ages of presentation are two to five years and adolescence to early adulthood, respectively. Adults with late-onset disease have a more variable course including psychosis and gait disturbance [

         Following clinical assessment, diagnosis is made by serum testing for enzyme activity and/or genetic testing for
         <em>
