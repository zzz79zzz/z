         Since individuals with HTAD are at moderate or high risk of complications during or following pregnancy, they should receive specialized evaluation, counseling, and management by a multidisciplinary pregnancy heart team prior to conception and during and following pregnancy, including delivery and the postpartum period [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The pregnancy heart team should include, at a minimum, a cardiologist, maternal-fetal medicine specialist/obstetrician, cardiovascular surgeon, and provider with expertise in genetics (genetic counselor or geneticist) [

         </span>
         Monitoring in pregnant patients with HTAD includes serial imaging of the aorta, generally by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) if prepregnancy TTE imaging provided reliable imaging of the affected/vulnerable aortic segment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without gadolinium contrast is the preferred modality for imaging of the entire aorta during pregnancy for those who have not undergone preconception evaluation or who have inadequate ascending aorta imaging by TTE.

         Aortic measurement methods are discussed separately. (See

         </span>
         Serial clinical assessment should include TTE monitoring in all pregnant patients with HTAD, even among patients with baseline aortic root diameter ≤40 mm, assuming the ascending aorta can be adequately visualized using echocardiography [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6
         </a>
         ]. We suggest clinical and echocardiographic follow-up every 8 to 12 weeks if the aortic root diameter remains ≤40 mm, and we suggest follow-up every four to eight weeks if the aortic root diameter is &gt;40 mm. The frequency of clinical and imaging follow-up should be individualized depending on patient characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach is similar to the approaches recommended in major society guidelines. The 2018 European Society of Cardiology guidelines suggest repeat echocardiographic imaging every 4 to 12 weeks during pregnancy and six months postpartum in patients with ascending aorta dilation [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, the 2022 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association aortic disease guidelines recommend echocardiographic measurement of the aortic root and ascending aortic dimensions at least once each trimester and again several weeks postpartum for patients with an aortopathic condition such as HTAD [
         <a href="#rid1">

         </span>
         When TTE is not sufficient to image the ascending aorta, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging without gadolinium is recommended over computed tomography (CT) for elective imaging in pregnant patients with aortic dilation to avoid exposing the mother and fetus to ionizing radiation [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,7
         </a>
         ]. Also, in patients with HTAD with aortic arch or descending aorta dilation or with aneurysm or chronic dissection of head or neck vessels or abdominal visceral arteries, we suggest serial CMR imaging without gadolinium during pregnancy [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         CMR imaging without gadolinium contrast is preferred and is generally sufficient for monitoring aortic size [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Gadolinium should generally be avoided in the pregnant patient, unless there is a specific indication for gadolinium contrast and the potential benefit is deemed to outweigh the potential risk to the fetus (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4791.html" rel="external">
          "Diagnostic imaging in pregnant and lactating patients", section on 'Magnetic resonance imaging'
         </a>
         ). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is an alternative for imaging the thoracic aorta, but the distal ascending aorta and proximal aortic arch are generally not well visualized by this modality and serial comparison is challenging.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a patient with suspected aortic dissection, CT is the preferred imaging modality.

        </p>
        <p>
         The use of beta blocker therapy in pregnant patients with HTAD is an extension of the indication for beta blocker therapy in patients with MFS with aortic dilation. Since pregnancy is associated with increased risk of aortic complications, we suggest beta blocker therapy during pregnancy in patients with or without aortic dilation in an attempt to minimize progressive aortic dilation and risk of aortic dissection by decreasing aortic wall stress. This approach is based largely on indirect evidence in nonpregnant patients with MFS. Limited evidence is available on the effects of beta blocker therapy in pregnant patients with MFS and other HTADs. Observational studies suggest that beta blocker therapy does not abolish the risk of progressive aortic dilation and aortic dissection during pregnancy [

         Patients with HTAD are commonly treated with an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) with or without a beta blocker to reduce the risk of aortic complications. Patients with HTAD who are taking an ARB should be gradually transitioned to beta blocker therapy prior to conception, given the risk of congenital malformation and fetal loss with gestational use of an ARB. Down-titration of the ARB to off and up-titration of the beta blocker as appropriate (to maintain the heart rate after submaximal exercise &lt;100 bpm) should occur over a period of weeks prior to conception.

         The diagnosis and management of acute aortic emergency or aortic dissection that occurs during pregnancy or the postpartum period are similar to that for aortic dissection in general. (See

         Given the lethal nature of aortic dissection, prompt diagnosis and intervention are critical. A review including papers describing 36 females with MFS with aortic dissection antepartum or postpartum reported a 21 percent maternal mortality rate and 12 percent fetal mortality rate [

         When aortic dissection is suspected, confirming the diagnosis is the first priority. For pregnant patients presenting with a high clinical suspicion for acute aortic dissection, CT is the test of choice given its widespread availability, reliability, and imaging speed. Other imaging modalities, such as TEE or CMR are generally reserved for nonacute settings (eg, follow-up of chronic aortic dissection) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. When CMR is performed, no gadolinium contrast is generally required, although gadolinium may be appropriate if it enhances the clarity of the diagnosis. Limited data suggest that the risk to the fetus of gadolinium may be minimal [

         Optimal treatment of aortic dissection during pregnancy requires individualized management by a multidisciplinary pregnancy and aortic heart team. The choice of medical, percutaneous, or surgical aortic treatment is based upon the patient's diagnosis, stability, the location of aortic dissection, and the gestational age of the fetus.

         There is no strong consensus regarding the preferred mode of delivery for patients with HTAD since scant evidence is available. The method of delivery should be carefully considered and individualized. We do not believe that there is sufficient information to endorse any general recommendations. General obstetric principles should be applied to select the least hemodynamically stressful mode of delivery in the context of the particular pregnancy at hand unless there is an overriding specific obstetric indication for cesarean delivery.

          Multidisciplinary care
         </strong>
         – Multidisciplinary preconception, pregnancy, and postpartum care for patients with hereditable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD) should be provided by a pregnancy heart team at a center with experience in management of HTAD, and access to maternal fetal medicine, specialized imaging, and cardiac/aortic surgical intervention is recommended for all patients with HTAD. The pregnancy heart team should include, at a minimum, a cardiologist, maternal-fetal medicine specialist/obstetrician, anesthesiologist, cardiovascular surgeon, and provider with expertise in genetics (genetic counselor or geneticist). (See
         <a class="local">

          General management during pregnancy
         </strong>
         – All pregnant patients with HTAD require regular cardiovascular follow-up during pregnancy with individualized frequency of follow-up and imaging. (See

         <strong>
          Monitoring
         </strong>
         – For monitoring during pregnancy, we suggest clinical and echocardiographic follow-up every 8 to 12 weeks if the aortic root diameter remains ≤40 mm for Marfan syndrome (MFS) and Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), and we suggest follow-up every four to eight weeks if the aortic root diameter is &gt;40 mm.

          Beta blocker therapy
         </strong>
         – For patients with HTAD, we suggest beta blocker therapy during pregnancy and for at least six weeks postpartum (

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). The duration of therapy should be individualized based on patient diagnosis, aortic dimension, and shared decision making between the patient and pregnancy heart team. We prefer

         – All pregnant patients with HTAD should deliver at a medical center where emergency aortic repair is frequently performed. The mode of delivery should be carefully considered and individualized for patients with HTAD by a multidisciplinary pregnancy heart team. Beta blocker therapy is continued during labor to minimize surges in blood pressure and cardiac output. (See

          Postpartum care

         – Due to the increased risk of aortic dissection postpartum, patients with HTAD should be monitored for complications during the first four to six weeks postpartum. For patients with HTAD and aortic root/ascending aortic diameter &gt;40 mm, long-term recommendations for beta blocker therapy or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) apply during and after the postpartum period, with modifications made in consultation with the infant's pediatric clinician if the patient is breastfeeding.
