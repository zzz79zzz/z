Preventive health care is an important aspect of medical practice, leading to significant improvements in overall health [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Several issues are involved in providing effective preventive care. Clinicians need to prioritize and decide which of the many available preventive services to recommend and which to discourage to prevent harm from inappropriate tests or interventions. Clinicians also must find a way to deliver preventive services efficiently within the context of a busy clinical practice.</p><p>This topic will discuss the approach to prevention and how to prioritize preventive services. It will also summarize primary prevention and screening recommendations primarily targeting United States adults &lt;65 years old. The recommendations are a compilation of those from individual UpToDate topics, in which the rationale and evidence base for the recommendations are provided.</p><p>Preventive care in certain populations and disease-specific screening recommendations are discussed in more detail in specific topic reviews.

Rather than performing a standardized comprehensive examination ("full physical") on all patients, clinicians should individualize screening and prevention interventions to maximize value, which encompasses the tradeoffs between benefits, harms, and costs [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p>We recommend referring to the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fuspreventiveservicestaskforce.org%2Fuspstf%2F&amp;token=hum7mOjesmoz9h1l%2Fh7HCdMOrFvWaeGS4DETw1KALCRTfL7z%2BhsONGNkfmJz4ow6wqumLGRn6hwVLqtArVD%2Bjg%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=97819" target="_blank">website</a> for the most up-to-date screening <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org%2FPage%2FName%2Frecommendations&amp;token=c3eYJaI7rhYlvoz%2ByNegNJqsHHMW2K5dbaRrTdEoQD2PyTr9M%2Fa1LaraMvMxIeY5F0dD15Z5qoiwMvKia7kxBO7zcrgYiFR7EmRn4iG8rVM%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=97819" target="_blank">recommendations</a> based on systematic reviews of available evidence.

The effects of recommended preventive interventions on longevity or quality of life vary widely, and the potential beneficial effect of any one intervention on an individual patient varies with their lifestyle, medical and family history, and other risk factors [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Available tools to help clinicians prioritize preventive services include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The Partnership for Prevention, which ranks preventive services based on the clinically preventable burden of disease and the cost-effectiveness of interventions [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].

Risks and benefits should be communicated to patients in a way that they can understand, which can be challenging because many patients have a limited understanding of probabilities. A 2014 systematic review found that patients are better able to understand absolute than relative risks, and that visual aids can be helpful [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Studies also suggest that patients tend to overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms of interventions (including screening tests) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>Further, scheduled preventive interventions (eg, cancer screenings) may need to be deferred due to intercurrent individual illness or a larger public health crises (eg, epidemic or pandemic infectious disease) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In such circumstances, patients should be reassured that preventative interventions will be resumed when appropriate. Cancer screening during the coronavirus pandemic is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128993.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Considerations in patients with cancer", section on 'Impact of the pandemic on cancer screening'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H186697354"><span class="h2">Overview of USPSTF recommendations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The USPSTF publishes evidence-based recommendations for multiple clinical preventive services based upon systematic reviews, each of which is graded based on a set of definitions [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org%2Fuspstf%2Frecommendation-topics%2Fuspstf-a-and-b-recommendations&amp;token=y%2BF6vzA4RsMB7ezuBMvGZiqLWOmG5NIhzl7fXfzzJddqjByu90avUVSSYdBdwGjCzl4nwNspfh9138YbeWksYTJ3GrxXnunxw4Ei0z1MLofVxHbAg5Yb5cbPIZYfpDkU&amp;TOPIC_ID=97819" target="_blank">USPSTF A and B level recommendations</a> – The USPSTF recommends certain screening and counseling interventions either with high certainty that the net benefit is substantial ("Grade A"), with high certainty that the net benefit is moderate, or with moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial ("Grade B").

If the service is offered, patients should understand the uncertainty about the balance of benefits and harms.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H186697420"><span class="h2">Harms of screening</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are harms associated with screening, including anxiety produced by false-positive screening tests, harms associated with diagnostic testing after a positive screening test, overdiagnosis of conditions that may be treated but would never have become clinically apparent, and cost [<a href="#rid12">12-14</a>]. Comorbid conditions may decrease the benefits and increase the harms associated with screening [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The benefits of screening may decrease as patients get older, particularly for cancer screening [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Cancer screening in older adults is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3017.html" rel="external">"Geriatric health maintenance", section on 'Cancer screening'</a>.)</p><p>Clinicians should make sure that patients understand the potential harms prior to screening and consider comorbidities when discussing screening. Patients may weigh potential benefits and harms of screening and, in some cases, decide against screening. This is a reasonable decision that should be accepted by clinicians. The optimal screening rate is less than 100 percent when patients are adequately counseled regarding the potential benefits and harms of screening.</p><p>Screening of patients who are unlikely to benefit from screening is common. As an example, in an observational study including 27,000 patients ≥65 years, 31 to 55 percent of those with ≥75 percent risk of nine-year mortality had received prostate, breast, cervical, or colorectal cancer screening within the previous two to five years [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H186697682"><span class="h1">HOW TO EFFICIENTLY DELIVER PREVENTION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H186697688"><span class="h2">Periodic "check-up"</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are no strict guidelines for the optimal frequency of periodic visits, and there is no evidence on which to base optimal frequency recommendations [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Annual examinations are not indicated for most younger patients, although people with chronic health issues (such as diabetes) warrant regular visits, with or without a periodic health maintenance visit, independent of age [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. In the absence of such indications, we suggest periodic health maintenance visits every three years for adult patients ≤49 years without chronic conditions, and annually for adults ≥50 years. For people who have no chronic conditions and rarely see a clinician, a periodic health evaluation visit may be the only opportunity to discuss preventive care.</p><p>Preventive counseling and services are an important component of the periodic health check-up [<a href="#rid20">20-22</a>]. Preventive services are more likely to be discussed when patients have an established relationship with an identified clinician. Studies have shown that patients who were connected to a specific clinician have higher rates of preventive services received [<a href="#rid22">22-25</a>]. Patients with more visits to their primary care providers were more likely to undergo screening for colorectal and breast cancer, have lower incidence and mortality of colorectal and breast cancer, and have lower overall mortality. Periodic visits may have other benefits, such as developing the patient-clinician relationship, relieving patient "worry," and educating patients about how to access the health care system [<a href="#rid21">21,26</a>].</p><p>In a 2014 meta-analysis including six randomized trials, general practice-based health checks did not decrease mortality but improved surrogate outcomes (blood pressure control, decreases in total cholesterol and body mass index [BMI]), especially in high-risk patients [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. In another meta-analysis including 14 randomized trials and over 180,000 participants, there was no beneficial effect of general health checks on total, cardiovascular or cancer mortality despite increased detection of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia as well as increased use of antihypertensives [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. However, some methodologic problems of the included trials (including the age of some trials which predated the routine use of statins) may limit interpretation of the results.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18348568"><span class="h2">Discussing stopping or reducing screening</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Changes to recommendations that result in a decrease in the intensity of screening or discontinuing screening for those patients with reduced likelihood of benefit may be problematic for patients. In particular, patients may be confused by these changes, especially if they view screening as something they can do to protect themselves from a feared condition [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. How best to explain the rationale for less-intensive or discontinued screening can be challenging. Although we know of no easy formula for conducting these discussions, some general suggestions may be useful:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The idea that screening programs can result in harm is often new to patients. Patients should be educated that the primary issue underlying any screening recommendation is the balance between the likelihood of benefit and the risk of harm. A discussion of hypothetical examples that illustrate how screening may lead to unnecessary, difficult, and possibly risky diagnostic procedures (such as lung biopsy) or treatment (such as chemotherapy for cancer that would not have become clinically apparent over the patient's lifetime) may be helpful.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One may acknowledge the patient's interest in preserving health and longevity and refocus the patient away from more intensive or longer screening toward other prevention activities that bring a higher likelihood of benefit.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For older patients with limited life expectancy, it may also be useful to start the discussion of stopping screening some years before actual stopping. Older patients, advised over years that screening is an important part of medical care, may view stopping screening as an indication that they are no longer "worth" the expense or effort [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Again, hypothetical stories may be used to illustrate the reality that the probability of benefit from screening decreases and the probability of harm from overdiagnosis increases in advanced age. In addition, harm occurs soon after screening while any benefit occurs only years after screening. For example, for colorectal cancer and breast cancer screening, a patient must live 10 years to have a 1 in 1000 probability of having their life extended, and 16 years to have a 2 in 1000 probability [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. If a patient is overdiagnosed, however, they receive unnecessary treatment (often including surgery) soon after diagnosis.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18348575"><span class="h2">Supportive office systems</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Creative approaches using office systems can assist in delivering needed preventive care [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. As an example, practices have successfully used databases of eligible patients (eg, for flu shots, mammograms, diabetic eye exams, etc) and automatic reminders to outreach to patients and assist in delivering routine preventive care [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. In one study of interventions to promote screening for colorectal cancer, mailings to patients were somewhat more effective than electronic reminders to clinicians [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Finally, using decision aids and/or training medical assistants to discuss important preventive services before a visit with a clinician can be more efficient and effective in helping patients make informed decisions [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2257400650"><span class="h1">CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE PREVENTION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3781200188"><span class="h2">Cardiovascular risk assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients aged ≥20 years should undergo cardiovascular risk assessment every three to five years.</p><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk can be estimated using one of several widely available tools, each with advantages and disadvantages. While all of the risk assessment tools have advantages and disadvantages, no single tool will be appropriate for all patients.

MCD tests analyze blood samples for molecular signals (eg, DNA, proteins) that are produced by cancer cells. Although they are intended to serve as adjuncts to standard cancer screening tests, MCDs can result in substantial downstream testing, which can be costly. A positive test result requires additional imaging and diagnostic work-up, particularly since MCD tests often do not specify the type of cancer or the organ(s) that are involved. </p><p>Although some MCD tests are commercially available and may detect cancer signals across a wide diversity of malignancies [<a href="#rid45">45</a>], their clinical utility for cancer screening remains uncertain. Results from studies to date are generally not reflective of test performance in larger populations who typically undergo screening (ie, asymptomatic individuals in primary care). Most importantly, no studies have shown that MCD testing improves clinical outcomes, such as cancer-related deaths, particularly in comparison with existing screening methodologies [<a href="#rid46">46,47</a>]. Representative studies include: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A prospective cohort study (PATHFINDER) performed MCD testing in a convenience sample of 6621 asymptomatic adults aged 50 years or older, 31 percent of whom had a known cancer predisposition or prior cancer (a high-risk population).

Of the true positives, 17 percent had recurrence of previous disease. The median time to diagnostic resolution was 57 days in true positives, and longer (162 days) in false positives. Most participants had further work-up with laboratory tests and imaging, and procedures were done in 30 percent of participants with false-positive results and 82 percent of those with true-positive results. In this high-risk study population, the overall sensitivity of MCD testing was only moderate (29 percent), suggesting that MCD testing would need to occur in conjunction with standard cancer screening methods in order to be effective [<a href="#rid47">47</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A multicenter cohort study of 6238 participants in England and Wales evaluated the utility of an MCD test in adult patients who were referred for urgent investigation of non-specific symptoms that were possibly caused by lung, gastrointestinal, or gynecologic cancers [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. This study population was therefore not typical of an asymptomatic screening population. In this cohort of symptomatic patients, the test was highly specific (98 percent) but only moderately sensitive (66 percent).

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on "patient info" and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Basics topics (see  <a class="medical medical_basics" href="/d/html/16169.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Breast cancer screening (The Basics)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_basics" href="/d/html/16561.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Lung cancer screening (The Basics)"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H738218599"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prioritizing preventive care</strong> – Appropriate screening and prevention interventions need to be prioritized both for effectiveness in modifying target outcomes and for risk of the condition in the individual patient. (See <a class="local">'Prioritizing preventive services'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Periodic health maintenance visits</strong> – We suggest periodic health maintenance visits every three years for adult patients ≤49 years without chronic conditions, and annually for adults ≥50 years. Preventive counseling and services are an important component of the periodic health check-up. (See <a class="local">'Periodic "check-up"'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Challenges of delivering screening and counseling interventions</strong> – Patients may not receive appropriate screening and prevention interventions if the time for addressing these needs is limited to a "routine physical examination." Creative solutions for delivering preventive care include involving use of patient databases and mechanisms for patient outreach, as well as incorporating preventive care into patient sick visits.
