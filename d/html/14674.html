A major depressive episode is a period lasting at least two weeks, with five or more of the following symptoms: depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in most or all activities, insomnia or hypersomnia, change in appetite or weight, psychomotor retardation or agitation, low energy, poor concentration, thoughts of worthlessness or guilt, and recurrent thoughts about death or suicide. Additional information about the clinical presentation and diagnosis of major depressive disorder is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1721.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2080251"><span class="h2">Continuation and maintenance treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Continuation treatment and maintenance treatment are distinguished from each other, as are remission and recovery, and relapse and recurrence  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120440" href="/z/d/graphic/120440.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Continuation treatment is administered after resolution of a major depressive episode to preserve and enhance remission, and prevent relapse of the presenting episode. Remission represents a period of time with minimal or no symptoms; the duration of this time period varies among different studies (eg, two to eight consecutive months) [<a href="#rid4">4-8</a>]. Continuation treatment is followed by maintenance treatment, which is provided after recovery from the presenting episode to prevent recurrence of new, subsequent episodes. Recovery is said to occur when patients remain well for a period of time exceeding the interval used to define remission.</p><p>However, there is no established cutoff that separates the end of remission from the beginning of recovery; thus, the distinction between continuation and maintenance treatment is not standardized [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Many studies therefore use the terms "continuation treatment" and "maintenance treatment" interchangeably to describe treatment that is provided after patients respond to acute therapy. Likewise, "relapse" and "recurrence" are often used interchangeably because distinguishing relapse of the presenting episode from recurrence of a new episode is arbitrary and depends upon duration requirements for defining remission and recovery. Continuation treatment has been studied more frequently than maintenance treatment [<a href="#rid10">10</a>], and systematic reviews of "maintenance treatment" typically include both continuation and maintenance trials [<a href="#rid11">11-13</a>].</p><p>Additional information about recovery from and recurrence of major depressive episodes is discussed separately.

By two years, the estimated rate was 54 percent.</p><p></p><p>Patients acutely ill with unipolar major depression who improve with pharmacotherapy and subsequently discontinue it are generally at greater risk for relapse/recurrence than patients who improve with and discontinue CBT:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A meta-analysis of eight randomized trials (393 patients followed for up to one year) found that the probability of remaining well was greater in patients treated acutely with CBT than pharmacotherapy (odds ratio 2.6, 95% CI 1.6-4.3) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a meta-analysis of seven randomized and observational studies (335 patients with major depression) with a mean follow-up of 68 weeks, relapse/recurrence occurred in more patients who received acute pharmacotherapy than acute CBT (61 versus 39 percent) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p>One hypothesis for the decreased risk of relapse/recurrence in patients treated with acute phase, depression-specific psychotherapy is that patients learn skills to resolve maladaptive thought patterns, respond more adaptively to stressful life events, and reduce their problematic behaviors [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. After psychotherapy ceases, these changes may persist and forestall reemerging symptoms. By contrast, the neurochemical changes that occur with medications may dissipate if pharmacotherapy is stopped.</p><p>However, some data suggest that recurrence may be comparable in patients who respond to acute treatment with either pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy, and then discontinue it. One study enrolled patients who recovered from major depression with acute pharmacotherapy alone or pharmacotherapy plus CBT, and randomly assigned them to maintain pharmacotherapy or discontinue it; CBT was not administered beyond the acute phase [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Among patients who recovered with medication alone and stopped it (n = 69), and patients who recovered with medication plus CBT and stopped both treatments, the rate of recurrence over three years of follow-up was similar (75 and 77 percent).</p><p>Relapse and recurrence are also common in patients with unipolar major depression who are successfully treated with acute electroconvulsive therapy, but do not subsequently receive continuation/maintenance treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1711.html" rel="external">"Unipolar major depression in adults: Indications for and efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)", section on 'Durability of response'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14391901"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Continuation treatment  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120440" href="/z/d/graphic/120440.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) (lasting, for example, four months to less than a year) is generally indicated for patients who respond to acute treatment of unipolar major depression [<a href="#rid1">1,2,18,20,21</a>]. Additional maintenance treatment (lasting, for example, one to three years) is often indicated for patients with an increased risk of recurrence due to factors such as [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Childhood maltreatment (physical or sexual abuse, neglect, or family violence or conflict)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Early age of onset of unipolar major depression (eg, ≤18 to 21 years of age)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A lifetime history of at least two or three major depressive episodes</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Persistent or emergent residual depressive symptoms, especially sleep disturbances and/or suicidal ideation</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Comorbid anxiety disorders</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prominent depressive cognitions, such as hopelessness or rumination</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Psychosocial stressors or impairment (eg, marital conflict or inability to work)</p><p></p><p>For patients with unipolar major depression who respond to acute therapy, continuation/maintenance treatment is consistent with multiple practice guidelines [<a href="#rid24">24</a>], including those from the American Psychiatric Association [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>], United Kingdom National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>], British Association for Psychopharmacology [<a href="#rid27">27</a>], and World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p>However, patients with unipolar major depression who respond to acute treatment with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and are not at increased risk of relapse/recurrence may reasonably decline continuation treatment, if acute phase remission is stable [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Multiple randomized trials indicate that acute phase CBT can provide enduring effects beyond the end of therapy [<a href="#rid11">11,16,30</a>]. The efficacy of continuation and maintenance CBT is described elsewhere in this topic. (See <a class="local">'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with unipolar major depression who respond to acute treatment with behavioral activation may also reasonably decline continuation treatment, provided that they are not at increased risk of relapse/recurrence. Behavioral activation focuses on increasing rewarding activities, promoting behaviors that decrease rumination, and improving problem solving skills [<a href="#rid31">31,32</a>]. A one-year randomized trial found that relapse of major depression was comparable for patients who remitted with acute phase behavioral activation and received no further treatment (n = 27), and for patients who remitted with and continued <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9743" href="/z/d/drug information/9743.html" rel="external">paroxetine</a> (maximum dose 50 mg per day; n = 28) [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p>Patients who recover from their first lifetime episode of unipolar major depression with acute and continuation pharmacotherapy may reasonably decline maintenance treatment, provided that the presenting episode was neither chronic nor severe, that remission was stable rather than marked by subsyndromal symptoms, that symptoms did not emerge during discontinuation of treatment, and that patients are not at increased risk of relapse/recurrence [<a href="#rid1">1,2,28</a>]. Support for this approach includes findings from a nationally representative survey in the United States that identified individuals with no lifetime history of major depression (n = 27,609) and individuals with a lifetime history of one uncomplicated major depressive episode (which did not include suicidal ideation, psychotic features, psychomotor retardation, or severe impairment, and remitted within six months; n = 418) [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. During follow-up that lasted three years, the incidence of depressive episodes and suicide attempts was comparable for both groups.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H86758411"><span class="h1">CHOOSING TREATMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute unipolar major depression that resolves is generally managed with continuation treatment and maintenance treatment, which are distinguished from each other  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120440" href="/z/d/graphic/120440.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>] (see <a class="local">'Continuation and maintenance treatment'</a> above). The subsections below discuss choosing continuation and maintenance treatment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3506993308"><span class="h2">Standard approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with unipolar major depression who respond to acute phase therapy, standard continuation and maintenance treatments  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120440" href="/z/d/graphic/120440.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy. The same treatment that was successfully used acutely is typically selected for continuation/maintenance treatment [<a href="#rid1">1,2,35</a>]. Pharmacotherapy alone has been most widely studied and used for acute treatment and thus continuation and maintenance treatment as well because of convenience and availability [<a href="#rid1">1,2,36</a>]. Other factors to consider in choosing maintenance treatment include the patient's past response as well as that of family members, patient preference, and cost. The efficacy of standard continuation/maintenance treatments is discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a class="local">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>Continuation/maintenance pharmacotherapy for unipolar major depression generally includes antidepressant medications, which should be used at the same dose that achieves remission [<a href="#rid1">1,2,35</a>] (see <a class="local">'Dose'</a> below). Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclics have been most widely studied, other reasonable options include serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, serotonin modulators (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16102" href="/z/d/drug information/16102.html" rel="external">vilazodone</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="91014" href="/z/d/drug information/91014.html" rel="external">vortioxetine</a>), atypical antidepressants (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9171" href="/z/d/drug information/9171.html" rel="external">bupropion</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9656" href="/z/d/drug information/9656.html" rel="external">mirtazapine</a>), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors [<a href="#rid12">12,13,37</a>]. Head-to-head randomized trials do not indicate that any one medication or medication class is superior [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Patients may want to discontinue the acute phase antidepressant and switch to a different drug or to psychotherapy for continuation/maintenance treatment; indications for switching include adverse effects, specific residual depressive symptoms (eg, insomnia may respond to sedating medications), comorbid general medical conditions, and drug-drug interactions. Switching antidepressants and switching to psychotherapy are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1716.html" rel="external">"Switching antidepressant medications in adults", section on 'Switching antidepressant medications'</a> and <a class="local">'Sequential treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>During acute treatment of unipolar major depression, antidepressants may be augmented with other medications such as second-generation antipsychotics, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9566" href="/z/d/drug information/9566.html" rel="external">lithium</a>, triiodothyronine, or a second antidepressant [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. However, there are no high-quality continuation/maintenance studies of medication combinations. Augmentation of antidepressants for acute treatment is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14688.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Treatment with second-generation antipsychotics"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13506.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Treatment with lithium"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15722.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Augmentation of antidepressants with thyroid hormone"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14671.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Treatment with antidepressant combinations"</a>.)</p><p>For continuation phase treatment of major depression, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy alone can be efficacious [<a href="#rid1">1,2,26</a>] (see <a class="local">'Psychotherapy'</a> below). However, the efficacy of maintenance phase pharmacotherapy may possibly exceed the efficacy of maintenance interpersonal psychotherapy [<a href="#rid38">38-40</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Interpersonal psychotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The most widely studied psychotherapy for continuation and maintenance treatment of unipolar major depression is CBT [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Other reasonable choices include interpersonal psychotherapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. No head-to-head randomized trials have compared different continuation/maintenance phase psychotherapies; thus, the choice frequently depends upon availability and patient preference. (See <a class="local">'Psychotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Randomized trials indicate that continuation and maintenance treatment with pharmacotherapy plus interpersonal psychotherapy is superior to either pharmacotherapy alone or interpersonal psychotherapy alone. (See <a class="local">'Antidepressant medications plus interpersonal psychotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H86758477"><span class="h2">Sequential treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with unipolar major depression who successfully complete acute phase pharmacotherapy may switch to or add psychotherapy (eg, CBT or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy) for continuation/maintenance treatment; this strategy is called sequential treatment [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].

In the sequential treatment group, patients received CBT or therapies based upon CBT (eg, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy), and antidepressants were either continued or were tapered and discontinued.

Remission represents a period of time (eg, two to eight months) with minimal or no depressive symptoms. Continuation treatment is followed by maintenance treatment, which is used after recovery from the presenting episode to prevent recurrence of new depressive episodes. Recovery occurs when patients remain well for a period of time exceeding the interval used to define remission.
