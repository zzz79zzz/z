These reactions are categorized by the presumed underlying mechanism and whether the reaction is elicited by multiple NSAIDs or by a single agent. Challenge procedures are used in the diagnosis of some NSAID reactions, and desensitization protocols are used in management of patients who require NSAID therapy despite a history of adverse reactions.</p><p>The various challenge and desensitization protocols used by allergy specialists will be reviewed here.

This is done by reviewing the clinical history in detail. The most important elements of the history are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The signs and symptoms of the reaction</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Whether the reaction has been elicited by a single NSAID or multiple NSAIDs</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The presence of several underlying medical disorders (specifically asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps, and chronic urticaria)</p><p></p><p>The different types of pseudoallergic and allergic reactions to NSAIDs are summarized briefly here and reviewed in more detail separately.

These typically occur in patients who have either asthma and chronic sinus disease (often with nasal polyposis) or chronic urticaria  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90304" href="/z/d/graphic/90304.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Type 1</strong> – Respiratory reactions to multiple NSAIDs in patients with asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (also called aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [AERD]).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Type 2</strong> – Urticaria/angioedema to multiple NSAIDs in patients with underlying chronic urticaria.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Type 3</strong> – Urticaria/angioedema to multiple NSAIDs in otherwise asymptomatic individuals.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Type 4</strong> – Blended (involving both the respiratory tract and skin) reactions to multiple NSAIDs in otherwise asymptomatic individuals. Some patients with type 4 reactions have underlying AERD and experience both respiratory and cutaneous symptoms (urticaria-like pruritic rash, angioedema) during NSAID reactions. Others do not have AERD but develop cutaneous symptoms that are not classic urticaria/angioedema and can be quite variable.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Allergic</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Allergic reactions are presumed to be immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated and are elicited by a single NSAID or, rarely, by more than one agent with similar chemical structures. Interestingly, allergic reactions have not been reported to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> itself but have been described to several other NSAIDS [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Type 5</strong> – Allergic reactions (usually urticaria, pruritus, or angioedema) to a single NSAID.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Type 6</strong> – Anaphylaxis (ie, a more severe allergic reaction involving multiple organ systems) to a single NSAID.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9673464"><span class="h1">REFERRAL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Referral to an allergy specialist with experience in drug allergy should be considered for patients who had severe reactions in the past and for those who would benefit from being able to take other NSAIDs if it were safe to do so. NSAID reactions are challenging to diagnose and manage for several reasons:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Some NSAID reactions can be severe or life threatening.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>NSAID reactions can be challenging to classify based on history alone because the signs and symptoms of the various types of reactions may be overlapping.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients have sometimes avoided all NSAIDs since the initial reaction, so it is not possible to determine if the symptoms are elicited by one or multiple agents.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Most patients develop NSAID sensitivity at some point after initially tolerating these drugs, so the history of having tolerated a different NSAID prior to the first reaction does not mean that the patient would tolerate that agent again in the future.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">GENERAL ISSUES IN NSAID CHALLENGE AND DESENSITIZATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Indications for challenge</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are no in vitro assays or skin tests available to diagnose NSAID reactions. Therefore, a provocative challenge is the only means of obtaining a definitive diagnosis of current sensitivity if there is a legitimate medical need for future NSAID therapy. Challenge protocols involve cautiously administering gradually increasing doses of an NSAID, usually <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>, in an appropriately monitored medical setting. These procedures are also used to desensitize patients to NSAIDs in some situations.</p><p>Drug challenges are not without risk. Therefore, the benefits of the information gathered from the challenge must be weighed against the risks for each patient individually. The following are general guidelines:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Performing an NSAID challenge simply to determine if a person with a suggestive history is sensitive to an NSAID is not recommended.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In contrast, if a patient has a medical indication for NSAID therapy (eg, cardiovascular risk factors, confirmed coronary heart disease, or a chronic inflammatory condition, such as arthritis), it is usually appropriate to determine the specific type of reaction present. The information can then be used to determine what other NSAIDs the patient may safely take.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1956025721"><span class="h2">Indication for desensitization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with NSAID reactions can sometimes be desensitized to an NSAID, which is accomplished by continuing the challenge procedure. Following desensitization, the patient must continue to take the NSAID in question daily to maintain the desensitized state. Two common indications for desensitization are the need for daily <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> in patients with cardiovascular disease and the need for daily NSAIDs in patients with rheumatologic disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Contraindications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Any concurrent cardiopulmonary conditions should be under optimal control before a patient is challenged or desensitized. In patients with asthma, it is our practice to proceed with these procedures only if the prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) is ≥70 percent of the patient's best and ≥1.5 liters. However, if <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> desensitization is needed urgently (eg, after a cardiovascular event or procedure), systemic glucocorticoids can be given to rapidly control asthma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/114687.html" rel="external">"Introduction of aspirin to patients with aspirin hypersensitivity requiring cardiovascular interventions"</a>.)</p><p>Patients with past NSAID reactions that involved possible anaphylaxis should not be on any medications that may increase the likelihood of anaphylaxis or interfere with treatment of anaphylaxis, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta blockers, although there may be individual exceptions to this.</p><p>NSAIDs can cause other types of reactions that are not considered here. These include severe cutaneous reactions, such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Patients who have experienced such reactions should not receive the culprit drug again, and any form of reexposure, including challenge and desensitization, is contraindicated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2091.html" rel="external">"Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1361264"><span class="h2">Safety issues</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>NSAID challenges should only be performed by clinicians with the expertise to manage any resultant symptoms and in settings equipped with the necessary medications, equipment, and support staff. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/392.html" rel="external">"Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/520.html" rel="external">"Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease", section on 'Signs and symptoms'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In some patients, intravenous access should be obtained prior to challenge in case emergency medications or fluids are required. This is indicated in patients believed to be at risk for moderate-to-severe symptoms during the challenge procedure, in those with past anaphylaxis, and in those with significant underlying cardiopulmonary disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Informed consent should be obtained from all adult patients or from the guardians of children under 18 years of age.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9673536"><span class="h2">Setting</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The appropriate setting is determined by the historical features of past reactions and the clinician's knowledge about what types of reactions are in the differential diagnosis. In most cases, these protocols may be safely performed in specially equipped outpatient allergy clinics, while, in other cases, admission to the hospital or intensive care unit (ICU) is indicated. Oral challenges in patients with previous anaphylaxis should be performed in an ICU or in an area where ICU transfer is readily available, although severe reactions are generally avoidable. The decision about where to perform challenges requires clinical judgment, and each case must be considered individually.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1362865"><span class="h1">PROTOCOLS FOR ORAL CHALLENGES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are several basic oral challenge procedures, which differ in the starting dose and the time interval between doses  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58610" href="/z/d/graphic/58610.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. The choice of protocol depends on the patient's past reaction. The clinician must categorize the patient's past reaction based on reported symptoms and underlying disorders in order to choose the most appropriate protocol. (See <a class="local">'Reaction types'</a> above.)</p><p>The protocols described in this section were intended to be performed as elective procedures. A somewhat different approach is used for urgent desensitization after cardiac procedures. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/114687.html" rel="external">"Introduction of aspirin to patients with aspirin hypersensitivity requiring cardiovascular interventions"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1362897"><span class="h2">Choice of NSAID</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>At the author's institution and many others, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> is the drug most often utilized in oral challenges. There is more experience with aspirin than any other NSAID, and aspirin has the additional advantage of not having been implicated in any confirmed cases of anaphylaxis. The few instances in which we perform challenges with NSAIDs other than aspirin are pointed out in the discussions below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1362904"><span class="h2">Use of placebo doses</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We do not usually include placebos when a challenge is performed solely for the purposes of patient management. However, there are some situations in which the use of placebo doses is clinically useful. As an example, placebo doses are helpful in the evaluation of the patient who is suspected of not having sensitivity to NSAIDs at all, in whom challenge is indicated to prove that the patient tolerates NSAIDs. We sometimes give such patients an initial dose of placebo and also end the challenge with one or more placebo doses (so that the patient receives placebo when expecting the largest dose of the day) with one or more placebo doses in between. Informed consent should be obtained for inclusion of placebos.</p><p>In contrast, placebo doses are essential in research studies in which challenge is performed for the purposes of confirming the diagnosis. Many protocols include an initial day in which only placebos are administered to control for nonspecific changes in pulmonary function that some patients demonstrate in a challenge environment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1361315"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO SPECIFIC TYPES OF REACTIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1363033"><span class="h2">Respiratory reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who experienced rhinorrhea or bronchospasm (often with nasal and ocular symptoms) following exposure to an NSAID most often have type 1 pseudoallergy. If the patient develops cutaneous symptoms (urticaria and/or angioedema or other cutaneous findings) during NSAID reactions, they may have type 4 pseudoallergy. Patients with types 1 and 4 pseudoallergy have underlying asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, although the polyposis may not have been detected unless the patient has undergone evaluation for their sinus disease. The combination of asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, and respiratory reactions to NSAIDs is called aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). It is important to recognize patients with AERD because they have potentially severe reactions to NSAIDs, and, if <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> challenge is attempted, it must be done with appropriate safeguards in place (discussed below). AERD is reviewed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/520.html" rel="external">"Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease"</a>.)</p><p>Occasionally, a non-AERD patient with past bronchospasm following NSAID exposure has IgE-mediated anaphylaxis to that NSAID (type 6, allergic reaction). This should be suspected if the patient had a severe reaction to a single agent in the past and does not have a history of asthma or sinus disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9674005"><span class="h3">Type 1 (respiratory reactions to multiple NSAIDs)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common reason for performing <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> challenge in a patient with AERD is to determine if the patient is sensitive to aspirin and therefore might benefit from daily aspirin therapy. In most cases, patients are premedicated with antileukotriene agents prior to undergoing aspirin challenges to reduce or eliminate the potentially severe pulmonary symptoms that can occur during challenge. A more detailed discussion of challenge and desensitization in patients with AERD is found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15539.html" rel="external">"Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease: NSAID challenge and desensitization"</a>.)</p><p>Patients with type 1 pseudoallergy can undergo the oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> challenge described in row 1 of the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58610" href="/z/d/graphic/58610.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), following premedication with a leukotriene-modifying drug (LTMD). The starting dose is 40.5 mg, and this is doubled at intervals of three hours until the patient reacts or the desired therapeutic dose is reached.</p><p>If the patient does not react, then they either do not have NSAID allergy or pseudoallergy or their reaction requires higher doses to elicit. Most patients with type 1 pseudoallergy react to between 60 and 100 mg of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>, so, if the final dose was only 81 mg, it is possible that it was below the dose needed to provoke a reaction. However, if the patient only requires low doses for therapy, then they can safely continue on 81 mg daily, although they should not take higher doses or other NSAIDs other than aspirin.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9674280"><span class="h4">Desensitization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>NSAID desensitization is a process of inducing tolerance to NSAIDs in a patient with pseudoallergic reactions. Desensitization is essentially a continuation of the challenge procedure until the patient reaches the desired dose without reacting further to the drug  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58610" href="/z/d/graphic/58610.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). <strong>Desensitization to </strong><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a><strong> is nearly always successful in patients with type 1 pseudoallergy.</strong> Following desensitization, aspirin or another NSAID must be taken daily since tolerance is lost if exposure is interrupted. This is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15539.html" rel="external">"Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease: NSAID challenge and desensitization"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4537770"><span class="h3">Type 4 (respiratory and cutaneous symptoms to multiple NSAIDs)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with type 4 pseudoallergy can undergo the oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> challenge described in row 1 of the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58610" href="/z/d/graphic/58610.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) following premedication with an LTMD.

If a reaction occurs, we administer additional antihistamines, wait for the symptoms to subside, repeat the provoking dose, and continue the desensitization process. This process can take hours to days. The interval between doses can be extended by several hours (not to exceed 48 hours), if needed, to allow symptoms to resolve before continuing. Systemic glucocorticoids may be necessary for resistant cases. When the desired dose is reached without symptoms, the patient is desensitized. Once desensitized, the antihistamine and LTMD can be discontinued (tapering the dose or discontinuing gradually is not necessary). Although studies of desensitization for type 4 pseudoallergic reactions are lacking, it is the author's experience that nearly all patients can be desensitized if the clinician is persistent and makes judicious use of antihistamines and LTMDs as described [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9674018"><span class="h3">Type 6 (anaphylaxis to a single NSAID)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If a patient had a past severe reaction to an NSAID that included respiratory symptoms and stopped taking NSAIDs at that point in time, it can be difficult to determine from the history if the patient had anaphylaxis to that single agent or if they have a form of pseudoallergy.</p><p>For patients who have a history suggestive of single NSAID reactivity with anaphylaxis (type 6), performing an oral challenge to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> is a safe first step in the evaluation (row 4 of the table)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58610" href="/z/d/graphic/58610.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) since anaphylaxis to aspirin has not been described.
