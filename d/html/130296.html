It rapidly spread, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a public health emergency in late January 2020 and to characterize it as a pandemic in March 2020. The virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). </p><p>Infection prevention interventions to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 include universal source control (eg, covering the nose and mouth to contain respiratory secretions), early identification and isolation of patients with suspected disease, vaccination, quarantine after exposure, the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), and environmental disinfection. </p><p>This topic will review general infection prevention principles when caring for patients in areas with community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Detailed information on prevention in the community and infection prevention policies and procedures when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in the health care and home settings is presented elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127501.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1154020630"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF TRANSMISSION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Experts agree that transmission occurs through droplets (when virus released in the respiratory secretions of a person with infection makes direct contact with mucous membranes) and through inhalation of aerosolized secretions, which can travel further, remain suspended in air longer, and contain infectious particles that are smaller than typically described for respiratory droplets [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>]. However, the relative contribution of each mode of transmission is uncertain [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Indirect (secondary) transmission, which occurs when a susceptible person touches a contaminated surface and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth, is also possible but is not thought to be a major route of transmission. More detailed information on the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), including the risk of asymptomatic transmission, is discussed in a separate topic review. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/126981.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Epidemiology, virology, and prevention", section on 'Transmission'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3396689786"><span class="h1">SCREENING PRIOR TO AND UPON ENTRY INTO THE HEALTH CARE FACILITY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2697184166"><span class="h2">Patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are many opportunities to screen patients before and after entry into the health care facility to reduce unnecessary exposures to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the healthcare settings. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prior to entry</strong> – Patients calling their provider with respiratory symptoms can be screened for clinical manifestations consistent with COVID-19 prior to entry into the healthcare facility. Such symptoms include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, myalgias, headache, sore throat, dyspnea, anosmia/hyposmia, congestion or rhinorrhea, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128323.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Clinical features"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Many of these patients with signs and symptoms of COVID-19 can be managed from home through telemedicine and will not need to enter a health care facility. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127759.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Evaluation of adults with acute illness in the outpatient setting"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127501.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection", section on 'Infection prevention in the home setting'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If the patient should be seen and the clinical setting cannot accommodate a patient with suspected COVID-19 or the patient requires a higher level of care (for COVID-19- or non-COVID-19-related symptoms), referral to an urgent care or emergency room may be needed. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Upon entry to the health care facility</strong> – Patients should be screened for symptoms of COVID-19 upon entry into a health care setting, even if they were screened prior to arrival. In many healthcare settings this is now done through signs and posters informing patients about the symptoms of COVID-19. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Efforts should be made to place patients with suspected COVID-19 into private rooms as soon as possible. If an examination room is not immediately available, such patients should not wait among other patients. In this setting, it may be reasonable to have patients wait in a well-ventilated space where patients can be separated by at least six feet, in addition to being masked. Persons accompanying such patients should either be placed in the same private room, outside, or in a waiting room, masked. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients without symptoms should be asked to inform HCP of any unprotected exposures to a person with COVID-19 within the last 10 days. Patients who have had <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fndc.services.cdc.gov%2Fcase-definitions%2Fcoronavirus-disease-2019-2021%2F&amp;token=d8oA%2F7NZfraiyYDWg3l0X2mjpXfnXiSaHPIr06VxIzF1KFHxfMik1%2Fl3kKXRr6s17AzHnnvCqkt00u9Y4AM3Dw53JdLUrYbZhkqCbXBWq%2FY%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=130296" target="_blank">close contact</a> with someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 may need to quarantine, be tested, or both. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127501.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection", section on 'Patients who have had an exposure to COVID-19'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Admission/preprocedural testing</strong> – During the COVID-19 pandemic, many institutions have implemented universal nucleic acid testing upon admission to the hospital and prior to elective aerosol-generating procedures and major surgeries. This allows patients with asymptomatic or presymptomatic infection to be identified, even if there are no risk factors for COVID-19. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The decision to implement these types of screening programs depends in part upon local infection rates, and must balance the risks and benefits of testing [<a href="#rid1">1,3,6,7</a>]. As an example, preprocedural testing may delay appropriate care, and with the appropriate use of recommended PPE (eg, respirators and eye protection for all aerosol generating procedures), HCP would not be at risk. By contrast, identifying asymptomatic cases via admission testing may be able to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission to other patients, particularly roommates in semi-private rooms [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Admission or preprocedural testing is generally not warranted for asymptomatic patients with prior COVID-19 if the patient's onset of illness was within the prior 30 days and they met criteria for discontinuation of precautions  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef127962" href="/d/graphic/127962.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef139926" href="/d/graphic/139926.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Reinfection is less likely during this period, and some patients may have prolonged viral RNA shedding, which is not clearly associated with prolonged infectiousness [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. However, if antigen testing is available, it is reasonable to test those with infection in the prior 30 to 90 days. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/126981.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Epidemiology, virology, and prevention", section on 'Viral shedding and period of infectiousness'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">More detailed information on COVID-19 testing as well as the use of testing as part of the preoperative evaluation is presented elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128404.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127481.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Perioperative risk assessment, preoperative screening and testing, and timing of surgery after infection", section on 'Preoperative evaluation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H760423789"><span class="h2">Visitors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>During the COVID-19 pandemic, most hospitals restricted visitors in the health care setting. Over time, there have been fewer restrictions; however, visitors with symptoms or other evidence of infection should not be allowed to enter the health care setting. </p><p></p><p>In addition, visitors with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection within the last ten days should not be allowed (even with a mask) due to the medical fragility of hospitalized patients. In some persons, this duration may need to be extended. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127501.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'</a>.)</p><p>Visitors with a known exposure in the last 10 days and no symptoms may be allowed to visit but must always wear a well-fitting mask until they have met criteria to discontinue masking. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/126981.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Epidemiology, virology, and prevention", section on 'Testing and masking precautions'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2151942198"><span class="h2">Health care personnel</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The approach to screening health care personnel (HCP) entering the health care setting depends upon the institution's policies. At a minimum, HCP should monitor themselves for symptoms of COVID-19 and stay home if they are ill  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef127890" href="/d/graphic/127890.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). They should then contact occupational health for additional guidance. In one report of 48 HCP with confirmed COVID-19, 65 percent reported working for a median of two days while exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. </p><p>HCP should also be aware of their institution’s policy regarding the need to report unprotected exposures to COVID-19 (both in the community and at work).<strong> </strong>Information on managing HCP with an exposure to SARS-CoV-2 can be found on the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fhcp%2Fguidance-risk-assesment-hcp.html&amp;token=13wRjrZJdeigRslPQOyYPzPouRvPCAz3Kxz3K4PTjioYWPClCI2339pzyLEZEFLOTfz%2F2%2BMChWUpnEL72ZrxkVZZVr42AoUHO4m%2BJHe4l%2F0%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=130296" target="_blank">CDC website</a>.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H561678431"><span class="h1">UNIVERSAL USE OF MASKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Similar to other prevention strategies, the need for universal masking is dictated by the specific institution, and depends in part on the degree of <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcovid.cdc.gov%2Fcovid-data-tracker%2F%23datatracker-home&amp;token=GDOHlJesKJxD%2BqMepjAIW9a31twICI2FmC%2FbTQUSZdV1k9DU5YjYjAI5UIHDNqhWzesYcHRq91J8%2FN3XJYVGog%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=130296" target="_blank">community transmission</a>. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that universal masking is only required when community transmission levels are high [<a href="#rid3">3,12</a>]. The use of masks as source control in community settings is presented elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/126981.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Epidemiology, virology, and prevention", section on 'Personal preventive measures'</a>.)</p><p>We support the use of universal masking in the health care setting to reduce transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from unsuspected virus carriers [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. Symptom screening alone is insufficient to identify individuals with COVID-19 since presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission can occur [<a href="#rid15">15-17</a>]. In addition, people may not always endorse symptoms, even if they are present. In the healthcare setting, outbreaks of COVID-19 can impact staffing and may lead to serious health outcomes in medically vulnerable populations.</p><p>When universal masking is implemented, we use the following approach:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient and visitors</strong> – All patients and visitors should bring or be given well-fitting masks to wear upon entry into the health care setting for universal source control [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Masks made from mesh or with exhalation valves or vents should be avoided since they do not provide source control. Patients or visitors wearing one of these masks should be provided with an appropriate alternative. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Visitors should be asked to wear a well-fitting mask at all times in the hospital setting.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For patients, once they are in an appropriate room (eg, single room with the door closed for patients with suspected COVID-19), they can usually remove their mask. However, patients should be instructed to replace their masks when HCP enter their room. If the patient cannot wear a mask, the HCP should wear a face shield or goggles and a respirator. The use of a respirator and face shield or goggles provides additional protection in the event that a patient cannot or will not wear a mask; this is particularly important in areas with moderate to substantial rates of community SARS-CoV-2 transmission. (See <a class="local">'Precautions for those NOT suspected of having COVID-19'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Health care personnel</strong> – HCP should wear a well-fitting medical mask in the health care setting. Hand hygiene should be performed immediately before and after contact with face masks. These masks provide both source control and respiratory protection. Masks should be worn even when the HCP is not caring for patients. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When caring for patients, the type of mask (eg, respirator or medical mask) may depend upon the clinical setting (eg, aerosol-generating procedures, routine care, suspicion for COVID-19) and the degree of community transmission, as discussed below and in a separate topic review. (See <a class="local">'High-risk procedures (eg, aerosol-generating procedures)'</a> below and <a class="local">'Routine care in the ambulatory or hospital setting'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127501.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection", section on 'Type of PPE'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Respirators with exhalation valves or vents should not be used in the health care setting since they do not provide source control. However, if needed in the setting of PPE shortages, a medical mask must be placed on top of the respirator. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Masks should be changed if they become soiled, damp, or difficult to breathe through. If they are used during the care of a patient for whom a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved respirator or facemask is indicated for PPE (eg, during a surgical procedure, or during care of a patient on droplet precautions), they should be removed after the patient care encounter and a new one should be donned prior to the next encounter [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Depending upon hospital policy, respirators should be discarded or removed and stored for later use. Considerations for extended use/reuse of PPE when caring for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 who are on the same unit are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127501.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection", section on 'Extended or limited reuse of PPE'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The benefit of universal masking of HCP has been demonstrated in several studies. In one report, 238 patients were exposed to a HCP with COVID-19, and the only clear case of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurred when neither the provider nor the patient was wearing a mask [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. In another study of 703 unvaccinated HCP, 50 were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing; risk factors for infection included being in the break room without a medical mask for more than 15 minutes, consuming food within one meter of an HCP, and failing to keep a safe social distance from other HCP [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In addition, studies have demonstrated a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infections in HCP [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]. In one report that evaluated nearly 10,000 HCP in Massachusetts who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 (mainly because of symptoms), the proportion with positive test results steadily declined after the introduction of universal masking (from 14.7 to 11.5 percent over 29 days) despite an increase in the number of cases in the community [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Similarly, in a study from North Carolina, the cumulative incidence rate of health care-acquired COVID-19 stabilized after the introduction of universal masking despite an increased incidence of COVID-19 in the community [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1867557552"><span class="h1">PRECAUTIONS FOR THOSE NOT SUSPECTED OF HAVING COVID-19</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When there is ongoing community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), enhanced infection prevention precautions should be used when caring for patients who are <strong>not</strong> suspected of having COVID-19, even those who are vaccinated and/or had a negative test for SARS-CoV-2 upon entry into the health care setting [<a href="#rid1">1,3,22</a>]. The types of precautions depend on the degree of community transmission and whether the health care worker is providing routine care or is involved with high-risk procedures (eg, aerosol-generating procedures or treatments). (See <a class="local">'Routine care in the ambulatory or hospital setting'</a> below and <a class="local">'High-risk procedures (eg, aerosol-generating procedures)'</a> below.)</p><p>This use of enhanced precautions is based on concerns that some patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or presymptomatic, and a single polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test does not reliably rule out SARS-CoV-2 in all patients. In one outbreak that included 14 patients and 38 employees, the index case was a patient with chronic lung disease who was originally admitted for a procedure but was found to be dyspneic and tachycardic [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. The patient tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 two times, 12 hours apart, on admission but subsequently developed a fever on day 4 and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Factors felt to contribute to transmission included the imperfect sensitivity of testing, the increased risk of transmission in symptomatic patients early in the course of disease, the potential role of nebulizers in enhancing transmission, the inconsistent use of eye protection in health care personnel (HCP), inconsistent mask wearing in patients, shared patient rooms, and that the index patient turned out to be in a positive-pressure room. In another case, an outbreak of COVID-19 that involved nine HCP occurred when an unmasked child had close contact with HCP who were not wearing face shields [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p>Emerging data suggest that using precautions such as face masks and eye protection for all patients may help reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Transmission-based precautions are warranted for persons who are unable to reliably wear a mask, are moderately to severely immunocompromised, or reside on a unit with others who are moderately to severely immunocompromised.

The types of precautions depend on the degree of community transmission and whether the health care personnel are providing routine care or are involved with high-risk procedures (eg, aerosol-generating procedures or treatments).(See <a class="local">'Precautions for those NOT suspected of having COVID-19'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Environmental cleaning</strong> – To help reduce the spread of COVID-19, environmental infection prevention procedures should be implemented.
