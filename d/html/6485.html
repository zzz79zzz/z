         Spiders of the genus
         <em>
          Loxosceles
         </em>
         are known colloquially as recluse spiders, violin spiders, fiddleback spiders, and in South America, by the nonspecific name "brown spiders." These terms are used when describing multiple
         <em>
          Loxosceles
         </em>
         species as a group. When the common name "brown recluse spider" is used here, it refers only to the one species,
         <em>
          L. reclusa
         </em>
         , which is widespread and commonly found in homes in the indigenous Central Midwestern United States.

        <p>
         <em>
          Loxosceles
         </em>
         spiders have gained notoriety in the medical literature and lay press because their bites sometimes become necrotic [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. However, this is a relatively uncommon sequela, and is largely limited to areas of the United States where these spiders are endemic  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56537" href="/z/d/graphic/56537.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Outside of these regions, the vast majority of necrotic skin lesions are caused by other disorders [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-6
         </a>
         ]. (See

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Recluse spiders are rather nondescript brown spiders  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70229" href="/z/d/graphic/70229.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         and
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79463" href="/z/d/graphic/79463.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>
         ). The most accurate method of identifying a recluse spider involves counting the eyes. Most spiders have eight eyes in two rows of four. In contrast, recluse spiders have six eyes, with a pair in front, a pair on both sides, and a gap between the pairs  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60968" href="/z/d/graphic/60968.html" rel="external">
          picture 3
         </a>
         ). With the naked eye or low magnification, the eye pairs (dyads) may appear as individual eyespots.
        </p>
        <p>
         Identifying a recluse spider on the basis of body markings is less reliable. The brown recluse is described as having a violin pattern on its anterior cephalothorax, although this has led to widespread misidentification of common, harmless spiders as brown recluse when the dark markings on spiders' bodies are mistakenly interpreted as violins [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Additionally, the violin marking is absent in many juvenile and recently-molted brown recluses as well as in some southwestern United States recluse species. Other features of recluse spiders include monochromatic legs, a monochromatic abdomen, and fine hairs (but not conspicuous spines) on the legs  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79463" href="/z/d/graphic/79463.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The most common spider mistaken for
         <em>
          Loxosceles
         </em>
         in the United States is
         <em>
          Kukulcania
         </em>
         (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64635" href="/z/d/graphic/64635.html" rel="external">
          picture 4
         </a>
         ), which has a darkened pattern on the cephalothorax near the eyes of the tan males that can be mistaken for a violin pattern [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Female
         <em>
          Kukulcania
         </em>
         are black or dark brown, velvety in texture, and resemble small tarantulas, although people still mistake them for brown recluse spiders.
         <em>
          Kukulcania
         </em>
         spiders are found in the southern third of the United States from the San Francisco Bay through southern California, east through Texas to Florida and north to North Carolina and Virginia. They are frequently found in homes, although verified bites from these spiders are virtually unknown.

         In the United States, recluse spiders are found in limited areas of the South, West, and Midwest  (

         <em>
          L. reclusa
         </em>
         , is the most widespread and the best known of North American recluse spiders. It is a

          synanthropic

         spider (ie, its population numbers increase in association with humans) and these spiders are commonly encountered within homes in endemic areas [

         <em>
          Loxosceles laeta

         The Mediterranean recluse,
         <em>
          L. rufescens
         </em>
         , has been transported around the world and continues to establish isolated populations inside buildings on many continents. It has been found in many American cities, where these spiders tend to develop dense populations within isolated buildings. However, despite these infestations, verified bites from Mediterranean recluse are exceedingly rare.

         Recluses are found mostly inside homes (eg, basements, attics, behind bookshelves and dressers, and in cupboards). As their name implies, these spiders prefer dark, quiet areas that are rarely disturbed  (

          table 1

         Loxoscelism is the term for the medical manifestations of bites by recluse spiders. In this review, the term is used to refer to both local and systemic symptoms resulting from bites, although toxicologists sometimes use the term to refer exclusively to the systemic symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         The literature pertaining to loxoscelism is in general inadequate because of the lack of documentation of a proven spider bite, which is the proven presence of the culprit spider in the vicinity [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Reports of larger series of patients carrying the diagnosis of loxoscelism only have proven bites in 7 to 14 percent of cases [

          14,15

         venom contains a large number of enzymes and biologically active substances that can be divided into two major groups: insecticidal toxins (inhibitor cystine knot peptides), metalloproteases (astacins), and phospholipases D; and the toxins expressed in lower quantities such as hyaluronidases, serine proteases, serine protease inhibitors (serpins), allergenic factors, and a translationally controlled tumor protein family of toxins [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Of these, the phospholipases D (formerly designated as sphingomyelinases) cause the majority of the clinical entity loxoscelism, including necrotic loxoscelism, platelet disorders, hemolysis, and acute renal failure. The phospholipases D are unique in nature to
         <em>

         Recluse spiders (like most spiders) typically bite humans only as a desperate last line of defense as they are being crushed between flesh and some object. This happens most frequently indoors, as a result of rolling over on the spider in bed or putting on clothing or footwear that has been left in closets or on the floor, in which the spider has sought refuge.
        </p>
        <p>
         Recluse spider bites typically occur on the upper arm, thorax, or inner thigh. Bites on the hands or face (ie, uncovered areas) are rare.
        </p>
        <p>
         Recluse bites can be sustained out of doors, although these spiders are not known to be found in living vegetation. Patients reporting a painful bite while reaching into living foliage are more likely to have sustained an insect sting or puncture by thorns or other sharp plant matter.

         The initial bite of a
         <em>
          Loxosceles
         </em>
         spider is usually painless, although they can occasionally be painful or cause a burning sensation [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The site can sometimes be identified by two small cutaneous puncture marks with surrounding erythema. The bite is usually a red plaque  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71174" href="/z/d/graphic/71174.html" rel="external">
          picture 5
         </a>
         ) or papule, which often develops central pallor. Occasionally, vesiculation around the site may occur  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96172" href="/z/d/graphic/96172.html" rel="external">
          picture 6
         </a>
         ). The pain typically increases over the next two to eight hours, and may become severe. It may develop a livedoid, vasculitic appearance. In most cases, this lesion is self-limited and resolves without further complications in approximately one week [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. However, in some patients, the lesion will develop a dark, depressed center over the ensuing 24 to 48 hours, culminating in a dry eschar that subsequently ulcerates  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96173" href="/z/d/graphic/96173.html" rel="external">
          picture 7

          'Necrosis'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Some patients develop urticaria or a morbilliform rash in the hours after the bite; this has been suggested by some as evidence of a prior bite, although the phenomenon has not been studied formally.

         Experts in the past have estimated that approximately 10 to 20 percent of recluse spider bites become necrotic [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,20,21
         </a>
         ]. However, many necrotic skin lesions are erroneously attributed to spider bites. Thus, the true frequency of skin necrosis after a bite is unclear [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ].
        </p>

         The progression of necrosis from a recluse spider bite typically occurs over several days. The original papule or plaque develops a dusky red or blue color in the center of the lesion, and a dry, depressed center may herald necrosis. There may be anesthesia in the center. An eschar forms and subsequently breaks down to form an ulcer. The lesion may enlarge in a gravitational manner  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96174" href="/z/d/graphic/96174.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A fully developed necrotic lesion is usually 1 to 2 cm in diameter, although skin loss can be more extensive and ulcers as large as 40 cm or more have rarely been described. These most typically occur over fatty tissue on the buttocks and thighs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lesions usually stop extending within 10 days of the bite, and most lesions heal by secondary intent over several weeks, without scarring  (

         <a href="#rid23">
          23

         A presumptive diagnosis of a spider bite is most often based on the history of feeling a bite and clinical presentation of a wound that may be necrotic. An assay for
         <em>
          Loxosceles
         </em>
         venom has been developed but is not commercially available [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. Of note, the diagnosis of a spider bite can be considered definitive only if the patient has a consistent skin lesion  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71174" href="/z/d/graphic/71174.html" rel="external">

         The spider was recovered, collected, and properly identified by an expert entomologist or an accurate identification of the culprit spider is made by the medical provider.

         If both of the above conditions are

         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Because systemic effects may precede skin findings, a working diagnosis of recluse spider bite may be made for children with acute hemolysis of unknown etiology in regions where the recluse spider is found. However, other etiologies for acute, severe hemolytic anemia must also be excluded. (See

         Cutaneous vasculitis results from inflammation of the small or medium-sized blood vessels in the skin. Small blood vessels are capillaries, postcapillary venules, and nonmuscular arterioles in the superficial and mid-dermis (&lt;50 micrometers). Medium-sized vessels consist of 50 to 150 micrometer vessels with muscular walls in the deep dermis and subcutis. Cutaneous vasculitis occurs in a wide variety of clinical settings  (

          table 6

         For patients with recluse spider bites that have a dusky center or other signs of developing necrosis, no proven therapy, other than antivenom administration, exists. Antivenom is suggested for patients with moderate to severe dermal necrosis who present for care within 48 hours after recluse spider bite occurring in South America. (See

        <p>
         As discussed further below, early surgical excision and/or curettage of a necrotic lesion as the lesion is still evolving should be avoided. However, once the lesion is demarcated and clinically stable, debridement and wound care may permit better healing. In one series of eight patients, vacuum-assisted wound closure was used to promote healing of necrotic lesions [

Consultation with a physician experienced with the management of bites by South American recluse spiders is encouraged prior to the administration of antivenom.
        </p>

         Management is determined by the severity of effects and whether the patient has acute local skin findings alone or also has signs of systemic envenomation. (See

         (ie, species indigenous to Brazil, Chile, and Peru) who have systemic findings at any time after a bite or who have moderate to severe dermal necrosis and present for care within 48 hours receive antivenom rather than supportive care alone [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50,51
         </a>

         Observational studies in humans and animal trials suggest that South American recluse antivenoms may reduce the risk of dermatonecrosis, as well as systemic envenomation and its severe complications (eg, hemolysis, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation).

         Systemic loxoscelism is rare, but may occur more commonly in children. Because systemic effects may precede skin findings, loxoscelism should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute hemolysis of unknown etiology occurring in the pediatric age group in regions in which recluse spiders are indigenous. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Life-threatening effects'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         All children with any systemic signs after a presumed recluse spider bite warrant hospitalization and evaluation for acute hemolysis and rhabdomyolysis. Treatment is supportive. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Children who do not have systemic findings may be discharged home after local wound care and general measures. However, because hemolysis has been described up to seven days after a spider bite [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ], caretakers must have clear instructions to promptly seek medical care if any systemic findings (eg, vomiting, fever, myalgias, or hematuria) occur. In addition, re-evaluation of the child at three and seven days after the bite, regardless of symptoms, is suggested.

         Patients should be counseled about how to care for the bite site and advised to watch the site for signs of secondary bacterial infection (eg, fever, spreading redness, pus formation or drainage), as well as progressive skin changes that suggest early necrosis (ie, enlargement of the lesion or black/blue color changes).

         Parents/caregivers of children with a presumed recluse spider bite should be instructed to seek prompt medical care if systemic findings (eg, fever, vomiting, myalgias, or hematuria) occur.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who are concerned about avoiding future recluse bites should be counseled to shake out clothes, shoes, gloves, and other items that have been unused or lying on the floor before putting them on.
        </p>
        <p>
         Beds should be modified so that only the legs of the bed touch the floor: they should be moved away from the wall, bedding should be tucked in and ruffles removed, and items should not be stored beneath it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Insecticides may be effective for controlling recluse populations within the home; however, these must be properly administered by a pest control professional. Placement of sticky traps next to baseboards but out of reach of curious children and pets is another useful method to eliminate brown recluse spiders from a building.

         <em>
          Loxosceles
         </em>
         ) are one of a handful of spiders throughout the world that are capable of inflicting medically significant bites in humans. They are nondescript brown spiders  (

          picture 1

          picture 3

          Clinical history
         </strong>
         – Recluse spider bites are usually sustained indoors. These spiders are not aggressive and generally bite humans only when being crushed between flesh and some object. (See

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Patients presenting with possible spider bites should always be questioned carefully regarding the circumstances surrounding the bite. Unless the patient witnessed the spider inflicting the bite and can retrieve the spider for identification by an entomologist, other disorders are responsible for most lesions attributed to spider bites  (

          Clinical manifestations
         </strong>
         – Loxoscelism is the term for the medical manifestations of bites by recluse spiders. The initial bite of a
         <em>
          Loxosceles
         </em>
         spider is typically painless, although some patients describe sharp pain or burning. The bite is usually a red plaque  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71174" href="/z/d/graphic/71174.html" rel="external">
          picture 5
         </a>
         ), which can sometimes be identified by two small cutaneous puncture marks with surrounding erythema. Occasionally, vesiculation around the site may occur  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96172" href="/z/d/graphic/96172.html" rel="external">
          picture 6
         </a>
         ). In most cases, this lesion is self-limited and resolves without further complications. Patients with clinical manifestations limited to local effects do not require laboratory evaluation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Local effects'

         The progression of necrosis from a recluse spider bite typically occurs over several days  (

         Systemic toxicity may appear over several days following a bite and include malaise, nausea and vomiting, fever, and myalgias. Patients with systemic findings warrant ancillary studies to identify hemolytic anemia, rhabdomyolysis with acute kidney injury (AKI), and/or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Systemic toxicity is more common in small children than adults. (See

          Diagnosis

         – A presumptive diagnosis of a spider bite is most often based on the history of feeling a bite and clinical presentation of a wound that may be necrotic. Of note, the diagnosis of a spider bite can be considered definitive only if the patient has a consistent skin lesion  (

          Local effects only
         </strong>
         – For patients with bites by recluse spiders who do not have dermal necrosis or systemic toxicity, management consists of general wound measures and tetanus prophylaxis, as needed  (

          Dermal necrosis
         </strong>
         – For patients with dermal necrosis after a bite by a recluse spider other than a South American species (
         <em>
          Loxosceles gaucho
         </em>
         ,

         <em>
          L. intermedia
         </em>
         [ie, species indigenous to Brazil, Chile, and Peru]), we suggest symptomatic and supportive wound care; no antivenom exists for these species, and the use of

          dapsone

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Only patients with signs of cellulitis or abscess (eg, redness, swelling, suppuration) should receive antibiotics. The clinician should avoid early surgical excision and/or curettage of a necrotic lesion as it is still evolving. However, once the lesion is demarcated and no longer progressing, debridement and wound care may permit better healing. (See

         For patients with presumed spider bites by a South American species and who have systemic findings at any time after a bite or who have significant dermal necrosis and present for care within 48 hours, we suggest antivenom (

          Grade 2C
