         AERD is also called NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (NERD). NSAID challenge protocols involve cautiously administering gradually increasing doses of an NSAID, usually

         , in an appropriately monitored medical setting. These procedures are used to diagnose NSAID pseudoallergy and also to desensitize AERD patients to NSAIDs when indicated. The safety and technical aspects of these protocols, as well as the efficacy of aspirin therapy for AERD, are discussed here. The clinical manifestations and management of AERD and a general discussion of allergic and pseudoallergic reactions to NSAIDs are reviewed separately. (See

         NSAID challenges are usually performed by allergy specialists with expertise in drug allergy and the training, medications, equipment, and support staff needed to manage any resultant symptoms whenever possible. In addition, there are several types of NSAID reactions, and determining which type is likely present can require some expertise. In some centers (especially in Europe), pulmonary and otolaryngology specialists also perform NSAID challenges. (See

         Challenges in patients with suspected type 1 pseudoallergy are provocative challenges, meaning that they are likely to induce symptoms, albeit in a controlled and limited manner. These protocols differ from most other types of drug challenges (particularly those for immunoglobulin E-mediated allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis), which are performed only on patients who are
         <strong>
          not

         Challenges should be performed in a medically monitored setting. In most cases, these protocols may be safely performed in specially equipped outpatient allergy clinics, although the decision about where to perform challenges requires clinical judgment, and each case must be considered individually.

          Diagnosis of NSAID pseudoallergy
         </strong>
         – There are no in vitro or skin testing methods available to diagnose NSAID pseudoallergy, and a provocative challenge procedure is the only means of obtaining a definitive diagnosis. In patients with AERD, an NSAID challenge that results in characteristic nasal, ocular, and/or respiratory symptoms is diagnostic of type 1 pseudoallergy. However, outside of research settings, challenges are uncommonly performed solely for the purpose of diagnosis as they are not without risk to the patient.

          Desensitization to NSAIDs

         – Desensitization is performed by extending the challenge procedure beyond the initial induction of symptoms. Desensitization is commonly (although not exclusively) performed with oral

         . Successful aspirin desensitization induces a state of temporary tolerance to NSAIDs, which can be maintained indefinitely as long as the patient continues to take aspirin or another NSAID on a daily basis. This can be useful in several clinical scenarios. (See

         challenges in patients with AERD can be performed using oral aspirin or using solutions of aspirin-lysine (ASA-lysine; not available in the United States) that are inhaled into the lungs or solutions of

          ketorolac
         </a>
         that are sprayed into the nose. Both oral and inhalational challenges with aspirin may be used to diagnosis AERD, but only oral challenges have been used as a means of desensitizing both the upper and lower airways for patients who require long-term oral aspirin therapy.
        </p>
        <p>

         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">
          aspirin
         </a>
         challenges for AERD involve inducing symptoms. Because the symptoms most often begin 40 to 60 minutes after oral ingestion, the time interval between doses must take this delay into account. An oral protocol using three-hour intervals between doses is the best-studied approach, but protocols using 90- and 60-minute intervals, which take less time to complete, have also been published [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The choice of protocol should take into account the patient's history of past reactions to NSAIDs, if this information is available. Although most patients react 40 to 60 minutes after
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">
          aspirin
         </a>
         ingestion, some will react later (up to two hours), which is why the interval of three hours was chosen when these protocols were first developed. Specialty centers and large allergy groups generally choose one protocol that is consistently used at that institution and is familiar to the staff. For clinicians who perform challenges and desensitizations infrequently, we suggest use of the oral protocol with three-hour intervals because it has an excellent safety record and requires no special solutions or equipment. The main disadvantage of this protocol is the time required to achieve desensitization, which is typically two days (assuming the initial day of placebos, which is most relevant to research settings, is not needed).
        </p>
        <p>
         If a faster protocol is desired, we would suggest using the one with 90-minute intervals as most patients will react within 90 minutes of ingestion. However, those patients who react after 90 minutes might have a more severe reaction as they will have already received another dose when they begin reacting to the provoking dose.

         LTMDs significantly impact the results of oral NSAID challenge by blunting the bronchospastic component in particular [

         ]. Before LTMDs became available, NSAID challenges were routinely performed in intensive care units because of the severe asthmatic and sometimes systemic symptoms (eg, hypotension) that could develop in highly sensitive patients, but the recognition that LTMDs attenuated the severity of the reactions allowed

         Topical corticosteroids taken regularly by the patient (including inhaled, intranasal, and/or in combination with inhaled long-acting beta-agonists [LABAs]) should be continued throughout the procedure.

         The author does not usually include placebos when a challenge is performed solely for the purposes of patient management. Particularly for patients suspected of having AERD, the index of suspicion for the condition is usually highly based on history alone, and placebos are rarely needed.
        </p>

         In contrast, placebo doses are

         in research studies in which challenge is performed for the purposes of confirming the diagnosis. Many early diagnostic protocols include an initial day in which only placebos are administered to control for nonspecific changes in pulmonary function that can occur as the day progresses.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are some situations in which the use of placebo doses is clinically useful. For example, placebo doses are helpful in the evaluation of the patient who is suspected of not having NSAID sensitivity at all, in whom challenge is indicated to prove that the patient tolerates NSAIDs. We sometimes give such patients an initial dose of placebos and also end the challenge with one or more placebo doses (so that the patient receives placebo when expecting the largest dose of the day). Informed consent should be obtained for the general inclusion of placebos, although the patient is obviously not told when in the protocol the placebo will be given.

         ]. If the challenge was performed to diagnose type 1 pseudoallergy, then the procedure should be repeated without LTMDs. If the procedure was done to both diagnose and desensitize the patient to aspirin, a practical approach is to continue the patient on aspirin (650 mg twice daily) for up to three months. If the patient's symptoms have not substantially improved, then either the patient does not have AERD or the patient is a nonresponder to aspirin treatment and aspirin can be discontinued.

         Once the patient has developed symptoms and these have been treated, the next step in the protocol is to repeat the provoking dose. For example, if the patient developed symptoms after the 81 mg dose, then 81 mg is given again. Many patients will not develop symptoms to this repeat dose, but some will. When the 81 mg dose is tolerated, the protocol is then continued until the patient reaches the 325 mg dose. It is rare (but possible) for patients to react to two different doses at or below 325 mg.

          aspirin

         challenge, although the average time to complete the desensitization was 9.5 hours. That may be longer than many clinics and offices can remain open in a single day. Three hours of total observation was required after the onset of symptoms. Patients were only included if their forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV
         <sub>
          1
         </sub>
         ) was 70 percent of predicted or greater, whereas other aspirin challenge protocols include patients with FEV
         <sub>

         of 70 percent or greater of the
         <strong>
          patient's prior best
         </strong>
         . Thus, patients with severe asthma may have been excluded, and patients with AERD not uncommonly have severe asthma. Also, the authors defined desensitization somewhat differently than previous studies. The patient was considered desensitized once they tolerated the dose after the provoking dose and had also consumed a total dose of at least 325 mg. Those patients were then sent home to take 325 mg twice a day. Thus, 14 patients took the first 325 mg dose at home without monitoring. After a week, they advanced to full-dose aspirin treatment (650 mg twice a day). Both doses were tolerated by all subjects without incident. This study presents a promising approach that requires further study, although, at present, we still recommend that oral challenges be performed with three-hour intervals between doses because of the extensive safety record of this protocol.

         Studies have also examined 60-minute intervals, although the author believes these protocols require additional study in larger numbers of patients [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,9
         </a>
         ]. One group compared protocols using 60- and 90-minute time intervals performed at a single center and concluded that safety was comparable, and the 60-minute interval could reduce the total challenge time by three to four hours [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. However, this study included only 54 patients: 16 undergoing the 90-minute protocol and 38 receiving the 60-minute protocol. Nineteen percent of the 90-minute subjects and 13.3 percent of the 60-minute subjects could not complete the challenges (15 percent of the total subjects studied) due to gastrointestinal symptoms or persistent bronchospasm, which is a much higher failure rate than that of the three-hour oral protocols. In addition, AERD was not confirmed in this patient population prior to challenge, and the author's experience suggests that many AERD patients react after 60 minutes, such that higher rates of more severe reactions would be observed if this protocol were applied to larger numbers of patients. Thus, this protocol may be reasonable if the patient's history clearly suggests that their reaction occurs in less than 60 minutes, but, for patients who cannot provide this detail, we favor longer time periods between doses.

          —
         </span>
         Desensitization of patients with pseudoallergic NSAID reactions involves extending the challenge procedure used for diagnosis. Once the patient has developed symptoms and these have been treated, the challenge is resumed by repeating the same dose that elicited the reaction. If there is another reaction, the symptoms are again treated, and the same dose is given again until there is no further reaction. Once the patient no longer reacts to that dose, the protocol is continued until the patient has ingested a full 325 mg dose without developing symptoms. At this point, the patient is desensitized.
        </p>
        <p>
         AERD patients who have been successfully desensitized to 325 mg of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">
          aspirin
         </a>
         can subsequently increase the dose to 650 mg twice daily at home. We believe this approach to be safe because, in over 600 consecutive desensitizations to aspirin, we have not seen a reaction to 650 mg of aspirin once a patient is desensitized to 325 mg [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The issue of whether to repeat the provoking dose in patients with mild reactions rather than simply continuing the protocol with the next higher dose has not been investigated. Thus, we recommend always repeating the provoking dose.

Patients with type 4 reactions are less likely to experience successful desensitization. A minority of patients will not be able to complete the aspirin desensitization procedure, because of refractory nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or the appearance of an erythematous, pruritic, macular dermatitis (

         therapy is interrupted in a patient with AERD who was previously desensitized, there is a "refractory period" of at least two to three days before the patient becomes reactive again. During this period, aspirin or the desired NSAID can be reintroduced without a reaction. Also, the return to sensitivity is gradual, so even if three to five days have elapsed, one can reintroduce the 325 mg dose (or 81 mg if desired as treatment) in the office/clinic without the patient experiencing the severity of the reaction to the provoking dose during the initial challenge. Beyond five days, the full challenge and desensitization process must be repeated before the patient can resume NSAID therapy.

         Occasionally, a patient reports recurrent symptoms and appears to have lost tolerance. It is our clinical experience that symptoms in these situations are almost always due to some other asthma trigger, such as an upper respiratory tract infection, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or irritant exposure. The patient may inappropriately attribute this to the

          aspirin

         and stop taking it. Patients should be counseled that they will remain tolerant to aspirin as long as they are compliant with the daily dose. They may still experience flares in their asthma and rhinitis symptoms from time to time, but, provided they have been compliant, they should not attribute these changes to the aspirin or discontinue it without speaking to their clinician first.

         The available evidence suggests that both 325 mg twice daily and 650 mg twice daily are effective in reducing nasal/sinus and asthma symptoms in patients with AERD. At the higher dose, benefit is seen in 65 to 87 percent of patients treated for 6 to 12 months [

         ]. After one year, there was no improvement in asthma, polyps recurred in the group receiving the lower dose, and all patients were changed to 300 mg of aspirin daily. A subsequent cohort of 39 patients was evaluated, and each completed at least one year of aspirin therapy. Nasal polyposis significantly decreased in all patients. Asthma symptoms were not evaluated. Thus, 300 mg daily appears to be helpful for the management of nasal polyposis, although the benefit on asthma symptoms is not as clear. In contrast, a dose of 100 mg daily is clearly not sufficient.

         In summary, both 325 mg twice daily and 650 mg twice daily are effective in reducing nasal/sinus and asthma symptoms in patients with AERD. Because approximately equal percentages of patients tolerate each of these doses but one-half clearly benefit
         <strong>

         from the higher dose, it is logical to begin therapy at the higher dose. The effects should be apparent after three to six months of therapy, after which patients who have responded well could have their doses reduced to the lowest dose that maintains symptom control [

          Indications for NSAID challenge and desensitization
         </strong>
         – Patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) may develop type 1 pseudoallergic reactions to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; including
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">
          aspirin
         </a>
         [acetylsalicylic acid; ASA]). NSAID challenges are used to confirm the diagnosis of pseudoallergy. These same challenges can be extended to achieve desensitization to NSAIDs. NSAID desensitization allows patients with AERD and type 1 pseudoallergy to safely take any NSAID, provided it is continued on a daily basis. Daily NSAID therapy may be indicated for several reasons, including treatment of the upper and lower respiratory manifestations of AERD, treatment of rheumatologic disorders, pain management, or antiplatelet therapy.

          Referral and safety

         – Whenever possible, NSAID challenge and/or desensitization should be performed by an allergy specialist with experience in diagnosing and managing drug adverse reactions. NSAID challenges are expected to provoke symptoms, and clinicians must be prepared to manage these safely. (See

          Desensitization
         </strong>
         – Desensitization is accomplished by continuing the diagnostic challenge procedure. We prefer a dosing interval of three hours over faster protocols for safety reasons. Symptoms are provoked and treated, and the provoking dose is then repeated until the patient no longer reacts to it. The patient is considered desensitized when 325 mg of
