The mechanical obstruction leads to increases in pressure within the left atrium, pulmonary vasculature, and right side of the heart. Progressive MS leads to complications including heart failure, systemic arterial embolism, hemoptysis, pulmonary hypertension, and death. Medical therapy can alleviate symptoms, but surgical or percutaneous intervention is required to relieve the obstruction to flow. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8173.html" rel="external">"Rheumatic mitral stenosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8139.html" rel="external">"Rheumatic mitral stenosis: Overview of management"</a>.)</p><p>Surgical and investigational approaches to management of MS are reviewed here. Issues directly related to the indications for intervention and choice of percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy versus surgery and the medical management of MS are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8161.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8139.html" rel="external">"Rheumatic mitral stenosis: Overview of management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1915271133"><span class="h1">PREPROCEDURE ASSESSMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1517888446"><span class="h2">Assessment of valve pathology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Preprocedural imaging of the mitral valve (MV) includes echocardiography as well as multidetector computed tomography (MDCT), when available. Echocardiography (initial transthoracic, complemented by transesophageal if needed) is used primarily for the hemodynamic (functional) assessment of valve pathology while MDCT is essential for precise preoperative anatomical delineation of MV apparatus anatomy and pathology including delineation of whether calcium is limited to the leaflet, involves the subvalvular apparatus, or even extends into the left ventricle beyond the mitral annulus. </p><p>Transthoracic echocardiography is the initial test of choice for assessment of MV pathology and hemodynamic (functional) severity of disease. In selected cases in which transthoracic echocardiographic assessment is incomplete, transesophageal echocardiography is useful for further characterization of pathology including the presence/extent of calcification and assessment of mitral regurgitation. When available, MDCT is used for precise anatomical delineation of abnormalities/pathology of the MV apparatus.</p><p>The feasibility of percutaneous or surgical commissurotomy is assessed based upon the type and severity of pathologic change involving the valve and subvalvular apparatus. For percutaneous commissurotomy, this is most commonly assessed using the Wilkins score, as discussed separately. Assessment for open MV surgery includes more extensive evaluation of all rheumatic pathology including the leaflets (to determine need for surgical delamination and augmentation with pericardium), commissures, and subchordal/chordal (elongation, splitting, chordal transfer or insertion) and papillary muscle pathologies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8161.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8161.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy in adults", section on 'Evaluation of candidates for PMBC'</a>.)</p><p>Most cases of MS are caused by rheumatic heart disease with mitral commissural adhesion, thickened immobile MV leaflets, fibrosis, thickening, shortening, fusion, and calcification of the chordae tendineae. Infrequent causes of MS include mitral annular calcification (MAC) and congenital MS (including parachute MV). The differing features of these causes enable differentiation by echocardiography. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8137.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and natural history of mitral stenosis", section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>For patients suspected of having significant MAC, cardiac CT imaging provides the most accurate delineation of the severity and location of annular and extra-annular calcification. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H639620299"><span class="h2">Risk assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who are candidates for MV intervention for MS should be evaluated and discussed by a heart valve team to assess the potential risks and benefits of various options for MV intervention. Methods for estimating the mortality risk of valve surgery are discussed separately.<strong> </strong>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8153.html" rel="external">"Estimating the risk of valvular procedures"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4276876564"><span class="h2">Preoperative coronary angiography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We recommend a similar approach to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2020 guidelines on the management of patients with valvular heart disease regarding the use of cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography to establish the presence of coronary artery disease [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>There were two main indications for coronary angiography prior to MV surgery:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with angina, objective evidence of ischemia, decreased left ventricular systolic function, or a history of coronary disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients at risk for coronary disease, including men &gt;40 years old and postmenopausal women with high pretest likelihood of cardiovascular disease. </p><p></p><p>MDCT is used as an alternative to invasive coronary angiography in patients at risk for coronary disease (including men &gt;40 years old and postmenopausal women) with low to intermediate pretest likelihood of cardiovascular disease [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. An approach to cardiovascular risk assessment is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1546.html" rel="external">"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention in adults: Our approach"</a>.) </p><p>For high-risk patients being considered for transcatheter MV replacement (see <a class="local">'Transcatheter mitral valve replacement'</a> below), preoperative coronary angiography is recommended. By contrast, coronary angiography is not required solely for coronary risk factors in patients undergoing percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (PMBV).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CHOICE OF PROCEDURE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with MS with an indication for intervention, the choice among mitral valve (MV) procedures (percutaneous versus surgical approaches) is based largely upon valve pathology, estimated procedural risks, and is also impacted by local expertise and availability of interventional and surgical procedures. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines emphasize the importance of these procedures being performed at a comprehensive valve center due to the expertise, experience, and resources required to optimally treat MS patients [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. As shown in the prospective REMEDY study of the global characteristics of rheumatic valvular disease, there is a gradient of availability of interventional procedures among the low, middle income, or upper middle income countries [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Rheumatic MS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When intervention is warranted in patients with rheumatic MS with valve morphology favorable for percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (PMBV; ie, limited calcium and valve thickening, pliable leaflets, and limited subvalvular thickening), no left atrial thrombus, and without moderate to severe (3+ to 4+) mitral regurgitation, we recommend PMBV, as recommended in the ACC/AHA guidelines [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The data supporting this conclusion are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8161.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy in adults"</a>.)</p><p>However, even with unfavorable anatomy, PMBV may be performed at a comprehensive valve center as a palliative procedure if the patient is deemed to be at high risk for morbidity and mortality with surgery and there is no left atrial thrombus or moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8161.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy in adults", section on 'Use'</a>.)</p><p>The following clinical features favor MV surgery (open commissurotomy and repair or valve replacement) as the preferred procedure for MS [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Suboptimal valve anatomy for PMBV, such as severe valve leaflet thickening/calcification/immobility with subvalvular fibrosis.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Left atrial thrombus that persists despite anticoagulation.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Concomitant moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Concomitant severe tricuspid regurgitation. (See <a class="local">'Tricuspid valve repair'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Among patients with unfavorable valve morphology who are referred for MV surgery, valve repair is performed if possible. The repair may include both open commissurotomy and placement of an annuloplasty ring after direct visualization of the valve [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Open commissurotomy and valve repair'</a> below.)</p><p>MV replacement is generally considered the last alternative for the treatment of MS because of its higher perioperative mortality and potential for morbidity. However, in symptomatic patients with severe MS in whom neither PMBV nor surgical valve repair is possible, valve replacement results in marked symptomatic improvement and is associated with improved long-term survival. (See <a class="local">'Outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3009854302"><span class="h2">Mitral annular calcification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend that in severely symptomatic patients with severe MS (mitral valve area 1.5 cm<sup>2</sup> or less, stage D) attributable to extensive mitral annular calcification (MAC), valve intervention may be considered only after discussion of the high procedural risk and the individual patient’s preferences and values [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The prevalence of MAC increases with age, but severe MAC infrequently causes symptomatic calcific MS. Predisposing conditions for MAC include chronic kidney disease, prior chest irradiation, hypertension, and other conditions predisposing to left ventricular hypertrophy [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. In patients with MS caused by MAC, PMBV (which treats commissural fusion in patients with rheumatic valve disease) is not effective. However, the presence of severe MAC complicates MV surgery and is associated with high operative mortality rates (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/116169.html" rel="external">"Management and prognosis of mitral annular calcification", section on 'Mitral valve surgery'</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Congenital MS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgery is usually preferred in patients with congenital MS, since the anatomy is complex, the utility of PMBV may be limited, and catheterization procedures are potentially dangerous. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8161.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy in adults", section on 'Selective use for congenital MS'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3748432945"><span class="h1">MITRAL VALVE INTERVENTIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1078252541"><span class="h2">Mitral valve commissurotomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mitral valve (MV) commissurotomy for rheumatic MS can be performed by percutaneous, open surgical, or closed surgical procedures.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H865029977"><span class="h3">Percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In individuals with MS with characteristics favorable for percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (PMBV or percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy), the safety and efficacy of PMBV compared with surgical commissurotomy (open or closed) have been established by randomized controlled trials, as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8161.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2530753170"><span class="h3">Open commissurotomy and valve repair</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Open surgical commissurotomy performed with the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass is generally preferred to closed commissurotomy but is used only in selected cases in health care settings in which PMBV is available. (See <a class="local">'Rheumatic MS'</a> above.)</p><p>Open commissurotomy is performed via a median sternotomy and has the advantage of allowing the surgeon to inspect the MV and subvalvular apparatus. In addition to splitting the commissures under direct vision, the valve can be repaired by debriding calcium deposits and abnormal cusp tissue followed by replacement with autologous pericardium and artificial chordae, dividing fused chordae tendineae, and splitting papillary muscles when appropriate. When mitral regurgitation is present, an annuloplasty ring is placed to restore valve competency. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H546799078"><span class="h4">Use</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>PMBV is generally preferred to open commissurotomy since outcomes with PMBV were similar or better than those with open commissurotomy in clinical trials [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. Other advantages of PMBV are shorter hospital stay, avoidance of the morbidity of thoracotomy, and a better outcome if repeat intervention is required [<a href="#rid8">8</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8161.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy in adults"</a> and <a class="local">'Repeat commissurotomy'</a> below). However, open commissurotomy with valve repair remains an appropriate choice in patients who are not candidates for PMBV due to valve deformity or calcification, left atrial thrombus, or significant mitral regurgitation. Similar to closed commissurotomy and balloon valvotomy, the success of the procedure depends upon a favorable valve morphology (see <a class="local">'Choice of procedure'</a> above). In addition, thrombectomy can be performed to remove a left atrial thrombus, and many surgeons amputate or ligate the left atrial appendage to remove a potential source of embolism. (See <a class="local">'Left atrial appendage ligation'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1743456154"><span class="h4">Outcome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The safety and efficacy of open commissurotomy are well established. Successful commissurotomy is generally defined as MV area &gt;1.5 cm<sup>2</sup> (normal 4 to 6 cm<sup>2</sup>) and a decrease in left atrial pressure to ≤18 mmHg in the absence of complications; the most common complication is mitral regurgitation, which occurs in 2 to 10 percent of patients.</p><p>Results from several studies have shown no residual stenosis with open commissurotomy; perioperative mortality rates are less than 1 percent and, at five to seven years, only 7 percent of patients need a reintervention [<a href="#rid6">6,7,9</a>]. The absence of residual stenosis means the acute success rate is essentially 100 percent in candidates with suitable valve morphology. Observational data show lower cardiac mortality rates with mitral repair compared with MV replacement, although cardiac mortality rates are similar after adjustment for baseline differences [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5334.html" rel="external">"Echocardiographic evaluation of the mitral valve"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H694431483"><span class="h3">Closed surgical commissurotomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The earliest surgical procedures for the treatment of MS were variations of closed commissurotomy [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. This operation is performed on a beating heart, which is generally exposed via a left thoracotomy incision. The surgeon then uses either a transatrial or transventricular approach to introduce a dilator across the MV [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. An obvious limitation compared with other surgical approaches is the inability to directly visualize the MV.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1966158618"><span class="h4">Use</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Closed commissurotomy is associated with worse long-term outcomes compared with PMBV and open commissurotomy [<a href="#rid6">6,13</a>] and thus is not recommended in settings in which PMBV or open MV surgery is available. It is still performed in some developing nations where cost and lack of balloon valvotomy capability are continuing problems. </p><p>Closed commissurotomy has also been performed successfully in pregnant women in whom correction of MS is indicated [<a href="#rid14">14</a>], but PMBV is preferred. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8133.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy in women with mitral stenosis", section on 'Clinical management'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2394679694"><span class="h4">Outcomes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Success of closed commissurotomy depends upon a favorable valve morphology. As a result, only patients with pliable MV leaflets, minimal calcification, and lack of significant subvalvular involvement historically were candidates for this procedure. Absolute contraindications included the presence of an atrial thrombus or moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, which can worsen upon commissural splitting.</p><p>The safety, efficacy, and long-term results of closed commissurotomy were determined in a report from India of 3724 consecutive patients, almost one-half of whom were New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV at entry [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The following results were noted:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The in-hospital mortality was 1.5 percent, and severe mitral regurgitation requiring immediate valve replacement developed in 0.3 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mitral restenosis was noted after the fifth year of follow-up and varied from 4.2 to 11.4 per 1000 patients per year between the fifth and fifteenth year after surgery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Actuarial survival was 84 percent at 24 years; in addition, 86 percent of survivors at 15 years continued to have symptomatic improvement.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2488728766"><span class="h3">Repeat commissurotomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>PMBV and surgical commissurotomy can be repeated as long as the valve morphology remains favorable. The approximate frequency of repeat intervention is 7 to 10 percent at seven years with both procedures [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The outcome after repeat intervention may be less favorable than with the initial procedure because there is usually more valve deformity, calcification, and fibrosis.</p><p>Repeat PMBV carries no greater risk than the initial procedure; by contrast, repeat surgical commissurotomy has a mortality rate 2 to 10 times higher than that associated with the first operation [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Thus, despite the equivalent success with open surgical commissurotomy and PMBV [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], these concerns provide additional support for PMBV being the intervention of choice whenever technically feasible. Furthermore, PMBV can be performed for restenosis after initial surgical commissurotomy [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Surgical MV repair can often be successfully performed after prior PMBV [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8161.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8161.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy in adults", section on 'Repeat PMBC'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h2">Mitral valve replacement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgical MV replacement is performed via a median sternotomy with exposure of the MV either via a left atrial incision or through the right atrium via a transseptal incision. The native leaflets are resected, followed by debridement of annular and subvalvular calcification. When necessary, annular reconstruction can be accomplished using an autologous or bovine pericardial patch, or resected anterior leaflet [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].

The majority of patients with rheumatic MS are women of reproductive age [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Thus, the choice of a mechanical valve often entails coping with the risks of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> and other anticoagulants during pregnancy, as discussed in detail separately (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8126.html" rel="external">"Management of antithrombotic therapy for a prosthetic heart valve during pregnancy"</a>). Thus, for women who are expected to have a future pregnancy, the benefit of avoiding the risks of anticoagulation for a mechanical valve is weighed against the risk of reoperation if a bioprosthetic valve is placed [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].

The perioperative mortality varies with the patient population, ranging from less than 5 percent in young healthy individuals to approximately 10 to 20 percent in older patients with significant comorbidities and pulmonary hypertension to 25 percent in patients with NYHA class IV  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef98396" href="/d/graphic/98396.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4,20</a>].</p><p>The last observation indicates the risk of delaying surgery. On the other hand, early MV replacement exposes the patient to a longer period of the persistent risks of valve thrombosis, systemic embolism, endocarditis, and bleeding secondary to chronic anticoagulant therapy.

The effective orifice area (EOA) in prosthetic valves used for MV replacement is often small in relation to body size and may be associated with transvalvular pressure gradients similar to those in mild to moderate MS. </p><p>The possible detrimental impact of PPM on long-term survival was evaluated in a retrospective study of 929 patients undergoing MV replacement for both regurgitation and stenosis; the patients were followed for a mean of 6.3 years [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].

Long-term outcomes of this technique are lacking, and potential risks of conduit-related complications including thrombosis and degeneration require study.</p><p>MV bypass was first reported in patients with congenital MS [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. This technique has been applied to patients with MS due to severe MAC who are at high risk for conventional MV replacement [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. MV bypass avoids direct manipulation of the severely calcified mitral annulus and involves sewing a conduit from the left atrium (typically the left atrial appendage or left atriotomy incision site) to the left ventricular apex. A prosthetic valve (either bioprosthetic or mechanical) is incorporated in the conduit near the left ventricle. Importantly, this technique cannot be used in patients with significant mitral regurgitation as the conduit only treats MS. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1584420640"><span class="h3">Transcatheter mitral valve replacement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Transcatheter MV replacement is under investigation as a means of treating patients with severe MS who cannot be treated by PMBV and who have prohibitive surgical risk. There is a clear need for minimally invasive MV replacement strategies given the increasing prevalence of advanced age and comorbidities in patients with symptomatic MS, particularly in the population with severe MS due to MAC. In patients with radiation-associated heart disease, extensive calcification of the ascending aorta often makes the risk of surgery prohibitive, leaving limited treatment options. </p><p>Transcatheter MV replacement involves insertion of a balloon-expandable or self-expanding transcatheter valve into the MV position while leaving the native MV tissue in place. This can be accomplished via transapical access, surgical transatrial exposure, or via a completely percutaneous transvenous transseptal approach.</p><p>Early investigations of balloon-expandable transcatheter valve implantation in patients with severe circumferential MAC have highlighted the challenges associated with implanting transcatheter valves into the complex MV anatomy [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>].
