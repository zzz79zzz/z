         Liberation from mechanical ventilation is an important process in recovery of critically ill patients in the intensive care unit. It is a three-step process, consisting of readiness testing, weaning, and extubation. Patients who wean successfully have less morbidity and mortality and use fewer resources than patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>
         ]. Thus, ensuring that patients wean in a safe and effective way is important for patient outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
         The practice of weaning varies widely.

         Weaning is the process of decreasing the degree of ventilator support and allowing the patient to assume a greater proportion of their own ventilation (eg, spontaneous breathing trials or a gradual reduction in ventilator support). The purpose is to assess the probability that mechanical ventilation can be successfully discontinued. (See

         Daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) with inspiratory pressure support is our preferred method of weaning based upon randomized trials that have shown it is efficient, safe, and effective [

         Older methods include progressive decreases in the level of pressure support during pressure support ventilation (PSV) and progressive decreases in the number of ventilator-assisted breaths during intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV). (See

         Weaning protocols can be manual (ie, personnel-driven) or automated (ie, computer-driven) [

          8-16
         </a>
         ]. There is insufficient evidence to definitively conclude that one method is superior to the other. We generally prefer manual protocols because they can be tailored to the patient, they are less costly, and because most of the available clinical trials that demonstrated efficacy used manual protocols [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. While automated systems are less labor-intensive, there are fewer clinical trial data supporting their efficacy.

          Manual protocols
         </strong>
         – A manual system is one where, following a daily assessment of readiness to wean, healthcare staff manually alter the ventilator settings so that the patient undergoes a weaning trial. Such protocols are usually respiratory therapy- or nursing-driven. While effective, manual protocols are labor-intensive and compliance can be challenging, especially in a busy environment [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,17,18

         </span>
         <strong>
          Automated systems
         </strong>
         – Automated systems use proprietary, computerized, closed loop weaning software packages that automate weaning by pressure support. Once the patient is deemed ready for weaning by healthcare staff, the automated weaning program adjusts levels of pressure support during the weaning trial to keep the patient in a normal range of intermittently-monitored respiratory rate, tidal volume, and exhaled carbon dioxide. Once the patient is stable at a specific level of pressure support, the program automatically reduces the pressure support level and reassesses respiratory stability.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Some patients may not be suitable for automated weaning. For example, patients whose baseline arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         ) is &gt;60 mmHg should not be weaned by automated systems, since a PaCO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         &gt;60 mmHg is the upper limit of the target range in most weaning software packages. In addition, automated systems are generally not necessary in the postoperative setting when extubation is expected within a short period of time (eg, one to two days) following surgery.

          Evidence supporting protocolized weaning
         </strong>
         – The efficacy of ventilator liberation protocols is supported by numerous clinical trials and meta-analyses comparing protocolized weaning versus no protocol (ie, physician judgment) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. In a meta-analysis of 14 trials (2205 patients), protocolized weaning reduced mechanical ventilation (MV) duration by 26 percent (95% CI 13 to 37 percent), which corresponds to a reduction of approximately 25 hours (95% CI 12 to 36 hours) assuming an average MV duration of 96 hours without protocolized weaning [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay was reduced by 11 percent (95% CI 3 to 19 percent), which corresponds to a reduction of approximately one day (95% CI 0.2 to 1.5 days), assuming an average ICU length of stay of eight days without protocolized weaning. Both groups had similar mortality rates (22 percent each) and reintubation rates (9.4 percent in the protocolized weaning group versus 11.9 percent in the control group). The clinical trials included in the meta-analysis were heterogeneous with regard to the population studied and protocol used. Most protocols were driven by nursing and respiratory therapy staff and included a daily assessment of readiness to wean, followed by a weaning trial if deemed ready. The effect on reducing MV duration did not appear to differ in trials using manual weaning protocols compared with computer-driven approaches; however, only two trials (n=154) used computer-driven protocols, which limits the conclusions that can be drawn from this subgroup analysis. The relative effect size appeared to differ according to type of ICU, with larger effect size in patients admitted to surgical ICUs (47 percent reduction in MV duration [95% CI 20 to 65 percent]), medical ICUs (29 percent reduction [95% CI 7 to 46 percent]), and mixed ICUs (21 percent reduction [95% CI 2 to 36 percent]); and little to no effect in patients admitted to neurointensive care units (1 percent reduction in MV duration [95% CI 20 percent decrease to 18 percent increase]).

          Comparison of automated versus manual protocols
         </strong>
         – Small randomized trials comparing computer-driven automated weaning systems with non-automated weaning have reached variable conclusions [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,19-22
         </a>
         ]. In a meta-analysis of 7 randomized trials (516 patients), patients managed with computer-driven automated systems had shorter MV duration compared with patients in the control group (mean difference one day; 95% CI 0.09-1.9 days) [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Mortality and hospital length of stay were similar in both groups. Two other meta-analyses reported similar findings [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,22
         </a>
         ]. An important limitation of these meta-analyses is that the control group in many of the trials consisted of "usual care" without a standardized weaning protocol. In the one trial that directly compared automated weaning with a standardized non-computer-driven weaning protocol, MV duration was similar in both groups (10.5 versus 11 days, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. In addition, most trials included in the meta-analyses evaluated one specific proprietary system and the findings may not be generalizable to other systems.

         </span>
         For most patients with acute respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation, we suggest an SBT as the initial weaning strategy. In an SBT, the patient breaths spontaneously through the endotracheal tube (ETT) for a set period of time, typically 30 minutes to two hours. The amount of ventilator support used for the SBT and the duration are discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Choosing ventilatory support'

        </p>
        <p>
         Approximately 50 to 75 percent of patients pass the initial SBT and are able to be successfully extubated [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,14,24
         </a>
         ]. For patients who fail the initial SBT, we suggest ongoing weaning with daily SBTs rather than other weaning strategies such as gradual PSV or IMV weaning. A strategy of extubation with immediate application of NIV may be an option for select patients who fail the initial SBT and are at high risk of having further difficulty weaning and extubating (eg, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] or chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure).

In a meta-analysis of eight trials (1188 patients), protocolized weaning with daily SBTs reduced MV duration by 16 percent (95% CI 0 to 30 percent), which corresponds to a reduction of approximately 15 hours (95% CI 0 to 29 hours) assuming an average MV duration of 96 hours without daily SBTs [

          SBT versus other weaning strategies
         </strong>
         – Based on the available evidence, it is unclear if weaning with daily SBTs is superior to other protocolized weaning strategies such as gradual PSV or IMV weaning. The previously described meta-analysis provided an indirect comparison of SBT-based weaning protocols versus gradual PSV or IMV weaning protocols and did not detect a significant difference between the two approaches; both were more effective than usual care with similar effect sizes [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Two small randomized trials have directly addressed this question and reached different conclusions. One trial found that patients weaned with daily SBTs (using T-piece (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76022" href="/z/d/graphic/76022.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         )) were successfully extubated sooner than patients who underwent gradual PSV or IMV weaning [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. The second trial found that patients who underwent gradual PSV weaning had a shorter weaning duration and higher likelihood of successful extubation compared with patients who underwent daily T-piece SBTs or gradual synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) weaning [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The conflicting findings of the two trials may be related to differences in how the SBTs were performed in each trial. In the first trial, patients were extubated if they tolerated a two-hour SBT [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. The patients were unlikely to develop respiratory muscle fatigue because they were closely monitored and returned to full ventilatory support at the first sign of distress. In contrast, in the second trial, clinicians could request up to three separate SBTs over a 24 hour period, each lasting two hours, before deciding whether to extubate a patient [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. It is possible that these very prolonged SBTs using a T-piece resulted in fatigue, a process that can take 24 or more hours to reverse (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61693" href="/z/d/graphic/61693.html" rel="external">
          figure 2

         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. In other words, respiratory fatigue may have slowed the progress of patients weaned via SBTs in the second trial.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         One reason why IMV weaning may be less successful than SBT or PSV weaning is that the degree of respiratory muscle rest on IMV is not proportional to the level of ventilatory support and patient is only supported on mandatory breaths [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. This effect can be overcome by adding PSV to the unsupported breaths during SIMV [

         We suggest performing the SBT with some form of ventilatory support (eg, low-level PSV, automatic tube compensation [ATC] or continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP; eg, 5 cm H
         <sub>
          2

         O]) rather than no ventilatory support (eg, using a T-piece (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76022" href="/z/d/graphic/76022.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         )). Choosing among the options for ventilator support is often institution- or clinician-dependent. In our practice, we typically use PSV (eg, inspiratory pressure augmentation of 5 to 8 cm H
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         O), which is consistent with the recommendations of the American College of Chest Physicians/American Thoracic Society [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28-30
         </a>
         ]. When using PSV-SBT, the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) remains at 5 cm H
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         O and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         ) at 0.4 or lower.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach is based on the rationale that PSV mitigates any increased work of breathing due to resistance of the ETT [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,27,31-34
         </a>
         ]. This is especially important for patients with small ETTs (eg, size ≤7 mm), but even larger ETTs can have considerable narrowing of the lumen after intubation [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. In addition, using PSV, ATC, or CPAP during the SBT allows the ventilator's monitoring system and alarms to alert the clinician if there are changes in the patient’s respiratory rate, tidal volumes, or minute ventilation; whereas such monitoring is not possible if a T-piece is used (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76022" href="/z/d/graphic/76022.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The practice of performing the SBT on PSV is supported by several clinical trials (described below) that suggest PSV-SBT leads to higher rates of successful extubation compared with other methods [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Ventilatory support in the form of CPAP in patients at risk for acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema and patients with acute hypercapnia from obstructive lung disease may result in a falsely reassuring SBT, since CPAP is a form of therapy and reduces the work of breathing for both of these conditions, especially in COPD patients with intrinsic PEEP [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35-38
         </a>
         ]. A T-piece may be more appropriate in such conditions particularly when patients fail an initial PSV-SBT. Ventilatory support with ATC is not used frequently and its use may be institution-dependent.
        </p>
        <p>
         The evidence supporting the use of PSV-SBT comes from several randomized trials and a meta-analysis [

          30

         ]. More patients in the PSV-SBT arm achieved successful extubation at 72 hours compared with those in the T-piece arm (82 versus 74 percent). In addition, 90-day mortality was lower in the PSV-SBT group (13 versus 17 percent; hazard ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99). Reintubation rates and hospital length of stay were similar in both groups. The findings were consistent across various subgroups, including older patients (&gt;70 years), those ventilated for longer than four days, medical and surgical patients, and those with COPD. However, more patients in the PSV-SBT group received some form of noninvasive support (ie, high flow oxygen delivered via nasal cannulae [HFNC] or NIV) following extubation (25 versus 19 percent), which may have contributed to the higher extubation success rate in that group.

          40

However, there was a modest increase in the proportion of successful initial SBTs in the PSV group (79 versus 72 percent), patients extubated within 24 hours (77 versus 72 percent), and patients extubated within seven days of the first SBT (98 versus 94 percent). Most patients received prophylactic noninvasive support immediately following extubation, which may have prevented the development of extubation failure (eg, noninvasive ventilation or HFNC). In addition, the absence of PEEP in the PSV arm more closely approximates a T-piece trial than if PEEP were applied to PSV. Last, the reintubation rates quoted in this study are rather low for patients considered at high risk of extubation failure. All of these issues may have potentially minimized the difference between the groups. (See

         We typically perform SBTs for a duration of 30 minutes to two hours, which is the range used in most of the available clinical trials. However, the optimal duration for an SBT is uncertain and it may depend upon the underlying reason for intubation, the duration of MV prior to the weaning trial, performance on previous SBTs, and physician- or institution-specific practices.

Extubation to NIV can also be used as a tool in patients at high risk of extubation failure. These issues are described separately. (See

         Weaning practice varies significantly among clinicians, hospitals, regions, and countries. Our preferred weaning method is consistent with observed practice in most US ICUs as illustrated in a multicenter, international prospective observational study of 1868 patients who were mechanically ventilated for at least 24 hours and admitted to one of 142 intensive care units (ICUs) in six geographic regions (Canada, US, UK, Europe, India, Australia/New Zealand) [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>
         ]. Most ICUs had a university affiliation and were medical surgical ICUs or multidisciplinary ICUs. The results were as follows:

         Written directives to screen for SBT readiness varied widely, ranging from 5 to 83 percent. Written directives for screening were present in more than half of participating ICUs in Canada, India, and the US (83 percent) while written directives for SBT conduct were lower, though present in 78 percent of US ICUs. Similarly, the frequency of screening (eg, never, once daily, twice daily) and personnel involved (eg, nursing, respiratory therapist, clinician) also varied among regions; daily screening was conducted in 83 percent of US ICUs. Readiness testing is discussed separately. (See

         Approximately 20 percent of patients died prior to a weaning attempt and 8 percent underwent a direct tracheostomy. Among the remaining patients, over two-thirds underwent an SBT while the remaining third were directly extubated without an SBT. ICUs in the US were associated with greater odds of using an SBT compared with ICUs in other regions. Most regions outside the US were using pressure support mode before an SBT or direct extubation, while most ICUs in the US were receiving volume- or pressure-controlled modes of ventilation.

         Among those who underwent an SBT, almost half used low-level pressure support (PSV) with positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), while one quarter used a T-piece, and 11 percent used continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). PSV with PEEP was more commonly used in all regions except India and Europe, where T-piece trials were the most common method used.

         During the weaning trial, clinicians should monitor vital signs and ventilator parameters such as the tidal volume and respiratory rate (ie, minute ventilation). In addition, patients should be assessed for respiratory distress and mental status changes, and if alert and responsive, asked about the presence of dyspnea and chest pain. Telemetry monitors should also be examined for ST changes that might prompt electrocardiography to look for cardiac ischemia. At the end of the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), an arterial or venous blood gas (ABG, VBG) is not always necessary. However, blood gas analysis is prudent in those at risk of developing acute hypercapnia during weaning (eg, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], patients who underwent prolonged mechanical ventilation, patients with known or suspected neuromuscular weakness).

         Importantly, clinicians should use their clinical judgement at the bedside to make a final conclusion regarding success or failure. Nonetheless, several objective criteria were used during weaning trials to indicate failure. The development of

         When a patient successfully passes a weaning trial, they should be evaluated for safety of extubation. This requires an assessment of the volume of respiratory secretions as well as airway patency and protection (ie, has a sufficient cough and adequate level of consciousness). Extubation is reviewed in detail separately. (See

         In general, patients who fail a weaning trial should be placed back on their previous ventilator settings. No further attempts at weaning are typically made for another 24 hours, although rare exceptions can be made. For example, it is reasonable to repeat the weaning trial sooner in patients who have sedation-related failure (ie, hypoventilation from excessive somnolence) if they are subsequently more alert after weaning sedation.

         Liberation from mechanical ventilation is a three-step process, consisting of readiness testing, weaning, and extubation. Weaning is the process of decreasing the amount of support that the patient receives from the mechanical ventilator, so the patient assumes a greater proportion of the ventilatory effort. The purpose is to assess the probability that mechanical ventilation can be successfully discontinued. (See

          Initial approach to weaning
         </strong>
         – Practice varies widely. The steps below represent our approach to initial weaning in patients who have been intubated for more than 24 hours and have been deemed as ready to wean:

        <p>
        </p>

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         We recommend protocolized weaning rather than no protocol (ie, physician judgment) (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">
          Grade 1B
         </a>
         ). For most patients, we suggest manual weaning protocols (ie, personnel-driven) rather than automated weaning systems (ie, computer-driven) (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). We prefer manual protocols because they can be tailored to the patient, they are less costly, and because most of the available clinical trials used manual protocols. Automated systems are a reasonable alternative. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Selecting manual or automated weaning'
         </a>
         above.)

         </span>
         For most patients, we suggest weaning via once-daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs), rather than gradual pressure support ventilation (PSV) or intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) weaning (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). While gradual PSV and IMV weaning have been used in the past, the available evidence suggests that they are likely not superior to SBT. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs)'
         </a>

         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         For most patients, we suggest that the SBT be performed with low-level PSV (eg, 5 to 8
         <sub>
         </sub>
         cm H
         <sub>

          Grade 2B
         </a>
         ). Automatic tube compensation (ATC) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) are reasonable alternatives to low-level PSV. T-piece trials may be appropriate in select patients if there is concern that a PSV trial may provide a falsely reassuring assessment of readiness to extubate (eg, patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema and patients with hypercapnia from obstructive lung disease). (See
         <a class="local">

         An initial SBT of 30 minutes duration is generally sufficient to determine whether mechanical ventilation can be discontinued. Trials of up to 120 minutes are appropriate for patients who fail their initial SBT and those with prolonged mechanical ventilation duration (eg, ≥10 days). (See
