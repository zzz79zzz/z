Opiates belong to the larger class of drugs, opioids, which also include synthetic and semi-synthetic drugs. Abrupt cessation or reversal of opioids produce a withdrawal syndrome. Symptoms of withdrawal can be severe in some cases, and iatrogenic withdrawal (from a reversal agent such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9678" href="/d/drug information/9678.html" rel="external">naloxone</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9679" href="/d/drug information/9679.html" rel="external">naltrexone</a>) can produce sudden surges in catecholamines and hemodynamic instability that are occasionally life threatening.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the clinical features and management of opioid withdrawal in the emergency setting. A summary table to facilitate emergency management of withdrawal is provided  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68306" href="/d/graphic/68306.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Discussions of opioid withdrawal during detoxification treatment, opioid intoxication, opioid withdrawal in neonates, and general management of the poisoned patient are found separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7808.html" rel="external">"Opioid withdrawal: Medically supervised withdrawal during treatment for opioid use disorder"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/300.html" rel="external">"Acute opioid intoxication in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5016.html" rel="external">"Prenatal substance exposure and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS): Management and outcomes"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/324.html" rel="external">"General approach to drug poisoning in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PHARMACOLOGY AND CELLULAR TOXICOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Repeated, regular use of opioids produces tolerance that predisposes an individual to withdrawal. Chronic opioid exposure causes adaptations that increase excitability in neurons in the locus ceruleus, the major noradrenergic center in the brain. The presence of opioids brings these neurons toward their normal firing rates [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">KINETICS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The vast number of opioids precludes presenting pharmacokinetic data for each, although a few clinically important generalizations can be made. The majority of opioids have volumes of distribution of 1 to 10 L/kg, which makes removal of a significant quantity of drug by hemodialysis impossible. They have variable protein binding (from 89 percent for <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9623" href="/d/drug information/9623.html" rel="external">methadone</a> to 7.1 percent for <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="91299" href="/d/drug information/91299.html" rel="external">hydrocodone</a>) and are renally eliminated. Many opioids are metabolized to active metabolites. Examples include hydrocodone (metabolized to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8538" href="/d/drug information/8538.html" rel="external">hydromorphone</a>) and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9291" href="/d/drug information/9291.html" rel="external">codeine</a> (metabolized to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9788" href="/d/drug information/9788.html" rel="external">morphine</a>), both by cytochrome P450. Cytochrome P450 polymorphisms cause variations in the clinical effects of many opioids. Morphine is also metabolized to an active metabolite (morphine-6-glucuronide), but not by cytochromes.</p><p>The most clinically important pharmacokinetic difference is a wide variation in serum half-life  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70480" href="/d/graphic/70480.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The half-life data in these tables, taken from healthy subjects receiving therapeutic doses, should only serve as a rough guide to duration of clinical effect. Actual effects are influenced by dose, an individual's tolerance, and the presence of active metabolites.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H617265623"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Drug Abuse Warning Network in the United States estimated that there were almost one million opioid-related emergency department (ED) visits in 2022 [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In addition to opioid overdose, a significant number of these visits were related to opioid withdrawal. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports opioids were involved in 80,411 overdose deaths in 2021, representing 75 percent of all drug overdose deaths. Of these deaths, 88 percent involved synthetic opioids [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Problems related to opioid misuse and opioid use disorder have had a major impact on EDs. More recent data reporting that 5.5 percent of patients who survive an opioid overdose die within one year emphasize the need for comprehensive longitudinal treatment options for these patients [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES OF OPIOID WITHDRAWAL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is often (erroneously) asserted that opioid withdrawal is never life-threatening. While this conventional wisdom is usually true for "naturally occurring" withdrawal, iatrogenic withdrawal (from a reversal agent such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9678" href="/d/drug information/9678.html" rel="external">naloxone</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9679" href="/d/drug information/9679.html" rel="external">naltrexone</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="135038" href="/d/drug information/135038.html" rel="external">nalmefene</a> as in the setting of ultrarapid opioid detoxification [UROD]) can produce sudden surges in catecholamines and hemodynamic instability that some patients may not tolerate. Also, opioid withdrawal that is untreated or undertreated places the patient at risk of overdose from self-treating with illicit opioids. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In individuals with opioid dependance, opioid withdrawal begins almost immediately after receiving an antagonist and over a few hours after cessation of use. Partial agonists (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9170" href="/d/drug information/9170.html" rel="external">buprenorphine</a>) and agonist-antagonists (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9753" href="/d/drug information/9753.html" rel="external">pentazocine</a>) can also rapidly produce withdrawal, so for the purpose of this review, the term "antagonist" will be discussed in relation to these drugs as well.</p><p>Signs and symptoms of withdrawal begin as early as 4 to 12 hours after the last dose of a short-acting opioid and are often delayed 24 to 48 hours after cessation of a longer-acting opioid such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9623" href="/d/drug information/9623.html" rel="external">methadone</a>. Withdrawal symptoms typically peak within 24 to 48 hours of onset and persist for several days with short-acting agents and up to two weeks with methadone.</p><p>Patients experiencing opioid withdrawal typically complain of the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Craving for an opioid</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dysphoria and restlessness</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rhinorrhea and lacrimation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Myalgias and arthralgias</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea</p><p></p><p>Some or all of these symptoms may be present, and the severity depends on the individual's tolerance to opioids, the continued presence of opioid in the serum and end organs, and the duration of time over which the withdrawal has occurred. As an example, a person who is tolerant to 200 mg/day of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9623" href="/d/drug information/9623.html" rel="external">methadone</a> who was administered 2 mg of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9678" href="/d/drug information/9678.html" rel="external">naloxone</a> intravenously (IV) would experience much more severe symptoms than someone taking 10 mg of methadone daily who stopped abruptly one day earlier (ie, "cold turkey"). A thorough history should ascertain why the patient discontinued opioid use to ensure there is not another underlying medical condition that precluded them from obtaining the drug. In some patients, opioid metabolism is accelerated as a result of an interaction from a recently started medicine, and the patient experiences withdrawal despite continued use of their opioid.</p><p>The use of a validated scale, such as the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106994" href="/d/graphic/106994.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/111610.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>), facilitates diagnosis and evaluation of therapeutic response in patients in opioid withdrawal [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. It also provides a clear context for medical documentation and decision-making. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Opioid withdrawal is characterized by the following signs:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mydriasis (pupillary dilation)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Yawning</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diaphoresis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rhinorrhea </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased bowel sounds</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Piloerection  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81045" href="/d/graphic/81045.html" rel="external">table 4</a>)</p><p></p><p>Of these signs, interrater reliability was &gt;0.75 for piloerection (0.94), yawning (0.93), mydriasis (0.9), perspiration (0.88), and rhinorrhea (0.87) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>If the patient is in severe distress, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate may be increased. Hypotension may be present in the setting of volume depletion from vomiting and diarrhea. Temperature is normal and, with the exception of very severe cases, mental status is preserved. The COWS  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106994" href="/d/graphic/106994.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/111610.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>) or a similar instrument should be used to help determine the presence of symptoms and signs consistent with opioid withdrawal and the severity of withdrawal.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Opioid withdrawal may appear similar to other withdrawal or intoxication syndromes. Most patients in opioid withdrawal have good insight into their problem, so the diagnosis is usually established by history alone. When present, the findings of yawning, lacrimation, and piloerection are helpful because of their specificity.</p><p>Ethanol, sedative-hypnotic, and opioid withdrawal can all present with a broad spectrum of severity and vital sign abnormalities, but the first two syndromes are much more likely to cause significant hypertension and tachycardia. Many patients in opioid withdrawal have a pulse and blood pressure within normal limits. Although some patients in opioid withdrawal have a tachycardia that reflects their agitation, discomfort, or hypovolemia, only a small minority of patients manifest both hypertension and tachycardia. When present, these signs are almost always a result of a surge in catecholamines from iatrogenically-induced withdrawal. Conversely, in ethanol and sedative-hypnotic withdrawal, normal vital signs are the exception rather than the rule. Unlike opioid withdrawal in adults, ethanol and sedative-hypnotic withdrawal may produce seizures or hyperthermia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/323.html" rel="external">"Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/108527.html" rel="external">"Alcohol withdrawal: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>Sympathomimetic toxicity produces mydriasis, agitation, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and hypertension, but these findings are usually much more severe than those that occur in opioid withdrawal.</p><p>Cholinergic (muscarinic) toxicity, which can cause diarrhea and vomiting, can be distinguished from opioid withdrawal syndrome by salivation, bradycardia, and altered level of consciousness. Also, when induced by organic phosphorus pesticides, nicotinic signs such as neuromuscular weakness or paralysis are expected in severe cases. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/339.html" rel="external">"Organophosphate and carbamate poisoning"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h1">LABORATORY EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients with opioid intoxication and withdrawal can be managed without laboratory studies. If the patient presents with a history of significant vomiting or diarrhea, it is prudent to obtain a basic metabolic profile to help assess fluid and electrolyte abnormalities.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Below, we discuss the management of acute opioid withdrawal in adults being cared for in the emergency setting.

If withdrawal was produced by an interruption in opioid use, symptoms can be managed with either opioids or with non-opioid adjuncts  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54978" href="/d/graphic/54978.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). Whenever possible, we prefer to use a single class of agents for treatment. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9623" href="/d/drug information/9623.html" rel="external">Methadone</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9170" href="/d/drug information/9170.html" rel="external">buprenorphine</a> (with or without <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9678" href="/d/drug information/9678.html" rel="external">naloxone</a>) are good choices to treat opioid withdrawal. Most experts agree that buprenorphine is the preferred choice for most patients. However, patients who have previously used methadone and those with a very high dependency tend to do better with methadone than with buprenorphine.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H321658054"><span class="h4">Buprenorphine</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We typically administer 8 mg of sublingual <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9170" href="/d/drug information/9170.html" rel="external">buprenorphine</a> for acute opioid withdrawal [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. If symptoms persist 30 to 60 minutes later, we administer a second dose [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Subsequent doses should be given until there is a subjective improvement of symptoms or, if preferred, until a COWS score of &lt;8 is achieved  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106994" href="/d/graphic/106994.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Total daily doses typically should not exceed 32 mg. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7803.html" rel="external">"Opioid use disorder: Pharmacologic management", section on 'Buprenorphine: Opioid agonist'</a>.)</p><p>A patient with significant tolerance, withdrawal on reassessment, or barriers to obtaining prescribed <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9170" href="/d/drug information/9170.html" rel="external">buprenorphine</a> after ED discharge (including experiencing homelessness) may benefit from larger doses [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. This approach has been used safely in the ED setting; for example, in a case series of 579 ED encounters, patients with OUD received 12 mg or greater without any instances of respiratory depression [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7803.html" rel="external">"Opioid use disorder: Pharmacologic management", section on 'Alternative induction methods for specific circumstances'</a>.)</p><p>Alternatively, 0.3 to 0.9 mg of intravenous (IV; given over 20 to 30 minutes) or intramuscular <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9170" href="/d/drug information/9170.html" rel="external">buprenorphine</a> are reasonable first doses in patients with severe gastrointestinal distress. If any dose of buprenorphine precipitates opioid withdrawal, more buprenorphine (up to 16 mg by sublingual route) is recommended [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. A preliminary report of ED initiation of a 7-day extended-release subcutaneous buprenorphine preparation found that 24 mg was well tolerated in patients with at least mild withdrawal (COWS &gt;4); less than 0.5 percent of patients developed precipitated withdrawal [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>The low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9170" href="/d/drug information/9170.html" rel="external">buprenorphine</a> initiation protocol (ie, "microdosing"), which involves frequent administration of small doses (eg, 0.5 to 2 mg), may be preferable while the individual is on the full opioid agonist, has early, mild withdrawal, or cannot abstain from opioid use long enough to tolerate a standard induction.
