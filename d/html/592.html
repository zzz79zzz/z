This topic review will broadly discuss factors that affect a child's ability to learn and will describe aspects of family, school, and community systems that support the child's ability to achieve their maximal educational potential.</p><p>The concept of "school readiness" traditionally applies predominantly to children with average or above abilities. Children with below average abilities or who are at risk for not meeting developmental expectations should be enrolled in early childhood programs at the time of diagnosis or identification rather than being considered "not ready" for school. Early childhood programs may foster skill progression and help them to be more successful in academic endeavors and, thus, more likely to achieve better long-term outcomes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H596370375"><span class="h1">BACKGROUND</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Early school success or failure can affect children's well-being, self-esteem, motivation, and subsequent academic achievement [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Because early learning experiences influence the manner in which children relate to others during the course of their lives [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>], it is important to try to ensure that children begin school when they are developmentally ready to participate in classroom activities with the greatest likelihood of success [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>The idea that all children should start school "ready to learn" was part of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act enacted by the United States Congress in 1994 and is the first stated goal of the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgovinfo.library.unt.edu%2Fnegp%2Fpage3.htm&amp;token=lwnOnDSolju%2B3dDjEUOiOsETyXf9seNB5il8gjfE%2BkuJq1AL1hNM21L%2FhHh0yWebSMwAZx7XtoKBiKmlrCdJng%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=592" target="_blank">National Educational Goals Panel</a> which was established in 1990 [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]. The idea of "school readiness" has traditionally implied that there is a measurable standard against which a given child's physical, intellectual, and socioemotional functioning can be compared, and that meeting the standard predicts future academic success. Such is not the case. Empiric evidence of such readiness standards does not exist [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], nor is there a consensus among educators about what constitutes readiness [<a href="#rid5">5,9</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Changes in readiness expectations and curriculum'</a> below.)</p><p>Despite the lack of consensus regarding readiness, surveyed kindergarten teachers identified a certain proportion of their students who were not ready to successfully participate in school [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Problems identified by the teachers that affected school readiness included deficiencies in language, emotional maturity, general knowledge, social confidence, moral awareness, and physical well-being, in decreasing order of importance.</p><p>Virtually every child, regardless of physical or mental disabilities, cultural or ethnic background, or prior exposure to educational activities, is capable of learning and should participate in an educational program [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Children with developmental delays or significant psychosocial disadvantage should be offered early intervention, early childhood special education, or Head Start programming before being assessed for kindergarten readiness. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on School Health and Committee on Early Childhood, Adoption and Dependent Care, "it is the responsibility of schools to meet the needs of all children at all levels of readiness" [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H596370476"><span class="h1">CHANGES IN READINESS EXPECTATIONS AND CURRICULUM</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Expectations for school readiness in the United States have changed over time with authorization/reauthorization of legislation related to elementary and special education (eg, No Child Left Behind [NCLB] Act, Every Student Succeeds Act). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/626.html" rel="external">"Definitions of specific learning disorder and laws pertaining to learning disorders in the United States", section on 'Every Student Succeeds Act'</a>.)</p><p>The main thrust of NCLB was to hold schools more accountable for the performance of students who are struggling or failing [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The accountability requirements of NCLB have been associated with changes in teacher beliefs about prekindergarten skills required for success and in the emphasis of various subjects taught during kindergarten, including [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased percentage of teachers who believe that children should know the alphabet before entering kindergarten</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased percentage of teachers who believe that children should learn how to read during kindergarten</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increase in the amount of time spent on reading</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>More frequent teaching of more advanced writing skills, such as writing complete sentences, spelling, vocabulary, and composing logical and complete stories</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Less time spent on basic math skills (eg, counting to 100, adding single digits) and more time on more advanced topics (eg, writing equations, thinking about probability)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Less time spent on science, social studies, music, and art (which are not tested as part of NCLB)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decreased time in physical education activities</p><p></p><p>Despite the increased emphasis on literacy, teachers continue to believe that nonacademic skill domains, such as self-regulation (eg, being able to sit still and pay attention) and social functioning (eg, sharing, taking turns), are the most important skills children need to be successful in kindergarten [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Readiness of the child'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">FACTORS RELATED TO A CHILD'S ABILITY TO LEARN</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Various sociodemographic factors affect a child's ability to learn and their risk for school problems [<a href="#rid12">12,16,17</a>]. Although it is not the only factor, lack of readiness contributes to early grade retention [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Approximately 5 to 10 percent of children repeat kindergarten [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>], although there is little evidence that retention is effective, and it may be harmful [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk factors</strong> – Early recognition of risk factors for learning difficulty may permit intervention before school problems emerge [<a href="#rid12">12,17,22-24</a>].

The National Education Goals Panel (NEGP) described three essential components [<a href="#rid12">12,51,52</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Readiness of the child</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Readiness of the school system</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Family and community supports that contribute to the child's readiness</p><p></p><p>The recommendations of the NEGP, although endorsed by federal and state governments, have not been fully implemented (particularly those that relate to readiness of schools and community support systems). Nonetheless, there are steps that caregivers and health care providers can take to ensure that their children and patients, respectively, are adequately prepared to enter school "ready to learn." These steps are described below. (See <a class="local">'Readiness of the child'</a> below and <a class="local">'Promotion of school readiness'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">READINESS OF THE CHILD</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H596370397"><span class="h2">Domains of readiness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>School readiness is a complex network of development that spans physical, cognitive, social, and community functioning rather than competence in certain foundational academic skills [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The scope of the child's readiness includes five interrelated and overlapping domains [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Physical well-being and motor development</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Social and emotional development</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Child's approach to learning</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Language development</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cognition and general knowledge</p><p></p><p>Achievement of proficiency in these domains before kindergarten entry is variable. The differences in achievement are related to early experiences, such as enrollment in quality day care, cultural environments that emphasize varying behaviors and activities, inborn developmental/physical characteristics, and psychosocial risk factors. Even children with seemingly inadequate school readiness skills are capable of acquiring some new skills while in kindergarten. However, children with a solid base of school readiness skills appear to learn more, and to learn more quickly, than children without that foundation [<a href="#rid53">53</a>].</p><p>Although proficiency in foundational skills is no longer the focus of school readiness, children with proficiency in rudimentary skills such as counting with one-to-one correspondence, recognizing numbers and letters, and mastering quantitative and relational concepts (eg, bigger than, equal to) are more likely to learn to read and do math earlier and better than children without those skills at kindergarten entry [<a href="#rid54">54</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Physical well-being</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The physical well-being of a child can affect their early learning experiences. Children who deviate significantly from normative expectations may need special services or alterations in the school program in order to maximize their learning potential.</p><p>The physical well-being and motor development of children varies depending upon their health status, growth, physical abilities and disabilities, and prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal conditions [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. Although normal physical fitness helps the child to pay attention and participate in social and academic activities, impaired physical or motor development does not prevent the child from entering school. It may, however, affect the child's ability to perform school-related activities and should be considered when making educational programming and service decisions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2840.html" rel="external">"Children and youth with special health care needs", section on 'School-based services'</a>.)</p><p>Examples of conditions that affect physical well-being and, consequently, school program or service planning include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Genetic or congenital disorders (eg, Down syndrome) may require remedial instruction or therapy (eg, speech and language therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy) as adjuncts to the school program.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cerebral palsy or delayed gross or fine motor development may require physical therapy and/or occupational therapy in order to improve skills necessary for exploration of the environment, engagement in social activities, and paper-and-pencil tasks [<a href="#rid56">56</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vision or hearing impairment must be addressed before entering school, and vision and/or hearing accommodations/supports should be included in the child's educational plan.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Impaired oral-motor skills may require speech and language therapy to improve ability to participate in academic activities and develop social interaction skills with peers.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic medical conditions (eg, asthma, sickle cell disease, food allergies [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]) require optimal medical therapy to minimize acute exacerbations that could lead to school absence. Chronic medical conditions may be associated with pain or discomfort that can affect attention and readiness to learn. Medications used to treat chronic conditions may affect cognitive functions. Children with chronic conditions may require a plan to receive medications or urgent medical therapy at school. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6203.html" rel="external">"Seizures and epilepsy in children: Initial treatment and monitoring", section on 'Adverse effects'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5739.html" rel="external">"Food allergy in schools and camps"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6245.html" rel="external">"Treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Poor sleep hygiene may affect school readiness and performance [<a href="#rid58">58</a>]. Among a group of seemingly normal kindergartners (none of whom had been identified as having a sleep disturbance), children with inadequate school readiness who were not going to progress to first grade were more likely to have longer sleep latencies, reduced sleep efficiency, increased nocturnal awakenings, and daytime sleepiness [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6357.html" rel="external">"Assessment of sleep disorders in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>At every visit from infancy through the preschool years, pediatric health care providers should be mindful of health conditions that affect the ability of their patients to learn. This includes regular screening for developmental problems, socioemotional and behavioral risk factors, vision and hearing problems, and various medical conditions (eg, lead poisoning, iron deficiency anemia, delayed immunizations, sleep disorders, etc). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2872.html" rel="external">"Screening tests in children and adolescents"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2876.html" rel="external">"Standard immunizations for children and adolescents: Overview", section on 'Routine schedule'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H28744564"><span class="h3">Social and emotional development</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The social and emotional development of the child encompasses their self-concept as well as interpersonal skills.

A child's ability to interact well with peers predicts kindergarten achievement [<a href="#rid63">63</a>], and peer interactions are one of the most salient predictors of adult adaptation [<a href="#rid51">51,64</a>].</p><p></p><p>Specific socioemotional competencies include self-regulation and the ability to separate from caregivers, the ability to express emotions in an appropriate manner, positive self-efficacy, awareness of the effect of one's actions on others, comprehension of the perspective of others, and a variety of prosocial behaviors (eg, taking turns, sharing, helping, acceptance of differences, empathy) [<a href="#rid51">51,65</a>]. It is also important to be able to form and maintain relationships with others, which requires the ability to interact cooperatively and respectfully, to recognize the intent of underlying actions, and to offer and seek out support [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. Some of these skills, including self-regulation, adaptive behavior, interpersonal skills, and attention, can be improved through experience and training in the classroom setting as well as in child care centers and at home (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54909" href="/d/graphic/54909.html" rel="external">table 1C</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3,23,60,66,67</a>].</p><p>Socioemotional functioning is a better predictor of academic performance in early grades than are cognitive abilities or family characteristics [<a href="#rid68">68-71</a>]. Teachers are less likely to recognize cognitive competencies in children who exhibit "undesirable" behavior (eg, verbal and physical aggression, impulsive behavior, lack of cooperation, ignoring or disregarding others, oppositional or defiant behavior) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Such children also have limited opportunities to learn from their peers, since the peers are likely to reject them as friends on account of the undesirable behavior [<a href="#rid72">72</a>].</p><p>Surveys of kindergarten and preschool teachers and child care providers indicate that disruptive behavior (eg, arguing, fighting, kicking, hitting, threatening) is common and one of their greatest challenges [<a href="#rid73">73-77</a>]. For some preschoolers, behavioral difficulties may be driven by developmental delays (eg, demands for performance at school exceed their abilities) [<a href="#rid29">29</a>], highlighting the need for universal developmental screening in early childhood. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/615.html" rel="external">"Developmental-behavioral surveillance and screening in primary care"</a>.)</p><p>Although there is an association between behavioral difficulties and lower school readiness in young children, difficulties with attention and self-regulation appear to be more important than overt aggressiveness [<a href="#rid78">78-80</a>]. Aggression becomes a stronger and unique predictor of academic achievement among older school-aged children [<a href="#rid81">81,82</a>]. Adequate peer interaction skills (eg, cooperation, initiating play) can offset some of the difficulties associated with behavioral problems [<a href="#rid83">83</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Approach to learning</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The child's approach to learning refers to the strategies they adopt to acquire, use, and demonstrate skills or knowledge.</p><p>Children approach learning through a combination of predispositions and learning styles. "Predispositions" are inborn or instilled at a very early age and refer to such factors as the child's sex, temperament, cultural patterns, and values. "Learning style" refers to the child's method of responding across situations and includes such factors as curiosity, initiative, attention, persistence, reflection, imagination, and reasoning. Young children with symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are at increased risk for impaired readiness in approach to learning and may benefit from preschool programs that focus on learning readiness skills and/or caregiver management training [<a href="#rid80">80</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/623.html" rel="external">"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Overview of treatment and prognosis", section on 'Preschool children'</a>.)</p><p>Children are most likely to be academically successful when teaching styles match their learning styles, yet standard school curricula often favor one style over others (eg, visual rather than auditory) [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. Encouraging a particular learning style without considering an individual child's needs or cultural background may put children with alternate learning styles at a disadvantage [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].</p><p>Kindergarten teachers describe most students, even the ones most at risk for poor school readiness, as exhibiting positive approaches to classroom learning. That is, even in high-risk groups, the children tend to demonstrate eagerness to master new skills, reasonable attention, and persistence in completing activities [<a href="#rid54">54</a>]. Classroom engagement (eg, working and playing cooperatively, following rules and instructions, listening attentively, working autonomously) has been shown to predict high school outcomes of academic achievement, dropout risk, substance use, and health status [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Language development</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Language development includes verbal language skills such as listening, speaking, and vocabulary, as well as emerging literacy skills such as sound-symbol association and understanding that stories have a beginning, middle, and end. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/617.html" rel="external">"Emergent literacy including language development"</a>.)</p><p>Delayed language development is the most common reason identified by kindergarten teachers for lack of readiness among kindergarten students [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The timing of language deficits appears to be more important than the persistence of them [<a href="#rid84">84</a>]. The presence of language problems immediately before kindergarten entry (ie, at 4.5 years of age) was highly correlated with decreased school readiness, whereas early language problems that had seemingly resolved did not have an adverse impact on school readiness. Receptive language problems were a stronger predictor of inadequate school readiness than expressive language problems. Caregivers can promote the development of language skills in their children by reading with them daily [<a href="#rid85">85-88</a>], reviewing linguistic concepts, helping them to identify sound patterns, and helping them to understand and retell stories (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74888" href="/d/graphic/74888.html" rel="external">table 1B</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/617.html" rel="external">"Emergent literacy including language development"</a>.)</p><p>Children use language not only for basic communication but also to access information in their knowledge stores. Thus, language is crucial for conceptual development and reasoning. Language development is strongly associated with conventional definitions of academic success [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].</p><p>Language development is closely interwoven with socioemotional development. The use of language requires agreement about the ways in which words are used and the structure of communication within a group. Most of a child's language development occurs through their interaction with other people, particularly parents and caregivers, who often provide bridges in early communication efforts (eg, asking questions to help clarify the child's expressions).</p><p>The way in which children acquire and use language varies between cultural groups; even within a single sociocultural group, the rate of language acquisition varies considerably [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. In addition, the language of an individual child may vary depending upon the setting. By the time they enter school, children have developed language functions within the background of their home and community environments; thus, a child's language skills are embedded in their cultural background. If that cultural background involves experiences discrepant from typical school experiences, the child may have more difficulty using their language abilities in school. Educators and caregivers should be sensitive to such struggles.</p><p>Literacy begins to develop before the child learns how to read; it includes the idea of assigning meaning to symbols, as well as how to listen and remember. Early exposure to books and reading is highly beneficial, although exposure to words can occur in other ways (eg, street signs, television, clothing labels, etc). Simple participation in routine activities contributes to language development. As an example, during make-believe activities, children are exposed to the process of structuring stories by role-playing.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Cognitive development</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cognition and general knowledge involve the recognition that different objects have various characteristics (eg, color, shape, size, number, and spatial relations) and the ability to make comparative distinctions on the basis of those characteristics. It also includes being familiar with conventions of print (in English, reading top to bottom) and understanding sound-symbol associations. Caregivers can promote cognitive and general knowledge skills through various activities at home and in the community (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70285" href="/d/graphic/70285.html" rel="external">table 1A</a>).</p><p>In the past, cognitive ability (ie, intelligence) was the primary, if not sole, indicator of school readiness, and social conventional knowledge (eg, ability to name colors and count) was the predominant area of skill development. Cognitive ability continues to be the domain that is most commonly associated with school readiness, particularly by caregivers [<a href="#rid89">89</a>]. However, the NEGP's view of this domain encompasses all types of knowledge: physical, logico-mathematical, and social-conventional.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Physical knowledge refers to the recognition that objects have physical properties in an external reality. The properties can be learned through observation and experience. In handling a ball, for example, one learns that it has weight and size and rolls downward when placed on an incline.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Logico-mathematical knowledge refers to the relationships and associations individuals create in their minds between and among objects: for example, perceiving two objects to be different because of variance in a particular physical property (eg, color, size). Logico-mathematical knowledge is difficult to assess because of its complexity, but understanding relationships is integral to problem solving.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Social-conventional knowledge refers to school-learned, society-endorsed "facts" that are maintained across generations. For example, use of a Judeo-Christian calendar system, agreeing that the English alphabet consists of 26 letters, and that the color of the daytime sky usually is "blue," whereas the sun is "yellow." Social-conventional knowledge is the type of knowledge on which the assessment of a child's cognitive capabilities is typically focused, even though it has the greatest variation across cultural groups and is the easiest to acquire.</p><p></p><p>The three types of knowledge are interrelated yet distinct. Children must develop a classification system that discriminates objects before they can "read" the physical properties. They may be able to count by rote to 10, but if they do not understand one-to-one correspondence, they will be unable to say how many blocks are in a stack.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h2">Chronologic age</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In order to enroll in kindergarten, children must reach their fifth birthday by a date that is arbitrarily set by the school system, usually the first day of September or October [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>Empiric evidence supports the enrollment of children in kindergarten at the age-appropriate time. If there is concern about a child's ability to successfully participate in kindergarten, parents, teachers, and health care providers should carefully consider the potential benefit and detriment of proceeding with or delaying enrollment, and if the decision is to proceed with enrollment, they should communicate frequently during the first weeks of school to determine whether special programming or services are necessary [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H168681242"><span class="h3">Delayed enrollment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Caregivers and/or teachers may advocate delaying kindergarten enrollment for some children who are deemed to be "unready." This is particularly true of males who have birthdays that are near the cut-off date. This practice assumes that the child needs more time to develop basic cognitive or psychosocial skills.</p><p>However, waiting an extra year does not yield any noticeable benefit, particularly if the child remains in the environment where readiness was not fostered. In fact, for attainment of basic academic skills, (eg, sound-symbol awareness, letter and number recognition, counting) the effects of schooling outweigh the effects of age [<a href="#rid90">90</a>]. Children who postpone kindergarten enrollment for one year do not perform any better than children who entered kindergarten at the usual age [<a href="#rid91">91</a>]. Academic performance and social abilities of students who enrolled at five years of age and those who delayed enrollment are similar after first or second grade [<a href="#rid92">92-96</a>].</p><p>Moreover, students who are older than classmates are more likely to drop out of school in later grades than their age-appropriate peers [<a href="#rid97">97,98</a>]. The causality of this association has not been established; the high drop-out rate may be related to factors that contributed to delayed enrollment, rather than delayed enrollment itself. Students older than their classroom peers also have more caregiver-reported behavior problems and youth-reported health-risk behaviors (eg, substance use) than their age-appropriate peers [<a href="#rid99">99,100</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3986102768"><span class="h3">Early enrollment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Caregivers also may advocate for early kindergarten enrollment (ie, at age four years) for their children who seem to have more advanced skills than their same-age peers. The ability of such children to successfully participate in kindergarten is comparable to children who entered kindergarten at five years of age if they have above-average intellectual abilities and well-developed socialization skills [<a href="#rid101">101</a>].</p><p>However, when controlling for effects of overall intelligence, children who were only slightly older than classmates at kindergarten entry showed modestly greater development across basic academic skills (eg, word decoding, number conceptualization, vocabulary, working memory) in the first few years of school, even though the groups did not differ on rudimentary skills demonstrated in kindergarten [<a href="#rid90">90</a>]. Teacher ratings of academic mastery in second or third grade also favored children who were slightly older at kindergarten entry. Social functioning did not differ between these groups of children during the first few years after kindergarten.</p><p>Adverse effects of early enrollment may become evident as the children enter middle and junior high school when physical maturation differences become more obvious. Although early enrollees typically continue to perform comparably in the academic arena, they may lag behind in the physical, and sometimes social, spheres and may be more likely to develop socioemotional difficulties [<a href="#rid102">102-106</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H182229404"><span class="h2">Need for special education</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For preschool age children who may need special education services, further assessment can be obtained through the child's local school or the school district's special education center.

The National Educational Goals Panel (NEGP) states, "Families and communities shape the context in which children grow, framing children's most important early experiences and encounters with their environments" [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].

As noted above, physical and mental difficulties can impede the acquisition of new skills and information, as well as the successful demonstration of knowledge. Thus, it is important to have interventions at the community level that are aimed at improving early health. Such interventions include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Programs that provide monitoring, referral, education, and support</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Immunization initiatives</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nutritional supplementation programs</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Programs that evaluate and treat oral health problems</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Programs that evaluate and treat mental health problems in parents or caregivers and children</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19"><span class="h2">Social</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ability of a child to participate in school activities also is related to their social environment.
