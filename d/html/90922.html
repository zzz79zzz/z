         Corneal abrasion is often used to refer to any defect in the corneal surface epithelium (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90887" href="/z/d/graphic/90887.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). However, this is an inexact use of the term, because it also implies etiology. Many corneal abnormalities are more appropriately called "corneal epithelial defects," while corneal abrasion more strictly refers to a defect in the epithelial surface of the cornea that is caused by mechanical trauma to the surface of the eye. Nevertheless, since "corneal epithelial defect" is not a term in general usage by patients and providers, we will use both terms interchangeably to refer to corneal epithelial defects of all etiologies.
        </p>
        <p>
         Corneal abrasions can be classified as traumatic, including foreign body related and contact lens related, or spontaneous. Spontaneous defects in the corneal epithelium may occur with no immediate antecedent injury or foreign body. Eyes that have suffered a previous traumatic abrasion or eyes that have an underlying defect in the corneal epithelium are prone to this problem. Spontaneous corneal abrasions are also known as recurrent erosions. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6897.html" rel="external">

         </span>
         Any patient who complains of severe eye pain with photophobia and/or foreign body sensation preventing opening of the eye generally can be presumed to have a corneal epithelial defect. The provider must then first rule out penetrating trauma, and second an infectious infiltrate, especially herpes simplex virus infection (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86913" href="/z/d/graphic/86913.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). The rapid overviews provide key diagnostic findings and initial management for patients with open globes and traumatic hyphemas (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50022" href="/z/d/graphic/50022.html" rel="external">

         The clinician should confirm the diagnosis of corneal abrasions with

         A history of contact lens wear should be specifically ascertained because this information will influence choice of antibiotic.

         Patients with signs of an open globe warrant emergent consultation with an ophthalmologist. (See

         Prompt involvement of an ophthalmologist for patients with hyphema is also typically necessary to perform a comprehensive eye examination, including intraocular pressure measurement, especially in younger children. (See

         The approach to treatment of corneal abrasions is summarized in the algorithm (

          algorithm 1

         ). Treatment options vary based upon the subtype of corneal abrasion. Children with corneal abrasions are treated similarly to adults with some age-specific modifications. (See

         Administration of topical antibiotics and, for large abrasions, cycloplegics have been the mainstay of therapy for decades, along with daily follow-up until the eye is healed. Patching was previously routine but is no longer recommended for most patients. (See
         <a class="local">

         Animal studies suggest that tetanus prophylaxis is warranted for penetrating eye injuries but is
         <strong>
          not

         necessary for corneal abrasions or foreign bodies [

        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who have a corneal abrasion with contaminated material (farm instruments, vegetable matter) are at risk for developing bacterial keratitis; this is the most common cause of bacterial keratitis among rural agricultural laborers in undeveloped countries [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. These patients warrant daily monitoring for corneal infiltrate or ulceration. (See

         If a corneal foreign body is detected, an attempt can be made to remove it by irrigation after the instillation of topical anesthetic. This is particularly helpful in the case of multiple superficial foreign bodies (eg, sand). An attempt can then be made to remove the foreign body with a swab, using direct visualization [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Foreign bodies under the lid should be removed after flipping the lid. If the foreign body cannot be dislodged by irrigation or with a swab, the patient should be treated by an individual trained and supervised in the use of instruments to dislodge foreign bodies off the ocular surface [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. This procedure is performed using magnification (usually a slit lamp, sometimes loupes) and a metal instrument. Topical anesthetic is instilled in the eye. The instrument used can be a 25G needle or a foreign body spud. Appropriate technique, including patient instruction, tangential approach to the cornea, and stabilization of the hand on the zygoma, is required to ensure patient cooperation and to avoid further injury to the cornea.
        </p>
        <p>
         Typically, ophthalmology residents and residents in emergency medicine and in family practice receive formal training in the removal of corneal foreign bodies. Those without formal training should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         approach the globe with sharp instruments; an appropriately trained clinician should be consulted if removal with a swab is unsuccessful [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The foreign body should be removed within 24 hours. The patient should be treated in the meantime with a topical antibiotic ointment (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9418" href="/z/d/drug information/9418.html" rel="external">
          erythromycin
         </a>
         ) four times a day and no patch.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is not possible to clinically distinguish infected from non-infected corneal bodies. In one study, 14 percent of 63 removed foreign bodies (the majority of which were metallic) cultured positive; the major pathogen was coagulase negative Staphylococcus [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Neither the mechanism of injury, the presence of a rust ring, nor the time present in the cornea allowed prediction of the presence or absence of infection. Nevertheless, foreign bodies need not be sent for culture; all patients with foreign body associated abrasions are treated with empiric broad spectrum antibiotics. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Topical antibiotics'
         </a>

         After removal of a foreign body containing iron there is often a residual rust ring and reactive infiltrate. Patients with rust ring should be treated as patients with corneal abrasions. The rust ring itself is not harmful and will usually resorb gradually. If there is failure of the epithelium to heal after two to three days, debridement of rust ring can be considered by clinicians trained in the use of instruments at the slit lamp [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3

         <strong>
          not

         recommended because of potential damage to Bowman’s membrane and resultant scarring.

         ). For adults with low-risk abrasions (eg, not associated with contact lens wearing, not caused by a foreign body, and not located over the central cornea), close observation without prescribing topical antibiotics is a reasonable option. Such patients may still benefit from a topical ophthalmologic lubricant to reduce pain. Use of topic antibiotics for corneal abrasions is primarily based upon clinical experience. Evidence is lacking to indicate whether topical antibiotics prevent infection or shorten the time to healing [
         <a href="#rid5">

          saline
         </a>
         in 94 patients, there was no difference in time to healing based upon symptoms, visual acuity, and corneal defect between treatment and control groups. However, the ability of this trial to detect a true difference was limited because of the small sample size [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. In another observational study of over 350 patients with corneal abrasions who were not treated with topical antibiotics, the rate of infection was &lt;1 percent. It is important to note that patients with corneal injury associated with the use of contact lens, a known risk factor for pseudomonas keratitis, were excluded from the study [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. It is also worth considering that the report arose from a high-resource nation with a temperate climate, and that a very small fraction of patients had trauma likely to involve organic matter [

          Small corneal abrasions
         </strong>
         – Most small abrasions (less than one-fourth of corneal surface area [eg, a round abrasion that is 4 mm across]) will heal overnight if the lid is closed and there is no rubbing or squeezing.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Mild to moderate pain can typically be controlled with oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (eg,

          10,11
         </a>
         ]. Some experts note that topical NSAID solutions are painful to apply and expensive, which limits adherence and efficacy. Long-term use is associated with surface keratopathy and corneal melting. In addition, the trials of topical NSAIDs for corneal abrasions have not always used a measure of pain reduction that may be clinically relevant and a meta-analysis of these trials judged the evidence for their use as weak [

         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. A meta-analysis of three trials (221 patients) found that, compared with placebo, use of a topical anesthetic to treat pain from traumatic corneal abrasions was associated with more eyes without complete resolution of epithelial defects by 24 to 48 hours (21 versus 15 percent, risk ratio 1.37, 95% CI 0.78-2.42); the finding did not achieve statistical significance [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13

         ]. In addition to delayed wound healing, anesthetic overuse in which the patient persists in use of the drops, sometimes surreptitiously, for a painful, non-healing surface can ultimately lead to keratopathy, ulceration, perforation, scarring, or blindness [

         ]. However, definitive outcomes were only known for 120 patients who returned for rechecks. Patients receiving topical tetracaine were more likely to return for emergency department reevaluation and topical tetracaine was prescribed inappropriately, according to the investigator’s a priori definition, in 151 patients, including those with large corneal abrasions, retained rust rings, herpes keratitis, anterior uveitis, and corneal erosions. Thus, high-quality studies are needed to establish the safety of this practice for simple corneal abrasions and avoid overuse or prevent administration to high-risk eye conditions.

         In theory, a pressure patch promotes epithelial proliferation and migration by keeping the lid lowered and stationary over the epithelial defect; a pressure patch is also thought to relieve pain. However, a meta-analysis has shown that, in patients with uncomplicated traumatic or foreign body corneal abrasions, the rate of healing is not improved by a patch (seven trials) and that patching does not decrease pain (ten trials) when compared with not patching [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in one trial of patching versus not patching in 201 patients with uncomplicated traumatic or foreign body-related corneal abrasions, patients with traumatic corneal abrasions (n = 120) healed significantly faster, had less pain, and fewer reports of blurred vision when they were not wearing a patch [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24

         ]. The amount of photophobia, tearing, and foreign body sensation were similar between the patch and no patch groups. In patients with corneal abrasions due to removal of foreign bodies (n = 81), healing also occurred significantly faster and was associated with less pain in those not wearing a patch. There was no difference in the amount of photophobia, tearing, foreign body sensation, or blurred vision.

         If the decision is made to apply a pressure patch for pain control caused by a large corneal abrasion, proper application is critical. A properly applied patch precludes blinking. Improper application may allow the patient to blink under the patch or worse, abrade the cornea further. Patching should

         Infectious pseudomonas keratitis is a fulminant, necrotizing, ulcerative process that can result in corneal melting and perforation within 24 hours. Even if perforation and vision loss on that basis is averted, there is often permanent corneal scarring that requires corneal transplantation. (See

         Patients with recurrent (or spontaneous) corneal erosions are treated the same as patients with traumatic abrasions. However, these individuals are often exquisitely symptomatic to even the smallest epithelial disruption. Our clinical experience is that they do better with frequent application (every one to two hours) of ointment at the first suggestion of symptoms (either an antibiotic such as Ilotycin or over-the-counter lubricant such as Refresh PM or Lacri-Lube), and limited duration of opioid analgesia if needed, rather than patching. Lubricant ointment therapy should be continued at bedtime for months after acute symptoms have resolved as a prophylactic regimen.
        </p>
        <p>
         Recurrent erosions that are particularly large or show no signs of healing in 24 hours should be referred to an ophthalmologist who may debride flaps of epithelium and may choose to use an extended wear contact lens as a bandage [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. Cases that do not respond to these measures can be treated with any of a number of minor surgical procedures including stromal micropuncture, epithelial debridement, polishing of Bowman’s layer, and phototherapeutic keratectomy.

          Management
         </strong>
         – The treatment of corneal abrasions is summarized in the algorithm (

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Management options vary based upon the subtype of corneal abrasion; children with corneal abrasions are treated similarly to adults with some age-specific modifications. Important considerations include recent contact lens wear, the presence of a foreign body, and the size of the abrasion. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Recent contact lens wear
         </strong>
         – Contact lens wearers who present with a corneal epithelial defect should be examined with a penlight or slit lamp to look for a corneal infiltrate (white spot or opacity) or an ulcer (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75303 graphicRef55332" href="/z/d/graphic/75303.html" rel="external">
          picture 2A-B
         </a>
         ), representing a surface breakdown in an area of infiltration. Patients with an infiltrate or ulcer require evaluation by an ophthalmologist
         <strong>

         <strong>
          never
         </strong>
         undergo patching, and they warrant timely referral to an ophthalmologist or optometrist for daily follow-up care. (See

         <strong>
          No contact lens wear
         </strong>
         – For patients with corneal abrasions who don't wear contact lenses, we suggest topical antibiotics to prevent superinfection rather than no treatment (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90920" href="/z/d/graphic/90920.html" rel="external">
          table 3

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). An ointment (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9418" href="/z/d/drug information/9418.html" rel="external">
          erythromycin
         </a>
         ophthalmic ointment) is theoretically better than drops because it functions as a lubricant and may reduce disruption of the remaining and newly generated epithelium. Ointments are preferred to drops in children because they do
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         sting during application. For adults with low-risk abrasions (eg, not associated with contact lens wearing, not caused by a foreign body, and not located over the central cornea), close observation without prescribing topical antibiotics is a reasonable option. Such patients may still benefit from a topical ophthalmologic lubricant to reduce pain. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Topical antibiotics'

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         We recommend that patients with uncomplicated, small, traumatic or foreign body corneal abrasions
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         undergo patching (

          Grade 1A
         </a>
         ). Patching may provide pain control in selected patients with large corneal abrasions. No patch should be left in place for more than 24 hours. (See

          Pain control
         </strong>
         – The approach to pain control for corneal abrasions varies according to the size of the abrasion (see

          Large abrasions

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In a patient with a corneal abrasion, we suggest that clinicians
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         routinely dispense or prescribe topical anesthetics for pain control (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Topical anesthetics may be used to facilitate the initial examination. Overuse (beyond 24 hours) and inappropriate use (eg, for conditions other than simple corneal abrasions) have rare but devastating association with keratopathy, scarring, ulceration, perforation, loss of vision, and loss of the eye.

         <strong>
          Follow-up
         </strong>
         – Most small corneal abrasions heal within 24 to 48 hours. Vision should return to normal in that time, although the presence of ointment on the ocular surface may reduce vision by one or two lines. Follow-up may not be necessary in reliable older children, adolescents, and adults as long as symptoms resolve and anticipatory guidance is provided. (See
