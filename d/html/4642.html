The major subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) include adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma, in decreasing order of frequency of occurrence. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4603.html" rel="external">"Pathology of lung malignancies"</a>.)</p><p>Patients with NSCLC who have disease limited to one lung and not involving the mediastinum or more distant sites have localized stage I or stage II disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805" href="/z/d/graphic/109805.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Stage I plus stage II disease accounts for approximately 30 percent of patients with NSCLC [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In this setting, surgical resection is the primary approach to treatment if there are no contraindications. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is the treatment of choice for those who cannot be safely operated on or refuse surgery.</p><p>The approach to treatment of patients with stage I and stage II disease will be reviewed here. Overviews of other aspects of lung cancer are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4641.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of lung cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4639.html" rel="external">"Overview of the initial treatment and prognosis of lung cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">STAGING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system is used for treatment planning and prognostic purposes in patients with NSCLC. The eighth edition of the TNM staging system  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805" href="/z/d/graphic/109805.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) has now replaced the seventh edition. It is recognized that the studies cited in this topic may have used previous editions of the staging system, which is a limitation of existing data. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4632.html" rel="external">"Overview of the initial evaluation, diagnosis, and staging of patients with suspected lung cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4602.html" rel="external">"Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system for lung cancer"</a>.)</p><p>Clinical staging may underestimate the extent of tumor, and patients are restaged pathologically following surgery. The issue of when to and how to evaluate the mediastinum in patients with clinical stage I or II disease is discussed separately.

For those with clinical stage II disease, we suggest induction chemoimmunotherapy followed by surgery rather than initial surgical resection. Event-free survival benefits have been observed with the addition of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="98764" href="/z/d/drug information/98764.html" rel="external">nivolumab</a> to neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy.

Although the role of surgery has not been validated through randomized trials, the favorable results reported in surgical series and the long-term survival data in these patients have led to surgery being the preferred treatment modality [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4632.html" rel="external">"Overview of the initial evaluation, diagnosis, and staging of patients with suspected lung cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4602.html" rel="external">"Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system for lung cancer"</a>.)</p><p>As with malignancies at other sites [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], mortality associated with surgery is decreased and long-term survival is improved in hospitals performing a high volume of lung cancer resections [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>Adjuvant systemic therapy is discussed elsewhere.

Details are discussed separately.

(See <a class="local">'Limited (sublobar) resection, in select groups'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients with early-stage NSCLC undergoing lobectomy, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS) are alternatives to open thoracotomy [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>Proximal tumors may not be readily resected by lobectomy, thereby requiring a more extensive procedure. In this situation, sleeve resection is preferred over pneumonectomy if possible, based upon equivalent oncologic results, better preservation of pulmonary function, and avoidance of the complications of pneumonectomy [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1457.html" rel="external">"Sequelae and complications of pneumonectomy"</a>.)</p><p>Historically, the data regarding the relative efficacy of limited resection compared with lobectomy are limited, with studies generally demonstrating an association between limited resection and worse local control and survival rates compared with lobectomy [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. The best evidence, albeit still limited, came from the Lung Cancer Study Group trial 801. In this study, 276 patients with peripheral T1N0 (stage IA) NSCLC were randomly assigned during surgery to either lobectomy or a more limited procedure (ie, wedge resection, segmentectomy) after intraoperative assessment of hilar and lobar lymph nodes [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. There was a threefold increase in the rate of local recurrence (5.4 versus 1.9 percent) and a trend toward lower survival rates with limited resection compared with lobectomy. It should be noted that the data from this study are approaching a quarter century, predating positron emission tomography scans for instance, and that this study grouped together the nonanatomic and anatomic sublobar resections. Additionally, the majority of the T1N0 lesions treated on this trial were larger than 2 cm in size.</p><p>However, there may be certain subsets of patients for whom limited resection yields similar results as lobectomy, for example, patients with small, peripheral tumors or older adult patients, particularly those with adenocarcinoma histology.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Limited (sublobar) resection, in select groups</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A sublobar resection consists of the removal of one or more anatomic segments (<strong>segmentectomy</strong>) or, more commonly, of a nonanatomic <strong>wedge resection</strong>. Limited (sublobar) resection may be an option for patients with either small peripheral tumors or those who cannot tolerate a full lobectomy because of severely compromised pulmonary function, advanced age, or other extensive comorbidity. Advances in VATS and robotic surgery have facilitated the utilization of limited resections in selected high-risk patients. (See <a class="local">'Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H765354052"><span class="h3">Small peripheral tumors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Recent evidence suggests at least equivalent and possibly improved survival with sublobar resection versus lobectomy for patients with small-peripheral NSCLC. This approach should be limited to primary tumors ≤2 cm, located in the outer one-third of the lung parenchyma, with lobar nodes that are proven to be noninvolved on frozen section. A thorough nodal dissection with frozen section evaluation of all of the nodes harvested from the hilum up to the segmental tree should confirm the N0 status of the clinical stage I malignancy before committing to segmentectomy or wedge resection, and the presence of N1 involvement should mandate a lobectomy in individuals that have adequate cardiopulmonary reserves. Some small lesions are not amenable to sublobar resections due to their location; lobectomies are usually favored in such a scenario, although extended segmentectomies and bisegmentectomies have been reported.</p><p>In a randomized trial including 1106 patients with clinical stage IA (≤2 cm, consolidation to tumor ratio &gt;0.5) peripheral NSCLC (outer one-third of the lung parenchyma), those assigned to segmentectomy experienced the following outcomes relative to the lobectomy group [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Improved five-year survival rates with segmentectomy relative to the lobectomy group (94.3 versus 91.1 percent; hazard ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.47-0.93).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The difference in survival appears to be related to death from causes other than the originally diagnosed lung cancer or postoperative complications, with 52 deaths in the lobectomy group and 27 deaths in the segmentectomy group attributable to other causes (largely other cancers). The study investigators attributed this difference to more extensive treatment for other lethal diseases in patients who received segmentectomy, as they had greater preservation of lung parenchyma.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Similar five-year relapse-free survival rates (88.0 and 87.9 percent, respectively).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>More locoregional relapses (11 versus 5 percent). This result seemed incongruous with the overall survival benefit with segmentectomy, highlighting that survival differences were likely from other causes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Similar changes in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) at one year.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Similar grade ≥2 postoperative complications.</p><p></p><p>By contrast, in a separate randomized trial in 697 patients with peripheral NSCLC with a tumor of ≤2 cm and pathologically confirmed node-negative disease in the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, sublobar resection (wedge resection or segmentectomy) resulted in a similar overall survival (80 versus 79 percent) as lobar resection [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. In this trial 59 percent of the sublobar resections were wedge resections. Locoregional recurrence rates were not statistically different in between the two groups: 13 percent for the sublobar group, 10 percent for the lobectomy. Five-year disease-free survival was similar (63.6 versus 64.1 percent). A nonclinically meaningful difference in FEV1 and forced vital capacity of 2 percentage points favoring the sublobar resection group was also observed.</p><p>Earlier observational studies have reported equivalent results to both historic and contemporary lobectomy cohorts with segmentectomy compared with lobectomy [<a href="#rid13">13-17</a>]. A 2014 meta-analysis suggests that this equivalence is only seen for lesions ≤2 cm in size [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Several prospective, nonrandomized studies have also reported favorable long-term survival following wedge resection (nonanatomic resection) or segmentectomy among patients with peripheral N0 lung cancers ≤2 cm in size [<a href="#rid16">16,17,19,20</a>], particularly those with adenocarcinoma with lepidic growth histology [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2018968576"><span class="h3">Older or frail adults</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Data are mixed and limited in regards to whether limited resection may yield similar results as lobectomy in older adult patients, and we typically reserve limited resection for those who either cannot tolerate a lobectomy, or those with small, peripheral cancers, as discussed above. (See <a class="local">'Small peripheral tumors'</a> above.)</p><p>An analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database of patients diagnosed with stage I or II NSCLC between 1992 and 1997 suggested similar survival outcomes with lobectomy and limited resection in patients over the age of 71 [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. However, a subsequent SEER study of patients diagnosed with stage IA NSCLC between years 1998 and 2010 suggested worsened survival among patients older than 65 years treated with limited resection versus lobectomy (though equivalent survival outcomes were seen in the subset of these patients with adenocarcinoma histology) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The discrepancy between the results of these retrospective analyses may reflect differences in patients enrolled as well as the time periods during which the studies took place.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>VATS is a minimally invasive approach to the treatment of early-stage NSCLC [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. In high-volume centers with significant VATS experience, VATS lobectomy has been reported to decrease surgical morbidity, including perioperative pain, and seems to be particularly useful for those with significant medical comorbidities.</p><p>The decreased morbidity with VATS may enhance compliance with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. As an example, in a nonrandomized series of 100 consecutive patients who underwent lobectomy, patients managed with VATS had significantly fewer delayed (18 versus 58 percent with open thoracotomy) and reduced (26 versus 49 percent) chemotherapy doses [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4636.html" rel="external">"Systemic therapy in resectable non-small cell lung cancer"</a>.)</p><p>Although the efficacy of VATS compared with conventional surgical techniques has not been definitively established by randomized trials, retrospective data from the National Cancer Database, several large case series from high-volume centers, and a preliminary report of a multi-institutional study support the safety and efficacy of a VATS lobectomy for patients with stage I NSCLC without compromising cancer survival [<a href="#rid3">3,27-31</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15141.html" rel="external">"Overview of minimally invasive thoracic surgery", section on 'Types of pulmonary resection'</a>.)</p><p>More recently, robotic surgery has been used in the treatment of NSCLC. Early-reported experiences suggest an equivalence to VATS as a minimally invasive approach or with traditional open resection.</p><p>Another minimally invasive platform that has gained popularity in Europe and Asia is a uniportal VATS approach, with similar reported results.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H328049"><span class="h2">Mediastinal lymph node dissection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients undergoing mediastinal lymph node evaluation at surgery, the optimal extent of lymph node resection is uncertain. A meta-analysis concluded that systematic mediastinal nodal dissection (levels 4, 7, and 10 for right-sided lesions and levels 5 or 6 and 7 for left-sided lesions  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73945" href="/z/d/graphic/73945.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>)) was associated with a small to moderate improvement in survival compared with lymph node sampling alone [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. The improved results may reflect the improved accuracy of staging [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p>In 2006, the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons guidelines recommended systematic lymph node dissection in all cases to ensure complete resection.

In contrast to locally advanced (stage III) and disseminated (stage IV) disease, early-stage disease is frequently curable with aggressive therapy.

The issue of when to and how to evaluate the mediastinum in patients with clinical stage I or II disease is discussed separately.

While surgery is considered standard treatment for operative candidates, particularly given its role both in staging and as therapy, there is growing evidence supporting SBRT as an alternative in selected stage I patients. (See <a class="local">'Surgical candidates'</a> above and <a class="local">'Stereotactic body radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For those with clinical stage II disease, we suggest induction chemoimmunotherapy followed by surgery rather than initial surgical resection or radiation (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>).

This assumes the procedure is technically feasible and that the lobar nodes are proven noninvolved on frozen section. For other patients undergoing surgery, we suggest lobectomy rather than a more limited procedure (ie, wedge resection or segmentectomy) if the patient has an adequate pulmonary reserve (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). More limited procedures may be preferred over lobectomy in situations where additional resections may be envisioned (eg, multiple ground glass opacities of which only one meets criteria for resection). Pneumonectomy or sleeve resection is required for proximal tumors that cannot be resected by lobectomy.
