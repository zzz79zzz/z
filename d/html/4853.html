The psychiatric complications generally take the form of adjustment disorder, unipolar depression, anxiety, diminished quality of life, or loss of self-esteem. The patients most at risk for depression and other psychiatric illness have advanced disease, a prior psychiatric history, poorly controlled pain, and other life stressors or losses.</p><p>In addition to these psychiatric conditions, nonspecific distress and anxiety are very common in cancer patients. Distress is the summation of multiple psychological, social, and spiritual factors. If severe enough, distress can interfere with the patient's ability to deal effectively with the illness, its symptoms, and the complications of treatment.</p><p>Specific issues regarding the management of psychiatric illness in patients with cancer are reviewed here. The diagnosis of these disorders is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4858.html" rel="external">"Patients with cancer: Overview of the clinical features and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ADJUSTMENT DISORDER</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The identification and diagnosis of adjustment disorder is not straightforward but is important since many of these patients will benefit from counseling. Physicians attempting to identify individuals who could benefit from counseling should focus upon a lack of patient flexibility [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Those who develop adjustment disorder may be more rigid in their thinking and determined to address their cancer-related problems in the same manner as they have for prior stressors. If the old coping and problem-solving strategies fail, the person may begin to exhibit depressed mood and anxiety associated with adjustment disorder. In contrast, patients who successfully adapt typically have a flexible style [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>People with adjustment disorder have positive outcomes when they are treated with brief psychotherapy [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Early treatment using counselors, nurses, and other staff is helpful before the problem expands to the point of requiring more intensive care.</p><p>Psychotherapy for adjustment disorder addresses cancer-related stressors directly by teaching enhanced coping skills, focusing upon immediate problems in living caused by the disease. Establishing social support networks and psychoeducation are also important [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Informal support groups and more formal group therapy are highly effective for improving quality of life and decreasing depression and anxiety symptoms [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">DEPRESSION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The sections below discuss management and treatment of depression in patients with cancer. Treatment of major depression in the general population is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1725.html" rel="external">"Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14685.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Choosing treatment for resistant depression"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H346950"><span class="h2">Prevention</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pharmacotherapy can prevent onset of depression in patients with cancer. A 16-week randomized trial compared <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9046" href="/z/d/drug information/9046.html" rel="external">escitalopram</a> (10 or 20 mg per day) with placebo in 125 patients who were about to commence treatment for newly diagnosed or recurrent stage II to IV epidermoid cancer of the head and neck, and were not receiving treatment for depression or anxiety, and did not meet criteria for major depression [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. The incidence of depression (scores on the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fids-qids.org%2F&amp;token=7rZ%2ByZ3Fpyv%2BJAjscd0DBolxbHsxnR7MZYOxhdb7Gjk%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=4853" target="_blank">Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Rated</a> ≥11) was less in patients treated with active drug (10 versus 25 percent). However, there was a trend for a greater rate of dropout due to adverse effects of study medication in patients who received escitalopram. Although it is reasonable to prophylactically prescribe antidepressants for some patients (eg, those with a prior history of depression), we generally monitor patients instead, based upon our judgement that additional studies are needed to confirm the results.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8601851"><span class="h2">Collaborative care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Outpatients with cancer and mild to moderate unipolar major depression can benefit when treatment of depression occurs within the context of collaborative care (also called integrated care). Collaborative care involves treating patients with a team that usually includes a primary care clinician who prescribes antidepressants; a case manager, such as a nurse, who helps facilitate and implement treatment (which may include psychotherapy), as well as monitor treatment (using measurement-based care); and a mental health specialist, such as a psychiatrist, who provides consultation and supervision.</p><p>Evidence supporting the use of collaborative care for treating unipolar major depression in outpatients with cancer includes multiple randomized trials. As an example, a meta-analysis of five open-label randomized trials compared usual care plus collaborative care with usual care alone for treatment of depressive syndromes in patients with cancer (mixed type and stage; n &gt;1700) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Collaborative care interventions lasted 3 to 12 months and included antidepressants and psychotherapy (eg, problem solving therapy). The trials found that 12 months after treatment was initiated, improvement was greater among patients who received collaborative care, and the clinical benefit was moderate. However, heterogeneity across studies was substantial and involvement of primary care clinicians was minimal, with the care model more similar to “multidisciplinary care” [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>Additional information about collaborative care is discussed in the context of treating adult depression in the primary care setting. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90154.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adult primary care patients and general medical illness: Evidence for the efficacy of initial treatments", section on 'Collaborative care'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Pharmacotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pharmacologic interventions are the mainstay of management for patients with moderate to severe levels of depression; antidepressants are safe and potentially effective in this setting. These drugs can alleviate depressive affect, emotional lability, irritability, and social withdrawal [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Medication also may help increase an individual's ability to participate in rehabilitation services and improve overall functioning.</p><p>Patients with early-stage cancer are similar to the typical patient who needs an antidepressant; patients with cancer can be safely and effectively treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other classes of antidepressants, using similar dose titrations as the physically healthy population. In patients with more advanced disease and increased levels of physical distress, the pharmacologic management is more complex and challenging. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1725.html" rel="external">"Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment"</a>.)</p><p>Evidence supporting the use of antidepressants for depression in patients with cancer is minimal at best. Relatively few randomized trials have been conducted, and the patients were heterogenous for type of depressive syndrome, type and stage of cancer, and cancer treatment. One review concluded that antidepressants are relatively safe and effective for more severe episodes of unipolar major depression [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. By contrast, investigators who conducted a meta-analysis of seven trials that compared antidepressants with placebo (n = 511 patients), and found a clinically moderate effect for active treatment, were nevertheless more circumspect about the benefit because of the poor quality of the trials [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Antidepressant selection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Selection of an antidepressant depends upon a number of factors.

A better choice for patients with fatigue or psychomotor slowing would be compounds with the least sedating effects (eg, SSRIs, stimulants).</p><p>Several coexisting medical problems may influence antidepressant selection.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In addition to its antidepressant action, the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8484" href="/z/d/drug information/8484.html" rel="external">duloxetine</a> can be efficacious for neuropathic pain in cancer patients [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. The TCAs also have analgesic properties and may potentiate the effects of opioid analgesics. Thus, patients who are experiencing pain, particularly neuropathic pain, may benefit from these agents alone or in combination with other drugs. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2815.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management: Role of adjuvant analgesics (coanalgesics)", section on 'Antidepressants'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Despite evidence that <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10042" href="/z/d/drug information/10042.html" rel="external">venlafaxine</a> may have analgesic effects in non-cancer patients, one study suggests it is inferior to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8484" href="/z/d/drug information/8484.html" rel="external">duloxetine</a> for chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with cardiovascular disease and older patients should take drugs that cause the least orthostatic hypotension (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8465" href="/z/d/drug information/8465.html" rel="external">fluoxetine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9886" href="/z/d/drug information/9886.html" rel="external">sertraline</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with slow intestinal motility or urinary retention, or with stomatitis secondary to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, should receive medications with the least anticholinergic effects (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients at risk for seizures or who may have a lower seizure threshold because of other medications are more safely treated with agents that will not exacerbate the problem (eg, neuroleptics).

As an example, sedation may be useful to the agitated patient who is anxious and cannot sleep, while the side effect of activation may be useful to the hypersomnolent, withdrawn patient with lethargy. In addition, some antidepressants stimulate appetite, a useful effect when appetite is decreased.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>SSRIs have become the most widely used antidepressants  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53818" href="/z/d/graphic/53818.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Their efficacy and side effect profiles in particular make them attractive agents for some patients with cancer. One study found that both <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8465" href="/z/d/drug information/8465.html" rel="external">fluoxetine</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9329" href="/z/d/drug information/9329.html" rel="external">desipramine</a> led to improvements in depression, anxiety, and overall quality of life in depressed women with advanced cancer, and were well tolerated [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. A larger double-blind study suggested that fluoxetine (20 mg daily) was superior to placebo in improving depression and overall quality of life in outpatients with advanced cancer [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p>SSRIs cause fewer problems with cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, and anticholinergic effects than the TCAs  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62488" href="/z/d/graphic/62488.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In addition, the SSRIs generally have less sedative, autonomic, and anticholinergic effects.</p><p>The SSRIs may increase blood levels of other drugs by dislodging them from blood proteins. They also inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Thus, blood levels of any medications that are metabolized by the P450 system may be increased. This is an important consideration in the cancer population since many of these patients are on <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9269" href="/z/d/drug information/9269.html" rel="external">cisapride</a>, two medications that are substrates for the P450 system.</p><p>Additional information about the pharmacology, administration, and side effects of SSRIs is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14675.html" rel="external">"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3999130259"><span class="h3">Tricyclic antidepressants</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>TCAs have been used frequently in the cancer setting  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53818" href="/z/d/graphic/53818.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). We typically begin TCAs at a low dose (10 to 25 mg at bedtime) and increased slowly by 10 to 25 mg increments every one to two days until a beneficial effect is achieved. This slow titration is especially important for debilitated patients with advanced disease. Patients with cancer may exhibit a therapeutic response to the TCAs at lower doses than physically healthy individuals [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Serial plasma drug levels can be utilized to monitor the effective and safe administration of the drugs, minimizing the risk of side effects or toxicity [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. A cardiac history and electrocardiogram should be obtained prior to prescribing TCAs since these drugs can have an adverse effect on cardiac rhythm [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p>The tertiary amines (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8554" href="/z/d/drug information/8554.html" rel="external">imipramine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8605" href="/z/d/drug information/8605.html" rel="external">amitriptyline</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9390" href="/z/d/drug information/9390.html" rel="external">doxepin</a>) tend to sedate patients, stimulate appetite, and cause anticholinergic side effects (eg, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, nausea, urinary retention, and tachycardia). Their metabolites, the secondary amines (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9329" href="/z/d/drug information/9329.html" rel="external">desipramine</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9711" href="/z/d/drug information/9711.html" rel="external">nortriptyline</a>) are less sedating and less anticholinergic. Many times, patients can tolerate secondary amines in higher doses, allowing for greater therapeutic benefit.</p><p>Additional information about the pharmacology, administration, and side effects of tricyclics is discussed separately.

It is very useful in depressed patients with psychomotor retardation and can be used in a wide variety of patients with few side effects. The drug is thought to act through the dopamine pathways, but its precise mechanism of action is not known. The immediate release formulation should be avoided in patients who have conditions (eg, CNS disease) that predispose them to seizures, and slow release formulations can be used with caution [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].

Psychosocial interventions are used to help individuals, families, and groups. The general objective of this therapy is to improve coping skills through educational, behavioral, or psychodynamic approaches.</p><p>The benefits of psychotherapy in patients with advanced, incurable cancer were addressed in a Cochrane review [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. In six trials (292 patients in the psychotherapy arm, and 225 in the control arm), psychotherapy was associated with a significant decrease in depression compared to usual care. Two more reviews of psychosocial interventions in patients with head and neck (21 studies) [<a href="#rid36">36</a>] and breast cancer (42 studies) [<a href="#rid37">37</a>] document efficacy in reducing symptoms of depression. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) showed the greatest effects in the head and neck cancer patients, while yoga and mindfulness-based therapies showed the greatest effects in the breast cancer patients. Another review of mindfulness-based psychotherapies (29 randomized trials with 3274 subjects) documented beneficial but small effects on depression, as well as anxiety, fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbances [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Crisis intervention</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinicians working in oncology rely primarily upon short-term supportive psychotherapy based on a crisis intervention model to help patients with depressive symptomatology. Crisis intervention is a process of actively influencing psychosocial functioning during a period of disequilibrium. It is directed at alleviating the immediate impact of disruptive stressful events. The aim is to reduce emotional distress while working toward strengthening the patient's psychological and social resources. Crisis therapy is generally time limited and asserts clear-cut goals [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].</p><p>Supportive/crisis intervention psychotherapy involves clarifying information and answering questions about the illness and its treatment, correcting misunderstanding, and giving reassurance about the situation. Describing common reactions to illness may help the patient and family to normalize their experience. The patients' usual adaptive strategies should be explored, and strengths supported as needed in adjustment. Patients are encouraged to discuss how they feel about their lifestyle modifications, family role changes, and fears of dependency and abandonment. Themes of loss and anticipatory grief are also explored. Patients often experience loss of good health, body integrity, and self-esteem, along with losses secondary to cancer (eg, financial, social, and occupational). Therapy seeks to improve a sense of control and morale. When the focus of treatment changes from cure to palliation, it is important for patients to know that they will not be abandoned and that their comfort, pain control, and dignity will receive continued attention.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h3">Cognitive-behavioral therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cognitive-behavioral techniques are often integrated into depression therapy and are very useful and effective. These approaches explore patients' beliefs about the cancer diagnosis and its treatment in order to elicit irrational or unhelpful thoughts that lead to feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. Therapy then leads to the correction of these maladaptive thoughts along with providing new coping skills (eg, relaxation). Both group and individual treatment are effective for reducing depressive symptoms and distress and improving quality of life [<a href="#rid40">40-42</a>].</p><p>The efficacy of CBT may depend upon the patient’s cancer status. A 12-week randomized trial in 392 breast cancer survivors with depressive symptoms found that improvement of depression (and anxiety) was greater with CBT than either supportive care or usual care [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. By contrast, a 16-week randomized trial in 230 patients with advanced (incurable) cancer and depressive syndromes compared usual care plus CBT with usual care alone, and found that improvement of depression was comparable in the two groups [<a href="#rid44">44</a>].</p><p>Cognitive-behavioral interventions help patients allay exaggerated fears by encouraging them to consider different possible outcomes for their situation. Helping the patient focus upon aspects of the disease and its treatment that they have control over and encouraging behavior modification that will keep them involved and positive could provide a better quality of life.</p><p>In addition, the benefits of cognitive-behavioral interventions appear to persist for years. As an example, a study examined patients who received surgery for early-stage breast cancer (n = 100) and participated in a randomized trial that compared cognitive-behavioral stress management (10 weeks of group therapy) with a psychoeducational seminar control condition (one day) [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. Assessments several years (median 11 years) after treatment found that there were fewer depressive symptoms in the group that received active treatment, and the clinical difference was medium to large.</p><p>A randomized trial in 245 patients with cancer and psychological distress (symptoms of depression and anxiety) found that improvement of psychological distress was greater with mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, administered either face-to-face or digitally, than usual care [<a href="#rid46">46</a>].</p><p>Two randomized trials indicate that CBT delivered via the internet for cancer survivors can reduce both depressive and anxiety symptoms [<a href="#rid47">47,48</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1233273973"><span class="h3">Problem-solving therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Problem-solving therapy (PST) is a behavioral treatment that can be efficacious for depressive syndromes in the general population.

The onset of anxiolytic action is delayed in comparison with the benzodiazepines, taking 5 to 10 days for relief of anxiety to begin. Buspirone is not a benzodiazepine; thus, it will not block benzodiazepine withdrawal, and caution must be used when switching from a benzodiazepine to this drug.

As in the treatment of depression, the therapist should emphasize past strengths and support previously successful ways of coping. This helps the patient mobilize inner resources, modify plans for the future, and perhaps even accept the inevitability of death.</p><p>Relaxation, guided imagery, and hypnosis may help reduce anxiety and thereby increase the patient's sense of control. Most patients with cancer, even those with advanced disease, are candidates for behavioral techniques despite physical debilitation. In assessing the utility of such interventions for a given patient, the clinician should take into account the patient's mental clarity. Confusional states interfere dramatically with the ability to focus attention and thereby limit the usefulness of these techniques, although occasionally they can be modified to include the mildly cognitively impaired [<a href="#rid73">73</a>].

Alprazolam was more effective for greater levels of distress or anxiety and had a more rapid onset of beneficial effect. Relaxation techniques can be used in combination with anxiolytic medications for highly anxious patients.</p><p>It is not clear if stress management training relieves psychological distress during cancer treatment, due to conflicting results across studies [<a href="#rid75">75,76</a>]. In a trial of patients (n = 382) about to begin chemotherapy, clinician-administered stress management training was not effective compared to usual care, whereas self-administered training was found to be beneficial [<a href="#rid75">75</a>]. In a trial in 160 colorectal cancer patients posttumor resection, cognitive-behavioral stress management (two-hour sessions for 10 weeks) improved, anxiety, depression and quality of life [<a href="#rid77">77</a>]. By contrast, a previous trial of patients (n = 310) receiving radiation therapy found that self-administered training did not relieve psychological distress compared to usual care, except in those cases with the highest levels of initial psychosocial distress [<a href="#rid76">76</a>].</p><p>An eight-week randomized trial in 70 patients with cancer (primarily early stage) found that improvement of anxiety was greater with yoga and meditation than a waiting list control condition [<a href="#rid78">78</a>].</p><p>For cancer patients, adjunctive creative arts therapies (eg, art, dance, music, and writing) appear to modestly relieve anxiety symptoms during treatment, but the benefit dissipates during follow-up. A meta-analysis of 25 randomized trials compared creative arts therapies with a control condition (no treatment, waiting list, or usual care) as add-on treatment in 1413 patients with cancer (primarily breast or blood) [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. There was a significant but clinically small benefit favoring the active intervention. However, an analysis of posttreatment follow-up effects (5 trials, 246 patients) found that anxiety symptoms were comparable in both groups.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3480565259"><span class="h1">INSOMNIA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help patients with cancer who have insomnia. A meta-analysis of eight randomized trials compared CBT with control conditions (eg, wait list control, usual care, or sleep education) in 752 cancer survivors with insomnia [<a href="#rid79">79</a>]. Self-reported sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, and insomnia severity each improved more with CBT, and the clinical effects favoring CBT ranged from small to large.</p><p>Additional information about CBT in the general population of patients with insomnia is discussed separately.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4823.html" rel="external">"Delirium and acute confusional states: Prevention, treatment, and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p>Measures to help reduce anxiety and disorientation include a quiet, well-lit room with familiar objects, a visible clock or calendar, and the presence of family. Judicious use of physical restraints, along with one-to-one nursing observation may be necessary. When supportive techniques alone are not effective, symptomatic treatment with neuroleptic or sedative medications are necessary. Sedation may be required to relieve severe agitation or insomnia [<a href="#rid80">80</a>].</p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8516" href="/z/d/drug information/8516.html" rel="external">Haloperidol</a> is the drug of choice for treatment of delirium in the medically ill [<a href="#rid80">80-82</a>]. Low doses (1 to 3 mg) are usually effective for agitation, paranoia, and fear. Typically 0.5 mg to 1 mg haloperidol (oral, intravenous, or intramuscular) is administered, with repeat doses every 45 to 60 minutes titrated against symptoms [<a href="#rid73">73,83</a>].
