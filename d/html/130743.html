         Testing for clinical care should be performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory. If the results are used in clinical decision-making and the original testing was not from a CLIA-certified laboratory, it should be repeated. This applies to positive results and negative results in an individual considered to be at risk.

         <em>

         was identified as the disease gene for MFS in the early 1990s. Subsequently, hundreds of pathogenic variants in
         <em>
          FBN1
         </em>
         have been reported in individuals with MFS [
         <a href="#rid2">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Approximately three-fourths of individuals with MFS have an affected parent who shares the same
         <em>
          FBN1
         </em>
         variant; the remaining one-fourth have a de novo mutation and a negative family history. Transmission is autosomal dominant. Sometimes clinical features differ between family members due to age-dependent manifestations, intrafamilial variable expressivity, or mosaicism. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical findings'

        <p>
         <em>
          FBN1
         </em>
         variants are numerous and scattered throughout the gene. Genetic testing requires next-generation sequencing that includes all coding exons and intron-exon boundaries, either alone or as part of a multigene panel. Genetic testing should include both sequencing and deletion/duplication analysis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17039.html" rel="external">
          "Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications", section on 'Whole genome, exome, or gene panel'

         Most
         <em>

         variants lack genotype-phenotype correlations. Rare exceptions include:

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Variants clustered between exons 24 and 32 can cause an early-onset, severe and rapidly progressive presentation of MFS; however, the severity of manifestations is a continuum, and not all variants in this region cause severe disease.

         A comprehensive clinical evaluation and application of the clinical diagnostic criteria for MFS can often aid in the interpretation of a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in
         <em>
          FBN1
         </em>
         . The situation can remain ambiguous in individuals with mild clinical presentations that do not include some of the most specific features of MFS such as ectopia lentis or the characteristic combination of skeletal findings.

         The finding of a pathogenic variant in
         <em>
          FBN1
         </em>
         does not establish the diagnosis of MFS; pathogenic variants in
         <em>
          FBN1
         </em>
         can also cause other connective tissue disorders or skeletal dysplasias, including stiff skin syndrome, Weill-Marchesani syndrome, geleophysic dysplasia, and acromelic dysplasia. While the pathogenic variants in
         <em>
          FBN1
         </em>
         that cause phenotypes distinct from MFS are known to cluster in specific domains of fibrillin-1, pathogenic variants in the same domains can be associated with classic MFS. Therefore, the nature and location of a pathogenic variant in
         <em>
          FBN1
         </em>
         are not fully predictive of the phenotypic consequences. (See

         Approximately 5 to 10 percent of individuals who meet clinical criteria for MFS lack an identifiable pathogenic variant
         <em>
          in FBN1

         . Some of these individuals ha
         <em>
          ve FBN1

         variants that are more challenging to detect by conventional testing technologies, such as a deep intronic variant that activates a cryptic splice site. Some may have other syndromes that overlap with MFS associated with other genes. (See

         MFS is likely underdiagnosed. The classic syndrome is seen in approximately 1 in 5000 to 10,000 individuals, which may underestimate the true prevalence [

         An
         <em>
          FBN1
         </em>
         variant that is formally classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic is sufficient for diagnosing MFS in most circumstances. There is a specific additional requirement for a minimal set of clinical findings in the proband, a positive family history of MFS, or prior association of the specific variant with MFS that includes aortic root enlargement and/or dissection [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. Such factors are often integrated into allele classification by the laboratory, but this should be documented in the test report. (See
         <a class="local">
          'How to read the report'

         Documentation of a pathogenic variant in
         <em>
          FBN1

         Critically, lack of identification of a pathogenic variant in
         <em>
          FBN1
         </em>
         (or any genes on a multigene panel) does not exclude risk in someone with a personal or family history of aortic root aneurysm, vascular disease, or other connective tissue findings. A negative result should only be used to discontinue clinical follow-up in a given individual if a definitive variant that has been documented in affected relatives has been excluded and the individual under consideration does not have physical or laboratory findings that independently warrant ongoing observation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Involvement of a genetics professional or expert in MFS and related syndromes is appropriate in any individual (child or adult of any age) in whom these disorders are suspected, as well as in anyone with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in
         <em>
          FBN1
         </em>
         or other systemic connective tissue disorder gene, even if symptoms are absent. A delay in diagnosis can be potentially life-threatening due to the risk of aortic rupture. (See

         – Overgrowth of long bones can cause taller than expected stature, kyphoscoliosis, and arachnodactyly. Elongation of the ribs can push the sternum anteriorly (pectus carinatum) or posteriorly (pectus excavatum). A high-arched palate can lead to crowding of the teeth.

         People with MFS and related connective tissue disorders such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome or vascular Ehlers-Danlers syndrome can have potentially life-threatening complications related to aortic dissection or aortic rupture. Complications can occur in children and adults. Branch arteries can also be involved and can be associated with life-threatening complications.
        </p>
        <p>
         Appropriate management by a geneticist and/or cardiologist with expertise in these syndromes is essential. Often a multidisciplinary team is involved. Resources for locating an expert are listed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Resources'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The expert or multidisciplinary team will discuss risks and risk reduction [

         – Risks include aortic dissection and rupture. Considerations include the appropriate surveillance strategy, role of medical therapies such as beta blockers or angiotensin receptor blockers, avoidance of certain medications such as fluoroquinolones and calcium channel blockers, and indications for preventive interventions including surgery. Heart valve dysfunction and heart failure can also occur in people with MFS. (See

         <strong>
          Sports and activities
         </strong>
         – The major risk is thought to be associated with activities that increase blood pressure, leading to aortic wall stress. Individuals are advised to avoid weightlifting and other activities that require Valsalva maneuvers, exercising to exhaustion, and contact sports leading to sharp blows to the head or chest or sudden acceleration or deceleration. Patient (and family/caregiver) education and shared decision-making is important to make activity plans that allow for social engagement and good cardiovascular health while avoiding both inactivity and activities that could increase risk of vascular catastrophe.

          Pregnancy

         Pre- or post-conception genetic testing and counseling are appropriate for prospective parents with MFS.

         At-risk children should generally be tested as soon as possible. Certain exceptions may apply, such as in kindreds without significant aortic abnormalities during childhood.
