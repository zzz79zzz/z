Intrauterine device (IUD) insertion and removal are usually relatively simple procedures that can be performed in the office setting by trained providers. The technical skills required for device insertion and removal can be obtained through proctored hands-on training in the clinical setting and/or may be provided by the manufacturers of these devices. This review is not intended as a substitute for hands-on clinical training.</p><p>This topic will address technical issues regarding the insertion and removal procedures for the copper-releasing and progestin-containing IUDs. Other aspects of intrauterine contraception, including detailed review of candidates, device selection, and management of complications, as well as selection of contraception in general and specifically postpartum, are reviewed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5419.html" rel="external">"Intrauterine contraception: Candidates and device selection"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5422.html" rel="external">"Intrauterine contraception: Management of side effects and complications"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5459.html" rel="external">"Contraception: Counseling and selection"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6708.html" rel="external">"Contraception: Postpartum counseling and methods"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the terms "woman/en" or "patient(s)" as they are used in the studies presented.

Most patients, including those who are nulliparous, adolescent, immediately postpartum or postabortion, have acute or chronic medical conditions, and/or desire emergency contraception are candidates for an IUD [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides comprehensive evidence-based guidelines regarding safety of various contraceptive methods in patients with specific characteristics or medical conditions (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Freproductivehealth%2Fcontraception%2Fpdf%2Fsummary-chart-us-medical-eligibility-criteria_508tagged.pdf&amp;token=p7A56cdQa48oh8HfN4dMPEKlrim7QFIQY%2FuVV%2FJckGU937u1ckJkmkgaK8H2PBoY%2FJ5BEapx7DHdp5gqM%2BK1cZFvupA973jfwqlDuJ3YBVeBCZhIb4QeOsKswDD%2B1dvSISE9r%2BIvb9WDleMu0Qs%2FMQ%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=3267" target="_blank">United States Medical Eligibility Criteria (USMEC) for Contraceptive Use</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Further information about IUD candidacy and contraindications as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the various types of devices are discussed in detail separately.

We find the website <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bedsider.org%2F&amp;token=h7Ird6MEQJ0ciS3wlIS74wS%2BbqJQEspyaSo36FRNdkGJJnrJaPDlUEGuXmILPu5F&amp;TOPIC_ID=3267" target="_blank">bedsider.org</a> to be a noncommercial, patient-friendly, and accurate source of information for patients that reviews the benefits and risks of all contraceptive methods and compares IUDs with all other birth control options. Further information about contraceptive counseling and specific IUD devices are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5459.html" rel="external">"Contraception: Counseling and selection"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5419.html" rel="external">"Intrauterine contraception: Candidates and device selection"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Timing of insertion and pregnancy testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An IUD may be inserted at any time during the menstrual cycle if pregnancy can be reasonably excluded by the presence of any of the criteria in the following table (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67567" href="/z/d/graphic/67567.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Timing IUD insertion with menses ensures that the patient is not pregnant, but does not reduce pain or improve patient outcomes. A 2013 systematic review concluded that the timing of copper 380 mm<sup>2</sup> insertion with regard to menses has little effect on insertional pain or short or long term expulsion rates (one study reported reduced pain with menstrual insertion, one reported increased pain, and two reported no difference) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Moreover, delays in scheduling IUD insertion to coincide with menses may increase patient risk of unplanned pregnancy. Thus, we do not recommend routinely waiting to schedule IUD insertion to coincide with menses.</p><p>Given the risks associated with IUD insertion in a setting of concomitant intrauterine pregnancy, documentation of a negative pregnancy test prior to IUD insertion is advised for most patients, but particularly for those with lactational amenorrhea or other conditions that lead to irregular intervals between menses (unclear timing of ovulation) or questionable compliance with contraception. To increase reliability, the pregnancy test should be obtained two or more weeks after her last episode of unprotected intercourse. Clinics that offer IUD insertions should have a protocol that includes counseling, screening (including exclusion of pregnancy), and insertion of the IUD in one visit [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Single-visit insertion results in more IUD placements than when two visits are required.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18272372"><span class="h2">Patients switching from another method</span></p><p>For patients who are using a different contraceptive method and wish to initiate an IUD, the copper 380 mm<sup>2</sup> IUD and 52 mg <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="104541" href="/z/d/drug information/104541.html" rel="external">LNG IUDs</a> are effective immediately upon insertion. Thus, patients who choose this method do not require any back-up contraception regardless of prior method of contraception. </p><p>However, it is not known if the 13.5 mg and 19.5 mg <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="104541" href="/z/d/drug information/104541.html" rel="external">LNG IUDs</a> provide immediate contraception and we advise patients use back-up contraception or practice abstinence for seven days after IUD insertion unless the patient:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Has a sure and reliable last menstrual period less than five days ago</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Received injectable contraception less than 14 weeks ago</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is exchanging a hormonal IUD and has a therapeutically active <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="104541" href="/z/d/drug information/104541.html" rel="external">levonorgestrel IUD</a> removed at the time of new hormonal IUD insertion</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Sexually transmitted infections</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can be asymptomatic, we counsel all patients about STI risk and offer voluntary screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia to all Individuals presenting for IUD insertion regardless of risk factors. Additionally, we routinely recommend screening based on the CDC <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fstd%2Ftreatment-guidelines%2Fdefault.htm&amp;token=GG%2FgjfxydbWPRfxXxvkuO3Z7rCvPfYCbHpI0XhRbEzgb1PiLFQLuos1hzlgAVwGZBa1nyF6yQEYtZyuOXda5Pg%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=3267" target="_blank">STD &amp; HIV Screening Recommendations</a> [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Since age is the strongest risk factor for STI incidence [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>], we encourage gonorrhea and chlamydia screening at the time of IUD placement for all patients age 25 and younger. It is important to emphasize that for all patients without symptoms, screening can be performed at the time of IUD insertion, and insertion should not be delayed for test results [<a href="#rid2">2,11</a>].</p><p>If gonorrheal or chlamydia testing obtained at time of IUD placement subsequently returns positive, the infection should be treated per the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fstd%2Ftreatment-guidelines%2Fdefault.htm&amp;token=GG%2FgjfxydbWPRfxXxvkuO3Z7rCvPfYCbHpI0XhRbEzgb1PiLFQLuos1hzlgAVwGZBa1nyF6yQEYtZyuOXda5Pg%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=3267" target="_blank">CDC Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines</a>, and the IUD can be left in situ [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5422.html" rel="external">"Intrauterine contraception: Management of side effects and complications"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7579.html" rel="external">"Treatment of <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> infection"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15892.html" rel="external">"Treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea (<i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae </i>infection) in adults and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p>Contraindications to IUD insertion related to infection include (1) active, diagnosed gonorrheal or chlamydia cervicitis (regardless of symptomatology); (2) symptoms suggestive of active gonorrheal or chlamydia cervicitis, such as cervical tenderness or mucopurulent cervical discharge; and (3) patients with known or suspected upper genital tract infection, such as pelvic inflammatory disease or tubo-ovarian abscess [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. For these individuals, IUD insertion should be delayed until the patient has (1) completed diagnostic work-up and her full treatment course, (2) her symptoms have resolved completely, and (3) her cervical and pelvic physical examinations are normal. Optimal timing for IUD insertion after completion of treatment for cervicitis or an upper genital tract infection is unknown. Sexual partners should also complete treatment according to standard guidelines [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. If the patient remains at risk of reinfection, a reassessment of IUD eligibility and a negative test for gonorrhea and/or chlamydia, usually done three to four weeks after treatment, should be confirmed prior to placing an IUD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5422.html" rel="external">"Intrauterine contraception: Management of side effects and complications"</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to gonorrhea and chlamydia, no large studies have evaluated the outcome of IUD insertion in the presence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) or trichomoniasis. In one small prospective study, five subjects with documented BV had an IUD inserted without complications [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. A larger prospective study found that subjects with BV at the time of IUD insertion were more likely to have dysmenorrhea, but not other complications, at their six-month follow-up [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. If a vaginal discharge suspicious of infection is seen, the device manufacturers recommend diagnostic testing and treatment of infection, but there is no evidence to support routine screening for BV in asymptomatic patients or to delay IUD insertion during diagnostic work-up for BV. The CDC specifically states that for patients with vaginitis, including BV and trichomoniasis, the advantages of IUD insertion typically outweigh theoretical or proven risks [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Antibiotic prophylaxis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Antibiotic prophylaxis for the placement of an IUD is not recommended [<a href="#rid3">3,15-19</a>], even for individuals with valvular heart disease [<a href="#rid16">16,20</a>]. The use of routine prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of IUD complications has been investigated in four large randomized trials. A meta-analysis of these trials found that prophylactic antibiotics (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9393" href="/z/d/drug information/9393.html" rel="external">doxycycline</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9041" href="/z/d/drug information/9041.html" rel="external">azithromycin</a>) decreased the frequency of unscheduled visits post-IUD insertion (odds ratio [OR] 0.82, 95% CI 0.70-0.98), but there was no significant decrease in occurrence of pelvic inflammatory disease (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53-1.51) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>There is also no evidence to support antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent endocarditis. In one study, there was a 0 percent incidence of bacteremia following IUD insertion [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. The American Heart Association does not include IUD insertion as an indication for endocarditis prophylaxis [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1890302906"><span class="h2">Analgesia</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4240026532"><span class="h3">Approach to analgesia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In our practice, pain management is a shared decision-making process that includes preprocedure counseling, support during the procedure, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and, for some patients, a paracervical block.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assess patients concerns for pain</strong> – Preprocedural planning should consider a patient's general tolerance for office procedures. An individual's perception of pain is influenced by their prior experiences and personal history, anxiety, anticipated level of pain, and relationship with the clinician. Risk factors for increased pain scores with gynecologic procedures include nulliparity, postmenopausal status, history of dysmenorrhea, anxiety, or high anticipated pain levels [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. While most patients tolerate the IUD insertion process well with standard comfort measures, a small minority of patients (such as those with a history of trauma, developmental delay, or significant anxiety or pain disorders) may require placement with sedation. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient support during the procedure</strong> – During the procedure, we inform the patient about what is happening, what they should be feeling, and what is going to happen next. We also tell the patient when they should expect no sensation and can rest and recover, such as during glove changes or preparation of the IUD applicator. We also emphasize that they retain bodily autonomy and are in complete control and can ask to pause or terminate the procedure at any time. We find that providing distraction, such as asking about life outside of the examination room, or positive suggestion can be helpful. Support staff can also support the patient by holding their hand, talking to them, and providing them with comfort measures such as application of warm or hot packs to the abdomen and cool compresses to the face or chest as needed. For patients who use anxiolytics for other indications, pretreatment with these medications before IUD insertion can be helpful.

Performing this step prior to opening the IUD kit avoids having to waste an expensive device if the pre-IUD insertion portions of the procedure cannot be successfully performed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">While placing the tenaculum on gentle traction with the nondominant hand to straighten the uterine axis, a uterine sound is passed through the cervix to the uterine fundus in order to measure the depth of the uterine cavity (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82457" href="/z/d/graphic/82457.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).

In order to avoid IUD breakage or permanent device memory of the arms bent in this position, the horizontal arms should not be kept in this position in the clear insertion tube for more than a few minutes before insertion. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Neither the IUD nor the portion of the insertion tube that enters the uterus should ever be touched with a nonsterile hand. If sterile gloves are not available, the device can be assembled within the partially opened IUD package. The provider partially opens the package to the level of the lower aspect of the IUD stem. With careful handling the distal end of the insertion tube with a nonsterile hand and handling the device itself through the clear, sterile cellophane of the unopened end of the package, the arms of the IUD can be bent down to be parallel with the stem and inserted into the clear tube to hold them in place (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113685" href="/z/d/graphic/113685.html" rel="external">figure 5</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115852" href="/z/d/graphic/115852.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>After positioning the IUD at one end of the insertion tube, the white plastic rod is passed through the opposite end, with the ringed end of the rod protruding from the base of the clear tube.

If we are using sterile gloves and have already touched the IUD to load the arms, we actually hold the IUD in place with our index finger while the white rod is threaded to the level of the IUD stem to ensure the newly loaded IUD is not pushed out of the tube. The blue elliptical flange can then be slid along the insertion tube to position it corresponding to the sounded depth of the uterine cavity. The wide diameter of the flange is oriented in the same alignment as the horizontal arms of the IUD to allow correct orientation of the IUD upon insertion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>While applying gentle traction on the tenaculum, the insertion tube is passed through the cervical os and up the full length of the uterine cavity to the point at which resistance is felt as the IUD reaches the top of the uterine fundus. This should also correspond with the flange meeting the external cervical os if it was properly set based on uterine sounding. Once the IUD is at the fundus, the tenaculum should be allowed to gently fall as the remaining portion of the insertion requires two hands. While holding the white plastic rod steady in space, the clear tube is drawn back as far as it will go until it hits the ring of the white rod, about 1 cm. This allows the arms of the IUD to deploy at the fundus. Recognize that the white rod is not an inserting tool; the IUD should <strong>not</strong> be pushed forward out of the insertion tube with the rod, as this would cause perforation through the fundus (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57148" href="/z/d/graphic/57148.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Next, while now holding the clear insertion tube steady in space, draw the white rod all the way out and set aside.

Removing the rod first followed separately by the tube decreases the risk that the strings may get caught on the rod and the IUD device would be inadvertently moved down in the fundus. If the IUD stem is visible within or protruding through the endocervical canal, it should be retrieved by pulling the strings and, if it has remained sterile, it may be reloaded and a reinsertion may be attempted.

With the applicator held here, 1.5 cm from the stop of the fundus, the blue thumb slider is moved down 1 cm, stopping at the gray mark designated on the handle. This downward thumb slider movement allows the arms of the IUD to be released.

To begin, hold the device underhanded in the dominant hand and push your thumb up to ensure both the blue thumb slider and the green thumb slider are fully advanced as far up as they will go in the handle. The IUD can then be retracted into the insertion tube by laying the device's free arms flat (horizontal) on the sterile inside plastic surface of the package, placing the dominant thumb on the blue slider to keep it fully advanced with gentle pressure while simultaneously pulling the strings down firmly with the nondominant hand until the IUD slides completely into the tube with the arms extended up. The blue flange is then slid along the insertion tube to position it to correspond to the sounded depth of the uterine cavity using a sterile or no-touch technique. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Once the IUD is loaded, it is ready for insertion. Using the nondominant hand, gentle traction is placed on the tenaculum while the loaded IUD applicator is then advanced through the cervix with the dominant hand until the flange is 1.5 cm from the cervix. For insertion into most uteri, we recommend that this applicator be held underhanded with the dominant thumb on the thumb slider at all times. With the applicator held 1.5 cm from the top of the fundus, the blue thumb slider is moved down 1 cm, stopping at the mark designated on the handle. This downward thumb slider movement allows the arms of the IUD to be released. We recommend a 3 to 10 second delay to allow the arms to relax back into the correct T-shaped configuration. After this delay, the applicator is then advanced until the blue flange touches the cervix and resistance is felt to indicate that the IUD is correctly positioned at the top of the fundus. Holding the inserter in place, the IUD is released by moving both blue and green thumb sliders all the way back down to the bottom of the handle. If the green slider is moved all the way down, a green indicator is exposed at the very base of the insertion handle to denote that the strings are free (no longer locked). The inserter can then be gently removed entirely from the cervical canal, exposing the blue strings that should then be cut to 2 to 3 cm. We suggest cutting the strings at least 2 cm long to leave enough length for the strings to soften and curve around the face of the cervix the cervical-vaginal fornix instead of along the length of the vagina. Additionally, we recommend cutting the strings with a curved scissor perpendicular to the thread length to minimize chance of sharp edges cut on a bias that could cause partner discomfort. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The Liletta LNG 52 mg IUD was originally available as an unloaded device that required more complexity to bring it into the applicator; insertion instructions are available in the manufacturer's instructions that are packaged with the device.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>LNG 19.5 mg IUD</strong> – The LNG 19.5 mg IUD (commercial name Kyleena) has a preloaded insertion system (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113689" href="/z/d/graphic/113689.html" rel="external">figure 10</a>) that is slightly thinner but otherwise identical to the Mirena LNG 52 mg applicator.

For individuals who require cervical dilation, a paracervical block may be helpful for pain reduction. For those who require significant cervical or uterine manipulation, procedural sedation may be required. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5404.html" rel="external">"Pudendal and paracervical block", section on 'Gynecologic procedures'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with a cervix that is flush to the vagina or who have had prior cervix or uterine procedures, an os finder can be used to identify the os and dilate the cervical path. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with cervical stenosis or a cervical canal path that is difficult to identify, use of Pratt dilators (13 to 15 French) or similar (eg, Hanks or Hegar dilators) can be useful. If the stenosis is severe, a lacrimal duct probe can be used as a very thin dilator. Alternatively, a 3 mm flexible endometrial biopsy Pipelle can be used instead of a rigid metal sound to identify and dilate the canal. Analgesia such as a paracervical block may be warranted for cervical dilation or manipulation. At times, a circuitous path or cervical divots may allow easy passage of the smooth metal dilators or sound but prevent easy passage of the flexible plastic IUD applicator. In this setting, over dilation to 21 to 23 French can allow for unrestrictive passage of the flexible IUD inserter.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other solutions for difficult entrance into the uterus include ultrasound guidance (see <a class="local">'Ultrasound guidance'</a> below), use of a smaller IUD inserter (the LNG 19.5 mg and LNG 13.5 mg applicator diameter dimension is 3.8 mm compared with Mirena at 4.4 mm and Liletta at 4.8 mm), or rotating the IUD applicator 180 degrees to allow improved angling of the device applicator along the posterior uterine aspect, particularly in retroverted uteri. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H77827894"><span class="h3">Ultrasound guidance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While not required for IUD placement, ultrasound guidance can be useful in resolving difficult IUD insertions. Specifically, ultrasound guidance can guide dilator insertion in patients with cervical stenosis or a tortuous cervical canal. It can also identify distorted uterine anatomy such as sharp uterine flexion (anteverted or retroverted) or fibroids (particularly submucosal tumors). Additionally, ultrasound can be used immediately postinsertion to confirm correct IUD placement. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H77827925"><span class="h3">Misoprostol</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although not routinely used for IUD insertion, pretreatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9657" href="/z/d/drug information/9657.html" rel="external">misoprostol</a> may benefit some patients, including those in whom IUD insertion is known to be difficult or has failed, or individuals who are nulliparous or have only had cesarean deliveries [<a href="#rid48">48-52</a>]. However, routine use of misoprostol has <strong>not</strong> been demonstrated to increase the rates of successful IUD insertion. In a systematic review of six trials, routine pretreatment with misoprostol did not lead to improved ease or success of IUD insertion and resulted in more insertional discomfort, particularly in nulliparous patients [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. As this lack of benefit for most patients must be balanced against uncomfortable side effects, we rarely prescribe misoprostol. We generally reserve misoprostol for individuals with a prior unsuccessful attempt at IUD insertion, presumed secondary to cervical stenosis.</p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9657" href="/z/d/drug information/9657.html" rel="external">Misoprostol</a> regimens vary; 400 mcg can be administered vaginally, buccally, or sublingually, ideally two to three hours before insertion. Side effects can include nausea, cramping, and diarrhea and tend to be higher in patients who receive sublingual dosing as compared with buccal or vaginal administration [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. Given the convenience of buccal administration, as compared to vaginal dosing, and the improved side effect profile when compared with sublingual dosing, our preferred dosing regimen is misoprostol 400 mcg placed buccally at least two hours before the IUD procedure. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h1">POSTABORTION (INDUCED OR SPONTANEOUS) PLACEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>IUDs can be inserted immediately after surgical uterine evacuation for pregnancy termination or miscarriage, or after confirmation of passage of the pregnancy in the setting of medical abortion or spontaneous miscarriage [<a href="#rid54">54,55</a>]. Insertion of IUDs during these pregnancy events has several advantages: The timing is convenient as the patient is already receiving medical care; some of the insertion procedure steps overlap with the surgical abortion management, which minimizes IUD insertional time and risk; the patient may be highly motivated to avoid a repeat pregnancy; anesthesia provided for the uterine evacuation will help ease the IUD insertion experience; and the woman is known not to be pregnant at time of IUD placement. These benefits must be weighed against an elevated IUD expulsion rate when placed postpartum after first, second, and third trimester delivery. The optimal candidates for the different IUD insertion timings and the risk of IUD expulsion is discussed in detail separately (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6708.html" rel="external">"Contraception: Postpartum counseling and methods", section on 'Intrauterine devices'</a>.)</p><p>While the general steps for postabortion IUD insertion are similar to the procedure described above for nonpregnant persons, the clinician must make minor modifications to technique. IUD placement should not be performed if there is suspicion of endometritis or if a complication was encountered during the suction procedure, such as perforation or unresolved significant bleeding.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Insertion following surgical pregnancy interruption in the first and second trimester</strong> – An IUD may be inserted immediately following a uterine aspiration in the first trimester or a D&amp;E in the second trimester. Both progestin and copper 380 mm<sup>2</sup>s can be used in these settings. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6708.html" rel="external">"Contraception: Postpartum counseling and methods"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">After uterine evacuation and prior to immediate postprocedure IUD insertion, the provider should verify that the evacuation is complete with no suspicion for retained products or ongoing bleeding. The method of insertion is highly similar to that with an interval procedure, with the primary differences being an already dilated cervix and a larger uterine cavity. Need for repeat cervical preparation with antiseptic after uterine evacuation and before IUD insertion is controversial, and there is limited evidence to support or refute the practice. Until further data are available, both approaches are reasonable. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Since the tenaculum is already in place for the uterine aspiration, it should be left in place. Also, we don't sound the uterus in this setting. Since the cervix is already known to be adequately dilated to accommodate the IUD, the length of the uterine cavity is already known from the evacuation procedure, and the uterine size is irrelevant since it is going to change with involution, sounding the uterus provides one more opportunity for uterine perforation without much benefit. This is especially true if the uterine evacuation is performed under ultrasound guidance, as the clinician can see themselves correctly place the IUD in the fundus. Loading, inserting and deploying the IUD is all unchanged from the interval insertion process described above. The strings again can be cut to about 2 cm, but the patient should be warned that, with uterine involution, the strings may become too long and may need to be trimmed in a number of weeks in the clinic. This is especially true with placement after a second trimester procedure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Insertion following medication interruption of pregnancy (spontaneous or induced abortion)</strong> – IUDs can be inserted after <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9657" href="/z/d/drug information/9657.html" rel="external">misoprostol</a> treatment for a spontaneous abortion or after combined <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10263" href="/z/d/drug information/10263.html" rel="external">mifepristone</a> and misoprostol for an induced abortion. Prior to insertion, complete abortion is confirmed either by demonstrating absence of a gestational sac on transvaginal ultrasound (typically 5 to 14 days after spontaneous or induced abortion) or by comparing the postprocedure hCG value with the hCG value obtained on the day of mifepristone administration (a &gt;80 percent drop in &gt;5 days is commonly used as a marker of complete medical abortion) [<a href="#rid56">56-58</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/109209.html" rel="external">"Contraception: Postabortion"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Several studies have evaluated the safety and efficacy of placing an IUD within one week of medication abortion, once confirmation of the gestation sac expulsion has occurred [<a href="#rid54">54,55</a>]. A prospective cohort study of patients who had medication abortion followed by LNG or Cu380A IUD placement at the one-week follow-up visit reported low expulsion rates (4 percent) at three months [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. Similarly, a trial comparing placement of the Cu380A IUD at one week or six weeks following medication abortion reported the rates of IUD expulsion and continuation were the same between the two arms [<a href="#rid54">54</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Insertion following spontaneous abortion</strong> – Given the unpredictable nature of spontaneous miscarriage, there is limited literature to help guide practice of IUD insertion in this setting [<a href="#rid54">54</a>]. However, there is biological plausibility to extrapolating the medication abortion literature noted above to the setting of spontaneous miscarriage. Therefore, once the gestational sac has passed and/or there is a rapid decline in hCG values to indicate the great majority of the pregnancy has been expelled, we feel comfortable placing an IUD (assuming there are no other risk factors, such as infection). The hCG trend does not need to be followed to a negative value before an IUD can be placed, and the IUD should not affect the rate of hCG drop. Similarly, resumption of menses does not need to happen before we place the IUD. Once we can be reasonably assured that the pregnancy has passed based on patient symptoms, ultrasound evaluation, and/or hCG trends, we immediately place an IUD if desired by the patient.

However, while IUD insertion within 10 minutes of placenta delivery has been defined for guideline and research purposes [<a href="#rid59">59</a>], there is no known limit as to how much time can pass between delivery of the placenta and safe IUD insertion. There may be no difference in clinical outcomes with longer placenta-to-insertion time intervals [<a href="#rid62">62</a>].

Meta-analysis of continuation and expulsion outcomes demonstrates that immediate IUD placement following placenta delivery has higher expulsion rates than delayed or interval IUD placement. However, due to poor postpartum follow-up rates, the initiation and long-term continuation rates of IUDs placed immediately postpartum are ultimately significantly higher, and more patients are ultimately protected with highly effective contraception [<a href="#rid65">65</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Additional information on IUD expulsion rates by timing of insertion and device type is available in related content.

The cervix is prepped with betadine.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Next, we remove the IUD from the applicator with the strings intact and either gently place the device between the index and middle fingers of our dominant hand (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115560" href="/z/d/graphic/115560.html" rel="external">figure 12</a>) or we very gently grasp the IUD with a ring forceps. We prefer to place the IUD manually, rather than use the inserter, because the copper 380 mm<sup>2</sup> inserter is typically too short and the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="104541" href="/z/d/drug information/104541.html" rel="external">LNG IUD</a> applicators generally require manipulation within the vagina, which we find awkward. If the ring forceps are to be used, great care is to be taken to grasp the IUD with minimal pressure, as tightening the forceps may lead to a full break of the IUD or lead to enough damage to affect the rate of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="104542" href="/z/d/drug information/104542.html" rel="external">levonorgestrel</a> or copper ion release. Once the IUD is positioned in the dominant hand or ring forceps, the device is inserted into the cervix, passed through the entire length of the uterine cavity, and released at the top of the fundus (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115558" href="/z/d/graphic/115558.html" rel="external">figure 13</a>). We typically perform postpartum insertion in the standing position and place our nondominant hand on the patient's abdomen to help stabilize the fundus. Once the IUD has been deposited at the fundus, we take care to remove the hand or the ring forceps without catching and pulling downward on the strings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The copper 380 mm<sup>2</sup> IUD strings may not actually be long enough to extend all the way through the cervix and, even if they are, they likely do not need to be cut. The <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="104541" href="/z/d/drug information/104541.html" rel="external">LNG IUD</a> strings are typically long enough to extend through the cervix and may be cut but should be deliberately kept long to keep them from migrating back up into the open cervix. Given the increased literature on the safety of immediate postpartum IUD insertion and the increase of IUD provision in this setting, specific postpartum IUD inserters are in development (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115559" href="/z/d/graphic/115559.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Insertion following cesarean delivery</strong> — IUD insertion after a cesarean delivery is similar to placement after vaginal delivery. Since uterine tone increases with time following removal of the placenta, it is likely best to minimize delay of insertion. To allow room for our hands or instruments, we typically do this before we start the hysterotomy repair. However, some clinicians find it helpful to start the hysterotomy repair and then place the IUD when repair is about halfway complete. Typically we are able to use the IUD applicator for insertion at time of cesarean. However, as with vaginal insertion, an alternative option is to remove the IUD and the intact strings from the applicator and secure the IUD with the dominant index and middle figure (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115560" href="/z/d/graphic/115560.html" rel="external">figure 12</a>) or the ring forceps. We place the IUD at the top of the fundus while controlling the uterus with our non-dominant hand. We then direct the strings towards the vagina using long forceps such as DeBakey, though we do no other measures to directly bring the strings through the cervix. IUD strings migrate down through the cervix in about a half of the patients who have it placed at time of cesarean delivery and can be visualized during speculum examination at the postpartum visit [<a href="#rid66">66</a>]. For those patients in whom strings cannot be seen at the postpartum visit, the IUD is likely in the fundus but the strings are in the lower uterus or cervix. We perform an office ultrasound to check for IUD location and reassure the patient.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H702523149"><span class="h2">Delayed postpartum IUD insertion</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Early-delayed</strong> – Early-delayed IUD insertion is less common and generally is performed when a woman expressed her desire for an IUD after delivery but prior to discharge (between 10 minutes and one week after delivery) [<a href="#rid59">59</a>].

Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on "patient info" and the keyword(s) of interest.) </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Basics topics (see  <a class="medical medical_basics" href="/z/d/html/86384.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Intrauterine devices (IUDs) (The Basics)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_basics" href="/z/d/html/141006.html" rel="external">"Patient education: IUD insertion (The Basics)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_basics" href="/z/d/html/141007.html" rel="external">"Patient education: IUD removal (The Basics)"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Beyond the Basics topic (see  <a class="medical medical_patient" href="/z/d/html/8423.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Long-acting methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nomenclature and devices</strong> – Intrauterine device (IUD) encompasses intrauterine contraceptive (IUC) and intrauterine system (IUS, for progestin-containing devices). Four types of IUDs are commonly available globally; one contains copper (copper 380 mm<sup>2</sup> IUD) and three release the progestin <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="104542" href="/z/d/drug information/104542.html" rel="external">levonorgestrel</a> at differing doses (LNG 52 mg, 19.5 mg, or 13.5 mg). Other IUD types are available in specific geographic regions. (See <a class="local">'IUD nomenclature'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Candidates</strong> – There are very few contraindications to IUD use. Most patients, including those who are nulliparous, adolescent, immediately postpartum or postabortion, have acute or chronic medical conditions, and/or desire emergency contraception are candidates for an IUD. (See <a class="local">'Candidates, device selection, and contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Timing of IUD insertion</strong> – An IUD may be inserted at any time during the menstrual cycle if pregnancy can be reasonably excluded by the presence of any of the criteria in the following table (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67567" href="/z/d/graphic/67567.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Documentation of a negative pregnancy test prior to IUD insertion is advised for most patients, but particularly for those with lactational amenorrhea or other conditions that lead to irregular intervals between menses (unclear timing of ovulation), or questionable compliance with contraception. (See <a class="local">'Timing of insertion and pregnancy testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Postprocedure insertion</strong> – IUDs can be inserted immediately after surgical uterine evacuation for pregnancy termination or miscarriage, or after confirmation of passage of the pregnancy in the setting of medical abortion or spontaneous miscarriage. (See <a class="local">'Postabortion (induced or spontaneous) placement'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Postpartum insertion</strong> – IUDs can be inserted following vaginal or cesarean delivery. Immediate post-placental insertion is preferred because of the higher initiation and continuation rates, although expulsion rates are also higher compared with delayed or interval insertion. (See <a class="local">'Postpartum insertion'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>STI counseling and screening</strong> – We counsel all patients about risk of sexually transmitted infections (STI) and offer voluntary screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia to all individuals presenting for IUD insertion regardless of risk factors. Additionally, we routinely screen based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fstd%2Fprevention%2Fscreeningreccs.htm&amp;token=7%2FsDq8EttCAPckeysg%2FUmYytOIJ27df7gTnINoq8sXpK3WDsgwkBRTu13cnkfvqIjS6RE45y%2BrF3xEXtxDdZFQ%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=3267" target="_blank">STD &amp; HIV Screening Recommendations</a>. If no evidence of acute pelvic infection is present, STI screening should not delay IUD insertion. (See <a class="local">'Sexually transmitted infections'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Antibiotics not indicated</strong> – Antibiotic prophylaxis for the placement of an IUD is not recommended, even for individuals with valvular heart disease. (See <a class="local">'Antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Options for analgesia</strong> – In our practice, pain management is a process that includes preprocedure counseling, support during the procedure, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and, for some patients, a paracervical block. We perform shared decision-making with the patient to select an individualized approach. (See <a class="local">'Approach to analgesia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>NSAID</strong> – Despite the conflicting literature, we offer patients nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8547" href="/z/d/drug information/8547.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a> 800 mg or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9682" href="/z/d/drug information/9682.html" rel="external">naproxen</a> 550 mg, based on medication availability and onset of action) either before or after IUD insertion. Pretreatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9657" href="/z/d/drug information/9657.html" rel="external">misoprostol</a> does not reduce insertion pain. (See <a class="local">'Approach to analgesia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Paracervical block</strong> – In general, we find that patients frequently reject the option of a paracervical block for general IUD placements following a risk-benefit patient-centered discussion. However, patients with significant concerns regarding pain management, anxiety regarding the procedure, or with history of difficult IUD insertion for any reason may benefit from paracervical block. (See <a class="local">'Approach to analgesia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other analgesics that have been evaluated include <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9657" href="/z/d/drug information/9657.html" rel="external">misoprostol</a>, topical anesthetics, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10086" href="/z/d/drug information/10086.html" rel="external">nitrous oxide</a>, and conscious sedation. (See <a class="local">'Review of analgesia options'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Equipment for insertion</strong> – The following equipment is required for routine IUD insertion: sterile, packaged IUD device, speculum, single tooth tenaculum, uterine sound (either metal sound or alternative like a 3mm flexible endometrial biopsy pipelle), scissor (ideally long with curved blade), an antiseptic solution (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9801" href="/z/d/drug information/9801.html" rel="external">povidone iodine</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9244" href="/z/d/drug information/9244.html" rel="external">chlorhexidine</a>. Ideally, sterile gloves should also be available, although a "no touch" technique is acceptable. (See <a class="local">'Equipment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>IUD insertion</strong> – General steps common to insertion of any IUD include examining the pelvis, placing a tenaculum on the cervix, and sounding the uterine cavity. (See <a class="local">'General steps for IUD insertion'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The specific IUD insertion process varies by device. The clinician should be familiar with the specific steps for the various devices. (See <a class="local">'Device-specific insertion steps'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cervical dilation and ultrasound guidance</strong> – We do not routinely pretreat patients with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9657" href="/z/d/drug information/9657.html" rel="external">misoprostol</a> prior to IUD insertion, but misoprostol pretreatment can be helpful in select individuals, such as those with a stenotic cervix. For patients in whom the IUD insertion was difficult or failed, cervical dilators and ultrasound guidance can aid insertion. (See <a class="local">'Difficult insertion'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Postinsertion counseling</strong> – Postinsertion counseling includes a discussion of concerning symptoms and use of back-up contraception as indicated. (See <a class="local">'Postinsertion counseling'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3662564599"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Gillian Dean, MD, MPH, and Alisa B Goldberg, MD, MPH, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Creinin M, Kohn JE, Tang JH, et al.
