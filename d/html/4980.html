         The goal of newborn screening is to detect disorders that are threatening to life or long-term health before they become symptomatic. These conditions include inborn errors of metabolism, endocrine disorders, hemoglobinopathies, immunodeficiency, cystic fibrosis, hearing loss, and critical congenital heart disease. Early treatment of these conditions may reduce morbidity and mortality in affected patients.

         Screening tests are administered to all newborns to identify infants who have a serious but potentially treatable health problem. Screening tests do not provide a definitive diagnosis, but rather they identify newborns who require further testing. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2872.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Other conditions that may be detected by newborn screening
         </strong>
         – There are a number of disorders with biochemical profiles that are similar to one or more of the core conditions listed above. These conditions (sometimes called secondary disorders) can be picked up by newborn screening even though they are not specifically targeted by newborn screening. For example, the newborn screening test for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, which detects abnormal levels of a particular very long chain fatty acid (specifically C26:0-LPC), can also pick up other peroxisomal disorders (eg, Zellweger spectrum disorder, acyl CoA oxidase 1 deficiency, D-bifunctional protein deficiency). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6147.html" rel="external">
          "Peroxisomal disorders", section on 'Newborn screening'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Other examples of secondary conditions that can be detected through newborn metabolic screening are summarized in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef140207" href="/z/d/graphic/140207.html" rel="external">
          table 1

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In addition, because screening for critical congenital heart disease is based on finding hypoxemia by pulse oximetry, it can also detect other causes of hypoxemia, such as sepsis or persistent pulmonary hypertension. (See

         There is substantial regional variability in the number and types of diseases screened and the methods and algorithms used. This is due to a variety of factors, including the birth prevalence of different diseases in the population, the newborn screening program's resources for screening (including laboratory requirements and follow-up needs), jurisdictional public health and healthcare system infrastructure, legislative priorities and mandates, and costs [

         The role of the state is to design, coordinate, and manage an effective newborn screening system. However, the effectiveness of state newborn screening programs and their role in the follow-up of infants varies [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Clinicians should be aware of the level of services provided by the screening program in their area of practice. In each practice setting, proactive steps should be taken to ensure that the clinician can successfully communicate the results of the newborn screening tests to the family/caregivers and provide appropriate follow-up in a timely fashion [

         Newborn blood spot testing is performed with a variety of techniques, including tandem mass spectrometry (also referred to as MS-MS) and other techniques [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10

         ]. Increasingly, molecular methods are being incorporated into newborn screening.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tandem mass spectrometry expanded the possibility for mass screening of multiple disorders from one small sample, and it remains the method used to detect most of the conditions included in the newborn screening panel  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef140207" href="/z/d/graphic/140207.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). It detects molecules by measuring their weight and is a series of two mass spectrometers, which sort samples and identify and weigh the molecules of interest. It is best used when screening for inborn errors of organic acid, fatty acid, and amino acid metabolism. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/130068.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         There is growing interest in using molecular methods and genomic analysis for newborn screening. For example, molecular testing is used for newborn screening for spinal muscular atrophy using high-throughput molecular techniques that detect the causative molecular variant (homozygous deletion of exon 7 in the
         <em>
          SMN1
         </em>
         gene). (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Genetic sequencing (ie, whole exome or whole genome sequencing [WES or WGS]) holds promise as a tool for newborn screening [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11-14
         </a>
         ]. However, it is costly and there are other challenges that need to be resolved before applying WES/WGS as a broad screening tool. These include uncertainty related to genotype-phenotype correlation for many disorders and the potential to identify other abnormalities in addition to the conditions that screening is targeting (eg, late-onset disorders, carrier status).

         For healthy newborns receiving routine care in the newborn nursery, the blood spot specimen should be obtained during the birth hospitalization at 24 to 48 hours after birth, as close to hospital discharge as possible. This timing optimizes the sensitivity of testing as it permits accumulation of abnormal compounds in the infant's blood and the best chance of obtaining a positive result if disease is present.

         Blood samples are obtained by heel lance, warming the heel before puncture. Blood is collected on filter paper cards that are provided for this purpose. The designated circles should be completely filled with blood. Samples are then sent to a central laboratory for analysis.

         For preterm or acutely ill neonates who are cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), the approach to screening varies among screening programs with regards to the timing and number of screens performed. Newborns managed in the NICU usually require more than one screen. In some programs, the first blood spot test is obtained at the usual time (ie, 24 to 48 hours after birth) and then a second sample is obtained prior to discharge (or sooner if requested by the screening laboratory). However, other screening programs delay the first screen to reduce the risk of false-positives.
        </p>
        <p>
         The variability in practice reflects the uncertainty about optimal timing of screening for this population. Earlier screening for these infants avoids delays in identifying and treating the target disorders. However, early screening in preterm and acutely ill neonates is associated with a high likelihood of false-positive findings, particularly for testing of amino acid and acylcarnitine profiles, likely related to the use of parenteral nutrition (PN) [

         For newborns delivered out-of-hospital (ie, home births and birth centers), it is critical to ensure that newborn screening occurs [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Care providers in these situations should have screening protocols in place. If the primary healthcare provider cannot confirm that screening was performed in a newborn delivered out of the hospital, they should offer screening at the first well-baby visit. Primary care offices should contact their state or local newborn screening program to determine how best to obtain and send specimen to the appropriate laboratory.

         Repeat screening may be required if the initial specimen was insufficient or was obtained too early (ie, within the first 24 hours after birth). Preterm neonates often require repeat screening, as discussed above. (See
         <a class="local">

        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, some newborn screening programs use a two-screen protocol for all newborns. In states using two-screen protocols, the second blood spot screening panel is performed at the age of one to two weeks. This is typically done in the primary healthcare provider's office during a well-baby visit. The second screen increases the sensitivity (yield) of screening by mitigating initial false-negative screens related to normal physiologic changes and/or limited nutritional intake in the first days after birth [
         <a href="#rid18">

         The newborn blood spot panel typically takes five to seven days to result. Thus, unless a medical issue keeps the infant in the hospital (eg, preterm birth), most newborns will have been discharged from the birth hospital by the time results are available. For this reason, it is critical for newborn screening programs to have a reliable protocol in place for notifying the primary healthcare provider and parents/caregivers about abnormal results.

         The mechanism of communicating test results, including the role of state and local public health agencies, varies widely [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,5
         </a>
         ]. In some states, the testing laboratory is assigned the responsibility of communicating test results to the healthcare provider and/or birth hospital. In other states, the role of locating infants and communicating test results is assigned to local health department staff.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most state programs require that a healthcare provider be notified of results. However, this may be the clinician of record at the infant's birth hospital and not the primary healthcare provider. In cases of positive screening results that require urgent follow-up (eg, highly abnormal screening test for a metabolic disorder), newborn screening programs will actively seek parents/caregivers to inform them and to expedite diagnosis and treatment.

         The primary healthcare provider (eg, pediatrician, family practitioner, nurse practitioner) should be aware of the system in their state or region to ensure timely notification of abnormal results to parents/caregivers. Ideally, healthcare providers should also inform parents/caregivers when the results of screening are normal, but this is less critical and less time sensitive. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Normal screening results'
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         A successful screening program requires collaboration among all healthcare professionals involved in newborn care [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. This begins with the obstetric provider, who should educate expectant parents about newborn screening and the importance of identifying the medical home for the newborn. Additional information about newborn screening should be provided during the birth hospitalization. Identifying the medical home for the newborn is an important criterion for discharge. Discharge documentation should clearly indicate whether or not screening was performed, the name of the clinician responsible for the birth hospitalization, and the name of the primary care provider. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5068.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of the routine management of the healthy newborn infant", section on 'Discharge criteria'

        </p>
        <p>
         Primary care providers should be familiar with local pediatric subspecialty care resources so that appropriate referrals can be made when an infant is diagnosed with a specific disorder [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Genetic counseling, testing of other family members, and family/caregiver support services should be facilitated [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,7
         </a>
         ]. (See

         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Primary care clinicians are often underprepared to provide initial counseling and subspecialty referral for infants with positive newborn screening results. This was illustrated in a survey of general pediatricians and family practitioners in the United States that demonstrated many responding clinicians did not feel competent to discuss the results of a positive newborn screen [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>

         When screening identifies a carrier state (eg, sickle cell trait), communication to the parents/caregivers can be challenging because it does not usually have health consequences for the newborn. Nevertheless, the finding may have health implications during adulthood and it is important for future reproductive planning for the newborn's parents. (See

         Positive or equivocal results from newborn screening should have a repeat and/or confirmatory test performed as quickly as possible. In most newborn screening programs, positive results are communicated to the primary healthcare provider (or to the birth hospital staff if the newborn has not yet been discharged) who then assumes the responsibility for the appropriate follow-up care.

         If the newborn has no abnormal findings on any of the screening tests, parents/caregivers should be notified that the results were normal and that no additional testing is required. However, healthcare providers and parents/caregivers should be aware that a negative screening result does not completely rule out the disorder since false-negative screening results can occur.

        <p>
         Thus, primary care providers must remain vigilant to the development of symptoms of these conditions, even if screening was negative.

        <p>
         False-negative results are more likely in infants born prematurely, in those who received blood transfusions or dialysis therapy, or in those who were tested too early (less than 24 hours of age).

          Use of the residual dried blood spot specimen
         </strong>
         – Researchers can use anonymized dried blood spots to develop new screening tests. However, some families/caregivers are concerned about the risk to privacy. The rules regarding the use of anonymized dried blood spots for research and the length of time that newborn screening programs save residual dried blood spots vary by state.

          Identification of late-onset disease
         </strong>
         – Some newborn screening tests that detect significant illness in childhood will also identify individuals who might not develop illness until adulthood. Assessing the benefit versus harm of early identification of late-onset disease is challenging.

         <strong>
          Identification of conditions for which treatment has not been established
         </strong>
         – Identifying newborns with serious conditions in the presymptomatic period may be important to develop new treatments. Some families/caregivers might want to know early about serious health conditions in their children, even in the absence of therapy. This can help avoid unnecessary diagnostic evaluation and allow families/caregivers to make plans for the affected child and make informed reproductive decisions.

         <strong>
          Identification of carriers
         </strong>
         – Newborn screening can identify carriers for many of the targeted conditions. There is uncertainty and debate about how best and when to inform families and these children about their carrier status to inform future reproductive decisions [

         <strong>
          Cascade testing of family members
         </strong>
         – After diagnosis through newborn screening of certain conditions (eg, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy), it is reasonable to test first-degree family members to see whether they are carriers or affected by the condition. A number of ethical and psychosocial issues apply to genetic testing, including the consequences for the family, issues related to testing children who are unaffected, and concerns about genetic discrimination. Clinicians must consider the benefits and risks of genetic testing, including the possibility of false-positive and false-negative results. (See

         <strong>
          Provision of long-term care
         </strong>
         – Early identification of most of the conditions included in newborn screening allows modification of the condition from being associated with significant morbidity and mortality in infancy to a long-term chronic illness. Developing systems to assure that these individuals have access to chronic disease management, including medications or nonpharmacologic therapy (eg, specific diet), is challenging [

         <strong>
          Resource allocation
         </strong>
         – Public health agencies have limited resources, and assuring comprehensive newborn screening is costly. Often the cost of the screening test is coalesced into the cost of operating the newborn screening program and does not include resources to assure appropriate follow-up care. Policy makers therefore need to consider all costs related to the adoption of newborn screening for each condition.

          True positives
         </strong>
         – If follow-up testing confirms the diagnosis of a specific disorder, referrals should be made for appropriate subspecialty care. The detection rate of the core newborn screening conditions is approximately 30 to 40 per 10,000 live births. The four most commonly diagnosed conditions are congenital hearing loss, congenital hypothyroidism, sickle cell disease, and cystic fibrosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Newborns with a confirmed disorder'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          False positives
         </strong>
         – Most newborns with abnormal newborn screening results are not ultimately diagnosed with a disorder. The false positive rate is approximately 1 to 2 percent. Nevertheless, given the seriousness of the conditions on the newborn screening panel, clinicians should take all positive newborn screens seriously and have systems in place for timely and appropriate follow-up. (See
         <a class="local">
          'False positives'

         <strong>
          Normal screening
         </strong>
         – If the newborn has no abnormal findings on any of the screening tests, no additional testing is required. However, healthcare providers and parents/caregivers should be aware that a negative screening result does not completely rule out the disorder since false-negative screening results can occur. Thus, primary care providers must remain vigilant to the development of symptoms of these conditions, even if screening was negative. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Normal screening results'

         <strong>
          Challenges
         </strong>
         – Although newborn screening is incorporated into healthcare systems around the world, ongoing challenges and controversies remain. These include resource allocation, identification of conditions that are late-onset or have no established treatment, and identification of disease carriers. (See
