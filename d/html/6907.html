         Conjunctivitis is a common diagnosis in patients who complain of a red eye. It is usually a benign or self-limited condition, or one that is easily treated. Other causes of red eye are discussed elsewhere. (See

         This topic will review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of conjunctivitis. Other conditions which may be confused with conjunctivitis include acute angle-closure glaucoma, iritis, uveitis, and infectious keratitis. In contrast to acute conjunctivitis, these conditions are sight-threatening and must be managed by an ophthalmologist. They are discussed elsewhere:

         Conjunctivitis literally means "inflammation of the conjunctiva." The conjunctiva is the mucous membrane that lines the inside surface of the lids and covers the surface of the globe up to the limbus (the junction of the sclera and the cornea). The portion covering the globe is the "bulbar conjunctiva," and the portion lining the lids is the "tarsal conjunctiva"  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54272" href="/z/d/graphic/54272.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The conjunctiva is comprised of an epithelium and a substantia propria. The epithelium is a non-keratinized squamous epithelium that also contains goblet cells. The substantia propria is highly vascularized and is the site of considerable immunologic activity.
        </p>
        <p>
         The conjunctiva is generally transparent. When it is inflamed, as in conjunctivitis, it appears pink or red on general inspection. Up close, the examiner can discern fine blood vessels, termed "injection," in contrast to extravasated blood, which is seen in subconjunctival hemorrhage. All conjunctivitis is characterized by a red eye, but not all red eyes are conjunctivitis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6900.html" rel="external">

         Acute conjunctivitis can be classified as infectious (bacterial or viral) or noninfectious (allergic, toxic, or nonspecific). The prevalence of each type is different in pediatric and adult populations [

          1-3

         Patients with bacterial conjunctivitis typically complain of redness and discharge in one eye, although it can also be bilateral. Similar to viral and allergic conjunctivitis, the affected eye is often "stuck shut" in the morning [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The purulent discharge continues throughout the day and is thick and globular; it may be yellow, white, or green  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef132406" href="/z/d/graphic/132406.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). The discharge differs from that of viral or allergic conjunctivitis, which is mostly watery during the day, with a scant, stringy component that is mucus rather than pus. On examination, patients with bacterial conjunctivitis typically have purulent discharge at the lid margins and in the corners of the eye which reappears within minutes of wiping the lids. This contrasts with patients with viral or allergic conjunctivitis, in whom the eyes appear watery and where there may be mucus present on close inspection of the tear film or if one pulls down the lower lid, but pus does not appear spontaneously and continuously at the lid margin and in the corners of the eye  (

There is typically marked chemosis (conjunctival edema), lid swelling, and tender preauricular adenopathy. Conjunctival scrapings should be sent for immediate Gram stain to identify gram-negative diplococci. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can also be used for diagnosis of gonococcal conjunctivitis [

         Viral conjunctivitis is typically caused by adenovirus, with many serotypes implicated [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. The conjunctivitis may be part of a viral prodrome followed by adenopathy, fever, pharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infection, or the eye infection may be the only manifestation of the disease. Viral conjunctivitis is highly contagious; it is spread by direct contact with the patient and their secretions or with contaminated objects and surfaces [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Conjunctivitis can also be part of the prodrome or presentation of other viral upper respiratory tract infections.
        </p>
        <p>
         Viral conjunctivitis typically presents as conjunctival injection with watery or mucoserous discharge  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56481" href="/z/d/graphic/56481.html" rel="external">
          picture 3
         </a>
         ) and a burning, sandy, or gritty feeling in one eye. Patients may report "pus" in the eye, but on further questioning they have morning crusting followed by watery discharge, perhaps with some scant mucus throughout the day.
        </p>
        <p>
         The second eye usually becomes involved within 24 to 48 hours, although unilateral signs and symptoms do not rule out a viral process. Patients often believe that they have a bacterial conjunctivitis that has spread to the fellow eye; they do not appreciate that this is the ocular manifestation of a systemic illness, even if they are experiencing viral symptoms at the same time  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef139015" href="/z/d/graphic/139015.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         On examination there is typically only mucoid discharge if one pulls down the lower lid or looks very closely in the corner of the eye. Usually there is profuse tearing rather than discharge. The tarsal conjunctiva may have a follicular or "bumpy" appearance  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef131238" href="/z/d/graphic/131238.html" rel="external">
          picture 4
         </a>
         ). There may be an enlarged and tender preauricular node.
        </p>
        <p>
         Viral conjunctivitis is a self-limited process. The clinical course parallels that of the common cold. While recovery can begin within days, the symptoms frequently get worse for the first three to five days, with very gradual resolution over the following one to two weeks for a total course of two to three weeks. Just as a patient with a cold can have morning coughing and nasal congestion or discharge two weeks after symptoms first arise, patients with viral conjunctivitis may have morning crusting two weeks after the initial symptoms, although the daytime redness, irritation, and tearing should be much improved.
        </p>
        <p>
         Conjunctivitis might accompany herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis, acute varicella zoster (chickenpox), or herpes zoster ophthalmicus (V1 shingles), but the conjunctival process is self-limited, requiring no treatment beyond what would be undertaken for the herpes keratitis, for acute management of herpes zoster, or for management of chronic sequelae of herpes zoster ophthalmicus.

          —
         </span>
         One form of viral conjunctivitis, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC), is particularly fulminant and causes a keratitis (inflammation of the cornea) that typically appears a few days after the initial conjunctivitis. It is typically caused by adenovirus types 8, 19, and 37 [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. However, there is clinical variation; the same viral strain that causes EKC in one patient may cause ordinary viral conjunctivitis in another, probably due to differences in host immune factors. The corneal and conjunctival epithelium are both involved. In addition to the typical symptoms of viral conjunctivitis, the patient develops a foreign body sensation and multiple corneal infiltrates sometimes visible with a penlight (though easily seen at the slit lamp). The foreign body sensation is severe enough to preclude opening the eyes spontaneously, and the infiltrates typically degrade acuity by two or three lines to the 20/40 range.

         Allergic conjunctivitis is caused by airborne allergens contacting the eye that trigger a classic type I immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity response specific to that allergen, causing local mast cell degranulation and the release of chemical mediators including histamine, eosinophil chemotactic factors, and platelet-activating factor, among others.
        </p>

         It typically presents as bilateral redness, watery discharge, and itching  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79978" href="/z/d/graphic/79978.html" rel="external">
          picture 5
         </a>
         ). Itching is the cardinal symptom of allergy, distinguishing it from a viral etiology, which is more typically described as grittiness, burning, or irritation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef139015" href="/z/d/graphic/139015.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). Eye rubbing can worsen symptoms. Patients with allergic conjunctivitis often have a history of atopy, seasonal allergy, or specific allergy (eg, to cats), and other allergic symptoms (eg, nasal congestion, sneezing, wheezing) may be present.
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical findings are the same as those seen in viral conjunctivitis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef139015" href="/z/d/graphic/139015.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). Both cause diffuse injection with a bumpy or follicular appearance to the tarsal conjunctiva  (

          picture 4
         </a>
         ). Some allergic conjunctivitis may present with larger papillary rather than follicular reaction. There is profuse watery or mucoserous, stringy discharge, and both may have morning crusting. It is the complaint of itching and the history of allergy or hay fever as well as a recent exposure that distinguishes allergic conjunctivitis.
        </p>
        <p>
         In some cases of allergic conjunctivitis, there is marked chemosis (conjunctival edema); in extreme instances, there can be bullous chemosis, in which the bulging, edematous conjunctiva extends forward beyond the lid margins. Bullous chemosis is most commonly seen in patients with extreme hypersensitivity to cats. A detailed discussion of allergic disease is presented separately. (See

         Conjunctivitis is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, made on the basis of history and physical examination. Patients often call all cases of red eye "conjunctivitis" and presume that all cases are bacterial and require antibiotics. When a patient calls to report "conjunctivitis" or "pink eye," clinicians should not accept that as a diagnosis but should rather review the history, symptoms, and signs prior to treating. A detailed description of how to take a history and examine a patient with a red eye is discussed elsewhere. (See

          History

         It is worthwhile to elicit the character of the ocular discharge, as patients may refer to all discharge as "pus." In bacterial conjunctivitis the complaint of discharge predominates, while in viral and allergic conjunctivitis patients report a burning and gritty feeling or itching  (

          Examination
         </strong>
         – On examination, the redness or injection in conjunctivitis should be diffuse, involving the bulbar (globe) conjunctiva for 360 degrees as well as the palpebral (tarsal) conjunctiva (the mucus membrane on the inner surface of the lids).

         If the conjunctival injection is localized rather than diffuse, another diagnosis such as foreign body, pterygium, or episcleritis should be considered. (See

         </span>
         If the tarsal conjunctiva is spared, suspicion should be raised for keratitis, iritis, and angle-closure glaucoma. These serious conditions cause a red eye with 360 degree involvement of the bulbar conjunctiva, often in a ciliary flush pattern, but without tarsal conjunctival involvement. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Reasons for urgent ophthalmologic referral'

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of conjunctivitis can be made in a red eye if there is discharge, vision is normal (or unchanged), and there is no evidence of keratitis, iritis, or angle-closure glaucoma (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6900.html" rel="external">
          "The red eye: Evaluation and management"
         </a>

         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53218" href="/z/d/graphic/53218.html" rel="external">

         Cultures or stains are not necessary for the initial diagnosis and therapy of conjunctivitis, and ophthalmologists typically do not generally perform cultures even when they are referred cases that have not responded to initial therapy. The exception is patients with signs and symptoms of hyperacute conjunctivitis in whom Giemsa and Gram stains may be helpful to identify

         A rapid (10-minute) test for adenoviral conjunctivitis is available, however, lack of reimbursement limits its wide adoption. This test has reasonable sensitivity and specificity under study conditions [

          15
         </a>
         ] and might aid clinicians in determining a viral as opposed to bacterial etiology, thereby avoiding empiric antibiotic therapy. Elimination of empiric antibiotic therapy has theoretical benefits including prescription drug savings, avoidance of side effects, and reduction of antibiotic resistance, and a modelled cost-effectiveness analysis suggests a potential for significant cost savings with point of care (POC) testing [

         The diagnosis of conjunctivitis should be made carefully in contact lens wearers, who are subject to myriad secondary chronic conjunctivitides that require a change in contact lens fit, lens type, or lens hygiene and may require suppression of hypersensitivity. Soft contact lens wearers have a high risk of pseudomonal keratitis, especially with use of extended-wear lenses [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,18

         ]. This causes an acute red eye and discharge in association with an ulcerative keratitis. The ulcerative keratitis can lead to ocular perforation within 24 hours if it is not recognized and treated appropriately. Thus, the presence of keratitis should be ruled out prior to presuming and treating conjunctivitis. Keratitis causes objective foreign body sensation, and the patient is usually unable to spontaneously open the eye or keep it open; there is typically a corneal opacity visible with a penlight  (

         Providers are often pressured to prescribe antibiotics for conjunctivitis, even when there is nothing to suggest a bacterial process. This can be a particular issue for parents or other caretakers because most daycare centers and schools require that students with conjunctivitis receive 24 hours of topical therapy before returning to school. Patients may sometimes request to be treated without being examined. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Returning to work, school, or sports'

         We believe that no patient should be treated for conjunctivitis without an examination. In principle, only those diagnosed with bacterial conjunctivitis should receive antibiotics. If the decision is made to prescribe antibiotics without an examination, we use an inexpensive nontoxic antibiotic such as

          'Common conjunctivitis in contact lens wearers'

         There are emerging data on the value of online treatment of conjunctivitis. In a study comparing asynchronous online text-based e-visits (without photo or video), phone calls, and in-person encounters among pediatric patients with conjunctivitis, antibiotic prescribing was greater with phone call encounters (41.6 percent) than with e-visits (25.7 percent) or face-to-face encounters (19.8 percent) [

         ]. In most cases, the choice of whether to use antibiotics for the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis is driven by values and preferences (for example, in back to work or school situations). However, antibiotic treatment is required for acute conjunctivitis in contact lens wearers as well as for cases of adult inclusion conjunctivitis or hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis. (See

The dosing is 0.5 inch (1.25 cm) of erythromycin ointment deposited inside the lower lid, or one to two drops of trimethoprim-polymyxin B, four times daily for five to seven days to the affected eye. These agents are preferred as they are inexpensive, widely available, and non-toxic, and they have low rates of hypersensitivity. Common alternative therapies include

        </p>
        <p>
         Ointment is preferred over drops for children, those with poor compliance, or those in whom it is difficult to administer eye medications. Ointment stays on the lids and can have therapeutic effect even if it is not clear that any of the dose was applied directly to the conjunctiva. Because ointments blur vision for 20 minutes after the dose is administered, drops are preferable for most adults who need to read, drive, and perform other tasks that require clear vision immediately after dosing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients should respond to treatment within one to two days by showing a decrease in discharge, redness, and irritation. At this point it is reasonable to reduce the dose from four times daily to twice daily. Patients who do not respond should be referred to an ophthalmologist.

         For all contact lens wearers with bacterial conjunctivitis, we suggest antibiotic treatment due to the increased risk of keratitis and/or infection with gram-negative organisms. Fluoroquinolones are the preferred agent to treat bacterial conjunctivitis in contact lens wearers due to the high incidence of
         <em>
          Pseudomonas
         </em>
         infection. Patients should stop wearing contact lenses. If there is any corneal opacity or suspicion of keratitis, the patient should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist. Microbial keratitis is more likely if there is foreign body sensation or reduced vision (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6913.html" rel="external">
          "Complications of contact lenses", section on 'Infectious keratitis'

        </p>
        <p>
         If the diagnosis is bacterial conjunctivitis, contact lens wear can resume when the eye is white and has no discharge for 24 hours after the completion of antibiotic therapy, or, in the case of viral conjunctivitis, when the eye is white with no discharge. The lens case should be discarded and the lenses subjected to overnight disinfection or replaced if disposable.

         Patients must be told that the eye irritation and discharge may get worse for three to five days before getting better, that symptoms can persist for two to three weeks, and that use of any topical agent (antibiotics or antihistamine/decongestant) for that duration might result in irritation and toxicity, which can itself cause redness and discharge. Clinicians must be wary of trying one agent after another in patients with viral conjunctivitis who are expecting drugs to "cure" their symptoms. Patient education is often more effective than prolonged or additional therapies for patients who experience improvement but incomplete resolution of symptoms after a few days.

Although these are labelled for relief of itching due to seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, ketorolac is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), and post-market experience reveals that topical NSAIDs are associated with corneal adverse effect in some susceptible patients, which may become sight-threatening.

         The primary approach to toxic conjunctivitis is recognition and removal of the offending agent. Stopping as many topical agents as feasible is a good first step. However, glaucoma drops should not be stopped except by the prescribing clinician, as pressure rise may cause irreversible vision loss. Recovery may take weeks rather than days. With some agents, there is paradoxical rebound redness when agents are stopped, making adherence to medical advice difficult for patients. Patients in whom a glaucoma medication is thought to be the culprit, or those with severe symptoms or problematic rebound redness, should be referred to an ophthalmologist for management. (See

         The conjunctival surface regenerates rapidly from insults that precipitate noninfectious conjunctivitis, leading to spontaneous resolution of symptoms. Nevertheless, these patients may have symptom relief with the use of topical lubricants, which can be purchased over the counter as drops and ointments  (

          table 2

        </p>
        <p>
         Lubricant drops can be used as often as hourly for one to two days with no side effects. The ointment provides longer-lasting relief but blurs vision; thus, many patients use the ointment only at bedtime. It may be worthwhile to switch brands if a patient finds one brand of drop or ointment irritating since each preparation contains different active ingredients, vehicles, and preservatives.

         Patients with acute bacterial conjunctivitis usually respond to treatment within one to two days by showing a decrease in discharge, redness, and irritation.

          Work/school
         </strong>
         – Clinicians are often asked to advise patients and families or caregivers as to when it is safe to return to work or school. Bacterial and viral conjunctivitis are both highly contagious and spread by direct contact with secretions or contact with contaminated objects. Infected individuals should not share handkerchiefs, tissues, towels, cosmetics, linens, or eating utensils. The safest approach to prevent spread to others is to stay home until there is no longer any discharge, but this is not feasible for most students and for those who work outside the home. Most daycare centers and schools require that students receive 24 hours of topical therapy before returning to school. Such therapy will probably reduce the transmission of conjunctivitis due to bacterial infection but will do nothing to reduce the spread of viral infections.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         We suggest advising patients to consider that their problem is like a cold, and their decision to return to work or school should be similar to the one they would make in that situation. Those who have contact with the very old, the very young, and immune-compromised individuals should take care to avoid spread of infection from their eye secretions to these susceptible people.

          Sports
         </strong>
         – For bacterial conjunctivitis, patients should not return to playing sports until they have used an antibiotic for a minimum of 24 hours and had resolution of eye drainage. Clearance to return to play for viral conjunctivitis depends on the sport. Athletes who participate in sports that are individual and/or noncontact and which do not involve shared equipment (eg, cross-country running) can return when they feel able and can see clearly. If these athletes return before symptoms have resolved, they should be advised not to touch their eyes and to wash their hands frequently. Athletes who participate in contact sports, sports with shared equipment (eg, gymnastics), or water-based sports may return to play once daytime discharge has abated, typically after about five days.

          Causes
         </strong>
         – Conjunctivitis may be infectious (bacterial or viral) or noninfectious (allergic, toxic, dryness, and others). Most infectious conjunctivitis is probably viral; bacterial conjunctivitis is more common in children than in adults. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of conjunctivitis is made in a patient with a red eye and discharge only if the vision is normal (or unchanged) and there is no evidence of keratitis, iritis, or angle-closure glaucoma. Warning signs for alternative conditions that should prompt evaluation by an ophthalmologist are discussed above. (See

         <strong>
          Distinguishing between types
         </strong>
         – Distinguishing between bacterial, viral and allergic conjunctivitis can be achieved on the basis of history and physical examination. All etiologies can cause symptoms of the eyes being stuck closed in the morning. Helpful distinguishing characteristics are presented in the table and graphic  (

         <strong>
          Bacterial
         </strong>
         – Bacterial conjunctivitis should only be diagnosed in patients with thick purulent discharge that continues throughout the day and should be confirmed by a clinician examination. The discharge can generally be seen at the lid margins and at the corner of the eye  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef132406" href="/z/d/graphic/132406.html" rel="external">
          picture 1

          Viral
         </strong>
         – Viral conjunctivitis typically presents as injection, mucoid or serous discharge, and a burning or gritty feeling in one eye. It may be an isolated manifestation or part of a systemic viral illness. The second eye usually becomes involved within 24 to 48 hours; unilateral viral infection may occur. Usually there is profuse tearing rather than discharge; the latter may be present on close examination. The symptoms generally worsen for three to five days and resolve over one to two weeks. (See

          Allergic
         </strong>
         – Allergic conjunctivitis typically presents as bilateral redness, watery discharge, and itching. Itching is the cardinal symptom of allergy, distinguishing it from a viral etiology. Patients with allergic conjunctivitis often have a history of atopy, seasonal allergy, or specific allergy. (See

          Treatments to avoid
         </strong>
         – Avoid topical corticosteroids and topical NSAIDS – Ophthalmic corticosteroids (alone or in combination preparations) should not be prescribed by primary care clinicians for acute conjunctivitis; they can cause sight-threatening complications when used inappropriately.
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8591" href="/z/d/drug information/8591.html" rel="external">
          Ketorolac
         </a>
         should not be used to treat allergic conjunctivitis. Topical NSAIDS (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are associated with corneal adverse effect in susceptible patients. (See
         <a class="local">
          'No role for corticosteroid use'

         <strong>
          Infection control
         </strong>
         – Infection control and return to work or school – Bacterial and viral conjunctivitis are highly contagious. Advise patients to limit spread by avoiding direct contact with secretions or contaminated objects (eg, makeup, contact lenses). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Preventing contagion'

         For bacterial conjunctivitis, postpone return to school or work until 24 hours of treatment and resolution of discharge.
