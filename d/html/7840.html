         Exogenous hyperthyroidism is the term used to describe hyperthyroidism caused by ingestion of excessive amounts of thyroid hormone. It may be intentional (ie, suppressive doses of thyroxine to treat thyroid cancer) or inadvertent (ie, contamination of dietary supplements). When exogenous hyperthyroidism is due to the surreptitious ingestion of thyroid hormone, it is termed thyrotoxicosis factitia.
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of exogenous hyperthyroidism will be reviewed here. An overview of disorders that cause hyperthyroidism is found elsewhere. (See

         Patients who intentionally or accidentally (particularly children) take an overdose of thyroid hormone. Accidental overdose has been reported due to errors made by compounding pharmacies [

          3-7

          6
         </a>

         A novel form of exogenous hyperthyroidism is the ingestion of thyroid tissue inadvertently removed and ground up with neck muscle in slaughterhouses to prepare hamburger; this has resulted in at least two community outbreaks of thyrotoxicosis [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. The terms hamburger thyroiditis and hamburger hyperthyroidism were applied to these outbreaks because the clinical presentation mimicked that of painless thyroiditis (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7830.html" rel="external">
          "Painless thyroiditis"
         </a>
         ). Patients who ate large quantities of "thyroid burgers" became thyrotoxic for several weeks to months until their freezers were depleted, after which they had transient hypothyroidism. Subsequent case reports have described similar findings after ingestion of beef or sausage [
         <a href="#rid10">

         The symptoms and signs in patients who take excessive doses of thyroid hormone are similar to those in patients with hyperthyroidism from other causes, such as Graves' disease. The classic symptoms include weight loss, heat intolerance, tremor, palpitations, anxiety, increased frequency of bowel movements, and shortness of breath. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7833.html" rel="external">

         There are, however, two important exceptions:

         </span>
         Exophthalmos (ophthalmopathy) occurs only in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism because it is not caused by thyroid hormone per se. However, lid lag and lid retraction, signs of catecholamine excess, do occur. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7825.html" rel="external">

         There is usually no goiter because exogenous thyroid hormone in amounts sufficient to cause hyperthyroidism inhibits TSH secretion, resulting in thyroid atrophy. In patients with goiter given thyroid hormone in an attempt to reduce goiter size, however, the goiter may persist despite exogenous hyperthyroidism.

         (T4) overdose can cause acute hyperthyroidism. Myocardial infarction also can occur, especially in older adult patients, and seizures have rarely been described in children [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12-14
         </a>
         ]. In most cases, however, particularly in children (who ingested a parent's medication), accidental ingestion of many milligrams of T4 and the accompanying transient marked elevation in serum thyroxine (T4) concentrations cause few symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Chronic T4 overdose can cause chronic overt (low serum TSH, high free thyroxine [T4] and/or triiodothyronine [T3]) or subclinical (low serum TSH with normal free T4) hyperthyroidism. The skeleton and the cardiovascular system are the major target tissues adversely affected by chronic overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism, although abnormalities in other systems have been reported (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79602" href="/z/d/graphic/79602.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Overt hyperthyroidism is most clearly associated with accelerated bone remodeling, reduced bone density, osteoporosis, and an increase in fracture rate, especially in postmenopausal women. In some, but not all studies, even subclinical hyperthyroidism is also associated with low bone density in postmenopausal women. In addition, the frequency of atrial fibrillation is increased in older patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism, as it is in patients with overt hyperthyroidism. These topics are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See

         All patients with exogenous hyperthyroidism have low serum TSH concentrations. Serum T4 and/or T3 may be elevated or normal, depending upon the degree of hyperthyroidism and which thyroid hormone preparation was ingested. Serum thyroglobulin (Tg) is suppressed and 24-hour radioiodine uptake is low due to suppression of TSH secretion. Thyroidal artery blood flow on Doppler is also reduced.

         </span>
         The diagnosis of exogenous hyperthyroidism is based upon the clinical features, laboratory findings, and 24-hour radioiodine uptake. Patients with exogenous hyperthyroidism have classic biochemical findings (low TSH, elevated or normal free T4 and/or T3). The absence of goiter, a low serum thyroglobulin (Tg) concentration, and a low or undetectable 24-hour radioiodine uptake differentiate exogenous hyperthyroidism from other causes of hyperthyroidism.
        </p>
        <p>
         The serum concentrations of T4 and T3 may be useful in identifying the type of thyroid hormone ingestion [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. As an example, patients taking excessive amounts of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9563" href="/z/d/drug information/9563.html" rel="external">
          liothyronine

          levothyroxine
         </a>
         (T4) have high serum T4 and T3 concentrations, but the T4/T3 ratio is higher than that in most patients with spontaneously occurring hyperthyroidism. Conversely, patients taking

          thyroid extract

         In the setting of thyroid cancer or goiter, intentional intake of exogenous thyroid hormone is easily identified. A careful history may also reveal intentional intake of excessive doses of thyroid hormone to treat psychiatric disorders. In such cases, further evaluation is not necessary to diagnose exogenous hyperthyroidism. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7838.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Accidental ingestion of thyroid hormone (diet pills, contaminated meat) or surreptitious use of thyroid hormone (thyrotoxicosis factitia) is usually more difficult to detect. In these cases, further evaluation is needed to confirm the cause of hyperthyroidism. The initial evaluation typically includes measurement of radioiodine uptake. The findings on 24-hour radioiodine uptake can distinguish hyperthyroidism due to de novo synthesis of thyroid hormone (normal or high uptake) from either inflammation and destruction of thyroid tissue with release of preformed hormone into the circulation or an extrathyroidal source of thyroid hormone (nearly absent uptake). For patients with nearly absent uptake, we measure serum Tg to distinguish exogenous hyperthyroidism (low Tg) from all other causes of hyperthyroidism with nearly absent uptake (high Tg). Whenever serum Tg is measured, a test for anti-Tg antibodies should be performed at the same time (good laboratories do the latter first) because serum Tg measurements are falsely low in immunometric assays in the presence of anti-Tg antibodies.

          Nearly absent radioiodine uptake
         </strong>
         – The 24-hour radioiodine uptake in the thyroid is less than 1 percent in patients with exogenous hyperthyroidism due to the suppression of TSH secretion, except in patients with some autonomously functioning thyroid tissue. In addition to exogenous hyperthyroidism, other causes of hyperthyroidism with low or nearly absent 24-hour radioiodine uptake values include any of the different types of thyroiditis associated with release of preformed hormone from an inflamed gland, struma ovarii, and sometimes iodine-induced hyperthyroidism.

         In difficult cases where thyrotoxicosis factitia is suspected and Tg is either not suppressed potentially because of a goiter, or Tg is undetectable potentially because of anti-Tg antibodies, fecal T4 measurement may be useful. In one study, fecal T4 values were approximately 0.8 mcg/g (1 nmol/g) in normal subjects and were increased twofold in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism and 12- to 24-fold in patients with exogenous hyperthyroidism [

         Exogenous hyperthyroidism is the term used to describe hyperthyroidism caused by ingestion of excessive amounts of thyroid hormone. It may be intentional or inadvertent. It can occur in several clinical settings, including ingestion of excessive doses to treat thyroid cancer or to shrink the thyroid gland in patients with goiter, or through ingestion of weight-reducing dietary supplements containing

          Clinical features

         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         The symptoms and signs in patients who take excessive doses of thyroid hormone are similar to those in patients with hyperthyroidism from other causes and include weight loss, heat intolerance, tremor, palpitations, anxiety, increased frequency of bowel movements, and shortness of breath. Unless underlying thyroid disease is present, there is no goiter or ophthalmopathy. (See

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         The diagnosis of exogenous hyperthyroidism is based upon clinical manifestations (presence of hyperthyroid symptoms, absence of goiter), abnormal thyroid function tests (low TSH, elevated or normal free thyroxine [T4] and/or triiodothyronine [T3]), a low serum thyroglobulin (Tg) concentration, and a low or undetectable 24-hour radioiodine uptake. (See
         <a class="local">

          Treatment
         </strong>
         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Discontinuation or reduction in the dose of thyroid hormone is usually the only treatment needed for most patients. When therapy is stopped in patients taking thyroxine, serum T4 concentrations fall approximately 50 percent in seven days. T3 is cleared more rapidly (serum half-life approximately one day). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Treatment'
