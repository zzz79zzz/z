It is manifested by penile erection in males and vasocongestion of vaginal, clitoral, and breast tissue, along with vaginal lubrication, in females. Physiological arousal in genital tissue is prompted by both increased blood flow and nervous innervation, and further physical sexual activity leads to increases in overall muscle tone, heart rate, and respiration.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Plateau</strong> refers to the sensation of impending euphoric sexual release or orgasm.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Orgasm</strong> is the physical and emotional peak of sexual satisfaction, manifested by ejaculation in males and rhythmic contractions of the genital musculature in females.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Resolution</strong> involves a psychological and physical state of relaxation following orgasm in which genital tissues are generally refractory of further arousal and orgasm.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13732720"><span class="h2">Age-related changes in sexual function</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Normal aging is associated with a general decline in physiological sexual response, and variable declines in sexual activity.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3629023429"><span class="h3">Frequency of sexual activity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is a general decline in the frequency of sexual activity in males and females after the age of 65, but not as much as might be expected. In surveys, 50 to 80 percent of males and females over 60 continue to be sexually active, usually defined as having sexual intercourse at least once a month [<a href="#rid5">5-9</a>]. Older males tend to be more sexually active than older females, although sexual satisfaction among those active with a partner remains relatively high in males and females. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14605.html" rel="external">"Normal aging"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1486894695"><span class="h3">Influencing factors</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Physical health appears to be the most influential factor for sexual activity in males [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].

This 2- to 10-year decline of ovarian function (termed perimenopause) typically begins in a woman’s 40s and culminates in complete cessation of menses by the early 50s.

With aging, however, many males can experience important changes in bodily function that are linked to declines in testosterone production [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. As males age, there are gradual declines in sexual function that have variable impacts on sexual activity. Sexual desire remains relatively stable in most males. Erections are less reliable and durable, and require more stimulation to achieve and sustain. Ejaculation during orgasm involves decreased amounts of seminal fluid, and the refractory period between orgasms can increase by hours to days. With age, the total testosterone level in males drops by an average of 1.6 percent per year. Levels below 8 nmol/L are typically associated with symptoms including loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, loss of bone and muscle mass, loss of strength, fatigue, and even poor concentration and depression. Levels between 8 and 12 nmol/L are often symptomatic, but symptoms that occur with levels above 12 nmol/L are more likely due to other causes. By age 60, 20 percent of males have low testosterone levels, and this rises to 50 percent of males over age 80. [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]. Testosterone deficiency is discussed in detail separately.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13732727"><span class="h2">Psychologic response to age-related changes in males and females</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Aging can bring increased emotional maturity and a heightened capacity for intimacy that can enhance sexual relationships. Older couples may have greater privacy and more time for intimacy. Individuals who understand that certain changes in sexual function are normal are less fearful and better able to adapt. As an example, instead of dreading the effects of menopause, a woman may welcome the freedom from worry about contraception and unwanted pregnancy. Instead of focusing solely on sexual intercourse as the goal of sexuality, a man may be able to shift his focus to the pleasurable sensual intimacy of sexual foreplay. Couples who communicate well can adjust sexual practices in order to maintain or even improve upon previous levels of enjoyment [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p>Some individuals will react negatively to age-related changes, viewing them as harbingers of physical decline or sexual dysfunction. For males, declines in erectile function can be viewed as threatening to their sense of masculinity, and lead to excessive worry, anger, or even depression. Some females grieve the loss of potential motherhood at menopause, particularly if they never had children. These reactions may reinforce negative views about late-life sexuality being inappropriate or dangerous, and may lead to less frequent and less enjoyable sexual relations [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p>Men who have sex with men and females who have sex with females and couples face similar issues to heterosexuals in terms of age-associated changes in sexual function and sexual relationships. Several studies indicate that older individuals who identify as such feel high levels of satisfaction with both their identity and lifestyle and high levels of sexual satisfaction [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13732741"><span class="h2">Sexuality in long-term care settings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Compared with older adults living in the community, residents in long-term care settings are significantly less likely to be sexually active, although some residents are still active in most facilities [<a href="#rid25">25-27</a>]. Barriers to sexuality in long-term care include [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Loss of interest</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cognitive impairment/dementia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Poor health</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sexual dysfunction</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lack of partners</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lack of privacy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Negative attitudes of staff</p><p></p><p>Older individuals who have same sex intimacy in long-term care face additional challenges since they fear being rejected and neglected [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Both staff members and residents tend to have more negative views of same-sex intimacy [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>].</p><p>Long-term care facilities have the responsibility, however, to educate both staff and residents about the residents’ rights to privacy and to engage in intimate relationships [<a href="#rid27">27,31</a>]. There are many accommodations that can be provided, such as beauty services, private rooms for conjugal visits, and medical and psychiatric consultation for sexual dysfunction [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p>When there is concern about an resident’s capacity to consent to sexual activity, clinicians should determine how well the individual is able to understand the nature of the relationship, including any potential, associated risks, and to what degree they can avoid coercion or exploitation [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5083.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia"</a>.)</p><p>Assessment and management of inappropriate sexual behavior in patients in long-term care is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5082.html" rel="external">"Management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia", section on 'Sexually inappropriate behavior'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13732748"><span class="h2">Sexually transmitted diseases</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) is often overlooked among older patients but remains an important clinical issue. In the United States, individuals 65 years and older account for the smallest percentage of STDs, such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis, that are reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, rates have increased across all age groups, and in some locations, greater increases have occurred among older adults compared with younger individuals [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. As an example, rates of STDs among members older than 60 years in a health network increased by 23 percent over a three-year period compared with an 11 percent increase overall [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Furthermore, in 2018, 17 percent of new HIV infections reported to the CDC occurred in individuals 50 years and older [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].</p><p>Despite overall low prevalence rates, older people remain at risk for acquiring STDs. Factors potentially increasing risk in this population include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Many older people never received the sex education that has routinely been provided to younger individuals in recent decades.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The higher prevalence of STDs among younger people may lead to a false sense of safety among older couples, leading them to neglect safe-sex practices.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Barrier contraceptives may have lower rates of use among older adults compared to younger adults, because they are not needed in postmenopausal females to prevent pregnancy. A study of nearly 6000 individuals ages 14 to 94 found that 91 percent of older males and a majority of older females did not use a condom when having sex; some did not use one when they knew their partner had an STD [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p></p><p>Sexually transmitted diseases in the broader population are discussed in more detail separately.

Examples of causative illnesses that are more common in older adults include diabetic neuropathy [<a href="#rid37">37</a>], which can impair sexual arousal, and peripheral vascular disease [<a href="#rid38">38</a>], which can impair genital vasocongestion. Other major medical causes of sexual dysfunction include cancer, stroke, Parkinson disease, and pulmonary disease [<a href="#rid39">39-41</a>].</p><p>Secondary sexual dysfunction may result from fatigue, pain, physical disability, or some other effect of a medical illness. As examples, a man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may become short of breath during sexual activity, causing him to become less aroused. A woman with a history of cervical cancer who underwent surgery and radiation could have scarring and contractures of her vaginal tissue, resulting in pain during sex and subsequent loss of libido.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3901905"><span class="h3">Medications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Medications often play a role in precipitating sexual dysfunction, and can affect males and females at any point in the sexual response cycle [<a href="#rid42">42-44</a>]. Some of the most common culprits include antihypertensives (eg, beta-blockers, diuretics), antiandrogens, and many psychotropic medications, particularly antipsychotics and antidepressants [<a href="#rid44">44-46</a>].

If the clinician is embarrassed or uncomfortable asking questions about sexual function, it is unlikely that adequate assessment will occur. The clinician must be able to ask direct questions using common language, and to listen carefully and patiently, keeping in mind that older people will have many of the same sexual concerns as younger people [<a href="#rid58">58</a>]. An indispensable source of information about a sexual problem is the partner. The partner’s presence during an interview will help facilitate open communication with the affected partner.

The goal of the sexual status examination is to identify the presence and degree of problematic changes in sexual function across the stages of the sexual response cycle. Inherent to this examination is a sex history that inquires about an individual’s current sexual functioning, prior sexual experiences, attitudes towards sexuality, and the state of any current relationship.</p><p>Clinicians can increase their own comfort level with discussing these topics with patients by role-playing an interview alone or with a colleague, with a focus on using sexual terms in a comfortable and matter-of-fact way. Patients are often more relaxed during an interview when they see that the clinician is skilled and comfortable with the questions.

Many patients have internalized negative perspectives on late-life sexuality. The act of providing reassurance builds trust between patient and clinician, and this relationship will lay the basis for the patient feeling comfortable with being open about emotional reactions to the problem, and seeking follow-up treatment. Many treatments fail at this point; not because the treatment will not work, but because the patient and clinician never establish a solid working relationship, or because the patient is overcome with pessimism or doubt and refuses to engage in treatment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H627132898"><span class="h2">General treatment principles</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Specific treatments for disorders in sexual functioning in older adults do not differ significantly from the modalities used in younger adults; these treatments are discussed in detail separately.

Sometimes the clinician can provide a forum for the couple to discuss basic difficulties during sexual activity, and strategize on ways to improve them. The clinician should emphasize to the couple that sex can be more than just intercourse, and that physically pleasing each other can occur through massage and masturbation, and does not always have to be mutual. Couples often have to adapt sexual techniques and refocus more time on foreplay in order to preserve previous levels of sexual function and enjoyment.</p><p>Education about sexuality, sexually transmitted diseases, and safe sex practices should not be neglected in clinical care for older adults. Many are sexually active, but may be at risk due to knowledge deficits. Many older adults completed their schooling prior to the introduction of routine sexual education.
