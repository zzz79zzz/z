Although CEDs are predominantly used by law enforcement, they are also marketed to and used by civilians [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>There are no available comprehensive data on United States emergency department visits for CED injury. A literature review included 948 CED discharges and found that 17 percent resulted in an emergency department visit, but most injuries were mild, with only three hospital admissions [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. CEDs were less likely to cause injury (both to subject and law enforcement) compared with police dogs, batons, irritant sprays, or physical restraints. The reported injuries are most commonly from falls while incapacitated or barb penetration of particularly vulnerable anatomic structures [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. However, evidence is limited by inconsistent reporting, bias, and difficulty collecting data about at-risk subjects on whom the CED is more likely to be used.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1659044298"><span class="h1">CED TYPES, MECHANICS, AND PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3694247819"><span class="h2">Types</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>TASER is the CED overwhelmingly used by law enforcement worldwide  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef139875" href="/d/graphic/139875.html" rel="external">picture 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef139877" href="/d/graphic/139877.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). All TASERs rely on the same primary technology, while various other types of CEDs have been developed and produced, including stun guns and shock prods. Several companies market personal-use (ie, civilian) CEDs, the majority of which are designed for direct contact only and cannot be shot from a distance. There are no reports of any specific CED models or types having a higher risk profile to cause greater injury. The TASER 7, which became available in 2018, uses a differently designed dart  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef139874" href="/d/graphic/139874.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) that is removed with a separate plastic tool  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef139878" href="/d/graphic/139878.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>), unlike previous models that do not come with a tool for dart removal.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4091558942"><span class="h2">Mechanics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A TASER delivers pulsed, high-voltage, low-amperage, direct current at 45- to 110-microsecond durations. Voltages range from 1400 to 2600 V delivered to the body. A separate open-circuit voltage of up to 50,000 V is generated to arc through air or thick clothing but does not reach the body. Average currents range from 2 to 4 mA. The device is powered by two 3-volt batteries [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>CEDs are only effective while a circuit is complete. The CED is ineffective if one or both of the barbs never make contact or are caught in thick clothing. If a barb falls out of the skin at any point or if the CED does not maintain contact in stun drive mode, current delivery ceases. Although barbs embedded in light clothing can complete a circuit due to the high voltages involved, clothing frequently inhibits circuit completion.</p><p>The most commonly used CEDs discharge in a five-second cycle, after which the trigger must be pulled again to initiate a subsequent firing and cycle. Holding down the trigger during firing can extend the cycle beyond five seconds.</p><p>A TASER can be operated via the following two modes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dart (probe) mode – Darts  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef139873" href="/d/graphic/139873.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef139874" href="/d/graphic/139874.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) with 9- to 13-mm barbs are fired by compressed nitrogen and can reach a 6.4- to 11-meter range. Darts are projected at up to 55 meters per second, which is similar to the velocity of a BB gun. The fired barbs typically do not have enough kinetic energy to penetrate thick clothing or deeper than 6 mm through tissue [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The darts have a fishhook barb designed to keep them embedded. When a circuit is complete and while it remains intact, pulsed current is discharged for one cycle. Law enforcement and emergency medical services personnel are trained in dart removal, and most are removed in the field [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stun drive mode – The front of the weapon is pushed directly against the body. The electrodes make contact with the skin, passing current across a much shallower and shorter distance as compared with dart mode.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1122034864"><span class="h2">Physiologic effects</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CEDs are designed to induce incapacitation, either by causing involuntary muscle contraction or pain. The specific pulse and current captures alpha motor neurons, causing muscle contraction if the darts are sufficiently separated (ie, dart mode) or pain if they are close to each other (ie, stun drive mode).</p><p>In healthy persons, measured physiologic changes following CED discharge are not clinically significant [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. The systemic effects of involuntary muscle stimulation and pain from CED discharge can include catecholamine release, tachycardia, hypotension, decreases in minute ventilation, acidemia, and increased lactate and creatinine kinase concentrations [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. However, studies have found that these physiologic effects when caused solely by CED exposure are relatively mild and unlikely to cause significant acidemia, electrolyte disturbance, myocardial injury, or rhabdomyolysis [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. For example, volunteers at rest who received a 10-second exposure from a TASER 7 had a median lactate increase of 3 mmol/L and median pH decrease of 0.07, which both normalized within one hour of exposure [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Median creatine kinase (CK) concentrations did not change within the first hour but were mildly elevated to 142 U/L after 24 hours, which is consistent with results of prior studies in healthy volunteers at rest. There was no rise in troponin or potassium. The adrenergic effects induced by a CED discharge have been found to be similar to the stress response from physical exertion and other incapacitating measures during the law enforcement restraining process [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>The specific current deployed by CEDs is insufficient to generate a significant degree of electrothermal heat and does not affect the central nervous system. Although animal studies suggest potential arrhythmogenic risk when darts are placed close to the heart, this risk is considered to be very low in humans [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The physiology of electrical injury is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/175.html" rel="external">"Electrical injuries and lightning strikes: Evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H770898239"><span class="h1">MECHANISM AND CLINICAL FEATURES OF INJURY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H599071094"><span class="h2">Overview</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Systematic and comprehensive reviews of CED-related injury have found low risk of adverse events when used on a healthy person [<a href="#rid4">4,7,11</a>]. Primary injuries from CEDs are mostly due to barb penetration when darts embed in certain vulnerable anatomic locations, thus injuring the underlying structures. Once incapacitated by the CED discharge, the patient may fall and sustain a secondary injury. Significant injury from the electrical current itself or directly from muscle contraction is unlikely. CED use has been mentioned in high-profile, restraint-related sudden death cases; however, the CED itself does not appear to be the direct cause since current-induced arrhythmias and metabolic acidosis in the absence of other etiologies are not reported [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1744757505"><span class="h2">Secondary injury from fall</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Secondary injuries can occur from falls after muscle incapacitation.<sup> </sup>Intracranial hemorrhage and cervical spine fractures may be more likely since these falls occur without the typical reflexive protective mechanisms (eg, outstretched hands) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Long bone fractures from CED-related falls have not been reported.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1804348364"><span class="h2">Injury from dart penetration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Dart-related injuries are rare, but there are reports of penetration in anatomic locations without thick overlying tissue such as the skull, facial bones, eye, throat, chest wall, scrotum, and fingers [<a href="#rid3">3,13</a>]. Newer models have darts  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef139874" href="/d/graphic/139874.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) with higher mass and kinetic energy, which could lead to an increase in depth and extent of penetrative injuries [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. There are no reports of infections secondary to dart punctures [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Skull and face –<strong> </strong>A study on polyurethane mannequin heads found that skull penetration (as much as 6 mm) is possible and more likely to occur at shorter firing distances (&lt;2 meters) [<a href="#rid13">13,16</a>]. Rare frontal and facial bone penetrations without neurologic sequelae have been reported [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Eyes –<strong> </strong>The eye and surrounding structures are particularly vulnerable to injury from dart penetration. In a study of 17 CED-related eye injuries, 71 percent had a globe rupture, 59 percent had retinal detachment, and 88 percent required operative management [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].<strong> </strong>Damage to the lacrimal structure has also been reported [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Throat – There is one report of tracheal penetration with associated pneumomediastinum [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chest – There is one report of pneumothorax related to possible chest penetration [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Scrotum – Testicular penetrations have been rarely reported without significant immediate injury [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fingers – Finger penetrations causing fracture and tendon injuries have been rarely reported [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2002467365"><span class="h2">Impact of muscle contraction</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Injury to surrounding structures</strong> – There are isolated case reports of vertebral body compression fractures without direct trauma in volunteers modeling for CED demonstration, postulated to be secondary to muscular contraction [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rhabdomyolysis</strong> – CED use has been associated with rhabdomyolysis, but the circumstances leading to the need for CED use (eg, agitation, intoxication, prolonged restraint, isometric muscle contraction) likely contribute more to the muscle breakdown compared with the contractions induced by the CED current itself, which causes only a small increase in creatine kinase (CK) in physiologic studies. (See <a class="local">'Physiologic effects'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Metabolic acidosis</strong> – It is possible that in certain circumstances, the relatively limited physiologic changes from CED discharge could increase the risk of metabolic acidosis (and ultimately sudden cardiac death if allowed to progress untreated) during restraint. Hyperadrenergic individuals undergoing prolonged restraint may not have enough reserve to tolerate these changes [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/139216.html" rel="external">"Restraint-related cardiac arrest: Pathogenesis, strategies for prevention, and management for hospital clinicians"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1460223547"><span class="h2">Electrical and thermal injuries are unlikely</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Significant primary electrical injury and electrothermal burns are extremely unlikely because the electrical energy produced by CEDs penetrates only superficially, targeting localized skeletal muscle motor neurons and having little effect elsewhere [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Deep electrothermal injuries, such as from high-voltage exposure, have not been reported to occur with CED electrical currents. There is no risk of electrical injury to someone touching a person who receives a CED discharge.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Arrythmias</strong> – Although cardiac arrest and stable arrhythmias have been reported to occur after CED exposure, there is insufficient evidence that CED electrical discharge directly leads to the arrhythmia. Many human studies have found no direct effect on the heart. The potential for arrhythmogenicity has been demonstrated under certain circumstances in swine models, but extrapolation of these findings is limited by differences in physiology and anatomy [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Continuous cardiac monitoring during CED discharge in volunteers has demonstrated only sinus tachycardia, and an analysis of the reported cases of associated ventricular fibrillation suggested the CED was not directly causative [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">CED discharge is unlikely to interfere with a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). These devices have built-in shielding protecting them from electrical noise. In order to trigger a shock, an ICD requires longer than the five-second duration of a CED cycle. Case reports exist of ICDs reading CED activity as ventricular fibrillation and charging but not delivering a shock because repeat sensing after the CED cycle ended recognized the native heart rhythm. Theoretically, firing of repeated CED cycles could lead to an inappropriately delivered shock [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Burns </strong>– Minor superficial burns can occur from electrical arcing during stun drive use  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef139882" href="/d/graphic/139882.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>).

Significant injuries are rare and usually from associated trauma. Embedded darts are typically removed by law enforcement, and most individuals exposed to a CED will not seek medical care. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Types, mechanics, and physiologic effects of CEDs</strong> – TASER  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef139875" href="/d/graphic/139875.html" rel="external">picture 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef139877" href="/d/graphic/139877.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) is the trade name of the most commonly used CED, which can fire darts  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef139873" href="/d/graphic/139873.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef139874" href="/d/graphic/139874.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) from a distance (dart mode) or be pushed against the subject's skin (stun drive mode). Personal-use (ie, civilian) CEDs are designed for stun drive mode only and cannot be shot from a distance. CED darts deliver pulsed, high-voltage, low-amperage, direct current that causes involuntary muscle contraction and pain by capturing alpha motor neurons. Muscle stimulation can cause catecholamine release, acidemia, and creatine kinase (CK) release that is not clinically significant in healthy subjects. (See <a class="local">'CED types, mechanics, and physiologic effects'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical features of potential injuries</strong> –<strong> </strong>The<strong> </strong>CED electrical current itself or muscle contraction is unlikely to directly injure a healthy person. Primary injuries from CEDs are mostly due to barb penetration when darts embed in certain vulnerable anatomic locations such as the skull, face, eyes, throat, scrotum, and fingers. Once incapacitated by the CED discharge, the patient may fall and sustain a secondary injury. CED use has been associated with rhabdomyolysis, but the circumstances leading to the need for CED use (eg, agitation, intoxication, prolonged restraint, isometric muscle contraction) likely contribute to most of the muscle breakdown. It is also possible that in certain circumstances, the relatively limited physiologic changes from CED discharge could increase the risk of metabolic acidosis (and ultimately sudden cardiac death) during restraint. (See <a class="local">'Mechanism and Clinical Features of Injury'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>History and examination</strong> – Ask law enforcement why the patient was brought for medical care, where the barbs penetrated and if they were all removed, the number of five-second cycles, and the details of the restraining process.

In a patient with a prolonged (&gt;15-second) exposure, obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG), blood gas, lactate, electrolytes, troponin, and CK. If there was difficulty in removing the dart or the dart appears embedded in bone, obtain a radiograph of the area to make sure there are no retained fragments or to evaluate the location of the barb, respectively. (See <a class="local">'Laboratory and imaging studies'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> –<strong> </strong>Assess and stabilize airway, breathing, and circulation.
