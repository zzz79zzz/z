         Diagnosis and treatment of progressive cognitive impairment in the younger adult requires a different approach than that of the older adult. In particular, the differential diagnosis is much broader and often requires a more extensive evaluation that includes consideration of both common and rare disorders. Nevertheless, the most common causes of early-onset dementia are the same in younger and older adults: Alzheimer disease (AD), vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
        </p>
        <p>
         Early and rapid evaluation in this population is critical. The financial impact on the person and family can be devastating, as these are adults in their prime working years. Establishment of a clear diagnosis can help with distribution of government-based resources. The impact on spouses or partners, children, and other family members is significant.
        </p>
        <p>
         The epidemiology, etiology, evaluation, and diagnosis of early-onset dementia will be reviewed here. A more general approach to adults with cognitive impairment or dementia and disease-specific diagnosis and management are presented elsewhere.

         Several definitions for dementia exist, but a commonly used framework is one provided by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). According to the DSM-5, dementia is defined as significant acquired cognitive impairment in one or more cognitive domains (eg, learning and memory, language, executive function, complex attention, perceptual-motor function, social cognition) that represents a significant decline from previous baseline and interferes with independence in daily activities  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91276" href="/z/d/graphic/91276.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5083.html" rel="external">
          "Evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia", section on 'Criteria for dementia'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         While this definition recognizes multiple different cognitive domains, a decline in memory is one of the earliest and most prominent features of Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia and most other forms of dementia. A prominent exception is frontotemporal dementia (FTD), in which memory may be relatively preserved in relation to other cognitive domains such as language function or social cognition, at least initially. For most forms of dementia, however, memory and language dysfunction are generally always present.

         Although terminology varies, we consider early-onset dementia to refer to cases of dementia occurring in adults ranging from 18 to 65 years of age. Some authors further subdivide early-onset dementia, using young-onset dementia to refer to cases with an age of onset between 18 and 45 years. This distinction is somewhat arbitrary, however, and most of the causative diseases do not follow such strict age cutoffs. A common approach to differential diagnosis, including consideration of rare diseases, should be followed regardless of the age of the younger adult with new cognitive change.

         </span>
         The prevalence of early-onset dementia is estimated at 40 to 119 per 100,000 individuals globally, although no broad-based studies have been performed [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-7
         </a>
         ]. Published studies have used different methodology, inclusion criteria, and age groups. Patients with traumatic brain injury, Down syndrome, and certain types of vascular disease are major patient groups that may or may not be included in these studies.
        </p>
        <p>
         Several population-based studies illustrate the frequency and range of diagnoses most often responsible for early-onset dementia:

         An epidemiologic study in four London boroughs identified 185 patients with an onset of dementia between 30 to 64 years of age [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Approximately 55 percent were felt to have a single progressive neurodegenerative etiology, predominantly Alzheimer disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), dementia related to Parkinson disease (PD), and corticobasal degeneration (including corticobasal syndrome and many other phenotypes) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The remaining 45 percent of patients had the following etiologies: vascular-related cognitive change, alcohol-related cognitive change, Huntington disease (HD), cognitive impairment resulting from multiple sclerosis (MS), prion diseases, dementia related to Down syndrome (predominantly AD), and unknown/unclassified.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The four most common etiologies in the cohort were AD (34 percent), vascular dementia (18 percent), FTD (12 percent), and alcohol-related dementia (10 percent). Notably, the prevalence of dementia doubled every five years after age 35.

         Neurodegenerative disease accounted for approximately one-third of cases in a retrospective review of all 17- to 45-year-old patients given a diagnosis of dementia at a tertiary referral center over an 11-year period [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. This was followed by autoimmune/inflammatory disease (21 percent), unknown causes (18 percent), and metabolic disease, including mitochondrial and storage diseases (11 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Among the neurodegenerative diseases, FTD accounted for the largest proportion (42 percent) and represented 13 percent of the entire cohort. AD accounted for only 5 percent of those with neurodegenerative disease and 2 percent of the total cohort. This analysis specifically excluded patients with static encephalopathy from traumatic brain injury, acute cerebrovascular events, and patients with Down syndrome.

         Other studies in Japan, Sweden, and elsewhere have also found that AD, FTD, and vascular dementia are the most common dementia etiologies in this age range [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6,8

        <p>
         Risk factors for early-onset dementia may vary according to the underlying etiology of the dementia. Although genetic etiologies are more common in early-onset dementia compared with late-onset dementia, the majority of cases of both early-onset and late-onset dementia (excluding autosomal dominant AD, FTD, and HD) do not have an identifiable monogenetic cause.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is a higher rate of vascular disease in patients with early-onset dementia of any type. Many of the risk factors for early-onset dementia identified in population-based studies relate to increased vascular risk, including stroke, transient ischemic attack, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic alcohol use, and drug intoxication [

          Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)

         – There is accumulating evidence that repeated mild traumatic brain injuries can contribute to a condition termed "chronic traumatic encephalopathy" (CTE). Neuropathology is consistent with a tauopathy, with an anatomic distribution involving superficial cortical layers that is distinct from that seen in AD. CTE has been described in professional sport settings, combat-related injuries, and after motor vehicle accidents. It likely also encompasses what has been referred to as "dementia pugilistica," a late-emerging dementia in boxers. Symptoms typically include progressive cognitive impairment and neuropsychological symptoms (behavior, personality changes, depression, and suicidality); parkinsonism and other speech and gait abnormalities have also been described.

         Many younger adults complain of memory loss that can be attributed to psychosocial stressors, multitasking, and a distracted thought process. In some cases, there is comorbid depression or anxiety that may be exacerbating the symptoms. Memory complaints in such cases are usually disproportionate to performance on objective testing. These individuals can generally be distinguished from those with dementia by history, examination, cognitive testing, and serial follow-up.

         Psychiatric illnesses, in particular depression, can manifest with cognitive impairment that is sometimes more prominent than mood symptoms. In a longitudinal study of 226 adults &lt;65 years of age referred to a tertiary care clinic for evaluation of suspected dementia and followed for a median of five years, psychiatric disease accounted for 25 percent of primary diagnoses [

Neurocognitive dysfunction in depression is generally mild and marked by a greater number of subjective complaints rather than objective findings. In older adult patients, memory problems may be mistaken for dementia ("pseudodementia"); these problems often abate with successful treatment.

Outpatient follow-up may be necessary once the index illness has been adequately treated to determine whether cognitive function has returned to normal; interview of caregivers and other informants about premorbid function is also critical.

         The clinical assessment of a patient with suspected early-onset dementia is similar to that of an older adult but often needs to be extended to detect a broader range of diseases than the common neurodegenerative dementias. Although Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common etiology of dementia in adults presenting both under and over the age of 65 years, the younger population with dementia is enriched with a wider range of rare and genetic disorders that may have implications for both family counseling and emerging therapies.

         The initial appointment in a patient with suspected dementia should focus upon the history. Family members or someone who knows the patient well must be available to give an adequate history of cognitive and behavioral changes. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for the diagnosis of dementia (major neurocognitive disorder) are shown in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91276" href="/z/d/graphic/91276.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The history should establish the type of cognitive impairment, the most prominent domains affected (eg, learning and memory, language, visuospatial function, executive function, social cognition), any accompanying behavioral or personality changes, the time course of symptoms, and the degree of functional impairment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other important historical features include headaches (as often occur in vascular causes of dementia, including cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy [CADASIL]), stroke-like symptoms (as occur in multiple sclerosis [MS], mitochondrial disease, and vascular disease), underlying neoplasm (suggesting possible paraneoplastic disease), multiple organ system dysfunction (mitochondrial and metabolic disorders), and a history of significant head injury (chronic traumatic encephalopathy [CTE]).
        </p>
        <p>
         A particular focus on family history is important. Many of the causes of early-onset dementia are familial. A history of cognitive decline at an early age in a parent (or perhaps a debilitating psychiatric illness) could indicate the presence of a familial form of AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Huntington disease (HD), other heritable neurodegenerative dementias, or neurometabolic disease, including adult-onset leukodystrophies.

         Patients with early-onset dementia should undergo a complete physical and neurologic examination. A general physical examination is important, as many forms of early-onset dementia lead to or are associated with multisystem dysfunction  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef99871" href="/z/d/graphic/99871.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Eye examination is important to look for Kayser-Fleischer rings (seen in Wilson disease), retinitis pigmentosa (as seen in neuropathy, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa [NARP], a form of mitochondrial disease), and ophthalmoplegia as seen in many adult-onset mitochondrial disorders. Patients with MS may have an afferent pupillary defect and optic disc pallor from prior optic neuritis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cardiac examination may reveal signs of heart failure or arrhythmia, which may be seen in mitochondrial disease and Wilson disease. Abdominal examinations showing hepatomegaly and other sequelae of liver dysfunction can be seen in Wilson disease and mitochondrial disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         Facial nerve palsy and other cranial neuropathies can be seen in patients with neurosarcoidosis and some infectious causes of encephalopathy. Whipple disease can cause oculomasticatory myorhythmia, ie, characteristic rhythmic rapid muscle contractions around the mouth in coordination with pendular eye movements.
        </p>
        <p>
         Careful assessment of motor function can be essential to diagnosis. Subtle signs of parkinsonism may be present in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or Parkinson disease (PD) dementia. Asymmetry in motor function, whether frank weakness or subtle upper motor neuron signs, is often present in CADASIL, MS, vascular dementia, and mitochondrial disease (eg, mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes [MELAS]). Myoclonus can be seen in prion disease and mitochondrial disease (eg, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers [MERRF]).
        </p>
        <p>
         Movement disorders are quite common in a variety of diseases that manifest early-onset dementia; suggestive features may include resting tremor (DLB and PD dementia), a wing-beating tremor (Wilson disease), and chorea (HD). Sensory examination can reveal a peripheral neuropathy, which can be present in sarcoidosis and mitochondrial disease, among others.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cerebellar ataxia in a patient with early-onset dementia requires special attention. Alcoholic dementia should be a primary consideration. Differential diagnosis beyond this includes neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple system atrophy cerebellar subtype (olivopontocerebellar degeneration) and prion disease (eg, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome). Other associations include AD associated with

         The majority of patients with a slow, insidious disease course and "pure" cognitive decline by history and examination will have a neurodegenerative dementia, particularly if routine MRI is unremarkable or shows only mild atrophy. The primary goal of further testing in such patients is to improve diagnostic certainty as to the type of dementia. As in older adults, the most common etiologies are Alzheimer disease (AD), vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Additional testing may include cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for amyloid and tau, functional neuroimaging (eg, amyloid positron emission tomography [PET,] 18-F fluorodeoxyglucose-PET [FDG-PET]), and focused genetic testing.

         Additional tests that may be helpful in patients with suggestive clinical symptoms include CT angiogram or magnetic resonance angiogram for evaluation of suspected vasculitis, FDG-PET to assess any pattern of abnormal metabolism in suspected FTD or other neurodegenerative dementias, and amyloid PET to identify early-onset dementia caused by AD [

         Brain biopsy is reserved for patients in whom all diagnostic tests have been exhausted and failed to identify a cause. This includes careful consideration of neurometabolic diseases, which can be diagnosed by metabolic and genetic testing in the vast majority of cases and do not require brain biopsy for diagnosis. Neuropathologic tissue diagnosis is most warranted when a reversible or treatable condition is suspected, or if a potentially harmful treatment is being considered [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59

         Genetic testing may be helpful in establishing a cause for early-onset dementia in selected patients. The cost of testing has come down substantially, and many panels for common AD and FTD mutations are affordable (hundreds of dollars or less in many cases). Other comprehensive panels can come at high cost. A clear family history should be documented in suspected cases, with the caveat that a family history might not always be apparent or available because of censoring by premature death, small family size, uncertain parentage, de novo mutations, and incomplete penetrance.
        </p>
        <p>
         The decision to pursue genetic testing is highly individualized and depends on a variety of factors, including the age of the patient, the presence or absence of additional family members who might be at risk, the cost of the test and insurance coverage, and whether there are other affected family members. Among the neurodegenerative dementias, genetic testing is most often pursued for CADASIL, Huntington disease (HD), autosomal-dominant forms of AD, and patients with FTD, particularly when there is concomitant motor neuron disease. Genetic testing is also available and useful in the diagnosis of an increasing number of adult-onset leukodystrophies and other neurometabolic diseases. (See

Many illnesses have specific treatments available, which underscores the importance of a thorough diagnostic evaluation. For patients with a rapidly progressive dementia and an unrevealing diagnostic evaluation, many experts recommend consideration of high-dose steroids as empiric treatment for a possible autoimmune process, even if testing has been negative [

         Dementia refers to progressive cognitive impairment in one or more cognitive domains, most often memory, that represents a significant decline from previous baseline and interferes with functional independence.

         Early-onset dementia refers to cases of dementia occurring in adults ranging from 18 to 65 years of age. (See

         <strong>
          Causes
         </strong>
         – Although genetic etiologies are more common in early-onset dementia compared with late-onset dementia, the majority of cases of both early-onset dementia and late-onset dementia do not have an identifiable monogenetic cause. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Causes of early-onset dementia'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Similar to older adults, the most common etiologies in younger patients are Alzheimer disease (AD), vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Epidemiology'

          Dementia mimics
         </strong>
         – Dementia should be distinguished from symptoms of memory loss or personality and behavioral change that are nonprogressive or provoked by underlying systemic illness, medication, psychiatric disorder, or structural brain pathology. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Initial evaluation
         </strong>
         – The clinical assessment of a patient with early-onset dementia is similar to that of an older adult but often needs to be extended to detect a broader range of diseases than the common neurodegenerative dementias.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The information gained from the initial evaluation, which should include a detailed history, physical and neurologic examination, cognitive assessment, basic laboratories, and structural neuroimaging, will guide further testing. (See

          Additional testing
         </strong>
         – The pace of the illness and the presence or absence of additional neurologic and systemic features determine which additional tests are indicated. (See

         Most patients with a slow disease course and "pure" cognitive decline will have a neurodegenerative dementia, particularly if MRI is unremarkable. Further testing in such patients may improve diagnostic certainty as to the type of dementia and may include cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for amyloid and tau, functional neuroimaging (eg, amyloid positron emission tomography [PET,] 18-F fluorodeoxyglucose-PET [FDG-PET]), and focused genetic testing.

         Patients with a rapidly progressive course should routinely undergo lumbar puncture, EEG if there is clinical suspicion for seizures, and selected laboratory studies. A search for occult neoplasm is indicated if limbic encephalitis is suspected. Prion and other infectious diseases are also considerations.
