(See <a class="local">'Importance of multidisciplinary teams'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3158333640"><span class="h2">Location</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients who undergo this procedure are transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU; surgical tracheostomy) or already reside in the ICU (percutaneous tracheostomy). Occasionally, alert individuals who are able to protect their airway and have no need for aggressive airway clearance or mechanical ventilation may initially be cared for in a monitored non-ICU setting by health care workers knowledgeable in tracheostomy care (eg, high-dependency unit or ear, nose, and throat oncologic unit).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2155875499"><span class="h2">Immediate care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For immediate postoperative care, the following is reasonable:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We measure vital signs, inquire about postoperative pain, inspect the stoma for bleeding, and examine the neck and torso for subcutaneous air that might suggest pneumomediastinum/pneumothorax. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/131519.html" rel="external">"Tracheostomy in adults: Techniques and intraoperative complications", section on 'Pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum from a false tract'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When a complication such as pneumothorax is suspected, we perform a chest radiograph and bedside thoracic ultrasound [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We perform tracheostomy tube suctioning every two to three hours and also as needed, for airway clearance and to monitor for bleeding. (See <a class="local">'Bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the cuff is inflated, we check cuff pressure to ensure that it is maintained between 20 and 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, although some experts target 25 to 35 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1644.html" rel="external">"Complications of the endotracheal tube following initial placement: Prevention and management in adult intensive care unit patients", section on 'Maintain optimal cuff pressure'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the patient is mechanically ventilated, we resume original ventilator settings once sedation and paralysis medications have worn off (one to four hours, sometimes longer). We inspect ventilator settings and graphics to ensure that volumes and airway pressures are similar to or lower than those obtained prior to tracheostomy placement  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef123028" href="/d/graphic/123028.html" rel="external">table 2</a>); notably, airway resistance, peak inspiratory pressures, and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (ie, auto-PEEP) may decrease after tracheostomy. We do not actively engage patients in ventilator weaning until 24 hours after tracheostomy placement, provided no complications have occurred. An arterial blood gas is <strong>not</strong> typically obtained. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1652.html" rel="external">"Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1650.html" rel="external">"Initial weaning strategy in mechanically ventilated adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We keep an endotracheal tube and "back-up" tracheostomy tubes at the bedside in case of accidental tracheostomy dislodgement. Ideally, one "back-up" tracheostomy tube should have identical dimensions to the one in place and another should be narrower than the one in place.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For ventilated patients, we also generally remove the inner cannula (if a dual-cannula tracheostomy was placed) and ventilate through a single lumen, unless the inner cannula is needed to connect to the ventilator. For those who do not require mechanical ventilation, the inner cannula may remain in place, provided the patient is comfortably tolerating it.

(See <a class="local">'Changing a tracheostomy tube'</a> below.)</p><p>Regular maintenance over a longer period (weeks to months) involves daily cleaning of the inner cannula, routine tracheostomy exchanges, stomal care, daily tracheostomy dressings, daily monitoring of cuff pressure (20 to 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>0), tracheal suctioning when indicated, and humidification of oxygen. (See <a class="local">'Changing a tracheostomy tube'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H116567077"><span class="h1">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Minor complications from tracheostomy are frequent (eg, pain, minor bleeding), but serious complications are uncommon. One prospective series found an inpatient complication rate of 47 percent among 1000 tracheostomies performed in a single center over the course of a year [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. However, the majority of these were minor. In the same series, the complication rate was lower (15 percent) in outpatients than in inpatients who underwent tracheostomy. Although not rigorously studied, the complication rate associated with tracheostomy may be increased in patients with a body mass index ≥35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Tracheostomy is frequently associated with hospital readmission (approximately 33 percent) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. However, this is often due to the underlying disease as opposed to complications of the procedure itself.</p><p>Postoperative complications occur early or late following tracheostomy. While there is no consensus on how to define early or late, we typically consider complications that occur early as those seen within the first week to 10 days after tracheostomy, while we consider late complications as those that occur after this period.</p><p>Intraoperative complications are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/131519.html" rel="external">"Tracheostomy in adults: Techniques and intraoperative complications", section on 'Intraoperative complications'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3761546763"><span class="h2">Early (within 7 to 10 days)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common acute complications of tracheostomy (ie, during the first week to 10 days) include hemorrhage, obstruction, pneumothorax, and infection. Accidental decannulation (ie, dislodgement) is a particularly serious complication when it occurs early, since there is an increased risk of airway loss compared with decannulation after one week when the tracheocutaneous tract is epithelialized.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H785469537"><span class="h3">Bleeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Minor bleeding from the stoma site is common after tracheostomy and is more commonly encountered in those with a bleeding diathesis (eg, platelet count less than 50 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L and the presence of a coagulopathy) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>Bleeding should be monitored by checking the stoma site frequently, observing the quality of secretions on tracheal suctioning, and by recording how often the dressing needs to be changed. In most cases, minor bleeding resolves by itself after a few days.</p><p>Although rare, significant bleeding (eg, ongoing saturation of dressings, continued frank bleeding) may require revision of the tracheostomy and search for the source of bleeding after any bleeding diathesis has been addressed.</p><p>Bleeding due to the development of a tracheoarterial fistula is a complication that can be catastrophic. While it can occur during the early phase, it is more commonly encountered approximately three to four weeks after the tracheostomy placement. (See <a class="local">'Tracheoarterial fistula'</a> below.)</p><p>Bleeding rates may be lower in those who undergo percutaneous rather than surgical tracheostomy. One meta-analysis of 17 randomized trials reported lower rates of bleeding in patients who underwent a percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy compared with patients who underwent surgical tracheostomy (odds ratio [OR] 0.29, 95% CI 0.12-0.75 [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]). By contrast, two other meta-analyses reported no difference in major bleeding between the two procedures [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p>Management of pharmacologic anticoagulants periprocedurally is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1312.html" rel="external">"Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/131519.html" rel="external">"Tracheostomy in adults: Techniques and intraoperative complications", section on 'Checklists, medication adjustment, infection control, cuff inflation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3719919352"><span class="h3">Obstruction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Obstruction due to inspissated secretions or blood can occur in the early (or late) postoperative period. To avoid this complication, we promote the use of protocols that advocate for regular tracheal suctioning, humidified oxygen, and scheduled daily cleaning or replacement of the inner cannula.</p><p>Tracheostomy tubes can also become partially obstructed by the posterior membranous trachea following initial placement, although symptomatic obstruction is uncommon [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. This complication appears to be related, in part, to the experience of the clinician performing the procedure and can occur even a week after tube placement [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>].</p><p>Rarely, obstruction can occur due to partial displacement of the tracheostomy tube or complete displacement into a false tract. (See <a class="local">'Tracheostomy tube dislodgement'</a> below.)</p><p>The approach to obstruction is similar to that in patients with suspected obstruction of an endotracheal tube (ETT), which is discussed in detail separately (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1633.html" rel="external">"Assessment of respiratory distress in the mechanically ventilated patient", section on 'Obstruction'</a>). In brief, when a tracheostomy tube becomes obstructed, obstructing equipment should be removed from the tracheostomy itself including ventilator circuit, a cap, or speaking valves (see <a class="local">'Techniques'</a> below and <a class="local">'Speech devices'</a> below). The inner cannula, if present, should also be removed and inspected. A suction catheter should be placed into the tracheostomy tube and passed into the trachea. These maneuvers should relieve most episodes of obstruction. If the obstruction cannot be removed from the tracheostomy tube itself, the tracheostomy tube may need to be removed and replaced or an ETT placed. (See <a class="local">'Changing a tracheostomy tube'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H115347316"><span class="h3">Subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The incidence of subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax following tracheostomy is 1.4 and 0.8 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. This can occur from the creation of a false tract anterior to the trachea during placement or replacement or from accidental perforation of the posterior tracheal wall during percutaneous tracheostomy (eg, from the guiding wire or dilator). Management is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/131519.html" rel="external">"Tracheostomy in adults: Techniques and intraoperative complications", section on 'Pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum from a false tract'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/131519.html" rel="external">"Tracheostomy in adults: Techniques and intraoperative complications", section on 'Esophageal perforation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2333176761"><span class="h3">Infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mild cellulitis at the stoma site and tracheitis are the most common infections encountered after tracheostomy placement.</p><p>In general, these infections are minor and are treated with good wound care, regular cleaning of the stoma site, tracheal suctioning, and appropriate daily dressing changes. Antibiotics are not generally needed.</p><p>Rare infections that require antibiotics include stomal abscess formation, mediastinitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis of the sternoclavicular joint, and necrotizing fasciitis [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7014.html" rel="external">"Postoperative mediastinitis after cardiac surgery", section on 'Treatment'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7666.html" rel="external">"Septic arthritis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/114350.html" rel="external">"Nonvertebral osteomyelitis in adults: Treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7662.html" rel="external">"Necrotizing soft tissue infections"</a>.)</p><p>Infection rates may be lower in patients who undergo percutaneous rather than surgical tracheostomy. In two meta-analyses of randomized trials, percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy decreased wound infections compared with surgical tracheostomy (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.16-0.49) [<a href="#rid9">9,11</a>]. A separate meta-analysis of 29 randomized and nonrandomized studies reported a similar reduction in the rate of wound infection with percutaneous tracheostomy [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Although the reason for lower infection rates is unknown, it is thought that the snugly fitting stomal tissue tract around the tracheostomy tube may be less prone to stomal infection.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4074210587"><span class="h3">Tracheostomy tube dislodgement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Accidental decannulation is not uncommon, with reported rates up to 15 percent [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>]. The tracheostomy tube can be displaced or dislodged during turns, procedures, or transport, and bouts of excessive coughing, or can be removed by the patient.</p><p>Some data suggest that this complication may be higher in those who undergo a percutaneous tracheostomy compared with patients who undergo surgical tracheostomy [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>Risk factors include mental status change, traumatic brain injury, increased secretions, recent tracheostomy changes, and increased neck thickness [<a href="#rid19">19,22</a>].</p><p>This complication can be minimized by proper security ties that anchor the flange of the tracheostomy tube to the tracheostomy collar, which encircles the neck. While we do not typically use "stay sutures" to secure the tracheostomy tube to the skin of the neck, this mechanism is used by some experts to avoid dislodgement when staff are poorly experienced in tracheostomy care.</p><p>If accidental decannulation occurs within the first 10 days after tracheostomy tube placement and the patient is experiencing respiratory distress, we typically do <strong>not</strong> replace it with a new tracheostomy tube. We adopt this approach because this maneuver risks generating a false tract anterior to the trachea, since the tract is not considered as mature at this point. The safest approach is to intubate patients orally with an ETT and inflate the cuff distal to the stoma site, provided oral intubation is feasible. A replacement tracheostomy can then be safely attempted by experts skilled at tracheostomy placement; fiberoptic bronchoscopy should be used to confirm proper placement in the airway. In rare circumstances, when an ETT cannot be placed (eg, massive upper airway obstruction) and the tracheostomy tube needs replacement through the original stoma in order to stabilize the airway, we suggest that it be performed under fiberoptic guidance by experts in airway management. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/131519.html" rel="external">"Tracheostomy in adults: Techniques and intraoperative complications", section on 'Pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum from a false tract'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/131519.html" rel="external">"Tracheostomy in adults: Techniques and intraoperative complications", section on 'Tracheostomy techniques'</a>.)</p><p>The risk of accidental decannulation has the greatest impact on patients with a difficult airway, since delay in restoring the airway may lead to prolonged hypoxemia. If patients need bag-mask ventilation (BMV), placing two gloved fingers and some gauze over the stoma may help improve the efficiency of BMV.

There are no guidelines that suggest one particular method is superior to another. In our facility, we typically use capping trials. A consensus statement advocates that patients should undergo a successful capping trial with the cuff deflated prior to decannulation; however, tracheostomy downsizing should be considered when a large tracheostomy tube is in place (eg, size 8 tracheostomy) [<a href="#rid56">56</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Progressive capping trials until tolerated for 12, 24, or 48 hours</strong> – This approach is relatively common, particularly in long-term weaning facilities.

Trials of capping initially last two to four hours, sometimes longer, and are progressively increased to 48 hours over one to two weeks.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A successful trial is one where the patients tolerate a prolonged period of capping without respiratory distress, stridor, or secretion retention (eg, 24 to 48 hours).

In addition, doubt remains over the applicability to patients who wean in long-term acute care facilities, and questions remain regarding the confounding impact of high-flow oxygen on the outcome (since it delivers a small amount of positive pressure).

In the early postoperative phase, we advocate for protocolized care following tracheostomy placement; an example is shown in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121526" href="/d/graphic/121526.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Care focuses on monitoring and treating complications, particularly bleeding and infection, as well as stoma, tracheostomy tube, and cuff care.

We define it at 7 to 10 days, although other experts have varying definitions. When decannulation occurs before the tract is mature (eg, during the first week), oral intubation with cuff placement beyond the stoma is appropriate. This approach is based upon avoiding airway loss and reducing risk of creating a false tract. For those with a mature tract, reinserting the tracheostomy is reasonable. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Massive hemorrhage due to a tracheoarterial fistula (typically tracheoinnominate artery) is a life-threatening emergency. It may be preceded by a sentinel bleed. When a sentinel bleed is suspected, it should be assessed using bronchoscopy, computed tomography, and/or angiography. When a fistula is suspected, we perform innominate artery compression with cuff overinflation (eg, up to 50 mL) and apply external pressure posteriorly on the sternal notch. If that fails, we perform oral intubation with cuff overinflation distal to the stoma, removal of tracheostomy tube, and the placement of pressure on the bleeding artery using a finger through the tracheostomy stoma.

During the exchange we take the opportunity to examine the stoma site for bleeding, secretions, ulceration, and granulation tissue. We confirm intraluminal placement with clinical examination, visual inspection, and/or capnography. (See <a class="local">'Procedure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Decannulation</strong> – Decannulation is the process by which a tracheostomy tube is removed. Decannulation can be performed when all of the following are present: mechanical ventilation is no longer required, upper airway obstruction is absent, the cough is adequate, and secretions are well controlled. (See <a class="local">'Decannulation'</a> above and <a class="local">'Criteria'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>We assess readiness for decannulation by capping the tracheostomy tube (with the cuff deflated) for progressively longer periods of time or by progressively decreasing the size of the tracheostomy tube. Immediate decannulation is uncommonly performed in a select group of individuals. (See <a class="local">'Techniques'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Most tracheocutaneous tracts begin to close within the first 48 hours following decannulation and by seven days they should be completely or almost completely closed. A tracheocutaneous fistula is considered persistent if it remains open at three to six months following decannulation. Treatment includes cauterization, excision, or rarely, surgical closure. If a patient fails decannulation and the stoma remains open, a mini-tracheostomy tube may be placed for suctioning and short-term ventilation and the stoma serially dilated; if the stoma is closed, then orotracheal intubation is required. (See <a class="local">'Delayed tracheocutaneous closure'</a> above and <a class="local">'Failed decannulation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Speech devices</strong> – Patient communication can be greatly enhanced following tracheostomy by use of capping (with the cuff deflated) or one-way speech valves  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61596" href="/d/graphic/61596.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>); talking tracheostomy tubes  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60668" href="/d/graphic/60668.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>) are infrequently used.
