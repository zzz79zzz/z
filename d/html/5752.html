One in three children experience at least one acute wheezing illness before the age of three years [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. A nationwide survey performed in the United States between 1988 and 1994 showed that the prevalence for wheezing amongst 2 to 3 year olds was 26 percent and amongst 9 to 11 year olds was 13 percent [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>]. Subsequent reports continue to show similar prevalence. In a 2007 survey in the US and Europe, a total of 9490 children aged one to five years were screened for respiratory symptoms [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Overall, 3077 (32 percent) reported recurrent cough, wheeze, or breathlessness in the preceding six winter months. The prevalence of these symptoms varied from 29 percent in Northern Europe to 48 percent in Southern Europe. The overall prevalence in the US was 27 percent. A large worldwide study looking at older children showed a global prevalence of wheezing of 11.6 percent in children aged 6 to 7 years and 13.7 percent in children between 13 to 14 years of age [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Wheezing may be either a benign, self-limited process or the presenting symptom of a significant respiratory disease. The role of the treating clinician is to try to reach the most likely diagnosis as quickly and efficiently as possible so that therapy, if necessary, can be instituted and caregiver concerns can be addressed.</p><p>A diagnostic approach to wheezing in childhood is presented in this topic review. Other topics that cover related areas include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An overview of recurrent wheezing phenotypes in children (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13585.html" rel="external">"Wheezing phenotypes and prediction of asthma in young children"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The diagnosis and management of childhood asthma (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5742.html" rel="external">"Asthma in children younger than 12 years: Initial evaluation and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5744.html" rel="external">"Asthma in children younger than 12 years: Management of persistent asthma with controller therapies"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Virus-induced wheezing (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/535.html" rel="external">"Role of viruses in wheezing and asthma: An overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/546.html" rel="external">"Treatment of recurrent virus-induced wheezing in young children"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The emergency evaluation of children with acute respiratory distress (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6463.html" rel="external">"Acute respiratory distress in children: Emergency evaluation and initial stabilization"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DEFINITION AND PHYSIOLOGY OF WHEEZING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Wheezing is probably the most easily recognized adventitious sound [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Its long duration, typically more than 100 msec, allows its musical quality to be discerned by the human ear. In sound analysis, the wheeze appears as sinusoidal oscillations with sound energy in the range of 100 to 1000 Hz and with harmonics that exceed 1000 Hz on occasion  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef131965" href="/z/d/graphic/131965.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. A wheeze is produced by the oscillation of opposing walls of an airway narrowed almost to the point of closure [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. It can be high pitched or low pitched. The pitch of an individual wheeze is determined not by the diameter of the airway but by the thickness of the airway wall, bending stiffness, and longitudinal tension [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. A wheeze can consist of single or multiple notes and occur during inspiration or expiration or can be biphasic. Some experts distinguish between wheezes and rhonchi based upon the dominant frequency, or pitch, of the sound. Wheezes have a dominant frequency greater than 400 Hz, whereas rhonchi are of lower frequency, approximately 150 Hz, and lower pitch, which is responsible for its resemblance to the sound of snoring on auscultation [<a href="#rid6">6,9,10</a>]. However, the clinical significance of this distinction, if any, is not well defined [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>Wheezes can originate from airways of any size throughout the proximal conducting airways. Wheezing requires sufficient airflow to generate airway oscillation and produce sound in addition to narrowing or compression of the airway. Thus, the absence of wheezing in a patient who presents with acute asthma may be an ominous finding, suggesting impending respiratory failure.</p><p>Wheezing caused by a fixed large or central airway obstruction or tracheomalacia tends to be low in pitch and has a constant acoustic character throughout the lung (homophonous wheezing) but varies in loudness depending upon the distance from the site of obstruction. In contrast, the degree of narrowing varies from place to place within the lung in the setting of small airway obstruction. As a result, the sounds generated also vary in quality and acoustic character and are described as heterophonous wheezes [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>Stridor refers to a monophonic sound that is loudest over the anterior neck. Stridor can be heard during inspiration, expiration, or throughout the respiratory cycle, depending on the location and severity of air flow limitation. In general, inspiratory stridor is prominent in the setting of extrathoracic obstruction, whereas expiratory stridor suggests intrathoracic obstruction, and, if the obstruction is fixed and severe, then stridor can be biphasic regardless of its location. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6380.html" rel="external">"Assessment of stridor in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3276968902"><span class="h1">CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most likely diagnosis in children with recurrent wheezing is asthma, regardless of the age of onset, evidence of atopic disease, precipitating causes, or frequency of wheezing [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. However, other diseases can present with wheezing in infancy and childhood, and patients with asthma may not wheeze. The differential diagnosis of wheezing includes a variety of congenital and acquired conditions  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67370" href="/z/d/graphic/67370.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>Wheezing can be divided clinically according to the acuity of its onset and the mechanism of airway narrowing. In addition to asthma, new-onset acute wheezing suggests infection or sudden airway narrowing, whereas chronic or recurrent wheezing may be caused by congenital abnormalities, cardiac disease, aspiration syndromes, impaired immunologic defenses, or underlying pulmonary disease. The age of onset of wheezing can also help determine the etiology. Certain diseases most commonly present in infancy, while other are seen more often in older children  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67370" href="/z/d/graphic/67370.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2801179355"><span class="h2">Acute wheezing (hours to days)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition to acute exacerbations of asthma, acute onset of wheezing in a child is most often caused by an infectious process or foreign body aspiration (FBA).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H331410100"><span class="h3">Infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common cause of acute wheezing in infants under two years of age is viral bronchiolitis, usually due to infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Rhinovirus and paramyxoviruses, including parainfluenza virus and metapneumovirus, can also result in wheezing. A typical history is a prodrome of rhinorrhea, cough, and intermittent fever followed by wheezing and tachypnea. Physical examination usually reveals nasal congestion, tachypnea, increased work of breathing, and polyphonic wheezes throughout the lungs. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6018.html" rel="external">"Bronchiolitis in infants and children: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8311.html" rel="external">"Human metapneumovirus infections"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5975.html" rel="external">"Parainfluenza viruses in children", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5994.html" rel="external">"Respiratory syncytial virus infection: Clinical features and diagnosis in infants and children", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Wheezing can also occur with laryngotracheobronchitis. Less commonly, acute wheezing is associated with atypical pneumonia such as <em>Mycoplasma </em>pneumonia, especially in older children. Patients with bacterial tracheitis can also have wheezing, but other symptoms such as toxic looking, high fever, and severe distress will typically guide the diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6070.html" rel="external">"<i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> infection in children", section on 'Pneumonia'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H42496857"><span class="h3">Foreign body aspiration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>FBA should be suspected in any patient who presents with wheezing of sudden onset, even in the absence of a clear history of a choking episode. In addition, FBA should be suspected in any child with a unilateral wheeze or unequal breath sounds. In children, unlike adults, the foreign body can lodge in any bronchus, without predilection for the right side. Patients can also present with chronic symptoms if FBA is not recognized in the acute setting. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6382.html" rel="external">"Airway foreign bodies in children"</a> and <a class="local">'Structural causes'</a> below.)</p><p>Esophageal foreign body also can present with acute wheezing secondary to compression of the airways. A history of feeding and swallowing difficulties and the presence of dysphagia are important clues to the diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5888.html" rel="external">"Foreign bodies of the esophagus and gastrointestinal tract in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2853061696"><span class="h2">Chronic or recurrent wheezing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The differential diagnosis of chronic or episodic wheezing is broad and includes structural abnormalities of the tracheobronchial tree or other thoracic structures. Nonstructural causes of chronic wheezing include asthma, aspiration syndromes, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, vocal cord dysfunction, and other disorders  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67370" href="/z/d/graphic/67370.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1529226832"><span class="h3">Structural causes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Structural abnormalities, including anomalies of the tracheobronchial tree and vascular rings or slings, are among the most common etiologies for persistent wheezing that presents early in life (typically in the first few months) and are not responsive to asthma therapies.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anomalies of the tracheobronchial tree – </strong>Congenital tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia can present with noisy breathing early in life. Wheezing can present at birth but more commonly becomes apparent in the first two to three months after birth. The wheezing usually has a constant acoustic character throughout the lung but varies in loudness depending upon the distance from the site of obstruction and becomes more pronounced with activity or in the setting of upper respiratory tract infections. Other symptoms can include a croup-like cough or stridor, depending upon the location of the lesion. The severity can range from a thriving child with noisy breathing to a child with severe respiratory distress.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In a study of 124 children ages 7 to 14 months with poor response to asthma therapy, 46 percent of those children were found to have malacia of the central airways [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6377.html" rel="external">"Congenital anomalies of the intrathoracic airways and tracheoesophageal fistula"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6365.html" rel="external">"Acute events in infancy including brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Vascular rings or slings can cause compression and narrowing of large airways and may result in wheezing or stridor [<a href="#rid14">14-17</a>]. These include complete rings (eg, double and right aortic arches) and incomplete rings, also called slings (eg, pulmonary artery sling). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5757.html" rel="external">"Vascular rings and slings"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Signs and symptoms of congenital vascular compression of the airways commonly appear early in life. Biphasic stridor is a common sign in these patients, but wheezing, respiratory distress, recurrent respiratory infections, and apnea also may be presenting findings. Patients may also have symptoms related to esophageal compression by vascular structures, including feeding difficulty and vomiting.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Fistulas between the tracheobronchial tree and other anatomical structures can cause wheezing. Tracheoesophageal fistulae, including laryngotracheobronchial clefts, are the most common of these conditions. Some infants with rare H-type fistulas are not typically diagnosed in the immediate postnatal period. These infants can present with chronic cough and recurrent pneumonia as well as wheezing. Symptoms such as coughing and choking are increased with feeding. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6377.html" rel="external">"Congenital anomalies of the intrathoracic airways and tracheoesophageal fistula"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6343.html" rel="external">"Approach to chronic cough in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mediastinal masses – </strong>Tumors, thymic lesions, bronchogenic cysts, angiomatous lesions, and enlarged lymph nodes can cause compression of the trachea or bronchi, resulting in chronic cough and persistent or progressive wheeze. The anatomic location of the mass within the mediastinum provides some clues to the underlying diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56637" href="/z/d/graphic/56637.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6243.html" rel="external">"Overview of common presenting signs and symptoms of childhood cancer", section on 'Mediastinal masses'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6343.html" rel="external">"Approach to chronic cough in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Foreign body aspiration – </strong>FBA typically presents with the abrupt onset of wheezing. However, patients may present with chronic cough, wheezing, or postobstructive pneumonia if the diagnosis is not recognized initially and the foreign body is retained  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef68288" href="/z/d/graphic/68288.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Foreign body aspiration'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6382.html" rel="external">"Airway foreign bodies in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cardiovascular disease – </strong>A range of cardiovascular diseases can present with wheezing:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Cardiac conditions that result in pulmonary artery dilation, such as large left-to-right shunts (eg, ventricular septal defect [VSD], atrial septal defect [ASD], pulmonary artery stenosis, pulmonary hypertension, absent pulmonary valve) and/or left atrial enlargement (eg, mitral valve stenosis), can compress large airways and cause wheezing. In addition to compression of the mainstem bronchi by markedly enlarged central pulmonary arteries, compression of intrapulmonary bronchi by abnormally branching pulmonary arteries has been reported in patients with absent pulmonic valves [<a href="#rid14">14,18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5773.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology of left-to-right shunts", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>However, overcirculation and pulmonary venous congestion are probably the most common cardiac causes of wheezing. This can occur due to poor left ventricular function and, less commonly, due to pulmonary venous outflow obstruction. These conditions can result in distension of the pulmonary vascular bed, bronchiolar wall edema, increased airway resistance, and wheezing [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Inflammatory mediators such as transforming growth factor (TGF) beta may also play a part in airway remodeling. In addition, airway hyperactivity has been reported in patients with congestive heart failure [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Cardiac findings including cardiomegaly and murmurs may be absent in some infants with obstructed venous return; therefore, a high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis. As an example, wheezing was reported as the only presenting symptom in cases of isolated cor triatriatum [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8269.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical evaluation, and diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3036765224"><span class="h3">Functional (nonstructural) causes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Functional causes of chronic or intermittent wheezing aside from asthma include aspiration syndromes, inducible laryngeal obstruction (ILO; historically known as paradoxical vocal fold movement [PVFM]), bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and rare disorders such as primary ciliary dyskinesia and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO).</p><p>Common causes of functional wheezing in children include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Aspiration syndromes – </strong>Aspiration syndromes are important and often unrecognized causes of recurrent wheezing in young children. In many cases, these patients are misdiagnosed with difficult-to-control asthma. Aspiration syndromes are associated with a variety of anatomic and functional disorders. FBA and aspiration associated with fistulas are reviewed above (see <a class="local">'Foreign body aspiration'</a> above and <a class="local">'Structural causes'</a> above). The two most common categories of functional disorders leading to aspiration are gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and swallowing disorders:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>GER seldom involves aspiration of large amounts of gastric contents. However, chronic microaspiration can cause significant mucosal edema and inflammation and may result in chronic cough and wheezing. Infants who take a bottle to bed are at increased risk of both wheezing and asthma during the first five years of life, probably because of recurrent microaspiration [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Children with GER do not always report symptoms of reflux, such as heartburn or vomiting, but may present with more subtle findings, including nocturnal symptoms, hoarseness, or recurrent croup. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5892.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Swallowing disorders related to neurologic or muscular dysfunction of the pharynx and/or larynx can result in weakness and impaired swallowing, incomplete closure of the glottis, depressed cough reflex, and recurrent episodes of aspiration. Anatomic abnormalities, such as laryngeal clefts and vocal cord paralysis, can also cause swallowing dysfunction leading to aspiration, which may be "silent" (ie, not associated with coughing or choking events).

Metapneumovirus, another member of the Paramyxoviridae family, can result in upper and lower respiratory tract infection and may present with wheezing [<a href="#rid39">39,40</a>]. Thus, viral studies can be helpful in confirming the etiology of wheezing in infants and young children presenting with symptoms suggestive of bronchiolitis. However, they are not routinely recommended. Testing is reviewed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6018.html" rel="external">"Bronchiolitis in infants and children: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Viral testing'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8311.html" rel="external">"Human metapneumovirus infections"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/535.html" rel="external">"Role of viruses in wheezing and asthma: An overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5975.html" rel="external">"Parainfluenza viruses in children", section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5994.html" rel="external">"Respiratory syncytial virus infection: Clinical features and diagnosis in infants and children", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Sputum Gram stain and cultures may be useful in a setting suggestive of bacterial infections, including atypical infections (eg, mycobacterial or fungal infections). Tuberculin skin testing and specific serologic assays can be helpful if these infections are suspected. Serologic testing for <em>Mycoplasma</em> may be performed if such an infection is suspected since <em>Mycoplasma</em> is an increasingly recognized cause of wheezing and may predispose children to the subsequent development of asthma [<a href="#rid41">41,42</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5342.html" rel="external">"Overview of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2419.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8007.html" rel="external">"Tuberculosis disease in children: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Pulmonary tuberculosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5986.html" rel="external">"Community-acquired pneumonia in children: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Laboratory evaluation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6070.html" rel="external">"<i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> infection in children", section on 'Approach to testing'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1495511"><span class="h3">Immunologic evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Assessment of immunoglobulin levels can be used to screen for humoral immunodeficiencies.

Elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) can be indicative of an allergic process. Skin prick testing (or in vitro testing) may be helpful in the patient with signs and symptoms suggestive of environmental allergies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5949.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with recurrent infections"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3903.html" rel="external">"Laboratory evaluation of the immune system"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7525.html" rel="external">"Allergic rhinitis: Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and diagnosis", section on 'Allergen-specific testing'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1492364934"><span class="h3">Sweat chloride test</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There should be a low threshold to obtain a sweat chloride test in a patient with persistent or recurrent pulmonary symptoms who does not improve on asthma therapies, especially when wheezing is associated with a chronic, productive cough, since identifying a patient with CF has major implications for the patient, the family, and future reproductive decisions. The sweat chloride test should be undertaken at a facility with substantial experience, and clinicians interpreting the results should be aware of other conditions that result in elevated sweat chloride concentrations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6367.html" rel="external">"Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1924838056"><span class="h3">Primary ciliary dyskinesia work-up</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evaluation for primary ciliary dyskinesia can include genetic testing, nasal nitric oxide, and ciliary motion and ultrastructural analysis, especially if the patient presents with a wet, chronic cough; chronic sinusitis; and recurrent otitis media.

Rigid bronchoscopy is used in patients with sudden onset of wheezing and suspected FBA. Flexible bronchoscopy can identify structural airway abnormality, including airway malacia (best evaluated during spontaneous breathing when performed under conscious sedation). A structural abnormality was identified in up to 33 percent of infants with chronic wheezing not responsive to asthma therapies by bronchoscopy [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Obtaining bronchoalveolar lavage cytology can help in identifying phenotype of asthma (eosinophilic versus neutrophilic) and also can help when infection or aspiration is suspected. However, the recommendation for bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in infants with chronic or recurrent wheezing is conditional with low quality of evidence [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6382.html" rel="external">"Airway foreign bodies in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6374.html" rel="external">"Approach to the infant and child with diffuse lung disease (interstitial lung disease)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14537.html" rel="external">"Aspiration due to swallowing dysfunction in children", section on 'Evaluation of airway anatomy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2469238656"><span class="h2">Esophageal pH and impedance monitoring</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>GER is common among children under two years of age with recurrent wheezing. Thus, 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring is suggested in infants and children with recurrent wheezing, particularly in children under two years of age with recurrent wheezing who are unresponsive to bronchodilators or inhaled or systemic glucocorticoids, since GER symptoms may be subtle in this age group [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Evaluation for GER is also suggested for older children with poor response to asthma therapies, especially if they have any suggestive symptoms. Presenting symptoms may include excessive burping or emesis, coughing after meals, and nocturnal cough or wheeze along with discomfort indicated by crying and/or arching of the back. A positive response to empiric therapy (acid suppression) may be used to support a presumed diagnosis of GER [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5892.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p>Twenty-four-hour esophageal pH monitoring is preferred over an upper gastrointestinal series or gastroesophageal scintigraphy for the diagnosis of GER. Multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII) monitoring is a technique that permits measurement of all reflux episodes, including those that are weakly acidic or alkaline. It is usually used in combination with pH monitoring. In a trial comparing the two techniques, combined MII-pH monitoring detected reflux events that caused symptoms twice as often as pH monitoring alone [<a href="#rid43">43</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Definition and physiology of wheezing</strong> – A wheeze is a continuous musical sound heard during chest auscultation that lasts longer than 250 msec. It is produced by the oscillation of opposing walls of an airway narrowed almost to the point of closure. It can be high pitched or low pitched, consist of single or multiple notes, occur during inspiration or expiration or biphasic, and originate from airways of any size. (See <a class="local">'Definition and physiology of wheezing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Causes</strong> – Wheezing is a common presenting symptom of respiratory disease in children. It may be either a benign, self-limited process or the presenting symptom of a significant respiratory disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67370" href="/z/d/graphic/67370.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Causes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Acute-onset wheezing</strong> – In addition to asthma, acute onset of wheezing in a child is most often caused by infection or foreign body aspiration (FBA). (See <a class="local">'Acute wheezing (hours to days)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Chronic or recurrent wheezing</strong> – The most likely diagnosis in children with recurrent wheezing is asthma. However, not all patients with asthma wheeze, and other diseases can present with chronic or episodic wheezing. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes structural abnormalities of the tracheobronchial tree or other thoracic structures (eg, vascular rings and slings, mediastinal masses). Nonstructural (functional) causes include aspiration syndromes (from gastroesophageal reflux [GER] and dysphagia), bronchopulmonary dysplasia, vocal cord dysfunction (including inducible laryngeal obstruction [ILO; historically known as paradoxical vocal fold movement (PVFM)] in older children), abnormal immunologic defense mechanisms, bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), and interstitial lung disease (ILD). (See <a class="local">'Chronic or recurrent wheezing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – Clinical history and physical examination often allow accurate diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62889" href="/z/d/graphic/62889.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). Additional diagnostic tools are helpful in establishing the underlying etiology of wheezing in select patients. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Clinical history</strong> – When a patient presents with a history of wheezing, it is crucial to ask the patient or the caregivers to describe what they actually are experiencing or hearing (or demonstrate it with a home video or audio recording taken on a mobile phone). On many occasions, the word "wheezing" is used as a general term to describe noisy breathing, including snoring, congestion, gurgling noises, or stridor. Two important aspects of the medical history include the patient's age at the onset of wheezing and the course of onset (acute versus gradual). Certain clinical features favor the diagnosis of asthma or suggest another diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70442" href="/z/d/graphic/70442.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). (See <a class="local">'Clinical history'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Physical exam</strong> – General examination of a wheezy child should include measurement of weight and height; vital signs including oxygen saturation; digital inspection for the presence of cyanosis or clubbing; a complete chest examination; and cardiac, skin, and nasal examinations. (See <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Imaging</strong> – Anteroposterior (AP) and lateral chest radiographs are suggested in children with new-onset wheezing of undetermined etiology or chronic, persistent wheezing not responding to therapies. Other radiologic studies such as computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) may be helpful in selected cases  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62889" href="/z/d/graphic/62889.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). (See <a class="local">'Radiography'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Pulmonary function testing</strong> – Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are an important component of the diagnostic evaluation of a wheezy child. In older children who are cooperative, PFT with inspiratory and expiratory flow-volume loops is helpful in determining the presence, degree, and location of airway obstruction, as well as the response to bronchodilators  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63544" href="/z/d/graphic/63544.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). (See <a class="local">'Pulmonary function tests'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Endoscopy</strong> – When suspected, endoscopy can help identify FBA or structural abnormalities. (See <a class="local">'Endoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Response to treatment</strong> – For patients suspected of having asthma, a trial of inhaled bronchodilators with or without glucocorticoids can be used to confirm the diagnosis prior to initiating a more extensive work-up. Further work-up is indicated if the response to therapy is inadequate. (See <a class="local">'Response to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Laboratory studies</strong> – There are few laboratory investigations that are useful in the initial evaluation of the wheezy child. Any studies obtained beyond chest radiographs and PFTs should be based upon the suspected diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62889" href="/z/d/graphic/62889.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). These studies include tests to examine for viral, bacterial, or fungal infections; sweat chloride test to diagnose cystic fibrosis (CF), work-up for primary ciliary dyskinesis, evaluation for immunodeficiency or allergy, and work-up for GER if indicated.
