It causes acute or subacute pain, swelling, and tenderness, typically in the thigh or calf.</p><p>Diabetic muscle infarction is one of many micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes. Others include diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and atherosclerotic vascular disease affecting other circulatory beds.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of diabetic muscle infarction are discussed here. Other musculoskeletal manifestations of diabetes mellitus and disorders with an increased prevalence in patients with diabetes are presented separately, as is an approach to minimizing the risk of complications arising from diabetic micro- and macrovascular disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5126.html" rel="external">"Overview of the musculoskeletal complications of diabetes mellitus"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1750.html" rel="external">"Overview of general medical care in nonpregnant adults with diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3366078620"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pathogenesis of diabetic muscle infarction is uncertain but appears related to vasculopathic changes associated with longstanding and poorly controlled diabetes. Several theoretical pathways have been suggested, including arteriosclerosis, diabetic microangiopathy, vasculitis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and hypercoagulable states, all with insufficient proof of causality. The primary pathologic findings in muscle biopsies from affected patients are muscle necrosis and edema; occlusion of arterioles and capillaries by fibrin may also be seen [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages within the muscle tissue has been described, and in later stages muscle fiber regeneration can be seen [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Spontaneous infarction of muscle is a rare condition. It occurs equally in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and the majority of patients have multiple other microvascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and/or neuropathy [<a href="#rid1">1,3,6,7</a>]. The prevalence of this condition is difficult to determine as most information has been obtained from analyses of published case reports.</p><p>A 2015 systematic review of all cases published in the English language since the initial description of the condition in 1965 identified reports of 170 episodes of diabetic muscle infarction, including 126 initial episodes and 44 episodes of recurrence, with a mean age at presentation of 45 years (range 20 to 67 years) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>The number of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes identified in this review were similar, but the mean age at presentation with muscle infarction was lower for type 1 diabetics than for type 2 diabetics (36 years [20 to 65 years] versus 52 years [34 to 67 years]). The mean duration of diabetes at the time of presentation with muscle infarction was longer for those with type 1 diabetes (19 years [5 to 33 years] versus 11 years [1 to 25 years]).</p><p>Other complications of diabetes were present in the vast majority of patients presenting with diabetic muscle infarction in this systematic review (93 percent). The most common microvascular complication, nephropathy, was present in 75 percent of patients. Of the 126 cases reviewed, roughly half of patients (47 percent) had a triad of concurrent retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Two-thirds of patients (66 percent) had at least two of these diabetic complications.</p><p>These findings were similar to those in earlier reviews, including one with fewer patients (n = 116) that included non-English-language reports as well [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In this 2003 review, the oldest reported patient was 81 years of age, and rates of vascular complications of diabetes were similar to the 2015 report, but patients with type 1 diabetes were more common than those with type 2 diabetes (59 versus 24 percent, with 17 percent unknown).</p><p>A systematic review of 41 cases (published from 1980 to 2017) of patients with diabetic muscle infarction and end-stage renal failure due to diabetic nephropathy showed similar findings and incidence of diabetic complications to earlier reviews, in which some of the same case reports were included [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In this review, patients had a mean age of 44.2 years (19 to 67 years), 41.5 percent had type 1 diabetes, 81 percent were on dialysis, and 12 percent had kidney transplants. The recurrence rate for diabetic muscle infarction in this group was 43.9 percent.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1474257145"><span class="h2">Symptoms and physical findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Affected patients present with acute or subacute onset of painful swelling that evolves over days or weeks. The commonest area affected is the front of the thigh (55 percent), with the next most commonly affected areas being the back of the thigh and calf (15 percent each) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Upper extremity involvement is uncommon (&lt;10 percent). There is no history of trauma. The swelling may be mildly to extremely tender, and a minority of patients (approximately 10 percent [<a href="#rid3">3,7</a>]) are described as having a mild fever [<a href="#rid1">1,6</a>], although the majority of case reports do not record body temperature [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Erythema, induration, and warmth of the affected site has been described in some patients [<a href="#rid6">6,9</a>]. The affected limb may be enlarged secondary to muscle and subcutaneous edema. In some cases (approximately one-third), a palpable painful mass may develop and persist for weeks to months after onset [<a href="#rid7">7,10,11</a>].</p><p>The mean duration of symptoms before presenting for care is about four weeks but ranged from within one day to 40 weeks in one review, and time to resolution ranged from 2 to 17 weeks, with a mean of four weeks [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>In the largest review from 2015, bilateral involvement occurred at presentation in only 8 percent of patients [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. By contrast, a smaller review of patients with end-stage renal failure and diabetic muscle infarction [<a href="#rid8">8</a>] demonstrated that roughly 20 percent of patients had bilateral involvement and 39 percent had involvement of multiple muscle groups. In this study and others, lower limb involvement predominated, with the thigh affected four times more frequently than the leg below the knee. Upper limb involvement occurred in 5 out of 41 patients (12 percent) in this study.</p><p>Recurrence is common in published cases but often in a different location [<a href="#rid3">3,9</a>]. In the 2015 review, 170 episodes of diabetic muscle infarction were reported in 126 patients, and 61 percent of these recurrences were in a different location or muscle group from the original site [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In one case report, for example, a 61-year-old type 2 diabetic with left thigh muscle infarction developed muscle infarction of the contralateral thigh five weeks after the initial episode, followed by muscle infarction in the right calf three months later [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Estimating an accurate measurement on the frequency of recurrence has been challenging, as publication bias may skew results from the literature (recurrent cases may be more likely to be reported). The frequency of recurrence reported in the literature ranges from 25 to 40 percent. (See <a class="local">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Other complications, including compartment syndromes and secondary infections, are infrequently reported in patients with this rare condition. As an example, a spontaneous compartment syndrome requiring surgical intervention has been described in patients in whom a diabetic muscle infarction is suspected as the underlying cause [<a href="#rid12">12</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/358.html" rel="external">"Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities"</a>). This case report and literature review identified nine patients with type 1 diabetes aged 17 to 47 years (median age 29 years) with spontaneous compartment syndrome, of whom about one-half had diabetic complications such as retinopathy. In addition, neck muscle (levator scapulae) involvement, later complicated by staphylococcal sepsis in the necrotic muscle and secondary osteomyelitis, has been described in an immunosuppressed diabetic transplant patient [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Laboratory</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Laboratory findings are nonspecific and may be normal in many patients. However, patients often exhibit elevated levels of acute phase reactants and, less commonly, creatine kinase (CK), as well as leukocytosis. Based upon data from two large literature reviews, which were partially overlapping, the following results were observed [<a href="#rid3">3,9</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>CK levels were normal or increased, probably depending upon the stage of the condition when sampling was undertaken. CK levels were greater than 150 units (U)/L, the upper limit of normal, in 32 to 47 percent of patients, with a mean value of 710 U/L and values ranging from 10 to 11,000 U/L. An important take-home from these studies is that a normal CK can be seen in one-half to two-thirds of patients at presentation. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Leukocytosis has been found in 35 to 43 percent of patients in whom the leukocyte count was reported, with mean values in one report of 11.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L, but levels seen as high as 32 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) to more than 50 mm/hour was seen in 74 percent of patients in whom it was reported in one of these studies (of note, the ESR was measured in less than half of patients) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In the other report, the ESR was elevated in 83 percent of patients in whom it was reported, with a mean value for all patients reported of 87 mm/hour (range 1 to 153 mm/hour).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>90 percent of patients with a C-reactive protein (CRP) measurement had elevated values, with a mean value for all patients in whom measurement was obtained of 156 mg/L (range 0.03 to 524 mg/L).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Measurements of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) were only performed in a subset (40 percent) of patients in whom the mean value was 9.3 percent, indicating poor control [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Imaging features</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography have each been used to assess patients with possible diabetic muscle infarction. Their uses and relative utility for diagnosis and differential diagnosis are described separately. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> below and <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">MRI</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>MRI may show high intensity signal in the involved muscle on T2-weighted sequences as well as subcutaneous and subfascial edema [<a href="#rid6">6,9,14</a>]. The loss of the normal fatty intramuscular septa, a relatively common finding, is optimally observed with T1-weighted images, where the affected muscles appear hypointense or isointense.</p><p>The addition of gadolinium may be useful to distinguish nonenhancing infarcted muscle from surrounding inflammation or edema. On post-gadolinium scans, ischemic muscle may demonstrate diffuse heterogenous enhancement (ring enhancement) surrounding a low-signal, nonenhancing foci of necrosis [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. This classic pattern, however, is not seen in all patients and is not specific for muscle infarction. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H281623708"><span class="h3">Ultrasonography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are limited data regarding ultrasonography findings in diabetic muscle infarction. In one study of three patients, characteristic findings included a well-defined, hypoechoic intramuscular lesion with internal echogenic linear structures (the linear structures correspond to muscle fibers, suggesting the lesion is muscle in origin rather than an abscess pocket or neoplastic mass displacing the muscle); absence of a predominant anechoic area (abscesses are typically anechoic or hypoechoic); and absence of motion or swirling fluid with transducer pressure directly over lesion site (which can be seen in an abscess) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Arteriography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Arteriography, which is not generally performed for diagnostic purposes in patients with suspected diabetic muscle infarction, may reveal atherosclerotic luminal narrowing [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. There are very few studies of this modality in this context.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Muscle biopsy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Muscle necrosis and edema are the primary pathologic findings, but occlusion of arterioles and capillaries by fibrin may also be seen [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Mononuclear cells can also be identified infiltrating the muscle tissue in some biopsy specimens. (See <a class="local">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Awareness of the syndrome and the presence of the characteristic clinical features, usually including acute atraumatic swelling, warmth, and pain in a commonly affected site such as the thigh, will frequently suggest the diagnosis. Laboratory and imaging studies are aimed at excluding other disorders; laboratory changes suggesting an inflammatory process may be present, and an inflammatory response to the muscle infarction may make differentiation from infection difficult.</p><p>MRI with intravenous contrast enhancement appears to be the most useful diagnostic imaging technique and is the diagnostic imaging tool of choice. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Muscle biopsy is not required for the diagnosis of muscle infarction and is only necessary when the diagnosis remains in doubt despite careful clinical assessment, laboratory tests, and appropriate imaging. Muscle biopsy is usually performed only in patients in whom infection or neoplasm cannot be excluded by other investigative techniques. Since MRI clearly identifies the location of muscle involvement, it may be useful to guide pre-biopsy assessment [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>For patients with longstanding diabetes, known microvascular complications, no fever, and no leukocytosis, the findings on MRI of increased T2 signal, muscle enlargement, and subcutaneous and subfascial edema may avoid muscle biopsy [<a href="#rid9">9,15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1306279424"><span class="h2">Diagnostic evaluation</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2295708123"><span class="h3">Testing in all patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We suggest the following diagnostic testing in all patients with suspected diabetic muscle infarction:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Complete blood count (CBC) and differential.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prothrombin time and partial tissue thromboplastin time.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Creatine kinase (CK), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) measurement.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clinical and laboratory evaluation for common microvascular complications in diabetes (if not recently completed): serum creatinine, urine protein assessment, fundoscopic retinal examination, detailed sensory examination (eg, monofilament testing).

Cases in the literature describe the use of MRI both with and without contrast. The utility of gadolinium contrast or other enhancing agents should be discussed with radiology to determine the optimal protocol for each patient. The addition of gadolinium can be helpful to distinguish nonenhancing infarcted muscle from surrounding inflammation or edema [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]; however, the pattern of ring-enhancement is not entirely specific for muscle infarction and may be demonstrated in some patients with pyomyositis as well.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A retrospective study of MRI imaging from 16 patients with diabetic muscle infarction found that the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents may not be necessary in diagnosing patients with a typical presentation of diabetic muscle infarction [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Historically, the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents was avoided in patients with acute kidney injury or advanced chronic kidney disease (specifically chronic kidney disease stages 4 &amp; 5) given the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Newer evidence, however, suggests the risk of NSF is extremely low with the use of lower-risk gadolinium-based contrast agents, even in advanced chronic kidney disease. As a result, radiology guidelines recommend against selecting noncontrast studies on the basis of NSF risk alone with lower-risk contrast agents. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113082.html" rel="external">"Patient evaluation before gadolinium contrast administration for magnetic resonance imaging", section on 'Approach to preventing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1955.html" rel="external">"Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis/nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy in advanced kidney disease", section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1652254461"><span class="h3">Testing in selected patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients suspected of muscle infarction in whom infection cannot be excluded, additional studies, including biopsy, may be required. For patients with fever and/or leukocytosis, in whom muscle infection cannot be excluded on the basis of the tests above, we recommend computed tomography (CT)-guided core needle biopsy and examination of the tissue with Gram stain, culture, and routine histopathology. Needle biopsy may provide diagnostic tissue and is less likely to exacerbate the disease or prolong recuperation than is excisional muscle biopsy, which may be associated with hematoma, delayed healing, infection, and a prolonged recovery time [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p>In patients in whom a rapidly progressive infection of muscle or fascia cannot be excluded or in those with signs of sepsis, we suggest surgical exploration and excisional biopsy. If an alternative diagnosis such as malignancy or idiopathic inflammatory myositis is suspected, an excisional biopsy may be preferred to preserve tissue architecture in the histologic specimen. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Differential diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among other causes of acute muscle pain and tenderness, bacterial infections such as pyomyositis, spontaneous gangrenous myositis, nontraumatic clostridial myonecrosis, and necrotizing fasciitis must be excluded expeditiously. Ultrasonography used to exclude venous thrombosis may reveal intramuscular hematomas or muscle tears. Diabetic patients with end-stage kidney disease may develop soft tissue infarction due to calciphylaxis.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pyomyositis</strong> – There is an increased propensity to pyomyositis in patients with diabetes mellitus, and large muscles of the thigh are a commonly involved site. Early pyomyositis may be difficult to distinguish from ischemic muscle necrosis; however, fever, leukocytosis, and a well-defined intramuscular fluid collection is commonly noted at a more advanced stage of bacterial muscle infection. Typical findings on ultrasound may include anechoic or hypoechoic fluid collections within the muscle tissue or easily compressible, shifting fluid collections with transducer pressure over the affected site. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7669.html" rel="external">"Primary pyomyositis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Osteomyelitis</strong> – Limb pain from underlying osteomyelitis may present similarly to diabetic muscle infarction. Radiographs may be helpful in identifying associated periosteal and bone abnormalities but can be insensitive in early disease. Advanced imaging with MRI or CT may be necessary in such cases to identify early signs of underlying bone infection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Spontaneous gangrenous myositis</strong> – Spontaneous gangrenous myositis due to streptococcal infection, unlike pyomyositis due to <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, is characterized by gangrenous necrosis, rather than abscess formation; more systemic toxicity; and a much worse prognosis (80 to 100 percent mortality). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7662.html" rel="external">"Necrotizing soft tissue infections"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clostridial myonecrosis</strong> – The presence of gas in muscle is characteristic of nontraumatic clostridial myonecrosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7672.html" rel="external">"Clostridial myonecrosis", section on 'Spontaneous gas gangrene'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Necrotizing fasciitis</strong> – Necrotizing fasciitis is a deep-seated infection of the subcutaneous tissue that results in progressive destruction of fascia and fat. Necrotizing fasciitis should be considered in diabetic patients with cellulitis who also have systemic signs of infection such as tachycardia, leukocytosis, marked hyperglycemia, or acidosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7662.html" rel="external">"Necrotizing soft tissue infections", section on 'Necrotizing fasciitis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Venous thrombosis</strong> – Pain, swelling, and skin discoloration in the involved extremity are common symptoms of venous thrombosis, and these may be accompanied by the presence of a palpable cord (reflecting a thrombosed vein), ipsilateral edema, warmth, and/or superficial venous dilation. Noninvasive studies, particularly compression ultrasonography, may distinguish venous thrombosis from muscle infarction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1351.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intramuscular hematoma</strong> – Intramuscular bleeding due to low-energy blunt trauma or in patients with a heritable or acquired coagulopathy causes pain, swelling, and muscle tenderness. A history of trauma, bleeding disorder, or use of an anticoagulant is suggestive. Ischemic pain may result from increased intramuscular pressure that can be determined by measuring intracompartmental pressure [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Ultrasonography, CT, or MRI of the hematoma is usually diagnostic [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. MRI findings may include high-intensity signal within the affected muscle on T1-weighted imaging, whereas diabetic muscle infarction is more commonly associated with a hypointense or isointense signal on T1-weighted imaging (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13812.html" rel="external">"Quadriceps muscle and tendon injuries"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13812.html" rel="external">"Quadriceps muscle and tendon injuries", section on 'Quadriceps contusion'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Calciphylaxis</strong> – Calciphylaxis (calcific uremic arteriolopathy) is typically characterized by areas of ischemic necrosis that develop in the dermis, subcutaneous fat, and less often involve muscle. Typically seen in patients with end-stage kidney disease, these ischemic changes lead to livedo reticularis and/or violaceous, painful, plaque-like subcutaneous nodules on the trunk, buttocks, or proximal extremity. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1944.html" rel="external">"Calciphylaxis (calcific uremic arteriolopathy)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies</strong> – Characteristic MRI findings in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) include high-intensity signal on T2-weighted imaging of the proximal limb muscles. As such, the MRI findings in diabetic muscle infarction may be inappropriately attributed to a systemic autoimmune process. In contrast to diabetic muscle infarction, patients with IIM typically present with a subacute to chronic onset of bilateral, symmetric weakness of the upper and lower extremities. Limb weakness, rather than pain, is often the predominant feature in patients with IIM. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127066.html" rel="external">"Overview of and approach to the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diabetic lumbosacral plexopathy</strong> – Diabetic lumbosacral plexopathy (also known as diabetic amyotrophy) is an uncommon complication of diabetes, affecting approximately 1 percent of patients. It commonly presents as unilateral lower extremity (proximal thigh and pelvis) pain and weakness. The exact etiology is uncertain, but several reports describe an underlying vasculopathy affecting the lumbosacral nerve roots and the distal peripheral nerves. The disease can progress to involve the contralateral limb as well as the autonomic nervous system, and patients may present with malaise, reduced appetite, and weight loss. Examination and imaging of the muscle should allow distinction from diabetic muscle infarction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5268.html" rel="external">"Diabetic amyotrophy and idiopathic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neoplasm</strong> – Enlarging benign and malignant neoplasms are unlikely to be confused with muscle infarction, but tumor infarction or hemorrhage may cause acute pain and increasing size [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].

There are limited data suggesting that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment may improve outcome, but convincing evidence is lacking.

However, there are no studies to support the benefits of this approach specifically for diabetic muscle infarction, although it is used as an alternative antiplatelet agent in patients with diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease who are allergic to or otherwise unable to take aspirin but in whom aspirin would otherwise be indicated for the prevention of adverse cardiovascular events.

Patients should be carefully assessed for kidney disease, hypertension, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, use of anticoagulants, and risk factors for peptic ulcer disease and gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

As an example, in the systemic review from 2015, the average age of patients receiving an NSAID was 10 years younger than other treatment groups; hence, the improved outcomes associated with NSAIDs could be reflective of younger patient age rather than treatment effect [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Despite the initial symptomatic resolution and recovery, a second episode, often involving the contralateral side, has frequently been reported [<a href="#rid1">1,3,6,9,24</a>], with a risk of recurrence of approximately 25 to 40 percent [<a href="#rid3">3,9,25</a>]. Studies have also demonstrated poor long-term outcomes such as mortality, reflecting the high rate of concurrent microvascular complications from underlying diabetes. Death from a major vascular event was reported within a few years in the majority of patients in a 1993 review [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. A 2004 estimate of mortality within two years of an episode was 10 percent, however, suggesting some improvement in the prognosis of reported cases [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diabetic muscle infarction is a rare disorder that affects patients who have relatively longstanding diabetes, many of whom have other micro- or macrovascular complications.
