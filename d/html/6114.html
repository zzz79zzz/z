The prevention of recurrent disease, epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of nephrolithiasis in children are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6109.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in children: Prevention of recurrent stones"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6112.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in children: Epidemiology and risk factors"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6123.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in children: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2658803145"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The acute management of nephrolithiasis depends upon the severity of the pain, and the presence of obstruction or infection. Medical management is focused on alleviating pain and facilitating the spontaneous passage of the stone. However, in some cases, urologic intervention is needed for stone removal for patients with unremitting severe pain that is refractory to analgesic therapy, or in those with obstruction or infection. (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h2">Hospitalization versus outpatient management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The acute management of nephrolithiasis depends upon the severity of the pain and the presence of obstruction or infection. In most patients, outpatient medical management with oral analgesics and hydration is sufficient while awaiting spontaneous passage of the stone. Indications for hospitalization include urinary obstruction with impairment of kidney function, infection, solitary kidney with ureteral obstruction, the need for parenteral fluid and pain medications because of severe pain, or inability to take oral analgesics or fluids (eg, vomiting).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">MEDICAL MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21423414"><span class="h2">Supportive care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Supportive management includes symptomatic treatment and hydration. Data are insufficient to determine if high-volume fluid therapy facilitates stone passage. In the authors' practice, intravenous (IV) fluids are administered primarily to replete fluid loss due to poor oral intake and emesis associated with the renal colic symptoms, as opposed to promoting stone passage. Nausea and vomiting should be treated with IV antiemetics. Pain associated with renal colic is best treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications combined with narcotic analgesics.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">Pain control</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Both nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioid therapy are used to control pain associated with nephrolithiasis. In studies of adult patients, both classes of analgesics are effective in pain relief. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/82857.html" rel="external">"Pediatric procedural sedation: Pharmacologic agents", section on 'Analgesic agents'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/85542.html" rel="external">"Procedural sedation in children: Selection of medications", section on 'Approach'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7366.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Diagnosis and acute management of suspected nephrolithiasis", section on 'Pain control'</a>.)</p><p>At our institution, patients who arrive in the emergency department receive a combination of NSAIDs and IV narcotics as initial management. For patients who are hospitalized, we use IV <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13402" href="/d/drug information/13402.html" rel="external">ketorolac</a> and opioid therapy as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="16024" href="/d/drug information/16024.html" rel="external">Morphine</a> – For children &gt;6 months of age, IV morphine is given as 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg per dose every two to four hours as needed up to a maximum of 2 mg per dose.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13402" href="/d/drug information/13402.html" rel="external">Ketorolac</a> – For children &gt;2 years of age, IV ketorolac is given as 0.5 mg/kg per dose every six hours with a maximum dose of 30 mg. Ketorolac is automatically discontinued after 72 hours of IV administration.</p><p></p><p>Outpatient management for those without kidney function impairment include NSAIDs, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13028" href="/d/drug information/13028.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a>, and oral narcotics. Notably, opioid-reduction strategies for adults with renal colic have been successfully implemented within acute care settings, although not yet replicated in children [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. As such, this approach would also be reasonable given the current health care focus on opioid stewardship.</p><p>The use of NSAIDs should be stopped three days before a urologic intervention, if possible, to minimize the risk of bleeding. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7366.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Diagnosis and acute management of suspected nephrolithiasis", section on 'Pain control'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Management of urinary tract infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because urinary tract infection (UTI) may be a concomitant finding in children with nephrolithiasis (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6112.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in children: Epidemiology and risk factors", section on 'Infection'</a>), urine and blood cultures should be obtained. If a UTI is suspected, empiric antibiotic therapy is initiated while awaiting culture results. The choice of antibiotic, which can be given orally or parenterally based on the clinical setting, is guided by the likely pathogens and the likelihood of drug resistance. </p><p>Although not commonly seen in children, UTI with sepsis and sometimes bacteremia is a life-threatening complication of nephrolithiasis. In the setting of a ureteral stone or obstruction in a child with suspected (eg, fever) or confirmed urosepsis, emergent drainage is necessary using either a ureteral stent of percutaneous nephrostomy tube [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with a ureteral calculus or urinary obstruction (partial or complete) and suspected UTI are managed with prompt parenteral antibiotic therapy, and urinary decompression and drainage with stenting to lower the intrarenal pelvic pressure due to stone-induced obstruction. Once the infection has cleared, the calculi can be surgically removed [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In our institution, children with obstruction are initially treated empirically with IV <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13136" href="/d/drug information/13136.html" rel="external">ceftriaxone</a> pending urine culture results based on the likely pathogens and their resistance pattern observed in our locale, which is then modified or discontinued based on urine culture results.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with a non-obstructing renal calculus and suspected UTI, empiric antibiotic therapy is provided pending urine culture results. Clearance of UTIs with only antibiotic therapy is difficult in patients with symptomatic stones, therefore these patients need close interval follow-up with a urological surgeon. In cases where there is not resolution of infection or subsequent obstruction, surgical removal of the stone is warranted.</p><p></p><p>Antibiotic therapy for UTI is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5991.html" rel="external">"Urinary tract infections in infants older than one month and children less than two years: Acute management, imaging, and prognosis", section on 'Determining need for early empiric antibiotic therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Ureteral stone passage</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H603841054"><span class="h3">Confirming spontaneous passage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The majority of ureteral stones &lt;5 mm in diameter will pass spontaneously, even in small children [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. For children who have spontaneously passed a ureteral calculus, confirmation of a successfully passed calculus is important. This should include resolution of symptoms and either a documented "stone in hand" that can be analyzed or imaging that confirms passage of the calculus and resolution of associated hydronephrosis [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Follow-up imaging should be performed after a two- to four-week period of observation to confirm stone passage. </p><p>At our institution, ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality to monitor stone passage in patients who have not brought a passed stone into clinic. Alternatively, a KUB could be performed in follow-up if an initial CT scout image revealed a visible calculus. Although computed tomography (CT) is the most sensitive imaging modality in the detection of renal or urinary tract stones, it is more costly and is associated with higher radiation exposure. As a result, CT is reserved for children with a nondiagnostic ultrasound and/or KUB and a continued high index of suspicion for nephrolithiasis. In addition, CT is sometimes needed to determine true stone burden and exact stone location for surgical management. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6123.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in children: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H987741701"><span class="h3">Facilitating passage</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3114154989"><span class="h4">Medical expulsive therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In adults, several medical interventions have been used to increase the passage rate of ureteral stones, including antispasmodic agents, calcium channel blockers, and alpha blockers. Collectively, these treatments are known as "medical expulsive therapy." Although data are limited, systematic reviews of the literature that include small randomized trials and cohort studies suggest administration of adrenergic alpha-antagonists is an effective and safe intervention for ureteral stone passage in children with nephrolithiasis [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]. However, these results need to be confirmed with larger randomized control trials especially as the use of medical expulsive therapy remains controversial in adults. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7366.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Diagnosis and acute management of suspected nephrolithiasis", section on 'Medical expulsive therapy'</a>.)</p><p>In our practice, we have used alpha blockers to facilitate stone passage in children with ureteral stones. Although the US Food and Drug Administration has not approved the use of alpha blockers in children, based on the above data, we will use <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="100616" href="/d/drug information/100616.html" rel="external">tamsulosin</a> in children older than two years of age with symptomatic ureterovesical stones. We use a dose of 0.2 mg of tamsulosin for children between two to four years of age, and 0.4 mg of tamsulosin for children who are five years and older. Tamsulosin is given as a single dose in the evening before bedtime. Tamsulosin comes only in capsule form. It can be broken and placed onto foods such as yogurt or applesauce for children who cannot swallow pills [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. One should be cautious in children with enteric feeding tubes as administering this medication can result in clogging the lumen of these tubes.</p><p>These medications have been well-tolerated, and we have not seen orthostatic hypotension, even though this is a potential side effect of alpha blockers. Nevertheless, these agents should be used under the supervision of a clinician experienced in medical expulsive therapy. </p><p>If there has been no spontaneous passage by two to four weeks, we will intervene surgically. (See <a class="local">'Urologic intervention'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4287746116"><span class="h4">Uric acid stones</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with uric acid stones, urine alkalinization increases the solubility of uric acid and may result in a decrease in stone size with subsequent passage. Because of the duration of alkalinization necessary for stone dissolution, this treatment would not be appropriate for ureteral calculi but has been shown to be of similar efficacy to surgical options for renal calculi [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6109.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in children: Prevention of recurrent stones", section on 'Hyperuricosuria'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Stone collection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The family/patient should be instructed to strain the child's urine for several days, in order to retrieve the stone. If the stone or any fragment is recovered, it should be sent for stone analysis. The known composition of the stone is important to guide further evaluation and preventive measures to prevent recurrent stones. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6109.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in children: Prevention of recurrent stones", section on 'Evaluation for underlying risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Urinary strainers are available from medical supply companies. If a urinary strainer cannot be obtained, a receptacle covered by a cheese cloth or fine mesh sheet can be used. A fish net used for home aquariums is also a good alternative.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h1">UROLOGIC INTERVENTION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because of the high spontaneous stone passage rates for smaller calculi, as well as the cost and potential complications from urologic procedures in children, it is generally accepted that an observation period with adequate pain control should be given. The optimal length of time for observation prior to urologic intervention remains uncertain; however, in our practice, an observation period of up to two weeks is usually employed. </p><p>The goal of management is to minimize renal injury, which requires balancing the risk of a urologic procedure (ie, urinary drainage or stone removal) versus potential chronic kidney injury from continued obstruction, and to provide symptomatic relief of pain. </p><p>In our practice, indications for surgical intervention are as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Surgical removal without trial of medical management – Indications for surgical intervention <strong>without</strong> a trial of medical observation include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Urinary obstruction – Complete obstruction from renal calculi can result in renal parenchymal injury and a decrease in kidney function especially if there is evidence of impaired kidney function [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Intervention in patients with mild kidney dysfunction demonstrates both an initial improvement in kidney function due to the relief of the obstruction and subsequent improvement thought to be due to recovery of injured kidney tissue [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. Without relief, persistent obstruction can result in permanent scarring and loss of kidney tissue [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">We also consider urologic intervention for patients with partial obstruction of a solitary kidney. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Urinary tract infection – Urinary tract infection in the setting of a partial or completely obstructing ureteral calculus is an indication for decompression. Those patients with non-obstructing calculi, while not requiring urgent intervention, should have close interval follow-up with a urologic surgeon. (See <a class="local">'Management of urinary tract infection'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Struvite stones (magnesium ammonium phosphate and calcium carbonate-apatite) are often associated with an underling UTI, and tend to branch and enlarge resulting in a filling of the renal calyces producing a "staghorn" appearance  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62009" href="/d/graphic/62009.html" rel="external">image 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72669" href="/d/graphic/72669.html" rel="external">image 2</a>). Urologic removal of struvite calculi is generally required to eradicate the underlying infection [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Persistent infection, usually due to a urease-producing bacteria (eg, Proteus or Klebsiella), is a risk factor for recurrent stone formation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6112.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in children: Epidemiology and risk factors", section on 'Infection'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7372.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Struvite (infection) stones"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptomatic stones with unremitting severe pain – Severe pain despite adequate analgesia is most often due to a uretero-vesical (UVJ) or uretero-pelvic junction (UPJ) stone, which is usually accompanied by obstruction. In these patients, pain is relieved with a temporizing ureteral stent and subsequent stone removal, regardless of the size of the stone.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptomatic stones that fail to pass after a trial of conservative therapy – Surgical intervention is performed if there is no improvement after a trial of medical therapy for two to four weeks for symptomatic patients without an underlying UTI and for those successfully managed with oral analgesics that do not impair daily activities who have evidence of radiographically-confirmed obstruction or who have mild proximal urinary tract dilation.</p><p></p><p>We offer urologic intervention to asymptomatic children with stones that do not spontaneously pass after two to four weeks of medical therapy and observation. Asymptomatic calculi within the kidney, which usually do not pass spontaneously, can also be treated in order to prevent future symptom development. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Procedures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several minimally-invasive options for removal of kidney or ureteral calculi are available for surgical management in children [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. These procedures have generally replaced open surgical stone removal and can be used in children of all ages, including small children and infants. However, the experience and comfort of the surgeon as well as the equipment available should be considered in the decision of which intervention to use. Surgical intervention should only be considered by urologists with experience in children and access to appropriately-sized equipment; if these are unavailable, the patient should be transferred to center where they are available. Many of these interventions are limited by the size of the instruments available. Our group has used each of the three modalities below to treat children including infants, but other medical centers may be constrained by their pediatric-sized resources.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Percutaneous nephrostolithotomy (PCNL), including miniature PCNL</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ureteroscopy</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the surgical approach, the surgeon should make every effort to collect stone material for composition analysis, as this information informs individual preventive strategies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6109.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in children: Prevention of recurrent stones", section on 'Stone analysis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Percutaneous nephrostolithotomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although percutaneous techniques for stone removal were initially introduced in the late 1970s, it was not until the 1990s that instrumentation was adapted to pediatric patients [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Percutaneous nephrostolithotomy (PCNL) entails obtaining percutaneous access to the collecting system, dilating the tract with serial Amplatz or Alken dilators or balloon dilators, and extracting the stone with grasping forceps or fragmenting the stone with a laser, ultrasonic, pneumatic, hydraulic, or combined lithotripsy probe.</p><p>Stone clearance of 70 to 95 percent have been reported. Success varies depending upon the experience of the clinician, the complexity of the stones, and the presence of an underlying structural abnormality [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. One systematic review reported that PCNL had greater stone clearance than SWL, including calculi &lt;2 cm in diameter (OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.48 to 4.91) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. However, PCNL was associated with a longer operative time and hospital stay and had a higher complication rate for children with stones &lt;2 cm in diameter. </p><p>In children, data on complication rates are limited. Serious adverse events appear to be similar to those reported in adults (who have a complication rate of 4 to 5 percent) and include urosepsis, bleeding (sometimes requiring red blood cell transfusions), renal pelvic perforation, and injury to adjacent organs (eg, hydrothorax and colon perforation) [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>].</p><p>Follow-up data regarding renal function are limited. One study using 9mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) renal scans reported no evidence of postoperative scarring after PCNL or impairment of glomerular filtration rate when evaluated six months after the procedure [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4086170899"><span class="h4">Miniature PCNL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An important advancement in percutaneous instrumentation is the introduction of smaller nephroscopes and ultrasonic lithotripsy probes used in performing miniature (or mini) PCNL. Mini-PCNL is performed in a percutaneous tract less than 24F, typically using an 11 to 15F nephroscope while micro-PCNL is accomplished via a 4.85F "all-seeing needle". A systematic review of mini- and micro-PCNL series, including 14 studies in total, found that in moderate to large calculi (mean diameter between 1.2 and 4.1 cm) stone clearance ranged from 80 to 100 percent with a mean complication rate of 11.2 percent. While micro-PCNL was associated with a lower complication rate overall, it should be noted that the stone burden was lower in these series and the availability of the "all-seeing needle" was not universally available at the time of this publication or commercially available in the United States [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h3">Ureteroscopy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ureteroscopic instrumentation has been adapted for use in pediatric patients of all ages as a first-line therapy. In small children, a double J stent may need to be placed to passively dilate the ureter followed by ureteroscopy one to four weeks later. Staged therapy for the management of children with calculi greater than 20 mm in diameter may also be necessary, especially in those children for whom PCNL is not considered feasible [<a href="#rid3">3,22</a>]. Once the stone is visualized, it is extracted with grasping forceps or basket, or fragmented with laser, ultrasonic, or electrohydraulic lithotripsy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7371.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones", section on 'Ureteroscopy'</a>.)</p><p>Although data are limited regarding stone-free rates in children, a systematic review of the literature reported stone-free rates around 90 percent in children with a mean age of 7.8 years [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. In this review, the mean stone size was 9.8 mm and the majority of the stones were in the ureter (83 percent). The success rate was lower in children less than six years of age. For preschool children with moderately sized calculi (10 to 20 mm), a prospective study of 60 children (mean age 2.4 years) reported a higher stone-free rates at three-month follow-up for ureteroscopy versus SWL (87 versus 70 percent). </p><p>Ureteroscopy is not as successful in the removal of staghorn calculi. This was illustrated in a case series of 19 children with 23 renal calculi that demonstrated clearance of renal pelvic stones in six of eight children (mean number of sessions 1.5), successful clearance of stones in all four children with polar stones after multiple sessions, and clearance in only one of seven children with staghorn calculi [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. These results suggest that ureteroscopy does not have a role in treating children with staghorn calculi. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2595350655"><span class="h3">Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) employs high-energy shock waves produced by an electrical discharge. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Efficacy</strong> – SWL has been shown to be an effective and safe procedure for removing stones that are less than 20 mm in diameter in children, including small children and infants [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. The efficacy of SWL is dependent on the size and location of the stone. SWL is most effective without subsequent obstruction when the stones are less than 10 mm in diameter and are located in the ureter [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Procedure</strong> – Historically, SWL was performed with the patient placed in a water bath. Shock waves were transmitted through the water and directly focused onto the stone with the aid of biplanar fluoroscopy. Second and third generation lithotriptors do not require the water bath. Rather, they utilize a contained fluid interface with the patient to transmit the shock waves. The change in tissue density between the soft renal tissue and the hard stone causes a release of energy at the stone surface, which fragments the stone. However, later-generation lithotriptors are associated with lower efficacy and increased need for retreatment [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Proper positioning of the child and appropriate power and frequency of the shock waves to the size of the patient are required to reduce the likelihood of complications such as hematomas or lung contusions [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. In addition, general anesthesia is required so that the patient remains still during the procedure preventing the risk of movement due to the minimal skin sensation, which an awake child would perceive at the entrance site of the shock wave. The shock waves are delivered in a synchronized manner with the electrocardiogram (gated). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, in a small clinical trial using ungated SWL, slowing the shock wave rate from 120 to 80 waves per minute improved stone clearance in children with stones that were less than 20 mm in diameter after one session [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. This increase in efficacy was balanced against prolonged anesthetic time in the group of patients who received SWL using a slower wave frequency. Further research in larger cohort studies is needed to determine the optimal delivery and rate of shock waves for lithotripsy in children.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Like all surgical interventions, the goal of SWL is complete stone clearance. However, some patients will have residual fragments after the procedure and have recurrent symptoms as well potential new stone growth [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Residual fragments that are less than 25 mm in diameter usually pass without difficulty although retreatment may be necessary. For larger fragments, stents should be considered to reduce the risk of obstruction [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. However, in children, the placement and removal of the stent generally requires conscious sedation or general anesthesia. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complications</strong> – In children, short-term complications include steinstrasse, acute kidney tissue injury, decreased oral intake, pain requiring parenteral analgesics, gross hematuria, fever, and hematomas [<a href="#rid24">24,31</a>]. Data on long-term outcome are limited in the pediatric population and further study is needed to confirm the long-term safety of SWL in these children.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">At follow-up after SWL, limited data from pediatric case series reported no adverse renal effects:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>No evidence of new renal scar formation at six months follow-up [<a href="#rid32">32,33</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Relative renal function of the treated side remained normal and unchanged based on comparisons of 99mTc–<a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12808" href="/d/drug information/12808.html" rel="external">dimercaptosuccinic acid</a> (DMSA) renal scans performed before and after the procedure [<a href="#rid32">32,33</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>No adverse effect on subsequent renal growth [<a href="#rid34">34,35</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Data from a population-based study, adjusting for patient age, showed SWL was associated with a risk of developing hypertension in patients who did not have pre-existing hypertension or chronic kidney disease [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].

Indications for ureteral stenting vary based on the associated procedure and timing.  </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Preprocedure – Preoperatively, stents may be placed to relieve obstruction of a child with infected and/or acutely symptomatic ureteral calculus to relieve symptoms and allow for staged treatment (see <a class="local">'Management of urinary tract infection'</a> above). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Debate exists regarding whether preplacement of a ureteral stent improves ureteroscopic outcomes in children [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].<strong> </strong>Prestenting (the practice of placing a stent a week or two prior to the ureteroscopic procedure) has been used for passive dilation of the ureter to facilitate ease of passage of the ureteroscopes, especially in prepubertal children [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. This does place the child at a higher risk for lower urinary tract symptoms and possible infection, but minimizes the need for ureteral dilation at the time of ureteroscopy. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Post-procedure</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Following URS or PCNL, stents may be placed to prevent ureteral edema and/or aid in passage of blood clots or stone fragments. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Following SWL, ureteral stents may be placed to enable passage of fragments, especially for treatment of larger stone burdens (see <a class="local">'Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy'</a> above). Stents are used to prevent ureteric obstruction either from edema due to ureteral injury or residual fragments in SWL. Studies in adults have demonstrated that patients with stents versus those without stents were more likely to have lower urinary tract symptoms (dysuria, frequency, or urgency), while there was no difference in stone-free rate, and the rates of UTIs, ureteric structures, and analgesic administration. Similar data in children are lacking. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3949952289"><span class="h3">Open surgical repair</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Open surgical repair is rarely, if ever, performed today and is reserved for children who have failed other urologic procedures or those with complex renal or ureteral anatomic abnormalities. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h2">Choice of procedure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Choice of treatment is dictated by the experience of the clinician and the availability of instrumentation adapted for pediatric cases. In centers where the different procedures are available, treatment choices are based upon the stone size and location, presence of an anatomical abnormality, and, if known, stone composition as follows [<a href="#rid39">39,40</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Size of stone:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For stones less than 10 mm, SWL and ureteroscopic lithotripsy have similar efficacy, when controlling specifically for stone size and location, with reported stone-free rates of up to 90 percent [<a href="#rid22">22,41</a>]. The stone location, age of the patient, and expertise of the urologist and availability of appropriate-size instrumentation clinical center are the major factors in decision-making between the two procedures. PCNL is rarely indicated in removal of these smaller stones, unless they are located within an inaccessible calyx, such as with infundibular stenosis or a calyceal diverticulum.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In patients with stones between 10 and 20 mm in diameter, it is uncertain what the best urologic procedure is. As discussed above, SWL and ureteroscopy appear to offer similar outcomes within this size range for older children. For preschool children, limited data suggest mini-PCNL is associated with a better stone-free rates for moderately sized calculi with minimal complications [<a href="#rid39">39,40</a>]. The choice of the procedure is based on clinician preference and availability of appropriate equipment for the child, and the preference of the patient and family. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with stones greater than 20 mm in diameter in the kidney, PCNL is the preferred modality for successful stone removal because of the low stone-free rates and difficulty of high stone burden passage produced by SWL [<a href="#rid39">39,40</a>]. Both SWL and URS are also options but with a higher need for repeat intervention.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Location – Several pediatric case series have observed poorer clearance of renal stone fragments from the lower pole compared with other locations [<a href="#rid42">42,43</a>]. For patients with lower pole stones, ureteroscopy is the preferred intervention. In addition, distal ureteral calculi are more effectively removed with ureteroscopy than with SWL, the decreased efficacy of SWL in the distal ureter may be due to the presence of the bony pelvis [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. Ureteroscopy is also associated with a lower radiation risk to the pelvic area, since SWL typically uses fluoroscopy for guidance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Structural abnormality – Children with underlying structural abnormalities, such as ureteropelvic (UPJ) obstruction and calyceal diverticulum, are at increased risk for developing renal stones. In addition, the underlying anatomical defect prevents effective passage of stone fragments with SWL. PCNL, URO, or laparoscopic or robotic-assisted excision may be considered for calyceal diverticulum. In our center, we prefer PCNL, especially for posterior-located diverticula, and in children with UPJ obstruction, either PCNL or ureteroscopy is used for stone removal. Additionally, calyceal diverticular stones may be accessed from a laparoscopic approach with an incision being made over the dilated stone-laden calyx and directly extracting the stones. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Composition of stone – Stones of harder composition, such as cystine and calcium oxalate monohydrate stones, are less amenable to fractionating with SWL and repeat sessions are often needed. As an example, in patients with cystine stones, the stone-free success rate may be as low as 60 percent with fluoroscopic-guided SWL [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. As a result, PCNL or ureteroscopy, and laser lithotripsy are the preferred procedure for patients with these types of stones. In contrast, struvite, calcium oxalate dihydrate, and uric acid stones break more readily with SWL and have a high stone-free success rate with SWL, although ultrasound guidance would be necessary for uric acid calculi, which are radiolucent on fluoroscopy [<a href="#rid46">46</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age – Smaller children may have higher failure and complication rates with ureteroscopy [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Furthermore, many of these children are at risk for multiple procedures and therefore multiple exposure to general anesthesia, especially if pre-stenting is performed. For this reason, SWL may be preferred to ureteroscopy in children younger than five for similarly sized calculi, especially when the location is in the renal pelvis or proximal ureter.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h3">Recommended approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In institutions where different treatment options are available, therapy can be individualized based upon the factors discussed in the previous section as follows [<a href="#rid39">39,40</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients with stones up to 20 mm in diameter, ureteroscopy with lithotripsy or SWL are both reasonable options for stone removal.
