         Oligodendroglial tumors constitute approximately 5 to 10 percent of all glial tumors. Oligodendroglial tumors typically arise in the fourth to sixth decades, with low-grade tumors occurring at an earlier age than anaplastic tumors. Despite the prolonged clinical course seen with oligodendroglial tumors, they are almost always life limiting.
        </p>
        <p>
         Historically, management decisions in patients with oligodendroglial tumors have been based primarily on tumor grade (2 versus 3) and informed by results from studies in patients with both astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors, carried out prior to the recognition of the molecular and prognostic differences between oligodendroglial and other glial tumors. In some of those studies, enrolled patients were later assessed for 1p/19q status, allowing for treatment recommendations according to the present World Health Organization (WHO) classification [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         According to the WHO classification for central nervous system tumors, the diagnosis of an oligodendroglioma requires the presence of both an isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and combined 1p/19q loss  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef134946" href="/z/d/graphic/134946.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Tumors continue to be categorized as either grade 2 (low-grade) or grade 3 (anaplastic) oligodendroglioma based on histopathologic features. However, in the era of molecular glioma diagnosis, the biologic and prognostic differences between grade 2 and grade 3 oligodendroglioma treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy have become marginal. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5211.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         The treatment and prognosis of grade 2 and 3 IDH-mutant, 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendrogliomas will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, pathology, and molecular diagnosis of oligodendroglial tumors and the management of IDH-mutant diffuse astrocytomas are discussed separately. (See

         Surgery provides tissue to establish the diagnosis and is used to relieve symptoms due to mass effect in patients with suspected diffuse gliomas. As with other gliomas, maximal resection is the preferred approach for oligodendrogliomas, but depending upon the location and extent of the tumor, only a partial resection or even just a biopsy may be safely feasible.
        </p>
        <p>
         Microsurgical techniques and pre- and intraoperative planning tools are used to remove as much tumor tissue as safely feasible while maintaining a low risk of new neurologic deficits. When these two goals are at odds, the priority is to prevent new permanent neurologic deficits [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5228.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         There are no randomized trials that have established the benefit of maximal surgical resection compared with a more limited resection, and such studies are unlikely to be conducted. Evidence supporting this approach specifically in oligodendroglial tumors (grade 2 and 3) comes from secondary analyses of two large trials, which demonstrated a positive association between a more extensive resection and prolonged survival [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. There is growing consensus that the amount of residual tumor following surgery is correlated with outcome in low-grade glioma patients. This has also been demonstrated in observational studies of molecularly defined oligodendroglioma [

         Surgery is not curative in patients with oligodendrogliomas, and additional therapy (eg, radiation therapy [RT] and chemotherapy) is ultimately required in all patients. Standard of care has evolved over time as long-term follow-up of randomized trials initiated in the 1990s has shown that combined-modality therapy is superior to RT alone in both grade 2 and grade 3 oligodendrogliomas, and with subsequent development of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-specific targeted therapies. The optimal timing of additional therapy remains uncertain in some cases, especially for patients with particularly low-risk disease.

         </span>
         Patients with a newly-diagnosed grade 2 oligodendroglioma will soon have three options for postoperative management, outside of clinical trials: watchful waiting, RT plus chemotherapy, and IDH-targeted therapy. Use of an IDH inhibitor in this setting is based on results of the INDIGO trial of vorasidenib (an investigational IDH1/2 inhibitor not yet approved by the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]), presented at the 2023 American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting and discussed below.
        </p>
        <p>
         The approach to these patients is evolving as data on IDH-targeted therapies become available and as definitions of risk are revised. Treatment guidelines have traditionally defined risk based on age, extent of resection, and tumor grade to select patients for immediate postoperative RT and chemotherapy, but data to justify treatment decisions based on these factors alone in the era of integrated molecular glioma diagnoses are in fact absent. In particular, the evidence for age and grade as risk factors is weak and often too strictly interpreted. An alternative understanding of risk continues to recognize certain high-risk features favoring early treatment with RT and chemotherapy (eg, uncontrolled disease-related symptoms, contrast enhancement on brain magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and broadens the pool of patients who may be candidates for watchful waiting or IDH-targeted therapies before committing to RT and chemotherapy.

         – Watchful waiting has traditionally been favored for most of these patients, who are at low risk for early progression and may not require further therapy for many years. IDH-targeted therapy may be an option to prolong progression-free survival, although patients without measurable disease were not included in the INDIGO trial, and safety data for very long-term treatment with vorasidenib are only available for a limited number of patients treated on phase 1 trials.

         </strong>
         – For most such patients, IDH-targeted therapy with vorasidenib may have a major role, based on the progression-free survival advantage over placebo shown in the INDIGO trial and the benefits of delaying toxicities of RT and chemotherapy. Both watchful waiting and immediate RT plus chemotherapy will remain reasonable alternatives in patients who do not have access to IDH-targeted therapies, depending on an individualized assessment of risks and benefits.

         The multicenter phase 3 INDIGO trial enrolled 331 patients 12 years of age or older with residual or recurrent grade 2 IDH-mutant glioma who had undergone no prior therapy other than surgery, had measurable nonenhancing disease (≥1 cm in two dimensions), high performance status (Karnofsky Performance Status ≥80), were not on glucocorticoids, and were considered appropriate for a watch-and-wait approach [

         ]. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral vorasidenib (40 mg once daily) or placebo. Median age of participants was approximately 40 years (range, 16 to 71 years), and more than 80 percent of patients had residual disease &gt;2 cm in diameter. Thus, most patients met historical criteria for "high-risk" for low-grade glioma (eg, as per National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] guidelines [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         With a median follow-up of 14.2 months, patients in the vorasidenib group had significantly-improved progression-free survival compared with the placebo group (27.7 versus 11.1 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0.39, 95% CI 0.27-0.56) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. The likelihood of not receiving a next treatment intervention was higher in the vorasidenib group at 18 months (85.6 versus 47.4 percent) and at 24 months (83.4 versus 27.0 percent). Data on seizure control, quality of life, and overall survival are not yet available. Vorasidenib was well tolerated overall, with a low incidence of serious adverse events (&lt;2 percent in both groups). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse event related to vorasidenib was elevated alanine aminotransferase (9.6 percent). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to treatment were &lt;4 percent in both groups. Vorasidenib is not available for clinical use and is under review by the FDA.

         – Immediate postoperative therapy with RT and chemotherapy is advised for most patients with uncontrolled disease-related symptoms or contrast enhancement on brain MRI.

          Rationale for observation
         </strong>
         – A "wait and see" approach following initial surgery is suggested for most patients who have undergone complete or near-complete resection of an IDH-mutant, 1p/19q-codeleted grade 2 oligodendroglioma  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef138450" href="/z/d/graphic/138450.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 2
         </a>
         ). These tumors have a lower annual growth rate compared with astrocytic low-grade gliomas, and some patients may not require further therapy for many years [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Surgery is not curative, and it is expected that these patients will eventually require additional therapy at the time of tumor progression. Delaying RT in this setting does not have an adverse impact on overall survival [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15
         </a>
         ], and it postpones the potential toxicities of therapy. Patients who are uncomfortable with the uncertainties surrounding observation may reasonably choose immediate postoperative therapy, even though this approach is associated with more toxicity in the short term. (See

         Of note, often older age (eg, &gt;40 years) and the presence of neurologic deficits are taken as arguments for immediate further treatment, but these are prognostic and have never been tested in prospective trials to identify which patients may benefit from early treatment, particularly for a genetically uniform group of tumors. However, because age &gt;40 years was one of the risk-defining inclusion criteria for Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9802 of RT with or without

         The natural history of untreated completely resected grade 2 oligodendrogliomas is largely informed by older studies that enrolled a mix of oligodendroglial and astrocytic tumors with unknown IDH status. In a prospective series of 111 patients &lt;40 years of age with low-grade gliomas who were felt to have a gross tumor resection based upon surgical assessment, overall survival rates at two and five years were 99 and 93 percent, respectively [

Among patients with histologically pure oligodendroglioma, &lt;1 cm residual disease, and a preoperative tumor size &lt;4 cm, two- and five-year progression-free survival rates were 100 and 70 percent, respectively.

         Oligodendrogliomas tend to recur locally at the margins of the resection cavity, and interpretation of small changes over time can be challenging. New MRIs should always be compared with the oldest available postoperative imaging as the most relevant baseline. It can sometimes take several years for the clinician to become confident that minor changes or increases in nonenhancing T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal are definitively progressive and indicative of tumor recurrence. Not every minor change is an immediate reason for further treatment; especially in slow-growing lesions, it can be cumbersome to identify the right moment for further treatment.

          Management at the time of progression

         – Management of recurrent or progressive tumor in patients who have been observed following initial resection is individualized. Decisions take into account the rate of change from one MRI interval to the next, the overall volume of tumor, its location in the brain and resectability, patient preferences with regard to more surgery, presence of contrast enhancement, and histopathologic grade of the progressive tumor, when available.

         For patients with recurrent tumors in whom a re-resection appears safe and likely to be extensive or gross total, we typically propose re-resection. If the re-resection leaves no or little residual tumor behind and pathology confirms a grade 2 tumor, a watch-and-wait strategy can again be considered.

         For patients with a relatively low volume of recurrent, nonenhancing tumor or those who are not eligible for or do not wish to undergo further surgery, we typically proceed with RT plus chemotherapy, per standard of care for grade 2 oligodendrogliomas. (See

         For patients with a large or rapidly progressive recurrence, re-resection is often indicated for debulking as well as to confirm the diagnosis and grade. This may be most relevant for patients who have had a prolonged disease-free interval and those whose tumors were diagnosed in an era prior to full molecular characterization. The need for tissue confirmation of grade may be less important in the molecular era for fully categorized tumors, however, as both the therapeutic and prognostic implications of grade 2 versus grade 3 oligodendroglioma have become less important.

         Immediate postoperative therapy is appropriate for most patients with a newly diagnosed grade 2 oligodendroglioma who have significant residual or symptomatic tumor (apart from well-controlled seizures) after maximal safe resection. However, a period of observation may be justified in some of these patients who wish to postpone therapy, such as younger adults (eg, &lt;40 to 50 years) or patients with modest amounts of residual tumor, provided that they do not have symptoms from the tumor aside from well-controlled epilepsy [

The patient population included those with diffuse astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and mixed astrocytoma/oligodendroglioma in 26, 42, and 32 percent of cases, respectively. Randomization was stratified by age, presence of enhancement, and histology (astrocytic versus oligodendroglial predominant).

         Although RT plus chemotherapy has generally replaced single-modality therapy as the standard of care for grade 2 and grade 3 diffuse gliomas, there are selected clinical scenarios in which initial treatment with chemotherapy alone can be justified. In patients with oligodendrogliomas, the most common of these is probably the case of a diffuse, multilobar or bihemispheric oligodendroglioma, for which the necessary radiation field would be very large or essentially whole brain radiation. In such cases, concerns about the potential for delayed neurocognitive toxicity take on greater weight than in the case of focal brain radiation, and chemotherapy alone can be a reasonable initial treatment strategy. (See

         This approach has not been well studied prospectively in oligodendroglial tumors, although some data exist in both grade 2 and grade 3 gliomas with subsequent molecular analyses that may help inform individualized treatment decisions.

         ]. Randomization was stratified by 1p status. In the subgroup of patients with IDH-mutant, 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendrogliomas, progression-free survival was similar for temozolomide and RT (55 and 62 months, respectively) with a median follow-up of four years. Mature survival data are not yet available.

         In grade 3 tumors, data from a truncated randomized trial in which chemotherapy alone was one of three treatment arms in patients with newly diagnosed anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (initial phase of "CODEL") found that patients treated with

         <a href="#rid35">
          35

         ]. With a median clinical follow-up of 6.6 years, 10 out of 12 patients (83 percent) treated with temozolomide alone had progressed, compared with 37.5 percent of RT-treated patients (HR 3.12, 95% CI 1.26-7.69). Adjusted overall survival was nonsignificantly worse in the temozolomide-alone arm (HR 2.78, 95% CI 0.58-13.2). There were no differences in neurocognitive decline at three months.

         – Brain MRI has traditionally been obtained two to six weeks after completion of radiation therapy (RT) before starting adjunctive chemotherapy. However, with a median progression-free survival of greater than 10 years in clinical trials of grade 2 and 3 oligodendrogliomas, early post-RT progression is unlikely, and postponing the first MRI scan until four months after the end of RT in these patients limits the risks of picking up pseudoprogression. During adjunctive chemotherapy, brain MRIs are typically obtained every two to three chemotherapy cycles for patients receiving PCV and every two to four cycles for those receiving monthly

         – After completion of initial RT plus chemotherapy, MRIs should be obtained every six to nine months indefinitely for both grade 2 and 3 tumors. Patients treated with RT alone or chemotherapy alone should be imaged as often as every three to four months but at least every six months until progression. Earlier MRIs should be obtained as clinically indicated in the event of a clinical change such as development of seizures or neurologic deterioration.

        <p>
         In historical population-based or multicenter studies, the median overall survival for patients with low-grade oligodendroglioma ranges from 10 to 15 years, and the median survival for patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma ranges from five to nine years [

         Historical studies may therefore understate the prognosis of fully characterized, IDH-mutant, 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendrogliomas.

        <p>
         Clinical factors that impact prognosis in patients with oligodendroglial tumors overlap with those identified in other gliomas. Some of the more commonly identified clinical features that predict worse overall survival include older age, male sex, poor functional status and/or baseline neurologic deficits, nonepilepsy presentation, tumor location other than the frontal and parietal lobes, and large tumor size (ie, &gt;4 to 5 cm) [
         <a href="#rid80">
          80-82

        <p>
         WHO grade 3 oligodendroglial tumors have historically been associated with worse prognosis compared with grade 2 tumors, with an average difference in overall survival of approximately five years. The prognostic value of WHO grade may be lower in the more narrowly defined molecular subset of IDH-mutant, 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendrogliomas; however, more long-term follow-up studies are needed [

          Classification
         </strong>
         – Oligodendrogliomas are diffuse gliomas defined molecularly by the presence of both an isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and chromosome 1p/19q codeletion. A World Health Organization (WHO) grade of 2 or 3 is assigned based on histologic features  (

         ). (See

          Surgical resection
         </strong>
         – Surgery is the initial step in management of all suspected diffuse gliomas. Maximal safe resection is the goal. Gross total resection is associated with improved outcomes in patients with oligodendroglioma but is not always possible based on the location or extent of the tumor. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Timing of additional therapy
         </strong>
         – Surgery is not curative, and radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy are ultimately required in all patients. Treatment timing varies according to tumor grade, clinical status, and extent of resection  (

         For most patients who undergo complete or near-complete resection of a grade 2 oligodendroglioma, we suggest initial observation after surgery (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Patients who are uncomfortable with the uncertainties surrounding observation may reasonably choose immediate postoperative therapy, even though this approach is associated with more toxicity in the short term. (See

         Immediate postoperative therapy is appropriate in most patients with significant residual or symptomatic grade 2 oligodendroglioma and in patients with grade 3 (anaplastic) oligodendroglioma. (See

          Components of additional therapy
         </strong>
         – When patients with grade 2 or 3 oligodendroglioma are selected for additional therapy, we recommend RT plus chemotherapy rather than RT alone (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_1" rel="external">
          Grade 1A
         </a>
         ). This recommendation is based on the survival benefit conferred by combination therapy in long-term follow-up of trials in both grade 2 and grade 3 oligodendroglial tumors. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Subtotal resection, grade 2 tumor'

        <p>
        </p>

         Some patients may reasonably choose PCV because it is the regimen demonstrated to improve survival in randomized trials that have included patients with oligodendroglioma, whereas others may reasonably choose

          Limited role of chemotherapy without RT

         – A chemotherapy-alone approach is sometimes justified in patients who are poor candidates for RT. One example is patients with diffuse, multilobar or bihemispheric oligodendrogliomas, for which the necessary radiation field would be very large or essentially whole brain radiation. (See

          Recurrent disease
