         Metabolic alkalosis, which is usually accompanied by hypokalemia, is defined as a disorder that causes elevations in the serum bicarbonate concentration and arterial pH. In a patient with an uncomplicated (simple) metabolic alkalosis, both parameters are above normal. However, this may not be present in patients with mixed acid-base disorders. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2352.html" rel="external">
          "Simple and mixed acid-base disorders"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis requires, sequentially, both the development or generation of alkalosis (related to the source of the additional bicarbonate) and the maintenance of the metabolic alkalosis (related to why the disorder persists and is not corrected by renal excretion of the excess bicarbonate). These issues are discussed in detail in other topics (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2330.html" rel="external">
          "Pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis"

         An elevation in the serum bicarbonate concentration is due to excessive hydrogen ion loss in the urine or gastrointestinal tract; hydrogen ion movement into cells; administration of sodium or potassium bicarbonate or the sodium or potassium salt of an organic anion, such as citrate or lactate, that is metabolized and thereby generates bicarbonate; and/or volume contraction around a relatively constant amount of extracellular bicarbonate (called a contraction alkalosis). This is called the "generation phase" of metabolic alkalosis.

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         An inability to excrete the excess bicarbonate in the urine is due to intravascular volume contraction, reduced effective arterial blood volume (including heart failure and cirrhosis), chloride depletion, hypokalemia, kidney function impairment, or combinations of these factors. This is called the "maintenance phase" of metabolic alkalosis [

        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with metabolic alkalosis usually develop respiratory compensation characterized by hypoventilation and an elevation in arterial PCO2. This lowers the arterial pH toward normal. However, the beneficial pH effect of hypoventilation is blunted because the elevation in arterial PCO2 increases renal acid excretion, producing a further rise in serum bicarbonate [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>

         Patients with metabolic alkalosis may be asymptomatic or may complain of symptoms that are primarily related to the alkalemia, to the underlying etiology of the metabolic alkalosis, or to accompanying electrolyte abnormalities. Symptoms can, for example, be due to volume depletion (which may produce lassitude, easy fatigability, muscle cramps, and postural dizziness) and hypokalemia (which may produce muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and, if persistent, polyuria and polydipsia due to impaired urinary concentrating ability and/or direct stimulation of thirst). (See

         Clinical manifestations directly related to the
         <strong>
          metabolic alkalosis
         </strong>
         are uncommon. This is in contrast to paresthesias, carpopedal spasm, and lightheadedness that often occur in acute

          respiratory

         <strong>

          "Hyperventilation syndrome in adults"
         </a>
         ). This difference is probably related to several factors. Metabolic alkalosis probably causes a smaller change in intracellular pH and brain pH than acute respiratory alkalosis because rapid shifts in arterial CO2 tension are almost immediately transmitted throughout the total body water, including the intracellular fluid compartment, the brain, and the cerebrospinal fluid. By contrast, alterations in blood HCO3 concentration cause slower and less pronounced pH changes within the intracellular compartments and across the blood-brain barrier.
        </p>
        <p>
         Muscular spasms, tetany, and paresthesia can occur with severe metabolic alkalosis [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-7
         </a>
         ], but these findings are most likely to occur when the ionized calcium and magnesium concentrations are also reduced (as in Bartter syndrome, Gitelman syndrome, chronic diuretic use). Severe metabolic alkalosis can cause agitation, disorientation, seizures, and coma [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-8
         </a>
         ], especially when metabolic alkalosis develops in patients with chronic liver disease. In such patients, the alkaline systemic pH will increase the blood concentration of unionized nitrogen compounds such as ammonia, which enhances their penetration into the central nervous system and thereby enhances neurotoxicity.

         Abnormal findings on physical examination, when present, reflect the cause of the metabolic alkalosis. Hypovolemic patients (eg, vomiting, diuretic therapy for hypertension) may have signs of extracellular and intravascular volume depletion, such as reduced skin turgor, low-estimated jugular venous pressure, and postural hypotension. By contrast, patients with effective arterial blood volume depletion due to heart failure or cirrhosis who develop metabolic alkalosis (most often due to diuretic therapy) may have peripheral edema, ascites, and/or, in heart failure, pulmonary edema.

         Metabolic alkalosis is associated with a respiratory compensation that should raise the PCO2 by approximately 0.7 mmHg for every 1 mEq/L elevation in the plasma bicarbonate concentration, thereby minimizing the increase in arterial pH. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         Patients who are unwilling or unable to report vomiting or diuretic ingestion. Self-induced vomiting and surreptitious diuretic or laxative abuse associated with the anorexia nervosa-bulimia nervosa spectrum are relatively common and must always be considered in patients with unexplained metabolic alkalosis, especially in women. Dental pathology (due to hydrochloric acid-induced decalcification), parotitis, and chronic traumatic lesions on the fingers and hands strongly suggest a diagnosis of surreptitious vomiting. (See

         The history may not be helpful in patients with metabolic alkalosis due to primary mineralocorticoid excess syndromes (most often, primary aldosteronism), disorders that mimic mineralocorticoid excess including glycyrrhizic acid (licorice) ingestion, ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome, the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess, and genetic disorders involving renal tubular transport such as Bartter, Gitelman, or Liddle's syndrome. Primary aldosteronism and its mimics are usually associated with hypertension and mild volume expansion due to the stimulatory effect of aldosterone on sodium reabsorption, whereas patients with vomiting, diuretic therapy, Bartter syndrome, and Gitelman syndrome usually present with volume contraction and relatively low blood pressure.

         Congenital chloridorrhea, which is a rare hereditary disorder that produces hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis as a result of chronic, watery, chloride-rich diarrhea. The cause is a mutation in the solute carrier family 26 member 3 (
         <em>
          SLC26A3
         </em>
         ) gene. This gene directs synthesis of an intestinal chloride-bicarbonate exchanger located in the apical mucosa of the lower intestinal tract. It normally reabsorbs chloride and secretes bicarbonate into the intestinal lumen. The exchanger has several different names including the "intestinal chloride-bicarbonate exchanger," the "chloride diarrhea anion exchanger (CLD)," and the "downregulated-in-adenoma (DRA)" transporter.

         The alkalosis in these conditions is in part related to relatively high stool chloride and potassium concentrations, resulting in potassium depletion and hypokalemia. The loss of ammonium chloride and other organic chloride salts in the stool generates systemic bicarbonate. Intermittently, the renal loss of bicarbonate together with secondary hyperaldosteronism also generates renal potassium losses. Hypokalemia stimulates the generation and excretion of ammonium chloride by the kidney, which generates systemic bicarbonate [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,9-11
         </a>
         ]. In addition, hypokalemia causes potassium to move from the intracellular to the extracellular fluid, and this transcellular potassium flux moves extracellular hydrogen ions into cells to maintain electroneutrality. These ion fluxes simultaneously increase the plasma bicarbonate concentration but lower the intracellular pH. In renal tubular cells, this intracellular acidosis promotes hydrogen secretion into the lumen and, therefore, bicarbonate reabsorption and generation (

         The spot urine chloride concentration is persistently low in metabolic alkalosis due to vomiting or nasogastric suction, reflecting both hypovolemia and the associated hypochloremia (unless the patient is also ingesting diuretics) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. This reflects the extracellular fluid volume contraction and chloride depletion that exist in these patients. In contrast, the urine sodium concentration often fluctuates in these patients. The hypovolemia stimulates renal tubule sodium reabsorption, reducing the urine sodium concentration. However, the urine sodium concentration may increase intermittently despite persistent volume contraction because the high serum bicarbonate concentration and high-filtered bicarbonate load will intermittently exceed the renal bicarbonate reabsorptive capacity. When this occurs, the loss of bicarbonate into the urine must be accompanied by an equimolar quantity of cations, mainly sodium and potassium [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13-15
         </a>
         ]. At these times, the urine pH is high, generally greater than 6.5, and the urine sodium and potassium concentrations increase. However, the urine chloride concentration remains low. This is further described by the following sequence:

         Another group of disorders that generate metabolic alkalosis associated with persistently high urine chloride concentrations are those caused by genetic mutations that mimic the effect of loop and/or thiazide diuretics. (Bartter and Gitelman syndromes are the classic examples.) The mutations producing these disorders directly or indirectly reduce the activity of the sodium and chloride transporters that are inhibited by loop or thiazide diuretics. However, unlike diuretics, which are usually taken intermittently, these defects are persistent. Thus, they generate persistent renal salt wasting and a persistently high renal chloride concentration despite systemic volume contraction. Such patients are relatively hypovolemic and hypotensive (

        <p>
         In addition, marked potassium depletion with severe hypokalemia (serum potassium concentration less than 2 mEq/L) can cause metabolic alkalosis with a high urine chloride concentration. It is believed that the severe potassium depletion can reversibly impair renal tubular chloride reabsorption, leading to a rise in urinary chloride excretion that is independent of volume status. This form of metabolic alkalosis does not improve with sodium chloride volume expansion but resolves with potassium repletion [

         Metabolic alkalosis, which is usually accompanied by hypokalemia, is defined as a disorder that causes elevations in the serum bicarbonate concentration and arterial pH. The pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis requires both the development and generation of alkalosis (related to the source of the additional bicarbonate) and the maintenance of the metabolic alkalosis (related to why the disorder persists and is not corrected by renal excretion of the excess bicarbonate) (see
         <a class="local">

         An elevation in the serum bicarbonate concentration is due to hydrogen ion loss in the urine or gastrointestinal tract; hydrogen ion movement into cells; the administration of sodium or potassium bicarbonate or the sodium or potassium salt of an organic anion, such as citrate or lactate, that is metabolized and thereby generates bicarbonate; and/or volume contraction around a relatively constant amount of extracellular bicarbonate (called a contraction alkalosis). This is called the "generation phase" of metabolic alkalosis.

         An inability to excrete the excess bicarbonate in the urine is due to intravascular volume depletion, reduced effective arterial blood volume (including heart failure and cirrhosis), chloride depletion, hypokalemia, kidney function impairment, or combinations of these factors. This is called the "maintenance phase" of metabolic alkalosis.

         Patients with metabolic alkalosis may be asymptomatic or may complain of symptoms that are primarily related to either the underlying etiology of the alkalosis (eg, volume depletion) or accompanying electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hypokalemia). Metabolic alkalosis due to Bartter or Gitelman syndrome or chronic diuretic use can be associated with neuromuscular irritability, spasms, and tetany. This may also occur with severe metabolic alkalosis of other etiologies. Abnormal findings on physical examination, when present, may reflect the cause of the metabolic alkalosis. (See

         The two most common causes of metabolic alkalosis are loss of gastric secretions due to vomiting or nasogastric suction and diuretic therapy. These and other causes of metabolic alkalosis (

         The spot urine chloride concentration is always appropriately low (less than 20 mEq/L and often below 10 mEq/L) when metabolic alkalosis is due to vomiting or nasogastric suction, reflecting hypovolemia, chloride depletion, and hypochloremia. Although the spot urine sodium concentration is also often reduced to less than 20 mEq/L as a result of the volume depletion, it is less reliable than the urine chloride because it increases intermittently when bicarbonaturia occurs (and sodium and potassium are excreted to maintain electroneutrality). Under those conditions, the urine pH exceeds 7. However, the urine chloride concentration is persistently reduced whether or not bicarbonaturia exists, and it is therefore a superior indicator of volume status. (See
         <a class="local">

Similarly, disorders resulting from genetic mutations that cause persistent renal salt wasting, such as Bartter or Gitelman syndrome, also result in elevated urine chloride concentration. These patients will be volume contracted and relatively hypotensive. They are functionally similar to persistently acting loop or thiazide diuretics (
