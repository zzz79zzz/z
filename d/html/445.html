         The hemoglobinopathies are heterogeneous genetic disorders of hemoglobin (Hb) typically inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic in carriers to mild to severe disease in homozygotes and compound heterozygotes. At the severe end of the spectrum, hemoglobinopathies impact quality of life, require life-long care (typically with regular blood transfusions), and can shorten life expectancy. Significant advances have been made in the understanding of the molecular pathology of these disorders and the ability to predict clinical phenotype from a genotype. Some remaining challenges in implementing these advances include developing optimal screening systems and efficient diagnostic methods. Though the benefit of applying programs for carrier screening (with an option for prenatal diagnosis) is recognized in many countries, the infrastructure to support comprehensive screening and accurate diagnosis are not widely available. In particular, low-income countries where hemoglobinopathies are more prevalent often lack the resources required for screening services and for public education and awareness.
        </p>
        <p>
         The hemoglobinopathies can be divided into two general types:

         Thalassemias are caused by pathogenic variants primarily in the genes encoding the two alpha or two beta globin chains comprising Hb A, and result in imbalance of the complementary globin chains.

         Beta thalassemia syndromes are generally classified according to the degree of reduction in beta globin production; complete absence of Hb A production (beta zero thalassemia) or partial absence (beta plus thalassemia). Structural variants such as Hb E are also associated with thalassemia phenotypes, and a combination of these two types is possible. In most cases the phenotype can be predicted from the genotype  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). However, the clinical phenotype can have marked heterogeneity among patients with similar globin mutations and families need to be made aware of the potential variability.

         Alpha thalassemia syndromes are mostly caused by gene deletions and the clinical severity correlates with the number of deleted genes. The less common nondeletional mutations can result in multiple possible combinations of alpha thalassemia variants with various severities  (

         Sickle cell disorders are caused by the sickle cell variant (mutation) at the beta globin locus of one allele in combination with a second variant affecting the beta globin locus at the other allele. The second variant may be another sickle cell variant, resulting in sickle cell disease (Hb SS) or a different variant, resulting in sickle-beta thalassemia, Hb SC, or others  (

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The purpose of preconception/prenatal hemoglobinopathy screening is to identify couples whose offspring are at risk of being affected, provide them with information on the expected severity of the hemoglobinopathy if their offspring is affected, and counsel them about their options before/during pregnancy. Screening before pregnancy (ie, preconception) maximizes the couple's future reproductive options as it may be possible to reduce the possibility of conceiving/implanting an affected embryo.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prenatal (fetal) diagnosis is offered to couples with established pregnancies who have been identified as at risk for having an affected offspring. The information provided to the parents will allow them to make reproductive choices. A definitive diagnosis of fetal hemoglobinopathy can have clinical implications; for example, in cases of alpha thalassemia major, knowing that the fetus is affected would prompt close monitoring of the pregnancy for nonimmune hydrops fetalis, and possibly early initiation of in utero therapy. The clinical sequelae of other hemoglobinopathies manifest later in life and have no adverse effects on the fetus, mother, or neonate. For couples who conceived in part to harvest cord blood hematopoietic stem cells to donate to a previous sibling with a life-limiting hemoglobinopathy, knowledge that the fetus is unaffected or heterozygous confirms the potential for this plan. Some couples may choose to terminate an affected pregnancy.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will review preconception/prenatal screening of couples for hemoglobinopathy and diagnosis of fetal hemoglobinopathy in at risk pregnancies. (Throughout this topic we recognize that sometimes the pregnant person alone rather than a couple is involved in decision-making). Postnatal clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment are discussed separately:

         The epidemiology of the hemoglobinopathies is a major factor informing decision-making regarding the screening approach. Sickle cell disease and thalassemia are among the most common genetic diseases worldwide. Globally, approximately 7 percent of pregnant individuals are heterozygous carriers of alpha or beta thalassemia trait or hemoglobin (Hb) S, C, D Punjab, or E, and over 1 percent of couples are at risk of having an affected child [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. The incidence varies by country and may be underreported in resource-limited countries where diagnostic testing is not routinely available. The thalassemias are the most common inherited single-gene disorder in the world and occur most frequently in malaria-endemic areas, including the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The structural Hb variants S and C are most common in tropical Africa, and also found in Mediterranean countries, Saudi Arabia, and Caribbean countries. Hb E is most common in Southeast Asia.

         More than 300 genetic mutations of clinical significance in the beta globin locus causing beta thalassemia have been described. Co-inheritance of two severe variants (beta zero or compound heterozygous for beta zero and severe beta plus or two severe beta plus mutations) and, less commonly, inheritance of delta/beta thalassemia variants and Hb Lepore, will result in a moderate or severe thalassemia major phenotype. Less severe phenotypes (thalassemia intermedia) will mostly result from compound heterozygous of two milder beta variants or co-inheritance of one severe variant with another structural mutation (such as Hb E) or with alpha gene triplication [

         Africans and, less commonly, other ethnicities, may be compound heterozygous for both a beta thalassemia gene mutation and sickle cell gene resulting in moderate or severe sickle cell disease (S beta plus- or S beta zero thalassemia, respectively). Alpha thalassemia trait (also called alpha thalassemia minor) is common in Africans and most commonly consists of loss of one gene for alpha globin synthesis on each chromosome 16 (trans; loss of two alpha-chain genes: homozygosity for the alpha thalassemia-2 trait [ie, a-/a-]). This deletion does not cause fetal sequelae but generally has a positive effect on the extent of anemia if sickle cell disease also exists.

         Alpha globin gene deletions are more common in carriers than mutations. By contrast to the African type of alpha thalassemia trait, the Southeast Asian pattern of alpha thalassemia trait consists of both genes missing on the same chromosome (cis; alpha thalassemia-1 trait [ie, aa/--]). If both parents have this pattern, the offspring has a 25 percent chance to have all four alpha globin genes absent and will be unable to synthesize any fetal or adult hemoglobin, resulting in severe anemia. Tetrameric gamma chains (Hb Bart's) in the affected fetus bind oxygen with high affinity, which leads to hypoxia, high-output cardiac failure, hydrops fetalis, and death if no intrauterine transfusions are performed to support the fetus. If one parent has alpha thalassemia trait (two alpha genes deleted in cis) and the other parent is either a silent carrier for alpha thalassemia (one alpha globin gene missing) or has alpha thalassemia trait (two alpha genes deleted in trans), this may result in an offspring with three alpha globin genes absent named Hb H disease.

         Around 200 alpha globin gene mutations have been described (referred to as "nondeletion alpha thalassemia"); most have little or no clinical significance. The co-inheritance of alpha thalassemia trait (cis) and a clinically significant nondeletional mutant alpha globin allele, such as hemoglobin constant spring, results in a phenotype that is typically more severe than Hb H disease. Other less common nondeletional alpha mutations (eg, Hb Quong Sze, Hb Adana, Hb Pakse) will have a similar effect [

         In the United States, in contrast to sickle cell disease, the prevalence of individuals with alpha and beta hemoglobinopathies is more difficult to determine. This is due to changes resulting from shifts in immigration patterns, which include people who are carriers of hemoglobinopathies that had been rare in the United States, and the increasing number of pregnancies among couples of discordant ethnicity leading to births of infants with hemoglobinopathies that previously had not been seen [

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         These points are illustrated by data from the California newborn universal mandatory screening program for hemoglobinopathies that was initiated in 1990 [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,9
         </a>
         ]. Each year, approximately 0.05 percent of the 530,000 newborn samples are sent to the Hemoglobin Reference Laboratory for confirmatory testing: Between 1998 and 2006, sickle cell disease was the most common hemoglobinopathy (1 in 6600 births) followed by alpha thalassemia (1 in 9000 births) and beta thalassemia disease (1 in 55,000 births) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. A shift of the at-risk groups for beta thalassemia was noted with the majority of cases detected in families of Asian ancestry. Hemoglobinopathies detected more often include Hb E/beta thalassemia, found almost exclusively in Southeast Asians with a prevalence of 1 in every 2600 births. Population migration and racial intermarriages continue to present new hemoglobinopathies, such as a compound heterozygous Hb SE disease, a moderate form of sickle cell disease diagnosed in the California newborn screening program [

Though the highest frequency is in Black individuals, the sickle cell carrier state is also noted in other racial/ethnic groups: The incidence of sickle cell trait was 73.1 per 1000 Black infants; 6.9 per 1000 Hispanic infants; 3 per 1000 White infants; and 2.2 per 1000 Asian, Native Hawaiian, or other Pacific Islander infants screened. Approximately 28 percent of African American people have one alpha thalassemia gene deletion, and about 3 percent have alpha thalassemia trait. In the United States, sickle cell disease affects approximately 100,000 Americans. The incidence of sickle cell disease has remained relatively stable (SS disease 1 in 3721 newborns, SC disease 1 in 7386 newborns) [

         The goals of preconception hemoglobinopathy screening are to identify couples whose offspring are at risk for having an inherited hemoglobinopathy, provide them with information about the disorder, and discuss their reproductive options. They may choose to proceed with pregnancy with or without prenatal diagnosis for fetal hemoglobinopathy; undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF) and preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT-M) with implantation of likely unaffected embryos, intrauterine insemination with donor sperm from a noncarrier, or IVF using a donor egg from a noncarrier; adopt; or not become pregnant.
        </p>
        <p>
         For couples who are already pregnant at the time of screening, early pregnancy identification of those whose offspring is at risk for having an inherited hemoglobinopathy and providing information about the disorder remain important, and prenatal (fetal) diagnosis by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) between 10 and 12 weeks of gestation or amniocentesis after 15 weeks of gestation is an option. Knowledge of an affected offspring allows couples to prepare for the birth of an affected child or consider pregnancy termination; access to pregnancy termination and the upper gestational age allowed for termination vary regionally.
        </p>
        <p>
         In most cases of confirmed fetal hemoglobinopathy, fetal diagnosis does not alter ongoing obstetric care, as fetal hemoglobinopathy typically has no adverse effects on the fetus, mother, or course of pregnancy. One exception is cases of alpha thalassemia major caused by the loss of all four alpha globin chains or by other rare combinations of alpha globin mutations and deletions [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15

         ], where early pregnancy diagnosis and the decision to continue the pregnancy would prompt changes in pregnancy management, such as close fetal monitoring for fetal hydrops, possible fetal intervention with serial intrauterine transfusions, and possible participation in a clinical trial of in utero stem cell transplantation, gene therapy, or gene manipulation. Additionally, pregnant individuals with a hydropic fetus are at risk for mirror syndrome (ie, proteinuria, elevated blood pressure, and preeclampsia symptoms), which presents medical risks and may lead to a medically indicated preterm birth.

         Universal (nonselective) hemoglobinopathy screening is ideal when possible because it can detect more hemoglobinopathy carriers than selective screening based on race and ethnicity, especially given the increasingly diverse ethnic and geographic distribution of hemoglobinopathy genotypes in the United States and elsewhere. Challenges to this approach include cost-effectiveness, optimal timing (adolescent, premarital, preconception, early pregnancy) to maximize reproductive options, and need for appropriate public awareness and education and access to screening services. Due to these limitations, selective screening of at-risk individuals is a common accepted strategy whereby care providers adjust their hemoglobinopathy carrier screening strategy to the population served, taking into consideration its diversity, individual family histories, and the masking effect of iron deficiency anemia on hemoglobin and mean corpuscular value (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH).

         Because individuals may not be fully aware of their race/ethnicity background and family history of a hemoglobinopathy, at a minimum, all pregnant patients should have a complete blood count (CBC), which is easy to perform, readily available in countries with limited resources, and also provides baseline hemoglobin/hematocrit.

         If the MCV and/or MCH is low (ie, MCV &lt;80 femtoliters [fL], MCH &lt;27 picogram [pg]) in the absence of iron deficiency, maternal hemoglobin analysis can be performed by protein chemistry methods, typically by either capillary electrophoresis or by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), or less commonly by isoelectric focusing or hemoglobin electrophoresis. Overall, these "first-line" hematological and protein chemistry tests will detect most common hemoglobinopathies  (

         Two alpha gene deletions (alpha thalassemia trait) will not be detected directly, although exclusion of a beta thalassemia carrier in cases of microcytosis and normal protein chemistry testing will indicate alpha thalassemia trait. Subsequent DNA testing will be required for confirmation.

         A one alpha gene deletion (alpha thalassemia minima or silent carrier: a-/aa) will not be detected by a CBC as affected individuals are not anemic, their red blood cells (RBCs) are not microcytic (although mild hypochromia may be noted on the blood smear), and their protein chemistry analysis is normal. Case reports have described females with a normal CBC who were silent carriers and gave birth to a child with Hb H disease when the partner was a carrier of an alpha 0-thalassemia trait (two alpha genes in cis).

         Similarly, some cases of nondeletional alpha gene variants such as a constant spring carrier state often display normal MCV and MCH. Though these minor variants mostly do not have a role in the prevention of Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis, they do contribute to the risk for an offspring with three alpha genes affected (Hb H disease) if the partner of the carrier is an alpha 0-thalassemia trait carrier (two alpha genes in cis).

         It is important to note that hemoglobin analysis by protein chemistry methods in the setting of combined iron deficiency and beta thalassemia trait can miss typical changes characteristic of thalassemia trait (primarily increase in Hb A2); therefore, iron deficiency, particularly when severe (estimated at ferritin level less than 15 ng/mL), should be corrected prior to making a definitive diagnosis by these methods. If timely correction is not possible, DNA-based testing can be performed since results are independent of iron status. (See

A hemoglobin electrophoresis (or other protein chemistry method) is performed in addition to a CBC if there is suspicion of hemoglobinopathy based on ethnicity (African, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Southeast Asian, or West Indian descent) or if red cell indices show a low mean MCV or MCH. Characteristics other than ethnicity that are associated with a higher risk for an individual to be a hemoglobinopathy carrier include a history of chronic anemia or stillbirth, a relative with a hemoglobin structural variant or thalassemia, and consanguinity [

         A study assessing the outcomes of these ACOG recommendations showed 5 percent positivity rate among 42,166 patients analyzed by RBC indices and HPLC; a third of the positive cases were 'possible alpha thalassemia trait,' which was confirmed as alpha thalassemia trait by DNA testing in 41 percent [

These findings suggest that an initial analysis that evaluates RBC indices and HPLC will have some nonspecific results that require molecular diagnosis; thus, concurrent DNA testing would be faster, more informative, and a better method for identifying alpha thalassemia carriers but may be inaccessible due to cost. In 2022 ACOG updated its recommendations to offer universal hemoglobinopathy testing to people planning pregnancy or at the initial prenatal visit if no prior testing results are available for interpretation [

         Fetal diagnostic testing should be offered to pregnant individuals at risk of having a fetus with hemoglobinopathy after counseling regarding the risks, limitations, and benefits of testing. After this counseling, the at-risk individual should be able to make an informed decision on whether to proceed with fetal genetic testing and should understand how the results of genetic testing will impact their reproductive choices. The decision to proceed with fetal diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies is influenced by the ethical considerations and the cultural and social background of the individual and their family.

          Chorionic villus sampling, amniocentesis
         </strong>
         – DNA-based testing for Hb S and C and alpha and beta thalassemia can be performed during the first trimester of pregnancy on villi obtained by chorionic villus sampling (CVS, which is typically done at 10 to 12 weeks of gestation) or on cells in amniotic fluid obtained by amniocentesis (typically performed at ≥15 weeks of gestation). These procedures are discussed in detail separately. (See

          Celocentesis (investigational)
         </strong>
         – Celocentesis (ultrasound-guided aspiration of celomic fluid) is an investigational technique for very early prenatal diagnosis of hemoglobinopathy when in utero intervention is being considered. Recent advances in genomic techniques have enabled reliable results from the small number of fetal cells that are available as early as 7 weeks of gestation; however, concerns about possible adverse fetal effects (procedure-related pregnancy loss and transverse limbs defects) need to be addressed by additional large and randomized trials before offering this investigational technique in clinical practice [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. It is only performed at highly specialized centers and may be most useful for selecting candidates for studies of early fetal intervention (eg, in utero stem cell transplantation) of alpha thalassemia. Diagnostic accuracy appears to be &gt;99 percent in limited small series.

          Cell-free DNA
         </strong>
         – Use of noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS) for monogenic autosomal recessive diseases by assessment of cell-free DNA in the maternal circulation is commercially available. However, it is considered investigational because the methodology has more challenges than aneuploidy screening for the common trisomies and sex chromosome aneuploidies and because of the lack of adequate validation studies [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28-30
         </a>
         ]. It should be performed at ≥10 weeks of gestation to ensure an adequate fetal fraction. (See

         In autosomal recessive conditions like sickle cell disease and thalassemia, 50 percent of the fetal genome is the same as that inherited from the mother. For a fetus to be affected with the hemoglobinopathy, the paternal pathogenic allele would also have to be identified by NIPS and distinguished from the maternally inherited pathogenic allele. This may involve inclusion of other family members for molecular tracking of the pathogenic allele. If NIPS is performed, it is a screening test; positive findings must be confirmed by diagnostic testing performed on a fetal/placental sample obtained via an invasive procedure (CVS, amniocentesis discussed above) before undertaking any interventions.
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Given its limitations, some parents and providers might choose to perform interventional diagnostic testing even with a negative NIPS, particularly in cases where the couple had prior affected children.

An affected fetus is suggested by a cardiothoracic ratio &gt;0.5 before 17 weeks; a placental thickness &gt;18 mm before 15 weeks or &gt;30 mm at ≥18 weeks or greater than the mean plus 2 standard deviations for gestational age; or MCA-PSV &gt;1.5 multiples of the median (MoM) after 15 weeks [

         As discussed above, most cases of confirmed fetal hemoglobinopathy do not require an alteration in pregnancy care, as fetal hemoglobinopathy typically has no adverse effects on the fetus, mother, or course of pregnancy. Alpha thalassemia major, typically a result from homozygous alpha thalassemia with the loss of all four alpha globin chains, is an exception as it usually causes hydrops fetalis and, in the absence of any intervention, causes fetal death during the late-second through mid-third trimester of pregnancy. Fetal hydrops can also lead to a preeclampsia-like syndrome called maternal mirror syndrome. (See

         One intervention for fetuses with alpha thalassemia major is serial intrauterine transfusions, which has resulted in successful live births, sometimes at full term, but commits the infant to transfusion dependence and its consequences unless postnatal allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is performed [

          Parental carrier screening
         </strong>
         – Preconception/prenatal hemoglobinopathy screening is a routine part of preconception/prenatal care. Our approach is shown in the algorithm  (

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). The goal is to identify individuals/couples at high risk of having a child with a clinically important inherited hemoglobinopathy. Typically, the pregnant or potentially pregnant member of the couple is screened first, but both members can be screened concurrently if time and gestational age is an issue. Screening results allow the couple to make reproductive choices based on this information and, in the case of alpha thalassemia major, to monitor the pregnancy for nonimmune hydrops fetalis and potentially intervene.

          Prenatal (fetal) diagnosis

         – If the fetus is at risk of having an inherited hemoglobinopathy, DNA-based testing for fetal hemoglobinopathies can be performed during the first trimester on cells obtained by chorionic villus sampling (CVS; typically performed at 10 to 12 weeks of gestation) or on direct or cultured amniotic fluid cells obtained by amniocentesis (typically performed after 15 weeks of gestation), if the couple desires. Noninvasive prenatal testing of cell-free DNA in the maternal circulation is being developed for hemoglobinopathies but is typically followed by fetal testing for confirmation. (See
