It is estimated that 13 to 23 percent of people experience psychotic symptoms at some point in their lifetime and 1 to 4 percent will meet criteria for a psychotic disorder [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>].</p><p>The distribution by age of new cases of psychosis has not been well studied. Among all causes of psychosis, the distribution of the age of onset has not been well studied.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H473103563"><span class="h1">CAUSES OF PSYCHOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Psychosis is a feature of many psychiatric disorders but may also be a manifestation of substance use or underlying medical disease.</p><p>Common or notable causes of psychosis include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Primary psychotic disorders</strong> – These include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, brief psychotic disorder, and delusional disorders. (See <a class="local">'Primary psychiatric causes and their differentiation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Psychosis due to another medical condition</strong> – These include medical and neurologic disorders, infectious or inflammatory processes, endocrinologic, or other systemic illness. In some cases, psychotic symptoms are present with delirium.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Examples of medical conditions that can present with psychosis include (see <a class="local">'Medical and substance/medication-related causes'</a> below):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hepatic and renal disorders, such as hepatic or uremic encephalopathy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Infectious disease, such as syphilis, herpes simplex encephalitis, or prion disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Inflammatory or demyelinating disorders, such as autoimmune encephalitis, systemic lupus encephalitis, or multiple sclerosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Neurodegenerative and neurologic disorders, such as dementia with Lewy bodies, Huntington disease, or Alzheimer disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Metabolic disorders, such as acute intermittent porphyria or Wilson disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Substance or medication induced psychotic disorders </strong>– Many prescription medications, as well as illicit substances, can induce transient psychotic symptoms. Substances that can cause psychosis are included on the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef96392" href="/z/d/graphic/96392.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Medical and substance/medication-related causes'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Evaluation for the cause of psychosis is discussed elsewhere.

Typical manifestations of psychosis include delusions, hallucinations, and disordered thinking [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. In primary psychotic disorders, the first episode of psychosis is typically preceded by premorbid signs and symptoms and a prodromal period.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1100228225"><span class="h2">Defining features</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3755148475"><span class="h3">Delusions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Delusions are defined as strongly held false beliefs that are not typical of the patient's cultural or religious background. Delusions can be categorized based on plausibility as bizarre (family members have been replaced by body-doubles) or nonbizarre (spouse is having an affair). Frequently encountered types of delusions include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Persecutory delusions or paranoid delusions (eg, believing one is being followed and harassed by gangs)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grandiose delusions (eg, believing one is a billionaire CEO who owns casinos around the world)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Erotomanic delusions (eg, believing a famous movie star is in love with them)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Somatic delusions (eg, believing one's sinuses have been infested by worms)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Delusions of reference (eg, believing dialogue on a television program is directed specifically towards the patient)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Delusions of control (eg, believing one's thoughts or actions are being controlled by other persons or objects)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1555968766"><span class="h3">Hallucinations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hallucinations can be defined as wakeful sensory experiences of content that is not actually present. They are differentiated from illusions, which are distortions or misinterpretations of real sensory stimuli. Hallucinations can occur in any of the five sensory modalities. Auditory hallucinations (eg, hearing voices) are the most common, followed by visual, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory hallucinations. Auditory hallucinations can present as speech (including spoken commands or a running commentary on the patient's actions) or other sounds. Visual hallucinations can range from recognizable objects to more unformed lights or shadows. Olfactory hallucinations are frequently of unpleasant odors.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1433390492"><span class="h3">Thought disorganization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Commonly observed forms of thought disorganization include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Alogia/poverty of content – Very little information conveyed by speech.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Thought blocking – Suddenly losing train of thought, exhibited by abrupt interruption in speech.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Loosening of association – Speech content notable for ideas presented in sequence that are not closely related.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tangentiality – Answers to interview questions diverging increasingly from topic being asked about (called circumstantiality if content eventually returns to original topic).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clanging or clang association – Using words in a sentence that are linked by rhyming or phonetic similarity (eg, "I fell down the well sell bell.")</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Word salad – Real words are linked together incoherently, yielding nonsensical content.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Perseveration – Repeating words or ideas persistently, often even after interview topic has changed.</p><p></p><p>Evidence for thought disorganization is derived from the patients' pattern of speech during the interview. While disorganized speech is a frequently observed symptom in psychosis, it is nonspecific and can also be present in delirium or other neurologic or cognitive disorders.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1383051228"><span class="h2">Associated clinical manifestations</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3170436531"><span class="h3">Premorbid and prodromal periods in primary psychotic disorders</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Premorbid features</strong> – Individuals who develop psychosis may experience premorbid signs and symptoms including mood changes, neurocognitive impairments, functional decline, and social isolation. Minor physical anomalies suggestive of neurodevelopment abnormalities are also commonly noted prior to the onset of psychotic illness and include facial dysmorphia, such as a wide skull base or abnormal size of facial features [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prodromal symptoms </strong>– The prodromal period may last from a few weeks to a few years and is characterized by subsyndromal psychosis, negative symptoms, and a deterioration in functioning. The prodromal syndrome is usually diagnosed retrospectively. Prospectively, consistent symptoms represent a high, but not inevitable, risk for developing psychosis. Other terms used to describe the prodromal syndrome are attenuated psychosis syndrome, ultrahigh risk for psychosis, and clinical high risk for psychosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The presence of prodromal symptoms cannot predict a specific psychiatric disorder, although data on the eventual diagnosis among patients with prodromal symptoms are limited. In a sample of 89 clinical high-risk subjects from the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study consortium, 56 percent were eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum psychosis, 10 percent with affective psychosis, and 34 percent with other psychosis, principally psychosis not otherwise specified [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H261969392"><span class="h3">Agitation/aggression</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Agitation is a state of acute anxiety and heightened emotional arousal with increased motor activity. Although not specific to psychosis, untreated psychosis is associated with an increased risk for agitation and aggressive behaviors. These can sometimes lead to intentional or unintentional bodily harm to self or others. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/291.html" rel="external">"Assessment and emergency management of the acutely agitated or violent adult"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/130944.html" rel="external">"Psychosis in adults: Initial management", section on 'Psychiatric symptoms'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/130944.html" rel="external">"Psychosis in adults: Initial management", section on 'Additional patient-specific considerations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1376818971"><span class="h3">Catatonia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Catatonia is a syndrome manifested by inability to move normally. It can present as either extreme negativism (eg, passive resistance to movement), mutism, or catatonic excitement (eg, excessive, purposeless motor activity). The presence of catatonia should alert the clinician to the possibility of an underlying medical disorder and should be thoroughly investigated. Treatment of catatonia is reviewed in more detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15869.html" rel="external">"Catatonia: Treatment and prognosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14683.html" rel="external">"Catatonia in adults: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1810519217"><span class="h3">Negative symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Negative symptoms, also called deficit symptoms, include decreased expressiveness, apathy, flat affect, anergia. These symptoms may be secondary to other manifestations of the illness (ie, depression) or due to treatment of psychosis (extrapyramidal symptoms).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1196275791"><span class="h3">Neurocognitive deficits</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neurocognitive impairment may be prominent prior to the onset of psychotic illness and when present in the prodromal state are predictive of a later development of psychotic illness [<a href="#rid10">10-12</a>]. Neurocognitive dysfunction is commonly noted in domains of memory, attention, processing speed, and executive functioning. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14067.html" rel="external">"The mental status examination in adults", section on 'Mental status examination'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14067.html" rel="external">"The mental status examination in adults", section on 'Executive functioning'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3696404280"><span class="h3">Functional impairment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Functional impairment is linked to neurocognitive impairment and is often present before the onset of psychosis. Functional impairment in the prodrome is a predictor of later developmental of a full psychotic episode. Early psychosis treatment programs use recovery-based services to target the significant functional impairment that occurs early in the course of the illness.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3541381811"><span class="h1">COMORBID DISORDERS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Psychotic illness is associated with several comorbid diagnoses that may be present at all stages of the psychotic illness.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3970063653"><span class="h2">Substance use disorders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with psychosis and underlying psychotic disorders overall have higher rates of co-occurring substance use disorders (SUDs) compared with the general population.</p><p>In one study of 404 patients with first episode psychosis at 34 community mental health centers across the United States, 52 percent of patients met criteria for any lifetime or drug use disorder [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Additionally, the study reported the following rates of other SUDs in first episode psychosis:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cannabis use disorder – 35 percent (versus 11 percent in general population)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stimulant use disorder – 5 percent (versus 2 percent in general population)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Opioid use disorders – 5 percent (versus 3 percent in general population)</p><p></p><p>In contrast, the rate of lifetime alcohol use disorder in first episode psychosis was found to be similar to that in the young adult general population (35 versus 37 percent) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>Studies have found associations between substance use, generally cannabis use, and increased risk of developing psychotic symptoms [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Some experts believe that early cannabis use is a causal factor in developing schizophrenia. In a sample of 291 individuals meeting the criteria for attenuated psychotic syndrome, a history of any SUD was one of five predictors of conversion to psychosis [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7797.html" rel="external">"Cannabis use and disorder: Epidemiology, pharmacology, comorbidities, and adverse effects", section on 'Psychiatric effects'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H969708517"><span class="h2">Mood disorders and suicidal ideation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Depressive symptoms including dysphoria, anhedonia, amotivation, and sleep disturbance are common during the prodromal phase and first episode of psychosis. Additionally, the risk of suicide is high early in the course of psychosis and at the onset of schizophrenia [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p>The presence of depression during the prodromal phase is a significant predictor of future depression and is associated with acts of self-harm and a less favorable outcome [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. In one study, it was reported to occur in 80 percent of patients at one or more phases of the first episode of psychosis. The combination of depression and suicidal thinking was present in 63 percent [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>Factors associated with increased suicidal behavior are previous suicide attempt, history of sexual abuse, substance use (eg, cannabis use), lower baseline functioning, greater psychotic symptoms, and family history of severe mental disorder [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6962.html" rel="external">"Schizophrenia in adults: Clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis", section on 'Suicide'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3837479998"><span class="h2">Anxiety disorders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Anxiety disorders are prevalent in the premorbid and prodromal phases of psychosis as well as during the first episode of psychosis.

Delusions, hallucinations, and disordered thinking are the hallmark symptoms, and are present in variable degrees in patients with psychosis. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Causes of psychosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical manifestations</strong> – Individuals with psychosis may display agitation, catatonia, negative symptoms, and neurocognitive deficits, all of which may contribute to the functional impairment associated with psychosis. (See <a class="local">'Associated clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Comorbidity</strong> – Psychotic illness is associated with several comorbid diagnoses that may be present at all stages of the psychotic illness. These include mood disorders, substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and metabolic syndrome. (See <a class="local">'Comorbid disorders'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Suicidal ideation</strong> – The risk of suicide is high early in the course of psychosis and at the onset of schizophrenia. (See <a class="local">'Mood disorders and suicidal ideation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic evaluation</strong> – Psychotic symptoms can be seen in many psychiatric and medical illnesses. Longitudinal follow-up is often needed to clarify to diagnosis. As part of our diagnostic evaluation of a patient with recent onset of psychosis, we include the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Interview of patient and family members to assess the quality and timeline of symptoms, co-occurring disorders that may be contributing to the psychosis, safety risk, and level of care needed. (See <a class="local">'Interview'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Review of past medical history, psychiatric history, developmental history, family history, and psychosocial history including history of substance use. (See <a class="local">'Initial assessment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Mental status examination including assessment of general behavior, mood, affect, thought process, thought content, hallucinations, thoughts of self-harm, and cognitive screen. (See <a class="local">'Mental status examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>We complete a physical examination and laboratory testing including complete blood count, lipid panel, chemistry panel, and electrocardiogram in order to screen for underlying medical causes of psychosis. We also perform a pregnancy test on all females of childbearing age. (See <a class="local">'Initial medical screening and laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Determining the etiology</strong> – Clinical features of the presentation including rate of onset, age at onset, and type of hallucinations may help to differentiate medical (or substance) related causes from primary psychiatric causes of psychosis. (See <a class="local">'Medical and substance/medication-related causes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p>In individuals with an acute or exacerbated chronic medical condition, psychosis is a common manifestation of delirium.</p><p class="bulletIndent1">Additional laboratory testing, imaging studies, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis should be done in certain cases. These include (see <a class="local">'Evaluation for medical causes'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If a medically related or substance-induced cause is suspected – Hepatic function panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone, B12 level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibodies, HIV testing, urinalysis, and urine drug screen.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Neuroimaging studies in cases with onset at older age, focal neurologic signs, rapidly progressive course, new or more frequent seizures.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Cerebrospinal fluid studies and rheumatologic studies in cases of rapidly progressive illness.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differentiating primary psychiatric cause</strong> – The time, course, and quality of symptoms are the primary distinguishing features in determining the specific psychiatric diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131414" href="/z/d/graphic/131414.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Determining the etiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If there is limited overlap of mood symptoms with psychosis (either no overlap or overlap only for a minority of the illness duration), then brief psychotic disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia, and delusional disorder are possible diagnoses. (See <a class="local">'Psychotic symptoms predominate'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If clinically significant mood symptoms are present (depressive or manic symptoms), then major depressive disorder with psychotic features, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, or schizoaffective disorder should be considered as possibilities. (See <a class="local">'Mood symptoms predominate'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2039166171"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Michael Davis, MD, PhD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">McGrath J, Saha S, Welham J, et al.
