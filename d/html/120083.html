         Hyponatremia is defined as a serum or plasma sodium less than 135 mEq/L. Hyponatremia is among the most common electrolyte abnormalities in children. Drops in sodium level can lead to neurologic findings and, in severe cases, significant morbidity and mortality, especially in those with acute and rapid changes in plasma or serum sodium.

         The diagnostic evaluation, prevention, and treatment of pediatric hyponatremia are reviewed here. Causes and clinical manifestations of pediatric hyponatremia and hyponatremia in adults are discussed separately. (See

         Serum and plasma sodium levels are typically interchangeable, except for the uncommon cases of pseudohyponatremia. Because most laboratory testing of blood sodium (clotted blood samples) is based on the serum sodium, this topic preferentially uses serum sodium, except if a study specifies the use of plasma sodium.

         Hyponatremia is detected when serum sodium level is below 135 mEq/L. In many instances, hyponatremia is found incidentally when serum electrolytes are obtained during clinical evaluation for an acute illness, especially in children with levels between 125 and 135 mEq/L. Levels below 125 mEq/L are more often associated with clinical signs and symptoms, or conditions that are associated with low sodium values (eg, chronic kidney disease). (See

         Clinicians should be aware that sodium levels vary by measurement technique. Normal values are typically based on measurements from central hospital automated blood biochemistry autoanalyzers with ion-selective electrodes using indirect potentiometry. Whole blood sodium measurements obtained via point-of-care blood chemistry analyzers (eg, iSTAT) tend to be 2 to 3 mEq/L lower than central laboratory-based measurements [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. For patients in whom ongoing monitoring of sodium is needed, this variation based on sampling technique and method of analysis should be kept in mind while managing patients with abnormal sodium values, especially if measurements are performed using different techniques.

         Once hyponatremia is detected, the evaluation is focused on determining the underlying etiology. The cause of the child's hyponatremia is often evident from the initial clinical assessment (history, physical examination, and basic laboratory testing). For example, most pediatric cases are seen in patients with hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal loss when they receive hypotonic fluids for repletion. Physical findings of edema and/or ascites are suggestive of fluid retention, which may be associated with depleted effective circulating volume, as seen in children with heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrotic syndrome.
        </p>
        <p>
         Further laboratory testing is performed for children with either persistent or severe hyponatremia when no etiology is confirmed by the initial assessment.

The urine-specific gravity varies with the osmolality, rising by approximately 0.001 for every 35 to 40 mosmol/kg increase in urine osmolality  (

          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Thus, a urine osmolality of 280 mosmol/kg (which is isosmotic to normal plasma) is usually associated with a urine-specific gravity of 1.008 or 1.009. Release of ADH is associated with a urine-specific gravity ≥1.008.

         However, specific gravity can be affected when there are other large molecules in the urine that are not normally present, such as glucose or radiocontrast material. The urine dipstick will also detect glycosuria.

         Serum osmolality is obtained when a diagnosis cannot be confirmed with the initial assessment and hyponatremia remains persistent. Since serum sodium is the principal determinant of serum osmolality, hyponatremic children typically are hypotonic, with an osmolality lower than the normal range of 275 to 290 mosmol/kg. (See

         However, if there is a relative elevation of the serum osmolality to serum sodium, causes of hyponatremia with increased tonicity due to the presence of another osmole must be considered. In children, most of these cases will be due to hyperglycemia or azotemia, which would be identified by the initial laboratory assessment. Other causes of hyponatremia with increased tonicity are due to exogenous sources of osmoles such as

This is seen in children with heart failure, cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome. (See

         As noted above, a significant number of children who are hospitalized develop hyponatremia as a result of excessive free water administration. In particular, children who are postoperative or have central nervous system (CNS) illness (eg, meningitis, encephalitis, or brain trauma) or respiratory disorders (eg, pneumonia or bronchiolitis) are likely to have antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release, which is independent of effective volume contraction. This pediatric population is at risk for developing acute hyponatremia if unrestricted hypotonic fluids, either intravenously or by mouth, are provided [

         In our centers, isotonic fluid is typically given to hospitalized or postoperative euvolemic children requiring parenteral therapy. The goal of this approach is to prevent hyponatremia because these patients are at risk for inappropriately increased ADH secretion, with associated hyponatremia  (

         Acute hyponatremia develops over a period of less than 48 hours. Children with acute hyponatremia are more likely to be symptomatic and are at risk for complications as there has not been sufficient time for cerebral adaption to occur. In this setting,

         Severe symptoms include seizures, obtundation, and coma and are more commonly seen in children with severe hyponatremia defined as a serum sodium concentration of &lt;120 mEq/L. These patients require aggressive therapy to raise sodium concentration, typically requiring hypertonic

         In patients with chronic hyponatremia (duration greater than 48 hours), cerebral cell volume adaptation has likely occurred. As a result, these patients are less likely to be symptomatic and, more importantly, are at risk for osmotic demyelination if hyponatremia is corrected too quickly. In patients who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, management is focused on correcting the underlying cause. However, if patients are symptomatic, especially if they are severe in nature, directed therapy to increase serum sodium levels is provided.

         Chronicity of hyponatremia – As discussed above, patients with chronic hyponatremia (duration greater than 48 hours) are more likely than those with acute hyponatremia to have cerebral adaption, which protects them from cerebral edema but makes them more susceptible to osmotic demyelination with overly rapid correction.

         Acute hyponatremia and severe symptoms – Severe neurologic symptoms (eg, seizures and altered mental status) are most likely to occur with acute hyponatremia, which is accompanied by a rapidly decreasing sodium concentration. In these patients, there has been no time for cerebral adaption and a more rapid approach using hypertonic

         Severe hyponatremia – Overly rapid correction of severe hyponatremia (serum sodium concentration less than 120 mEq/L and usually less than 115 mEq/L) can lead to a severe and sometimes irreversible osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), resulting in diffuse demyelination in the brain and the development of profound irreversible neurologic symptoms (dysarthria, confusion, obtundation, and coma). Symptoms of ODS can present several days after the sodium has been acutely corrected. Most reported cases have occurred when the serum sodium corrections exceeded 10 mEq/L in a 24-hour period, especially in patients with chronic hyponatremia. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2317.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Patients with chronic hyponatremia are more susceptible to ODS, and, therefore, we recommend a targeted daily correction rate in serum sodium of 4 to 6 mEq/L in patients with chronic hyponatremia (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2317.html" rel="external">
          "Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia", section on 'Duration of hyponatremia'

         is used (sodium concentration of 513 mEq/L compared with 154 mEq/L in 0.9 percent or isotonic saline). In the child with seizures or altered mental status, correction of acute hyponatremia should not be delayed. In these patients, 3 to 5 mL/kg of 3 percent saline is the suggested initial therapy, administered within 10 to 15 minutes [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10

         ]. Nearly 90 percent received hypertonic saline via peripheral intravenous catheter, simplifying management by avoiding central venous access.

         is provided at a rate of 1 to 2 mL/kg per hour. As symptoms abate, the child's clinical status and ongoing degree of hyponatremia guide adjustments for the rate and the tonicity of the replacement fluid (transition to more isotonic fluid), with the targeted goal of raising serum sodium to less than 8 to 9 mEq/L over the initial 24 hours [

         In patients with hypovolemia and reduced effective circulating volume, as seen with gastroenteritis, there is often both a loss of total body salt and water. Provision of isotonic fluid will restore the circulating volume and improve kidney perfusion. Since the administered fluid will remain in the effective circulating volume, it will inhibit activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and ADH release and limit the free water reabsorption that has mediated the hyponatremia. The child can then receive sufficient sodium and water to replace losses and restore fluid and sodium balance. (See

         The frequency of monitoring depends on the child's clinical condition, the severity of the hyponatremia, and the ongoing treatment plan. In the setting of severe hyponatremia or symptomatic hyponatremia, serum sodium should be assayed at least every two to four hours. Once there is stability to the rate of rise of serum sodium and reassurance that the rate of rise is consistent with a daily target of 6 to 8 mEq/L, and any clinical symptoms have started to abate, laboratory assessment can be decreased in frequency. Generally, if serum sodium values exceed 130 mEq/L and the child is asymptomatic, laboratory assessment can be transitioned to daily testing if there is ongoing provision of intravenous fluid therapy and, even less frequently, if intake is now following a normal enteral pattern.

          and clinical presentation
         </strong>
         – Hyponatremia is defined as a serum or plasma sodium less than 135 mEq/L and is among the most common electrolyte abnormalities in children. It is often detected incidentally, especially in asymptomatic cases of mild or moderate hyponatremia (serum sodium between 125 and 134 mEq/L). (See

         <strong>
          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – The goal of diagnostic evaluation of hyponatremia is to determine the underlying etiology, which is often evident from the initial clinical assessment:

         Most cases of hyponatremia in children are related to gastrointestinal fluid loss that was replaced with hypotonic fluids. Other children have physical findings of edema and/or ascites, which may be associated with depleted effective circulating volume, and can be seen in children with heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrotic syndrome. (See
         <a class="local">

         Initial laboratory testing may detect kidney dysfunction noted by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, or serum potassium; hyperglycemia; or evidence of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) stimulation based on an inappropriately high specific gravity. (See
         <a class="local">

         Further laboratory testing is performed when the diagnosis remains uncertain for children with either persistent or severe hyponatremia after initial assessment. Studies include measuring plasma and urine osmolality and urine sodium, which may identify disorders of water and sodium handling. (See

         <strong>
          Prevention
         </strong>
         – Prevention of hyponatremia includes avoiding hypotonic fluid infusions in hospitalized children; these children are at risk for developing hyponatremia due to inappropriate ADH release. Children with conditions predisposing to fluid imbalance, such as neurosurgical disorders or cardiac disease, also may require fluid restriction. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Principles of management
         </strong>
         – The goals of pediatric hyponatremia treatment consists of relief of symptoms caused by hyponatremia, avoidance of too rapid correction that may mediate central nervous complications, and prevention of further decline in sodium concentration. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Goals'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Management decisions regarding intervention are based on the duration of hyponatremia, the severity of hyponatremia, and if the underlying cause can be treated in a timely manner. Treatment options include administration of sodium chloride, fluid restriction, and treatment of the underlying etiology. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Symptomatic hyponatremia
         </strong>
         – We recommend intravenous sodium chloride administration for all symptomatic children with hyponatremia regardless of chronicity (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_3" rel="external">
          Grade 1C

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Initial therapy is with intravenous administration of 3 to 5 mL/kg of hypertonic (3 percent)

         <strong>
          Acute hyponatremia
         </strong>
         – For children with acute hyponatremia (develops over a period of less than 48 hours), aggressive initial correction is indicated for the first three to four hours (or until the symptoms resolve). To reduce the risk of cerebral edema, the rate of rise in serum sodium should be &lt;8 mEq/L over 24 hours. The primary problem with symptomatic hyponatremia is evolving cerebral edema, and the risk of morbidity from delayed therapy is greater than the risk of complication from too rapid correction and osmotic demyelination.

         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Chronic hyponatremia
         </strong>
         – For children with chronic hyponatremia with severe symptoms (eg, seizures, obtundation, coma), the rate of rise in serum sodium should be 4 to 6 mEq/L over 24 hours. This target should alleviate the symptoms and also avoid too rapid correction that may trigger osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). (See

         is not used for asymptomatic patients or those with chronic hyponatremia with mild to moderate symptoms. Treatment is guided toward correcting the underlying etiology and monitoring serum sodium levels to ensure that there is no further drop in the sodium concentration. Sodium supplementation can be provided, with a targeted rate of correction not to exceed 6 to 8 mEq/kg over 24 hours. (See

         <strong>
          Fluid management
         </strong>
         – Fluid management interventions are based on the clinical setting. For children with inappropriate ADH release, fluid restriction will correct the underlying problem of excess free water retention. (See
