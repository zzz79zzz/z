It is expected that a person with well-controlled asthma should be able to participate in work, school, play, and sports without limitation due to breathing. The four essential components of asthma management are patient education, minimizing exposure to asthma triggers, monitoring for changes in symptoms or lung function, and pharmacologic therapy. This overview topic presents the goals and components of asthma management. It is applicable to both children and adults. The recommendations are based upon major published asthma guidelines [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of asthma and more detailed management issues are reviewed separately. These topics are divided by age and, for adults, severity of asthma symptoms  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef127798" href="/z/d/graphic/127798.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).

PANDEMIC</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have identified asthma as a risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SAR-CoV-2]) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Several studies including patients with well-controlled asthma do not indicate increased risk in this population [<a href="#rid6">6-14</a>]. Other investigations, including a large meta-analysis of over 100,000 patients and a British nationwide cohort, report higher rates of various adverse outcomes, including hospitalization, intubation, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and death from COVID-19 in patients with asthma [<a href="#rid7">7,14-17</a>]. In the large British cohort of over 35 million adults and nearly 3 million children aged 12 to 17 years, those with mild and/or well-controlled asthma were not at increased risk of poor outcomes compared with those without asthma [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. However, adults who required medium- to high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids carried an elevated risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and death. Similarly, adolescents who required systemic glucocorticoids for an exacerbation in the prior year were at increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization.</p><p>Based on the CDC designation, patients with asthma may be prioritized for antiviral therapies if they develop COVID-19. Note that the antiviral tablets nirmatrelvir and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9871" href="/z/d/drug information/9871.html" rel="external">ritonavir</a> interact with the long-acting beta-agonist bronchodilator <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9875" href="/z/d/drug information/9875.html" rel="external">salmeterol</a>, which should be held for the five days of oral antiviral therapy and three additional days thereafter. Alternative bronchodilator therapy may be needed during this time in some patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/139068.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management of adults with acute illness in the outpatient setting"</a>.) </p><p>We concur with expert groups that every effort should be made to avoid exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and that all regular medications necessary to maintain asthma control, including inhaled glucocorticoids, long-acting bronchodilators, leukotriene modifiers, oral glucocorticoids, and biologic agents approved for asthma, should be <strong>continued</strong> during the COVID-19 pandemic [<a href="#rid4">4,18-20</a>]. Maintaining good asthma control helps minimize the risk of an asthma exacerbation.</p><p>There is no good evidence that inhaled glucocorticoids or the biologic agents used for asthma have an adverse effect on the course of COVID-19 [<a href="#rid8">8,21</a>]. Biologic agents for asthma are not considered "immunosuppressive" with respect to COVID-19 infection. In regards to inhaled glucocorticoids, there is even some evidence from open-label trials for faster recovery with high doses (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9167" href="/z/d/drug information/9167.html" rel="external">budesonide</a> 1600 mcg/day) [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/139068.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management of adults with acute illness in the outpatient setting", section on 'Therapies of limited or uncertain benefit'</a>.)</p><p>For those taking long-term oral glucocorticoids, abruptly stopping this medication can have serious consequences and has not been shown to reduce the risk of acquiring, or the severity of, COVID-19. Neither inhaled glucocorticoids nor <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> are thought to have a clinically meaningful interaction with the combination antiviral therapy <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="134695" href="/z/d/drug information/134695.html" rel="external">nirmatrelvir-ritonavir</a> over its five-day treatment course, although exposure to other systemic glucocorticoids may be more significantly increased [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The usual guidelines for prompt initiation of systemic glucocorticoids for asthma exacerbations should be followed regardless of COVID-19 exposure, as delaying therapy can increase the risk of a life-threatening exacerbation [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. For patients with COVID-19 infection, inhaled asthma medications should be given by inhaler rather than nebulizer when possible to avoid aerosolizing the virus and enhancing disease spread. When aerosolized medications are needed, they should be taken, whenever possible, in an area that is separated from others in the home.</p><p>Persons with asthma who are eligible should receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Although there may be a small decrease in antibody levels after COVID-19 vaccination in patients receiving asthma biologics compared with healthy controls without asthma [<a href="#rid26">26</a>], there is no evidence that this is a clinically meaningful effect. Oral glucocorticoids at a dose ≥20 mg/day of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> (or equivalent) in adults or adolescents may blunt the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. In our opinion, it is desirable for patients requiring daily glucocorticoids for treatment of an acute asthma exacerbation to delay vaccination until the acute exacerbation has resolved and the dose of oral glucocorticoids can be reduced to the equivalent of prednisone 10 mg or less. If dose reduction is not possible due to severe persistent disease, vaccination should be given regardless of glucocorticoid dose. Patients requiring ongoing use of ≥20 mg of prednisone daily should receive the vaccine schedule suggested for immunocompromised individuals. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129849.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Vaccines", section on 'Indications and vaccine selection'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129849.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Vaccines", section on 'Immunocompromised individuals'</a>.)</p><p>Peak expiratory flow (PEF) monitoring and monitoring of the forced expiratory volume in the first second of exhalation (FEV<sub>1</sub>) has the potential for aerosol generation during forced exhalation or coughing provoked by the maneuver [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. While recommendations vary, it seems prudent to limit PEF and FEV<sub>1</sub> measurement to settings with sufficient ventilation (eg, 6 to 12 air exchanges per hour) and where staff is wearing personal protective equipment (PPE; gloves, gown, face mask, and shield) [<a href="#rid27">27-30</a>]. Alternatively, patients can perform PEF or FEV<sub>1</sub> measurements (using a hand-held digital spirometer) in isolation at home during telehealth visits or prior to coming to the office.</p><p>Additional information about COVID-19 is provided separately.

The patient’s personal goals should be incorporated into decision-making regarding asthma management.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Optimizing control of asthma symptoms</strong> – Good control of asthma means reducing the intensity and frequency of asthma symptoms and maintaining normal or near normal activity levels.

Formoterol has both a rapid onset and long duration of action (up to 12 hours of bronchodilation). Alternatively, GINA recommends use of a low-dose glucocorticoid inhaler whenever a SABA is used for symptom relief. Although combination ICS-SABA inhalers are undergoing regulatory approval worldwide, including in the United States [<a href="#rid42">42</a>], lack of wide availability means that this latter strategy may require carrying two separate inhalers for intermittent, as-needed use [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. These novel approaches seek to treat the chronic airway inflammation that is thought to be present even in intermittent asthma and to reduce the risk of severe and potentially life-threatening asthma attacks that can occur in patients with intermittent asthma who rely on treatment with a SABA alone. More extensive discussion of the rationale behind these options is addressed separately.

An alternative is to use leukotriene receptor antagonists at least two hours before exercise [<a href="#rid43">43</a>], but patients treated with this approach should still carry a rescue inhaler in case of breakthrough symptoms.

Regular use of inhaled glucocorticoids reduces the frequency of symptoms (and the need for SABAs for symptom relief), improves the overall quality of life, and decreases the risk of serious exacerbations [<a href="#rid44">44-46</a>].</p><p>Disadvantages to regular maintenance inhaled glucocorticoids in this group include lack of perceived symptomatic benefit after each dose of inhaled glucocorticoid, leading to preferential use of SABA bronchodilator over controller glucocorticoid; patient concerns about the long-term safety of inhaled glucocorticoids and uncertainty of their need in the absence of symptoms; and confusion about the roles and therefore proper use of two different inhalers (which once removed from their packaging do not contain preprinted instructions for use on the inhaler devices themselves). One year after prescription of a daily inhaled glucocorticoid, fewer than 50 percent of patients are using the medication regularly [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. Alternatives proposed strategies to overcome these disadvantages of daily inhaled glucocorticoid therapy and achieve good asthma control in mild persistent asthma include as-needed use of a combination inhaled glucocorticoid and fast-acting beta-agonist (ie, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8946" href="/z/d/drug information/8946.html" rel="external">formoterol</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9396" href="/z/d/drug information/9396.html" rel="external">albuterol</a>) [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]; once-daily use of a glucocorticoid-LABA combination, with as needed SABA [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]; and intermittent use of high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids guided by symptoms, with as needed SABA [<a href="#rid4">4,50</a>].</p><p>Leukotriene modifiers are an alternative when avoidance of inhaled glucocorticoids is deemed necessary, but efficacy is generally less  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef127798" href="/z/d/graphic/127798.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef127786" href="/z/d/graphic/127786.html" rel="external">table 9</a>).

Because use of ICS and SABA together may require two rescue inhalers (until wider available of ICS-SABA combination therapy), use of SABA alone is a frequent alternative. However, this approach is probably suboptimal for maintaining good asthma control. </p><p>While LABA use was at one time thought to be associated with an increased risk of severe and life-threatening asthma attacks, subsequent large-scale, randomized trials regarding the use of combination inhalers containing inhaled glucocorticoid and a LABA found no such association, and the "boxed" warning (also called black box warning) that had been included in the package inserts of all LABA products was removed. It remains true that LABAs by themselves should not be used to treat asthma in the absence of concomitant anti-inflammatory therapy, typically an inhaled glucocorticoid.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6968.html" rel="external">"Office spirometry"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/569.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary function testing in asthma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5735.html" rel="external">"Overview of pulmonary function testing in children", section on 'Use of spirometry in asthma'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with asthma in whom airway obstruction has been established by spirometry, peak flow measurement using handheld peak flow meters can be used as an alternative for longitudinal monitoring. Peak flow monitoring is best used to assess changes over time and for detecting severe obstruction in a patient who may not have wheezing or complain of troublesome symptoms. Reliable PEF measurements can be made with minimal training; the costs in terms of equipment, staff, and time are minimal. Periodically, PEF values measured by peak flow meter should be correlated with peak flow measurement made via spirometry. Normal values for men, women, and adolescents are listed in the table or can be calculated  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62839" href="/z/d/graphic/62839.html" rel="external">table 18</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57257" href="/z/d/graphic/57257.html" rel="external">table 19</a>) (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/126050.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a> and <a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/126051.html" rel="external">calculator 2</a>); normal values for children can be calculated (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/127179.html" rel="external">calculator 3</a> and <a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/127252.html" rel="external">calculator 4</a>).</p><p>It is important to understand the limitations of PEF. A reduced peak flow is not synonymous with airway obstruction. Spirometry is needed to differentiate an obstructive from restrictive abnormality [<a href="#rid68">68</a>]. Peak flow may underestimate the severity of airflow obstruction as revealed by spirometry  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef141036" href="/z/d/graphic/141036.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). Also, the accuracy of a single peak flow measurement to detect the presence of airflow obstruction is limited, given the large variability of PEF among healthy individuals of the same age, height, and sex (±20 percent) [<a href="#rid68">68</a>]. The use of PEF monitoring and its limitations are presented in more detail separately.

However, measurements are highly dependent upon the patient's technique. It is therefore important that the patient's technique be assessed in the office and any mistakes in technique corrected. Instructions for use of a PEF meter are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_patient" href="/z/d/html/366.html" rel="external">"Patient education: How to use a peak flow meter (Beyond the Basics)"</a>.)</p><p>Ideally, the patient should establish a baseline value of peak flow or FEV<sub>1</sub>, using morning and evening measurements over the course of a week or two when feeling entirely well: the "personal best" peak flow value.

The personal best PEF is then used to determine the normal PEF range, which is between 80 and 100 percent of the patient's personal best.

Asthma control can be judged, irrespective of medication use, based on the current level of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) or PEF values, and number of exacerbations requiring oral glucocorticoids in the preceding year. National (NAEPP) and international (GINA) guidelines offer a step-care approach to escalating medications until good asthma control is achieved.
