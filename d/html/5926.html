The blood spreads quickly within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), leading to a rapid increase in intracranial pressure. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H681630249"><span class="h2">When to suspect</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute ischemic stroke due to vaso-occlusion in cerebral vessels is the first consideration in a patient with SCD who presents with new neurologic findings or severe headache. However, it is important not to overlook other potential causes of neurologic deterioration. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnoses'</a> below.)</p><p>Presenting features may suggest certain stroke subtypes or stroke mimics, though no clinical features are pathognomonic for distinguishing among types of stroke:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ischemic stroke</strong> – Infants may present with focal weakness but are more likely than older children to present with seizures and altered mental status. Older children usually have hemiparesis or other focal neurologic signs such as aphasia, or visual disturbance; other symptoms may include seizures, headache, and lethargy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6213.html" rel="external">"Ischemic stroke in children and young adults: Epidemiology, etiology, and risk factors"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1083.html" rel="external">"Overview of the evaluation of stroke"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The most common locations for an acute ischemic stroke in patients with SCD include large vessel territories and borderzone regions  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50288" href="/z/d/graphic/50288.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Hemorrhagic transformation of infarcts can occur in these sites [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Transient ischemic attack (TIA)</strong> – Stroke symptoms or signs lasting &lt;24 hours have been historically defined as a TIA. However, when appropriate neuroimaging is completed, up to 33 percent of patients with stroke symptoms lasting &lt;24 hours are found to have an infarct [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In a small study in children with TIA, 16 percent had infarcts on follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. This has led to a tissue-based definition of TIA as a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction on neuroimaging [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1088.html" rel="external">"Definition, etiology, and clinical manifestations of transient ischemic attack"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">During a TIA or acute ischemic infarct, blood transfusion may hasten recovery to baseline. The traditional threshold for distinguishing stroke from TIA is therefore somewhat arbitrary. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cerebral venous thrombosis</strong> – Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT; also called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis [CVST]) has a highly variable presentation, since there may be associated brain swelling, edema, venous infarction, or hemorrhagic venous infarction caused by venous occlusion. The onset can be acute, subacute, or chronic. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Headache (of gradual, acute, or thunderclap onset) is the most frequent symptom and may occur as part of an isolated intracranial hypertension syndrome, with or without vomiting, papilledema, and visual problems. In other cases, headache may be accompanied by focal neurologic deficits, focal or generalized seizures, papilledema, and encephalopathy with altered mental status or coma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1103.html" rel="external">"Cerebral venous thrombosis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ICH</strong> – The presentation of ICH depends primarily on the size of the hematoma, anatomic location, and whether the hemorrhage extends into the ventricles. Typical findings include rapid onset of neurologic dysfunction and signs of increased intracranial pressure such as headache, vomiting, and decreased level of consciousness. For patients with large volume hemorrhage, stupor or coma is typical. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1133.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>SAH</strong> – The primary symptom of aneurysmal SAH is a sudden, severe headache, which may or may not be associated with a brief loss of consciousness, nausea or vomiting, and meningismus. Restricted SAH may manifest with transient motor or sensory symptoms that suggest epileptic phenomena and/or frank seizures. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1130.html" rel="external">"Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1111.html" rel="external">"Nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Age may be somewhat helpful for predicting the ultimate diagnosis. Ischemic stroke is more common than hemorrhagic stroke in children and adolescents with SCD. Hemorrhagic stroke is more common than ischemic stroke in adults with SCD [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. TIA is rare in children. However, individuals of all ages with SCD may have any of these diagnoses. </p><p>The epidemiology of stroke in SCD, which may differ according to the age of the patient, is discussed separately.

Hydration with normal <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> rather than hypotonic saline will avoid the potential worsening of cerebral edema; excessive fluids should be avoided.

Distinguishing between these is critical. Individuals with SCD are immunocompromised due to functional asplenia and are at high risk of sepsis from encapsulated organisms. Prompt institution of broad-spectrum antibiotics may be lifesaving. All patients with SCD who present with fever and acute neurologic findings should be treated presumptively for a bacterial infection until this possibility is eliminated, unless there is a good rationale not to do so.

The role in acute hemorrhagic stroke is less clear; however, simple transfusion is recommended for all patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90145.html" rel="external">"Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease: Indications and transfusion techniques", section on 'Indications for transfusion'</a>.)</p><p>Simple transfusion is a temporizing measure until exchange transfusion can be performed. Exchange transfusion is much more effective at lowering the percent hemoglobin S while avoiding hyperviscosity. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90145.html" rel="external">"Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease: Indications and transfusion techniques", section on 'Risk of hyperviscosity syndrome from simple transfusion'</a>.)</p><p>If clinical suspicion for an acute stroke is high and the patient's hemoglobin level is ≤8.5 g/dL, a simple transfusion should be given rapidly, within two hours of clinical presentation. Raising the hemoglobin to 10 g/dL also facilitates sedation for neuroimaging and central venous catheter placement if necessary. Overtransfusion (to hemoglobin &gt;10 g/dL) is avoided since it may cause hyperviscosity, which decreases oxygen delivery. </p><p>If the hemoglobin level is &lt;5 g/dL, it can be raised to 10 g/dL with sequential simple transfusions of 5 to 10 mL/kg, and the hemoglobin S concentration can then be determined to assess the need for exchange transfusion. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1007030545"><span class="h2">Neuroimaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neuroimaging (brain and neurovascular) is critical for all patients with suspected stroke in order to:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Differentiate ischemia from hemorrhage</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Exclude stroke mimics, such as tumor</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assess the status of large cervical and intracranial arteries</p><p></p><p>The major management implication of the distinction between ischemia and hemorrhage is in helping to decide whether urgent exchange transfusion is appropriate. Urgent exchange transfusion is indicated for patients with acute ischemic stroke, TIA, and/or hemorrhagic transformation of an acute ischemic stroke. The role of exchange transfusion in the management of hemorrhagic stroke is less clear. </p><p>Imaging methods are reviewed here briefly and presented separately.

Brain MRI is more sensitive for acute ischemia than computed tomography (CT), particularly with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the hyperacute time period. Brain MRI provides better visualization of the posterior fossa and detects intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) with good sensitivity using high susceptibility sequences. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Limitations of MRI include availability and cost. Young children and other individuals who cannot cooperate with lying still may require sedation for MRI, which carries additional risks and costs. Head CT typically takes &lt;5 minutes and thus is easier to obtain, and unenhanced CT has a high sensitivity for hemorrhage. However, CT is a source of radiation exposure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Children</strong> – Head CT is generally <strong>not</strong> considered adequate to diagnose ischemic stroke; MRI may be required to reliably exclude stroke mimics. CT should be used if MRI is not rapidly available or if a child is not stable for (or cannot tolerate) MRI. If CT is unrevealing, MRI can be obtained once the patient is stabilized [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Adults</strong> – Either CT or MRI may be used as the initial study. Brain MRI with DWI is typically preferred if available because it is more sensitive for acute ischemic stroke. For older adults with risk factors for embolic stroke such as atrial fibrillation, head CT with CT angiography (CTA) of the head and neck will rapidly diagnose large vessel occlusion.

However, the risk of ICH in SCD appears to be due to an increased prevalence of aneurysm rather than increased bleeding tendency specific to SCD. Thus, SCD is not an exclusion criterion for tPA treatment of adults with ischemic stroke. An observational study using administrative data to compare 832 adults with stroke and SCD versus 3328 adults with stroke who did not have SCD found no difference in the percentage treated with thrombolytic therapy (8.2 versus 9.4 percent) or in the incidence of symptomatic ICH complicating thrombolysis (4.9 versus 3.2 percent) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].

Hemorrhagic stroke accounts for one-third of events. It is important not to overlook other potential causes of neurologic deterioration, including transient ischemic attack (TIA), cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), seizure, infection, and other stroke mimics. (See <a class="local">'Presentation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Immediate measures</strong> – Management involves initial stabilization by clinicians with expertise in stroke and SCD, supplemental oxygen to maintain saturation &gt;95 percent, rapid clinical assessment and baseline laboratory testing, and simple transfusion, followed by neuroimaging  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef140156" href="/z/d/graphic/140156.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Patients with fever should receive empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics and antipyretics. (See <a class="local">'Immediate evaluation and management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Neuroimaging</strong> – Brain and neurovascular imaging is essential to differentiate ischemia from hemorrhage, exclude stroke mimics, and assess large cervical and intracranial arteries. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is generally preferred. (See <a class="local">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Transfusion </strong>– For patients with SCD who have a suspected or confirmed stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or TIA, we suggest exchange transfusion (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). The goal is to lower the percentage of sickle hemoglobin to &lt;30 percent of total hemoglobin (typically to 15 to 20 percent) without raising the total hemoglobin &gt;10 g/dL and causing hyperviscosity. Simple transfusion is used as a temporizing measure until exchange transfusion can be instituted. (See <a class="local">'Transfusion'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Reperfusion</strong> – Adults with SCD and acute ischemic stroke should be evaluated for intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy. (See <a class="local">'Reperfusion therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mechanism-specific treatment </strong>–<strong> </strong>The following is appropriate in addition to immediate assessment, stabilization, and other standard acute stroke management  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef140156" href="/z/d/graphic/140156.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Ischemic stroke or TIA</strong> – Antiplatelet therapy may be appropriate for adults with SCD who have an acute TIA or ischemic stroke, particularly if they have traditional stroke risk factors. (See <a class="local">'Role of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Intracranial hemorrhage</strong> – Neurosurgical evaluation and angiography to guide therapy. Additional interventions for specific types of hemorrhagic stroke are discussed above. (See <a class="local">'Intracranial hemorrhage management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Moyamoya syndrome</strong> – Some clinicians start antiplatelet therapy. (See <a class="local">'Moyamoya syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>CVT</strong> – Heparin anticoagulation, even if hemorrhagic transformation occurs. (See <a class="local">'Cerebral venous thrombosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Follow-up</strong> – Secondary stroke prevention is critical. Repeat imaging, cognitive assistance, and rehabilitation services may be appropriate. (See <a class="local">'Follow-up after the acute event'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2240587731"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span></p><p>UpToDate acknowledges ZoAnn Dreyer, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p><p>The UpToDate editorial staff also acknowledge the extensive contributions of Donald H Mahoney, Jr, MD, to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Kassim AA, Galadanci NA, Pruthi S, DeBaun MR.
