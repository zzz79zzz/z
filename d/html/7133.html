         Evaluation for anemia is one of the most common problems in clinical practice. The evaluation may be straightforward in an otherwise healthy individual with a single cause of anemia, but in many cases the cause is not readily apparent and multiple conditions may be contributing.
        </p>
        <p>
         An approach to the evaluation of the adult with anemia is presented here. Diagnosis of specific conditions is discussed in separate topic reviews referenced below. Evaluation of anemia in children is discussed separately. (See

         Anemia is defined for patient care as a reduction in one or more of the major red blood cell (RBC) measurements obtained as a part of the complete blood count (CBC): hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, or RBC count. A low hemoglobin concentration and/or low hematocrit are the parameters most widely used to diagnose anemia, with the following cutoffs  (

         <strong>
          Hemoglobin
         </strong>
         – Hemoglobin is reported as the concentration of hemoglobin in whole blood. When measured by an electronic counter, hemoglobin concentration is directly determined, while hematocrit is calculated from other parameters. For this reason, many physicians prefer to use hemoglobin to define and describe anemia. Values may be expressed as grams of hemoglobin per 100 mL (g/dL) or per liter (g/L). To convert to mmol/L, the hemoglobin in g/dL can be multiplied by 0.62. Hemoglobin can be reported non-invasively by continuous monitoring [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ].

         <strong>
          Hematocrit
         </strong>
         – Hematocrit (HCT), also called packed cell volume (PCV), is the percentage of blood volume occupied by RBCs. It can be measured directly following centrifugation of a blood sample  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61513" href="/z/d/graphic/61513.html" rel="external">
          picture 1

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         When measured by an electronic cell counter, HCT is calculated from the RBC count (in millions/microL) and the mean corpuscular volume (MCV; in femtoliters [fL]): HCT = ([RBC x MCV]/10).

         <strong>
          RBC count
         </strong>
         – RBC count is the number of RBCs contained in a specified volume of whole blood, usually expressed as millions of cells per microL of whole blood.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Other normal ranges have been proposed. World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for anemia in adult males are hemoglobin &lt;13 and in adult females are hemoglobin &lt;12 g/dL [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. However, these criteria were intended for use within the context of international nutrition studies and were not initially designed to serve as "gold standards" for diagnosing anemia [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Normal ranges for laboratory tests are defined as the range of values centered at the median that includes 95 percent of an apparently healthy population. For that reason, normal values of hemoglobin, HCT, and RBC count may differ depending on the population tested. Since hemoglobin is measured and HCT calculated (HCT = MCV x RBC count/10), hemoglobin is likely to be more accurate. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Caveats for normal ranges'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Some reports have described lower values for hemoglobin in Black Americans than in White Americans (approximately 0.5 to 1 g/dL lower for Black Americans) [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-9
         </a>
         ]. It is not clear whether this difference is due to health disparities such as greater frequency of iron deficiency, to a higher presence of alpha thalassemia in individuals of African ancestry, or to other causes [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. We use the same hemoglobin and HCT thresholds for evaluating anemia in all racial and ethnic groups (we do not assume that a slightly lower value in a Black American is normal).
        </p>
        <p>
         The increased frequency of anemia seen with aging has led to suggestions that a different standard for the normal hemoglobin should be used in older adults [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Review of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicates that the mean hemoglobin values for adults &gt;70 years are within the usual normal ranges (14.5 g/dL for males and 13.4 g/dL for females), while the 5
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         percentiles are below the normal ranges (11.7 g/dL for males and 10.9 g/dL for females) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. This lower boundary may reflect an increased prevalence of comorbidities, especially chronic kidney disease [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Another study that used survey data to try to identify a lower normal hemoglobin in older individuals concluded that the World Health Organization (WHO) definitions are applicable in older adults [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Thus, rather than seeking to define a lower limit for the reference range for older individuals as a population, we prefer to focus on determining the appropriate evaluation of a low hemoglobin in each person and to individualize the approach to each person's circumstances, with an informed discussion and shared decision-making. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Older adults'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In individuals with anemia, hemoglobin and HCT decrease in parallel, although the HCT/hemoglobin ratio (approximately 3 in most cases) may vary according to the volume (size) of the cells. The RBC count also usually parallels the hemoglobin and HCT, except in cases of extreme microcytosis such as thalassemia, in which the RBC count may be increased despite the presence of anemia. The RBC count is less commonly used to diagnose anemia for this reason. A finding of high RBC count in an individual with anemia suggests thalassemia. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7116.html" rel="external">
          "Diagnosis of thalassemia (adults and children)", section on 'CBC and hemolysis testing'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For research, anemia can be defined as a reduced RBC mass, expressed in mL/kg, as determined via blood volume studies. However, blood volume studies are not used in clinical practice, and increasingly they are not used in research. These studies are impractical, costly, and rarely available.

          Pregnancy

         <a href="#rid14">
          14

         ]. By the criterion of RBC mass, the individual is not anemic, but hemoglobin, HCT, and RBC count frequently decrease to anemic levels  (

         ). The terms "physiologic" or "dilutional" anemia have been applied to this setting, although these individuals are not actually anemic and do not require evaluation as long as their hemoglobin remains ≥11 g/dL in the first trimester, ≥10.5 g/dL in the second trimester, and ≥10.5 g/dL in the third trimester.

          Smoking

         The red blood cell (RBC) indices describe RBC size, hemoglobin content, and uniformity of the RBC population. These values can be very helpful in determining the cause of anemia. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and red cell distribution width (RDW) are generally the most useful.

          MCV
         </strong>
         – Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is the average volume (size) of the RBCs. It can be measured, as it is in automated cell counters, or calculated (MCV in femtoliters [fL] = 10 x HCT [in percent] ÷ RBC [in millions/microL]). RBCs with MCV in the normal range are roughly the same diameter as the nucleus of a normal lymphocyte on the peripheral blood smear. Anemia can be classified based on whether the MCV is low, normal, or elevated. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Evaluation based on MCV'

          MCH
         </strong>
         – Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) is the average hemoglobin content in an RBC. It is calculated (MCH in picograms [pg]/cell = hemoglobin [in g/dL] x 10 ÷ RBC [in millions/microL]). A low MCH is typically reflected in an enlarged area of central pallor in RBCs on the peripheral blood smear (greater than one-third of the RBC diameter), which defines "hypochromia" on the blood smear. This may be seen in iron deficiency and thalassemia.

          MCHC
         </strong>
         – Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is the average hemoglobin concentration per RBC. It is calculated as (MCHC in grams [g]/dL = hemoglobin [in g/dL] x 100 ÷ HCT [in percent]). Very low MCHC values are typical of iron deficiency anemia, and very high MCHC values typically reflect spherocytosis or RBC agglutination. Examination of the peripheral blood smear is helpful in distinguishing these findings. (See

          RDW
         </strong>
         – Red cell distribution width (RDW) is a measure of the variation in RBC size, which is reflected in the degree of anisocytosis on the peripheral blood smear. RDW is calculated as the coefficient of variation (CV) of the red cell volume distribution (RDW = [standard deviation/MCV] x 100).

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         A high RDW implies a large variation in RBC sizes, and a low RDW implies a more homogeneous population of RBCs. A high RDW can be seen in a number of anemias, including iron deficiency, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and hemoglobinopathies, as well as in patients with anemia who have received transfusions. Review of the peripheral blood smear often is helpful in identifying the cause. (See

          Anemia
         </strong>
         – In anemia, the reticulocyte count rises. A normal bone marrow can increase the rate of RBC production approximately fivefold in adults (seven- to eightfold in children). Thus, under optimal conditions, reticulocyte percentages of at least 4 to 5 percent (often considerably higher) and absolute reticulocyte counts as high as 350,000/microL (3.5 x 10
         <sup>

         An increased reticulocyte count represents a normal bone marrow response to anemia. Incorporation of the reticulocyte count into the anemia evaluation can be especially helpful in diagnosing certain disorders including hemolytic anemias and multifactorial anemias. (See

          Correction factors for the manual count
         </strong>
         – The usefulness of reticulocyte counting can be improved in some settings by adjusting for the degree of anemia and its effects on reticulocyte production; examples include the corrected reticulocyte count and/or the reticulocyte production index. Alternatively, the absolute reticulocyte count can be used.

         The reticulocyte stage of RBC development lasts for approximately four days. In the steady state, reticulocytes generally spend three days in the bone marrow and one day in the circulation. In severe anemia, reticulocytes can leave the bone marrow earlier and can circulate for two to three days, as illustrated in the figure  (

          Rate of decline in red cell mass
         </strong>
         – Symptoms of anemia also reflect the rate with which RBC mass declines, which determines the extent of compensatory changes. Following acute blood loss, an individual will initially have normal values for hemoglobin and HCT, but these values will decline over the ensuing 36 to 48 hours as most of the total blood volume deficit will be replaced by the movement of fluid from the extravascular into the intravascular space or with fluid resuscitation. Only then will the hemoglobin and HCT reflect blood loss. Thus, until the total blood volume deficit is fully repleted, the hemoglobin and HCT will underestimate the degree of blood loss [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. The rapid onset of symptoms in these cases primarily reflects initial hypovolemia and hypotension and their effects on tissue oxygenation.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Conversely, when anemia develops gradually over time (as with iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, or a myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]), compensatory increases in blood volume and tissue adaptation to hypoxia may prevent symptoms from developing until the hemoglobin is very low.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In general, clinical scenarios associated with a rapid decline in red cell mass that do not permit compensatory mechanisms to mitigate reduced tissue perfusion (large volume acute blood loss, acute hemolysis) will be more symptomatic for any given level of hemoglobin or HCT than low-level chronic blood loss, hemolysis, or anemias due to underproduction of RBCs.

         There are several conceptual frameworks in which to categorize anemia. Most clinicians with experience in evaluating anemia use a combination of these conceptual frameworks tailored to the specific patient and the urgency with which diagnostic confirmation is required. Typically, this starts with the clinical features (patient sex, age, and underlying conditions), with review of the complete blood count (CBC) and red blood cell (RBC) indices, and reticulocyte count with other testing (especially useful if the mean corpuscular volume [MCV] is in the normal range).

          Blood smear
         </strong>
         – A review of the peripheral blood smear is always desirable in the initial evaluation of anemia. However, it is not always possible to obtain this immediately, and some workflows will direct the blood smear to an off-site reviewer who is unfamiliar with the patient. These practices may make blood smear review during the initial evaluation an unrealistic expectation in many primary care practices. In contrast, review of the blood smear is a routine component of the anemia evaluation by a hematologist.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In some settings, review of a blood smear by an experienced professional is critical to the evaluation and treatment; these settings are indicated in the following sections. Interpretation of specific findings is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4435.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         More extensive initial testing may be needed in an individual who is critically ill.
        </p>
        <p>
         Conversely, certain tests may be omitted in an individual with an obvious clinical presentation that suggests a specific diagnosis. As an example, a menstruating female with microcytic anemia can be evaluated for iron deficiency by iron studies, without the need for reticulocyte count, LDH, liver function tests, or review of the peripheral blood smear. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Evaluation based on clinical presentation'
         </a>

         Ideally, laboratory results are incorporated with clinical information as soon as possible to help narrow and/or expand the diagnostic possibilities, as illustrated in the flowchart  (

         Diagnosis of the underlying etiology of anemia is generally not a challenge in an individual with obvious gastrointestinal bleeding or trauma.
        </p>
        <p>
         Typically, the major challenge is identifying and managing the specific site of bleeding. If an obvious anatomic site of bleeding cannot be identified, further evaluations for occult bleeding are appropriate. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2544.html" rel="external">
          "Evaluation of occult gastrointestinal bleeding"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Other assessments such as coagulation studies or assessment for a bleeding disorder may also be appropriate. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1367.html" rel="external">
          "Approach to the adult with a suspected bleeding disorder"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The immediate goal of management is to maintain or restore tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery by supporting intravascular volume and red blood cell (RBC) mass. This may require transfusions, including use of a massive transfusion protocol in some cases. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7931.html" rel="external">
          "Massive blood transfusion"

        <p>
         After the patient is stabilized, iron stores should be assessed and iron replaced if low. Serum ferritin, if low, is a reliable indicator of iron stores. Serum iron concentration is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         a reliable indicator of iron stores because it can be increased acutely by recent transfusion (due to iron release from damaged RBCs in the transfused product). (See

         If the clinical history and examination are otherwise negative, we obtain iron studies (serum iron, serum transferrin or total iron binding capacity (TIBC), serum ferritin, and calculated transferrin saturation [TSAT]). A low ferritin is highly specific for iron deficiency. Obtaining the studies after an overnight fast may be useful as it avoids interference by dietary iron or iron-containing vitamins, which can increase the serum iron and calculated TSAT. (See

The red cells are typically normocytic, although there may occasionally be a moderate degree of microcytosis due to iron-restricted erythropoiesis. Iron studies show decreased serum iron and TSAT and normal or elevated ferritin concentrations. Serum erythropoietin is typically increased above the level seen in patients who are not anemic but to a lesser degree than would be observed in uncomplicated iron deficiency  (

         Anemia can also be classified on the basis of reticulocyte production. This approach is most informative when the reticulocyte count is either very decreased or very elevated. Attention must be paid to the particular reticulocyte parameter reported (absolute count versus percentage) and is most helpful using a reticulocyte parameter that is corrected for the degree of anemia  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef129992" href="/z/d/graphic/129992.html" rel="external">

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Reticulocytosis requires a normally functioning bone marrow replete with iron, folate, cobalamin (vitamin B12), and copper, and a normally functioning kidney that can sense a decrease in oxygen delivery and produce a compensatory increase in erythropoietin (EPO). Thus, a decreased reticulocyte count suggests underproduction of red blood cells (RBCs; bone marrow suppression), and an increased reticulocyte count usually suggests hemolysis or blood loss. If both bone marrow suppression and hemolysis or blood loss are present, the reticulocyte count will be inappropriately low.

         <strong>
          Response to treatment

         – An increase in reticulocyte count following treatment can also be very helpful in determining if the cause of anemia was determined accurately and completely. As examples:

         If anemia was attributed to a deficiency (iron, vitamin B12, folate), brisk reticulocytosis is expected to occur within one to two weeks of repletion.

         If the reticulocyte count does not increase with correction of a deficiency, this suggests an additional cause of anemia is interfering with bone marrow function. As an example, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency may occur concurrently with iron deficiency, causing a normocytic anemia (see

         Hemolytic anemia should be considered when there is a rapid fall in hemoglobin concentration with an increased reticulocyte count in the absence of blood loss  (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Schistocytes on the blood smear indicate likely hemolysis due to mechanical RBC destruction. Schistocytes plus thrombocytopenia indicate possible thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), which may be life-threatening. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/88648.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Chronic hemolysis may present with a stable hemoglobin, a high reticulocyte count, and a normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and bilirubin. The combination of an increased LDH and reduced haptoglobin is 90 percent specific for acute hemolysis, while the combination of a normal LDH and a serum haptoglobin greater than 25 mg/dL is 92 percent sensitive for ruling out hemolysis [

        <p>
         Intramedullary hemolysis (within the bone marrow) due to ineffective erythropoiesis, as may be seen in thalassemia or vitamin B12 deficiency, may produce elevations of bilirubin and LDH without reticulocytosis.

         Many individuals with anemia will be otherwise well, and the clinical history and other initial findings on the complete blood count (CBC) may not be helpful for suggesting specific diagnoses leading to anemia. A diagnostic approach based on the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is most useful in these cases, as illustrated in the flowchart  (

         Evaluation of anemia using the MCV is especially useful for microcytic and macrocytic anemia. (See

          Very low MCV
         </strong>
         – Iron deficiency and thalassemia are the most likely causes of a very low MCV (&lt;80 fL). The ratio of the MCV to the red blood cell (RBC) count (Mentzer index) is useful in predicting the likelihood of thalassemia trait versus iron deficiency. If the ratio of MCV (in fL) to RBC count (in millions of cells/microL) is less than 13, thalassemia is more likely than iron deficiency [
         <a href="#rid41">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In practice, all individuals with a low MCV should have iron studies to evaluate iron status (and should have deficiency corrected if present) because the results of hemoglobin analysis can be altered by concomitant iron deficiency. (See

         – All patients with microcytic anemia should have serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC)/transferrin, and serum ferritin concentrations measured, with calculated transferrin saturation (TSAT). Iron studies will identify iron deficiency (the most likely diagnosis for microcytic anemia) and ACD/AI in most cases. Mild microcytosis with iron studies showing low iron, low TIBC, and high-normal to high ferritin in the appropriate clinical context (eg, chronic inflammatory condition with normal MCV prior to its development) is consistent with ACD/AI.

          Individuals with normal iron studies

         – Thalassemia testing should be ordered in individuals with microcytic anemia who do not have iron deficiency or ACD/AI to identify beta thalassemia or other hemoglobinopathies. Globin gene studies may be needed to diagnose alpha thalassemia; the family history may be helpful in determining likelihood of these disorders. Minimal to mild anemia and microcytosis may indicate non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (thalassemia trait). Basophilic stippling may also be seen with beta thalassemia [

         A normal MCV (80 to 100 fL) is the most common finding in anemic adult males and postmenopausal females. Normocytic anemias can be more challenging to evaluate than anemias with an MCV that is obviously low or high. Causes are more numerous and may be multifactorial, an underlying condition may not be apparent, and other findings may be nonspecific.
        </p>
        <p>
         Often normocytic anemia is associated with a slightly elevated RDW, and the reticulocyte count is not substantially increased (and may be decreased). An increased RDW may indicate a population of microcytic or macrocytic RBCs that is too small to shift the MCV out of the normal range, or combined microcytic and macrocytic processes, such as iron deficiency plus vitamin B12 or folate deficiency [

         <strong>
          Conceptual framework
         </strong>
         – Anemia can be categorized in several ways, including pattern recognition for typical clinical presentations and laboratory findings; according to red blood cell (RBC) size; or according to whether the bone marrow is able or unable to increase RBC production, typically based on the reticulocyte count. Most experienced clinicians will consider these frameworks simultaneously. The figure illustrates common causes of anemia  (

          figure 3

         ). (See

         <strong>
          Initial assessment
         </strong>
         – A history and physical examination may identify features that suggest specific diagnoses or medications that might be implicated  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef131773" href="/z/d/graphic/131773.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). In addition to a complete blood count (CBC) with RBC indices and white blood cell (WBC) differential, most patients with anemia should have a reticulocyte count and chemistry panel with creatinine and hepatic transaminases. Tests for hemolysis and review of the peripheral blood smear are appropriate in some clinical situations. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Information to gather'

         <strong>
          Common clinical scenarios
         </strong>
         – Common presentations that can help narrow the diagnosis include acute bleeding, hereditary anemias, iron deficiency in premenopausal reproductive age females, bone marrow and nutritional disorders in older adults, combined nutrient defects due to malabsorption, and inflammatory conditions that produce anemia of chronic disease/chronic inflammation (ACD/AI).

          Initial laboratory abnormalities
         </strong>
         – Pancytopenia raises concern for an underlying bone marrow disorder  (

          table 6
         </a>
         ), which may be life-threatening in some cases. A high reticulocyte count suggests hemolysis or blood loss. Clinical and laboratory findings of hemolysis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126234" href="/z/d/graphic/126234.html" rel="external">
          table 4

          RBC size
         </strong>
         – For most individuals who lack an obvious clinical pattern that can be used to narrow the diagnosis, the evaluation can focus on RBC size, as determined by the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). MCV is also useful for expanding or narrowing diagnostic possibilities in individuals with various clinical presentations. Causes of anemia categorized by MCV are listed in the table  (

          Normal MCV
         </strong>
         – Normocytic anemia (MCV between 80 and 100 fL) can be challenging to evaluate. Causes include early or combined nutrient deficiencies, multifactorial causes, a number of chronic medical conditions, clonal bone marrow disorders, and other causes of bone marrow dysfunction. Testing for iron deficiency, hemolysis, endocrine disorders, and other disorders may be appropriate, guided by the patient's age and other medical conditions. (See
