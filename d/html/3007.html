         Elder abuse – "An intentional act or failure to act by a caregiver or another person in a relationship involving an expectation of trust that causes or creates a risk of harm to an older adult." This has also been called elder mistreatment in some literature, but elder mistreatment is not mentioned in the uniform definitions supplied by the CDC.

         Elder abuse, as defined in these uniform definitions, includes physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional/psychological abuse, neglect, and financial abuse/exploitation. All of these involve a perpetrator who is in a trust relationship with the older adult.

         Sexual abuse refers to behaviors toward an older adult that are forced, unwanted, or not consented to. If an older adult is unable to give effective consent for the sexual behavior due to incapacity, it is sexual abuse. Verbal or behavioral sexual harassment has been included in this definition.

         Self-neglect – The uniform definitions referred to above do not attempt to define self-neglect. One definition of self-neglect is failure of an older adult to provide for their own care and protection. Self-neglect is said to be a failure of the older adult to thrive in their environment due to this failure to self-care and self-protect [
         <a href="#rid8">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Most experts define self-neglect as excluding cases of intentional self-neglect where the older adult who has the capacity to make and carry out decisions regarding self-care and protection and who freely and knowingly chooses not to provide adequately for such care and protection [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>

         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. When an older adult is neglecting their needs, an effort is made to determine if that person is making a free and knowing choice to do so, with intervention potentially necessary when they are not able to make that choice.

         All states and territories of the United States, including the District of Columbia, have enacted legislation providing for protection of elders found to be abused, neglected, and financially exploited. In addition, most have statutes or regulations specifically providing for protection of older adults from self-neglect [

         Community-dwelling older adults may be offered resources and protection in the United States by state Adult Protective Services (APS) agencies. These agencies receive and investigate allegations or complaints, and provide social, legal, medical and material interventions to help the victims. This offer of help extends to older adults found to be in a state of elder abuse or self-neglect, whether or not the older adult is vulnerable or cognitively impaired. APS does attempt to facilitate the accomplishment of essential needs for the health and welfare of the victim.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Long-Term Care Ombudsman programs (LTCOP) provide protection to older adults in institutional settings in all states. They receive complaints and advocate on behalf of long-term care residents. The state LTCOP may have authority to investigate and intervene as needed, or it may refer the case to another agency (an APS agency or licensing agency for the involved facility) [

         Prevalence estimates of elder abuse vary widely, depending on definitions, populations, and settings and the means of ascertaining abuse (surveys, self-reports to regulatory agencies, etc). Elder abuse is often undisclosed and prevalence data are likely underestimations. The highest rates of elder abuse are in women and in persons 80 years of age and older. The abuser is a family member (usually a spouse or adult child) in approximately 90 percent of cases [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,17

         Data regarding elder abuse and neglect in the community are somewhat limited due to differences in definitions and data collection across the different jurisdictions in the United States. Lack of training in recognition of elder abuse and neglect, as well as reluctance to report due to fear of retaliation, a desire to protect the abuser, a fear of being removed from their home, or lack of cognitive ability to report the abuser also reduces the number of cases reported [

         In general, studies have confirmed the expectation that cases of abuse and self-neglect are underreported to Adult Protective Services (APS) and that self-neglect is the most common condition among reported cases. Some estimates of the prevalence of elder abuse in the community range from 2 to 10 percent [

         In the United States and other countries, large numbers of persons are receiving long-term care services at nursing home or some form of assisted living where help with activities of daily living are given. Such persons tend to be older, have functional limitations, and heavy disease burdens [

         Nationwide collection of data on complaints of institutional elder mistreatment is limited. State Long-Term Care Ombudsman programs (LTCOP) are federally mandated to report data via the National Ombudsman Reporting System (NORS) [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29-31

         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. Additionally, underreporting by the facilities is suspected. Supporting this suspicion is the fact that most complaints to the state ombudsman programs are filed by facility residents, family, or friends rather than by facility personnel.

         Besides the risk to residents of abuse from staff, there is sometimes maltreatment from other residents. Poor staffing, negligence in the management of resident behaviors, or failing to exclude dangerous residents from the resident population may result in abuse from other residents.

         In a systemic review of 26 studies from the United States and other countries , the estimated frequency of resident-to-resident aggression in long-term care facilities was 12 to 23 percent.

         A prospective cohort study of community-dwelling adults age 65 and older, with nine years of follow-up, found that referral to Adult Protective Services (APS) for physical abuse, neglect, self-neglect, and financial exploitation was associated with shorter survival after adjusting for other factors associated with increased mortality [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35

         In another cohort study of older adults followed for a median of seven years, reported self-neglect increased the risk of mortality almost sixfold in the first year, and risk remained increased but at a lower rate after one year (hazard ratio [HR] 5.82 and 1.39 respectively) [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36

         Financial exploitation is emerging as a risk factor for death.

         Elder abuse can have a severe impact on the vulnerable older adult who has poor social, financial, and functional reserves. Elder abuse is associated with multiple hospitalizations, medical nonadherence, pressure ulcers, untreated psychiatric and medical illness, and falls. An incident of financial exploitation may cause the older adult victim to lose independence and lose needed support, and these losses may result in morbidity and perhaps death [

         Several risk factors have been identified, but the strength of evidence varies.

Social embeddedness/social support lowered the risk of elder abuse. However, a shared living arrangement is a risk factor for physical and financial abuse [

         Our approach to surveillance and evaluation is to determine, with an awareness of risk factors and warning signs, if the patient's needs are being met, if the patient has an impaired capacity for self-care and protection, if the patient is neglecting themselves, and/or if someone who is expected to help the patient is abusing, neglecting, or exploiting them.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the patient has injuries, we look to the social and medical history, the physical exam, any laboratory studies, and known risk factors and warning signs of abuse or neglect to determine if the offered explanation for the injury is consistent with the injury observed [

         A comprehensive history and can be done, with attention to functional and cognitive ability, particularly since deficits in these areas have been associated with a risk of self-neglect [
         <a href="#rid63">
          63

        </p>
        <p>
         This evaluation may substantiate the presence of elder abuse or self-neglect. A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is a model for such an evaluation and has been studied for outcomes in identifying elder abuse as well as self-neglect [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,39,64,65
         </a>
         ]. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Observation is often more reliable than questioning the patient, although both questioning and observation are needed. Observation of the conditions the patient is living in are valuable to help understand the patient's functional abilities and needs. Asking about abuse will often need to be done when the patient is apart from their caretaker.

         – Falls are common in older adults. While vertebral fractures are common and can be spontaneous, hip fractures and other osteoporotic fractures may indicate accidents or self-neglect. Spiral fractures of long bones and fractures in sites other than the wrist, hip, or vertebrae in a non-alcoholic older adult may be suspicious for physical abuse [

          Malnutrition
         </strong>
         – Malnutrition may indicate neglect (including self-neglect), if the community-dwelling older adult is unable to procure their own meals or if staff do not take time to feed nursing home patients who cannot feed themselves. Malnutrition in an older adult may also be a manifestation of financial exploitation if the older adult is left without resources to purchase food [

          39

          Dehydration

         – Pressure ulcers do not necessarily indicate neglect but may occur more readily if the standard of care for prevention is not adhered to in a patient at risk. Intentional or negligent failure to follow the standard of care is elder abuse [

         Financial exploitation is suggested by a change in the ability of an older adult to pay for medical services, medications, utilities, housing, or food [
         <a href="#rid70">
          70
         </a>
         ]. Another sign is transfer of property by an older adult who lacks the capacity to consent to such a transfer. Five domains of financial exploitation have been identified: stolen money or property, coercion to surrender money or property, impersonation to obtain money or property, inadequate household contribution, and lack of family financial contribution to destitute older relative [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Age-associated financial vulnerability may affect many older adults, even those who are cognitively intact, and relates to social isolation and aggressive profit-seeking enterprises marketing to those with a disparate portion of wealth [
         <a href="#rid72">
          72
         </a>
         ]. If the older adult is exploited by a person in a trust relationship with that older adult, it is a form of elder abuse as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It the older adult is exploited by a stranger, it is most likely a crime, but it may not be considered elder abuse as defined in this chapter.

         The first obligation of the health care worker, social worker, community agency, or member of the public, is to assure the safety of the at-risk older adult. If the older adult is in immediate danger of harm, a report to the police may be the first intervention to make.
        </p>
        <p>
         A 2016 systematic review of interventions for preventing elder abuse found that there was no trustworthy evidence to assess the effects of elder abuse interventions on the occurrence or recurrence of elder abuse [
         <a href="#rid83">

        <p>
         An approach to identifying the presence of elder mistreatment and inappropriate interventions is the Abuse Intervention Model (AIM), which identifies factors making older adults vulnerable and at risk for abuse or neglect and identifies potential interventions [
         <a href="#rid84">
          84
         </a>
         ]. Risk factors for elder mistreatment are identified in the individual case for the suspected victim, the trusted other, and the context of their interaction, such as the quality of the relationship or social isolation. This analysis leads to interventions that may benefit the victim, such as reduction of isolation.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a small study using volunteer medical students, the students made unstructured social phone calls to victims of elder abuse or neglect, as validated by Adult Protective Services. Victims participating in the study reported reduced feelings of depression and loneliness, while the medical students reported enhanced appreciation for the social needs of older adults [

         If a health care worker has reason to believe that an older adult is in a state of elder abuse or self-neglect, appropriate medical interventions should be offered and reporting should be promptly initiated. Adult Protective Services (APS) and Long-Term Care Ombudsman programs (LTCOP) exist in all United States jurisdictions. If there is doubt about where and how to report, one of these agencies or law enforcement can provide the needed information regarding how to report suspected elder abuse or self-neglect.

         Reporting of elder abuse or self-neglect is said to be an effective and important intervention in the management of elder mistreatment [

         Reporting suspected elder abuse or self-neglect gives government agencies an opportunity to investigate the situation with home visits, financial record reviews, discussions with community contacts of the older adult, and other measures that a clinician does not usually have access or time to review.

         When elder abuse and self-neglect is identified, older adults at risk for poor health consequences are identified, giving APS, law enforcement, and sometimes the courts the opportunity to intervene to protect the victims. (See

         Investigations by APS workers in 58 California counties over a period from January to December of 2013 showed that of the total cases completed by APS (77,812), 34 percent confirmed the allegations of elder abuse or self-neglect, 16 percent found the allegations to be unfounded, and 50 percent found the allegations were inconclusive [

         Referral of identified victims of financial exploitation to multidisciplinary teams that include APS, clinicians, law enforcement, and prosecutors has increased the prosecution of financial abuse cases [
         <a href="#rid89">
          89
         </a>
         ]. Similar multidisciplinary teams exist in different states to which APS may present cases of elder abuse. Reporting to APS may also result in a court's finding of incapacity to live independently and result in a needed guardianship for supervision [

         According to the Stetson Center for Excellence in Elder Law, there are statutes for mandatory reporting for elder mistreatment in every state but not in every territory [
         <a href="#rid92">
          92
         </a>
         ]. Some jurisdictions require reporting by anyone who suspects elder abuse or self-neglect, while most jurisdictions only require reporting by members of certain named occupations, including by health care workers [
         <a href="#rid93">
          93
         </a>
         ]. There are penalties for failure of clinicians to report suspected abuse exist in most states and in the District of Columbia [
         <a href="#rid93">
          93
         </a>
         ]. Mandatory reporting requires a clinician to report suspected abuse, even if a competent older adult patient specifically asks that the abuse not be reported [
         <a href="#rid94">
          94
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The statutes in almost all of the US states specifically provide for immunity from any civil or criminal liability for reporting and testifying about suspected elder abuse, neglect, self-neglect, or exploitation, so long as the communications are made in good faith [
         <a href="#rid95">

         If reporting is motivated by the reporter's reasonable suspicion, governmental resources will assist with investigation, assessment, and case confirmation. Reporting also helps mobilize resources and interventions from the APS agency, such as reactivation of utilities, medications, safety repairs of the home, and personal care services.

         Careful and immediate documentation should be made of observations that support a finding of elder abuse. What the victim or the alleged perpetrator says should be dutifully recorded.
        </p>
        <p>
         Conclusions and general statements do not make good evidence for governmental agencies, law enforcement, or the courts. Specific details of observations are helpful. For physical evidence of abuse, photographs may be the best evidence. The reporter should carefully record size, color, and induration of lesions, preferably with an accompanying drawing when photographs are not possible. Instead of documenting that the alleged perpetrator "confessed" to the abuse, it is best to record carefully the exact words of the perpetrator.

         Once a report has been filed, the allegation or suspicion will be directed to a designated resource, either the APS agencies for community-dwelling older adults, or the state LTCOP (or agency that licenses the facility) for residents of long-term care institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
         At times, immediate reporting to law enforcement is indicated. If an observer is concerned that abuse or exploitation is ongoing and requires interruption to prevent further harm, law enforcement, as well as the state protective agencies, must be notified urgently.
        </p>
        <p>
         As mentioned above, the role of the clinician is to report the suspected elder abuse or self-neglect. From this point, medical, social, and legal interventions may be offered when an older adult is determined to be the victim of elder abuse or self-neglect. Older adults who are deemed to have the capacity to understand and consent to protective services may reject offered interventions from an APS agency. If the agency determines that the victim lacks the capacity to understand and consent to protective services and that a situation is unsafe, the agency may petition the courts for an emergency order for protective services. Most of the US states and territories have statutes providing for these emergency or involuntary protective services for those without capacity to consent [
         <a href="#rid96">
          96
         </a>
         ]. The court may require a statement from a clinician to support a finding of the lack of capacity to consent to protective services before such an emergency order is issued.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinicians who are able and willing to assess the ability of APS clients to make decisions regarding the acceptance or refusal of protective services, or their ability to live independently without supervision, are limited, especially in rural areas. One statewide program uses telecommunication to provide these assessments for APS clients in order to extend this service to underserved areas [
         <a href="#rid90">
          90
         </a>
         ]. The process used by this program for the remote and in-person evaluation of capacity for self-care and self-protection of the clients of APS has been published [

          91
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The APS agencies and the courts are obliged to use the least restrictive alternative when an individual's autonomy is impacted in order to protect that person. The government must explore all options and choose those that accomplish the needed protection while being no more restrictive than necessary. For example, if durable powers of attorney are in place and the designated power of attorney can effect needed decisions, guardianship should not be pursued [
         <a href="#rid97">

         Ultimately, the court must determine whether the older adult has sufficient capacity to self-care and self-protect to avoid danger, and whether alternative measures to the appointment of a guardian are available. The presence of such problems as disorganized thinking, hallucinations, delusions, lack of insight, and refusal to accept help are important in the determination of need for guardianship.
        </p>
        <p>
         The capacity for self-care and self-protection depends on whether an individual can both make and implement decisions regarding personal needs, health, and safety [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13

         ]. This requires both intact decisional and executive capacity in relation to multiple functional domains: personal needs and hygiene, condition of home environment, activities for independent living, medical self-care, and managing financial affairs. Assessment of decision-making capacity is discussed in detail separately. (See

         Decisional capacity and executive capacity can be evaluated during the history and physical examination, with further input from geriatric assessment tools; information from APS agencies, family, police agencies; or evaluation of the home environment by members of a geriatric assessment team. Neuropsychological testing may be useful in cases where the capacity of the older adult for self-care and self-protection remains in question.

         The capacities to consent to sexual activity, to make a will, to vote, to drive, to transfer property, to consent to participation in research, and to consent to treatment are capacities of importance to older adults that a clinician may be asked to specifically assess. Some of these more specific capacities, especially the capacities to transfer property, consent to sexual activity, and consent to treatment, may be needed to possess the more global capacity for self-care and self-protection.

          45

         ]. Outcomes were variable for multiple interventions that involved courses for professionals to heighten awareness of elder abuse or legal, psychological, and educational support programs for older individuals and their caregivers. A subsequent systematic review in 2016 also reported inadequate evidence to assess the effects of interventions to reduce the occurrence or recurrence of abuse [

         Prevention of abuse may be promoted by programs that provide respite for caregivers, support for informal (nonprofessional) caregivers, and encourage positive attitudes towards older people within a culture. The authors of this topic propose several approaches to target different groups and employ a variety of strategies that can play a role in the prevention of elder abuse.

         Recognition that clinicians from any discipline who have contact with older adults, not just geriatricians or those working in elder care institutions, are in a position to make an important impact. Education regarding the risk factors and warning signs of elder mistreatment and the appropriate interventions (especially reporting to the appropriate governmental agencies) when elder mistreatment is suspected should involve all clinicians.

         Education to address and overcome the barriers to reporting suspected elder mistreatment. These barriers include failure to recognize the ethical and often legal obligation to report, not knowing which agencies to report to, not realizing that only a reasonable suspicion of mistreatment is sufficient to trigger the duty to report, not understanding that there is protection from legal liability for the reporter who does so in good faith, not realizing that the report can be made confidentially, and thinking that the reporter needs the permission of the suspected victim of elder mistreatment in order to report [

         Education targeting clinicians as well as nonclinical personnel who have contact with older adults, including individuals in the banking industry, mail carriers, salespersons, emergency medical services workers, police officers, and long-term care facility employees. The educational efforts for non-medical personnel can be very similar to those used with clinicians. There should be a focus on risk factors, warning signs, the agencies to report suspicions to, and, as with clinicians, education designed to remove some of the barriers to reporting caused by ignorance.

         Education and administrative interventions to address conditions in institutions that may promote resident elder mistreatment by staff members. Factors that increase the likelihood that a staff member may mistreat a resident include excessive work pressure, having negative attitudes toward older adults, having negative attitudes toward their jobs, limited training, a history of drug or alcohol dependence, a staff member with a criminal record, a facility culture that tolerates placing staff and facility convenience before patient needs, and a low staff-to-resident ratio [

         <strong>
          Definition
         </strong>
         – Elder abuse refers to actions or failures to act, perpetrated by those with an ongoing relationship involving an expectation of responsibility toward the victim. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Definitions'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Resources
         </strong>
         – Community-dwelling older adults may be offered resources and protection in the United States by state Adult Protective Services (APS) agencies. This offer of help extends to elders found to be in a state of elder abuse or self-neglect regardless of whether the older adult is vulnerable or cognitively impaired. APS does attempt to facilitate the accomplishment of essential needs for the health and welfare of the victim. Long-Term Care Ombudsman programs (LTCOP) or licensing agencies for the institution address issues in institutional settings. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Regulatory and support services (United States)'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Risk factors and warning signs
         </strong>
         – The presence of risk factors and warning signs should prompt a clinician to evaluate a patient for elder mistreatment  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67380" href="/z/d/graphic/67380.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         <strong>
          Approach
         </strong>
         – A comprehensive history and physical with attention to the functional and cognitive assessment, considering risk factors and warning signs of elder abuse and self-neglect, should then take place. Patients may need to be interviewed by themselves to avoid intimidation by possible abusers. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Our approach to evaluation for elder abuse and self-neglect'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Interventions
         </strong>
         – The first obligation of the health care worker, in conjunction with social workers and community agencies, is to optimize the safety of the at-risk older adult. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Interventions'

         </span>
         <strong>
          Reporting and documentation
         </strong>
         – If a health care worker has reason to believe that an older adult is the victim of elder abuse or self-neglect, appropriate reporting should be promptly initiated. Careful and immediate documentation should be made of observations that support a finding of elder abuse. The APS agencies and the courts are obliged to use the least-restrictive alternative when an individual's autonomy is impacted in order to protect that person. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Reporting'

         <strong>
          Guardianship
         </strong>
         – Clinicians may be asked to make determinations of capacity in cases where the older adults have diminished capacity for self-care and protection. (See
