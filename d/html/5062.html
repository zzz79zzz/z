These include small for gestational age (SGA) and fetal (intrauterine) growth restriction (FGR). Although many SGA infants have FGR and many FGR infants are SGA, the two terms are not synonymous.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H625978636"><span class="h2">Fetal growth restriction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Fetal or intrauterine growth restriction (FGR/IUGR) refers to the fetus who does not achieve the expected in utero growth potential due to genetic or environmental factors  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef99966" href="/d/graphic/99966.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). It is defined as an estimated fetal weight &lt;10<sup>th</sup> percentile (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6752.html" rel="external">"Fetal growth restriction: Screening and diagnosis"</a>). Clinically, most infants with FGR are identified because they are born SGA with a BW below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile for gestational age  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75060" href="/d/graphic/75060.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef121969" href="/d/graphic/121969.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Moderate FGR is defined as BW in the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> percentile, and severe FGR as &lt;3<sup>rd</sup> percentile. </p><p>However, there are concerns that the above definition may not accurately reflect all infants who were affected by fetal growth restriction. As a result, a definition based on a survey of expert opinion was published that defines growth restriction in the newborn as one of the following [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, it remains to be seen whether this definition will replace the previous definitions. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>BW &lt;3<sup>rd</sup> percentile</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><strong>or</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Three of the following criteria are met:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>BW &lt;10<sup>th</sup> percentile</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Head circumference &lt;10<sup>th</sup> percentile</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Length &lt;10<sup>th</sup> percentile</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Prenatal diagnosis of fetal growth restriction (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6752.html" rel="external">"Fetal growth restriction: Screening and diagnosis"</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Prenatal history of conditions associated with fetal growth restriction (eg, maternal hypertension, preeclampsia, congenital infection)</p><p></p><p>Infants with FGR can be divided into:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symmetric FGR</strong> – Infants with symmetric FGR (20 to 30 percent of FGR cases) have reductions in all organ systems with the body, head, and length proportionally affected. Symmetric FGR begins early in gestation and usually is caused by intrinsic factors such as congenital infections or chromosomal abnormalities. However, decreased nutrient supply early in development can restrict growth of all organs [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Asymmetric FGR</strong> – Infants with asymmetric FGR (70 to 80 percent of FGR cases) have disproportionate growth restriction in which head circumference is preserved, length is somewhat affected, and weight is compromised to a greater degree. As a result, the normal-sized head appears relatively large compared with the size of the trunk and extremities  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78143" href="/d/graphic/78143.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). Abnormal growth typically begins in the late second or third trimesters and results from reductions in fetal nutrients that limit glycogen and fat storage, yet allow continued brain growth [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h3">Ponderal index</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As noted above, weight parameters at birth are not sensitive measures to detect FGR. The ponderal index (PI) is a useful tool to detect FGR, particularly in infants with asymmetric FGR [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>PI is a ratio of body weight to length expressed as [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]:</p><p>  PI = [weight (in g) x 100] ÷ [length (in cm)]<sup>3</sup></p><p>With normal growth, the PI increases gradually from 30 to 37 weeks gestation and then remains constant. Decreased growth of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, the major contributors to body weight, results in a reduced PI. PI of less than the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile reflects fetal malnutrition; PI of less than the 3<sup>rd</sup> percentile indicates severe wasting [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Other measures of body proportion ratios (eg, head circumference to weight, length, or abdominal circumference; or femur length to abdominal circumference) have also been used to detect FGR. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6752.html" rel="external">"Fetal growth restriction: Screening and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H584200489"><span class="h2">Small for gestational age</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Small for gestational age (SGA) is typically defined by BW below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile for gestational age (GA)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75060" href="/d/graphic/75060.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef121969" href="/d/graphic/121969.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. However, this definition does not make a distinction among SGA infants who are constitutionally normally small from those who are growth-restricted and small. Constitutionally small infants are those with a normal BW below 10<sup>th</sup> percentile due to constitutional factors including maternal height, weight, ethnicity, and parity. These infants are not at increased risk for perinatal mortality or morbidity [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. </p><p>An alternate definition defines SGA as BW and/or length for GA that is &gt;2 standard deviations (SD) below the mean (ie, &lt;2.3 percentile) [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5833.html" rel="external">"Growth hormone treatment for children born small for gestational age", section on 'Definition'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1457601729"><span class="h2">FGR versus SGA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The substitution of SGA for FGR is imprecise. As noted above, using the SGA criteria does not distinguish the constitutionally small fetus that achieves its normal growth potential from similarly small infants with intrauterine growth restriction whose BW is lower than the expected optimal BW. In addition, using SGA as the marker for FGR will miss infants with FGR who have BWs that are greater than the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile. As a result, customized fetal growth curves based on constitutional factors have been developed to help differentiate between SGA infants who are normally small from those with FGR. The use of these curves and the ongoing challenge of distinguishing between these two groups are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6752.html" rel="external">"Fetal growth restriction: Screening and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The incidence of fetal growth restriction (FGR) varies among populations and increases with decreasing gestational age. In addition, it is challenging to interpret the literature as some studies use the term small for gestational age (SGA), which may include both infants who are FGR as well as those who are constitutionally normally small. Also, the reference birth weight and intrauterine growth charts will influence the classification and incidence of IUGR [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, it appears that FGR is more prevalent in resource-limited countries. Approximately 10 percent of term infants in developed countries are SGA, compared with 20 percent of term infants in resource-limited countries [<a href="#rid2">2,9,10</a>]. In 2012, data from the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group (CHERG) based on 14 birth cohorts and using International Fetal and Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century (INTERGROWTH-21<sup>st</sup>) birth weight (BW) standard  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef96940" href="/d/graphic/96940.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) showed that SGA was observed in 19.3 percent of live births in low and middle income countries [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In this report, 22 percent of neonatal deaths occurred in infants born SGA.</p><p>For preterm infants, the incidence varies depending upon whether data collection is based on BW and/or gestational age. In the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network database, 22 percent of 4438 infants with BW 500 to 1500 g were classified as SGA [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. In a larger series of 20,000 very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (BW below 1500 g) in which the gestational age was restricted to 25 to 30 weeks, the incidence of SGA was only 9 percent [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6768.html" rel="external">"Fetal growth restriction: Evaluation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In FGR, the nutrient supply to the fetus is compromised. The fetus, in order to increase its chance of survival, responds by reducing its overall size, preserving brain growth, accelerating lung maturation, and increasing red blood cell production [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The fetus redirects blood flow from less vital organs to the brain, heart, adrenal glands, and placenta. Total body fat, lean mass, and bone mineral content are reduced, resulting in a wasted appearance in infants with severe FGR  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53832" href="/d/graphic/53832.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Nitrogen and protein content are lower because of reduced muscle mass [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Glycogen content is decreased in skeletal muscle and liver because of lower fetal plasma glucose and insulin concentrations [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Fetal growth restriction (FGR) may be caused by fetal, placental, and maternal factors  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef99966" href="/d/graphic/99966.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). However, no underlying etiology is identified in at least 40 percent of infants with FGR. In those infants where an underlying cause is identified, FGR is caused by genetic disease in approximately one-third of infants, and is related to the fetal environment in two-thirds [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H625979020"><span class="h2">Antenatal detection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The antenatal detection of fetal growth restriction (FGR) has increased with a greater emphasis by obstetricians on identifying fetuses with poor intrauterine growth. However, antenatal diagnosis based on sonographic evaluation of the fetus, placenta, and amniotic fluid remains challenging and is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6752.html" rel="external">"Fetal growth restriction: Screening and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H625979014"><span class="h2">Neonatal findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Classically, newborn infants with FGR appeared thin with loose, peeling skin, and decreased skeletal muscle mass and subcutaneous fat tissue. However, this presentation is less common, in part due to increased antenatal surveillance and the avoidance of postterm gestation (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4972.html" rel="external">"Postterm infant"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4972.html" rel="external">"Postterm infant", section on 'Fetal growth restriction'</a>). Nevertheless, this classic presentation may still be seen when growth restriction persists despite antenatal intervention. The face of severely affected infants has a typical shrunken or "wizened" appearance  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53832" href="/d/graphic/53832.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>), and the umbilical cord often is thin [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Cranial sutures may be widened, and the anterior fontanelle is larger than expected due to diminished membranous bone formation. Meconium staining may be present  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78143" href="/d/graphic/78143.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). In newborns with asymmetric FGR, the head appears relatively large compared with the size of the trunk and extremities  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78143" href="/d/graphic/78143.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). These infants usually have a low ponderal index (PI). (See <a class="local">'Ponderal index'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H625978918"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H758264420"><span class="h2">Antenatal diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most infants are diagnosed antenatally by sonographic evaluation. The antenatal diagnosis is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6752.html" rel="external">"Fetal growth restriction: Screening and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H434866043"><span class="h2">Postnatal diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The postnatal diagnosis of fetal growth restriction (FGR) is most commonly made when the birth weight (BW) is below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile for gestational age (ie, the definition of small for gestational age [SGA]). As noted above, there are pitfalls in this approach as it does not distinguish SGA infants who are constitutionally normally small from those with FGR, and it fails to identify infants with FGR who have BWs above the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile but who still had abnormally poor in utero growth. In addition, it is important to accurately determine the gestational age (GA) of the infant, which can be challenging in the setting of FGR. </p><p>Further support for the diagnosis of FGR is made by identifying other clinical features suggestive of poor intrauterine growth. These include a significant discrepancy between the actual weight and the expected optimal weight based on maternal stature, ethnicity, and parity; physical findings of malnourishment (eg, decreased skeletal muscle mass and subcutaneous fat tissue, and excessive skin desquamation); or evidence of asymmetric growth with a low ponderal index (PI). (See <a class="local">'Neonatal findings'</a> above and <a class="local">'Ponderal index'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1583881693"><span class="h3">Gestational age assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most reliable method of determining GA is the knowing with certainty the last menstrual period or date of in-vitro fertilization and measurements from antenatal ultrasound performed before 22 weeks gestation (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5391.html" rel="external">"Prenatal assessment of gestational age, date of delivery, and fetal weight"</a>). In clinical settings in which accurate menstrual dating and results from early antenatal ultrasounds are not available, GA is determined postnatally based on neonatal physical examination and neuromuscular assessment. However, many of the physical criteria used to assess GA are altered in infants with FGR [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. As an example, infants with FGR have increased desquamation and enhanced wrinkling (and more mature appearance) of the soles of the feet. However, in FGR infants without an underlying disorder that affects the nervous system the neurologic assessment remains consistent with the GA. In addition, the disappearance of the anterior vascular capsule of the lens, which occurs in an orderly sequence between 27 and 34 weeks gestation, is not altered by FGR. As a result, examination with a direct ophthalmoscope after dilation of the pupil can be used to accurately estimate GA, if necessary. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5061.html" rel="external">"Postnatal assessment of gestational age"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H625979087"><span class="h2">Differential diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The main consideration in the differential diagnosis of FGR is constitutional small size (or constitutional SGA). As noted above, patients who are normally constitutionally small have a BW that is consistent with the expected optimal BW, and there are no physical findings of in utero malnourishment. Normally constitutionally small infants are not at increased risk for morbidity and mortality. It remains challenging to determine whether a neonate is constitutionally small, but this diagnosis is more likely when one or both parents are also small.

However, with early fetal detection of FGR and close follow-up of fetal wellbeing, severe cases have become more uncommon, and the appearance of FGR could be modified and the clinician may not see the typical somatic signs of severe FGR. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – The diagnosis of FGR is most commonly made when the birth weight (BW) is below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile for gestational age (ie, the definition of small for gestational age [SGA])  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75060" href="/d/graphic/75060.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef121969" href="/d/graphic/121969.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). However, there are pitfalls in this approach as it does not distinguish SGA infants who are constitutionally normally small (who are not at increased risk for perinatal mortality or morbidity) from those with FGR, and it fails to identify infants with FGR who have BW that is above the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile. As a result, it is important for the clinician to confirm the diagnosis of FGR by identifying other clinical features suggestive of poor intrauterine growth. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complications</strong> – Neonatal complications associated with FGR include prematurity, perinatal asphyxia, poor thermoregulation, hypoglycemia, polycythemia resulting in hyperviscosity, and impaired immune function.

For severely affected cases, the pediatric delivery team should be prepared to manage any infant with perinatal depression, meconium aspiration, hypoglycemia, myocardial dysfunction, and hypoxia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>All infants with FGR should be immediately dried and placed under a radiant heat warmer to prevent hypothermia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Depending on the clinical status, the infant can be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit if the patient requires more extensive care or monitoring than the routine care provided in the normal nursery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Nursery</strong> – For infants with FGR admitted to the normal nursery, routine care includes:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Blood glucose monitoring initiated within one to two hours after birth. Surveillance is continued in infants with low plasma glucose concentrations (less than 40 mg/dL, 2.2 mmol/L) until feedings are well established and glucose values have normalized. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5053.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis, screening, and diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Measurement of ionized calcium level for infants who are preterm or who experienced birth asphyxia starting at 12 hours after birth. These infants are at risk for hypocalcemia, and ionized calcium levels should be monitored. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5060.html" rel="external">"Neonatal hypocalcemia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Measurement of a hematocrit or hemoglobin level in any infant with symptoms suggestive of polycythemia (cyanosis, tachypnea, poor feeding, and vomiting). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5940.html" rel="external">"Neonatal polycythemia", section on 'Who to test'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Enteral feeding should be started early at volumes appropriate for the infant's weight. Mother's breast milk is preferred over formula because of its additional short-term and long-term benefits. (See <a class="local">'Nursery management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Further evaluation</strong> – Once the infant is stabilized, further evaluation to determine the cause of FGR should be performed for infants in whom the underlying etiology remains unknown  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef99966" href="/d/graphic/99966.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). However, in the majority of cases, no underlying cause is identified. (See <a class="local">'Further evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Outcome</strong> – Infants with FGR are at risk for perinatal mortality and significant long-term morbidity including growth abnormalities and impaired neurodevelopmental outcome. However, there is significant heterogeneity in long-term outcome.
