Multiple studies in the United States, including a nationally representative surveys [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>] and retrospective studies of an administrative claims database [<a href="#rid2">2</a>] and medical records [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], indicate that roughly 40 percent of children and adolescents with depressive disorders are not treated.</p><p>Among children and adolescents with depression who receive standard treatment, psychotherapy alone is used most often [<a href="#rid2">2,5</a>]. The second most frequently used treatment is medication monotherapy and the least used is psychotherapy plus an antidepressant.</p><p>This topic provides an overview of treating pediatric depression. Pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for juvenile depression, as well as the assessment, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of depression, are discussed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88735.html" rel="external">"Pediatric unipolar depression and pharmacotherapy: General principles"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1227.html" rel="external">"Pediatric unipolar depression and pharmacotherapy: Choosing a medication"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1228.html" rel="external">"Pediatric unipolar depression: Psychotherapy"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1224.html" rel="external">"Pediatric unipolar depression: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">DEFINITION OF UNIPOLAR MAJOR DEPRESSION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Unipolar major depression (major depressive disorder) is diagnosed in patients who have suffered at least one major depressive episode  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994" href="/d/graphic/89994.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and have no history of mania  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91106" href="/d/graphic/91106.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) or hypomania  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91107" href="/d/graphic/91107.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. A major depressive episode is a period lasting at least two weeks, with five or more of the following symptoms: depressed mood, anhedonia, insomnia or hypersomnia, change in appetite or weight, psychomotor retardation or agitation, low energy, poor concentration, thoughts of worthlessness or guilt, and recurrent thoughts about death or suicide. In addition, the symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning, and the syndrome is not due to the physiologic effects of a substance (eg, drug abuse or medications) or another medical condition (eg, hypothyroidism). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1224.html" rel="external">"Pediatric unipolar depression: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis", section on 'Unipolar major depression'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1491901613"><span class="h2">Severity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The severity (intensity) of unipolar major depression is often classified as either mild to moderate or severe.</p><p>Mild to moderate major depression is characterized by clinical features such as:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>No suicidal or homicidal ideation or behavior, or ideation that does not pose an imminent risk (eg, thoughts that family members would be better off if the patient was dead; or fleeting thoughts of killing oneself, with nonexistent or vague plans to commit suicide and no intent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>No psychotic features (eg, delusions or hallucinations).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Little to no aggressiveness.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intact judgement such that the patient or others are not at imminent risk of being harmed.</p><p></p><p>Mild to moderate major depression is indicated by a score &lt;20 points on the self-report Patient Health Questionnaire – Nine Item (PHQ-9)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef104030" href="/d/graphic/104030.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. Patients with mild to moderate depression can generally be treated in an outpatient or partial (day) hospital program setting.</p><p>Severe unipolar major depression is characterized by seven to nine depressive symptoms that occur nearly every day, as indicated by a score ≥20 points on the PHQ-9. Severely ill patients often report suicidal ideation and behavior, typically demonstrate obvious impairment of functioning, are more likely to develop complications such as psychotic features, and are typically referred to a psychiatrist for management and inpatient hospitalization.</p><p>In addition, the PHQ-9 classifies patients as moderately severe if their score is 15 to 19. Patients with moderately severe major depression require urgent attention and often require treatment in either a partial hospital program or on an inpatient unit.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H590049968"><span class="h1">PREVENTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Administering psychotherapy to children and adolescents in targeted populations can prevent onset of depressive disorders [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. However, the benefits are small and do not appear to last beyond one year.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2918886563"><span class="h2">Targeted (selected) populations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Targeted treatment with psychotherapy to prevent either new or recurrent onset of depressive syndromes includes children and adolescents who are at high risk for the disorder by virtue of factors that include subsyndromal depressive symptoms, death of a parent, family conflict, or family history of depression [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. We generally do not administer psychotherapy to prevent depressive disorders in at-risk youth, unless the individual has suicidal ideation or behavior, a comorbid psychiatric disorder, functional impairment, has previously had a depressive syndrome, or requests treatment. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to provide psychotherapy even in the absence of these five exceptions, or to monitor at-risk youth regularly (eg, once per month). (See <a class="local">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Evidence regarding the use of psychotherapy to prevent depressive disorders includes a systematic review that performed a meta-analysis of 22 randomized trials, which compared psychotherapy with control conditions in children and adolescents (n &gt;3900) who did not meet criteria for a depression diagnosis [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. The youth were at risk for developing depressive syndromes due to the presence of subthreshold, mild to moderate depressive symptoms. Active treatment consisted of cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy, and control conditions consisted of usual care or no treatment. Most of the trials were conducted in school settings and delivered either group or individual therapy, usually on a weekly basis for 8 to 12 sessions. Diagnosis of a depressive disorder for up to 12 months after randomization was less likely with psychotherapy than control conditions; however, the clinical effect was small and did not persist beyond one year, and none of the trials controlled for psychotherapy’s nonspecific effects, such as attention.</p><p>In addition, the systematic review performed a second meta-analysis, which aggregated four trials (n &gt;400 at-risk youth) that were not included in the first meta-analysis, and compared psychotherapy with control conditions consisting of an attention placebo (eg, psychoeducation about general mental and/or physical health) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Self-reported depressive symptoms post intervention were comparable for the two groups.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H511882337"><span class="h2">Universal (unselected) populations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We do not suggest universal prevention for depressive disorders in children and adolescents. Universal prevention involves administering psychotherapy to the population regardless of risk for the disorder, and is not effective. In a meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials that compared either cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy with control conditions in children and adolescents (n &gt;2000), the incidence of depressive disorders was comparable for the two groups [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H86780457"><span class="h1">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF TREATING YOUTH WITH MAJOR DEPRESSION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H86780505"><span class="h2">Patient safety and treatment setting</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The first step in acute phase treatment addresses potential safety concerns. Every depressed child and adolescent must be evaluated for suicide risk and if risk is identified, safety must be assured by choosing the right setting. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1230.html" rel="external">"Suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents: Evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p>Treatment of pediatric depression may occur in a variety of settings: outpatient, partial hospital, inpatient, or residential [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Treatment should be provided in the least restrictive setting that is safe and effective for a given patient. The setting depends upon the severity of illness (including safety status), level of parental support, and motivation for treatment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H86780511"><span class="h2">Treatment plan</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment planning should be collaborative with patients and their families [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]; successful treatment typically requires parental involvement and cooperation [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Clinicians (eg, pediatricians, psychiatrists, or psychologists) who are treating youth with major depression and are formulating a treatment plan should engage the parents to weigh the risks and benefits of the various interventions (eg, psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy) in deciding upon a treatment regimen. Involving the school may also help, depending upon the severity of symptoms and impairment in the school setting.</p><p>The plan specifies the choice of therapy and frequency of sessions based upon the severity of depressive symptoms, the age and developmental status of the patient, the degree of current exposure to negative life events, and comorbidity (eg, anxiety and substance use disorders) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Many guidelines suggest a minimum of eight weeks of treatment for an acute episode of major depression [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Multiple sessions per week may be needed during the acute treatment phase. In addition, the plan should include interventions directed at problems in the patient’s environment.</p><p>The plan also addresses the use of medication. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88735.html" rel="external">"Pediatric unipolar depression and pharmacotherapy: General principles"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H86780747"><span class="h2">Education and resources</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An important component of treating depression in youths is education of patients and family members about the signs and symptoms of depression, treatment options and their benefits and risks, prognosis, and the ways in which the illness has affected their personal interactions [<a href="#rid10">10-17</a>]. With education, nonadherence with treatment may decrease, and patients and family members may view depression as an illness, which can reduce feelings of stigmatization and provide relief. Psychosocial difficulties may then be easier to address. Education may also help family members identify their own depressive symptoms and need for treatment [<a href="#rid10">10,13,14</a>].</p><p>Education addresses the:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Signs and symptoms of depression  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994" href="/d/graphic/89994.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), using language that is developmentally appropriate for the patient's level of understanding.

Patients are treated by a team that usually includes a primary care clinician, a case manager who provides support and outreach to patients, and a mental health specialist (eg, psychiatrist) who provides consultation and supervision. Other elements include a structured treatment plan that involves pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or both; scheduled follow-up visits; communication among the members of the treatment team; and measurement based care. Collaborative care is used for treating pediatric patients with mild to moderate episodes of unipolar major depression, as well as severe episodes and/or treatment-resistant episodes, and is used for patients managed by pediatricians or family medicine clinicians who lack experience with major depression. Instituting collaborative care to integrate the general medical and mental health of patients is endorsed by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Measurement based care is discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Multiple collaborative care programs, resources, and guidelines are available.

This guideline provides a toolkit that includes rating scales to aid in the assessment and diagnosis of pediatric depression, information on various treatment options, an algorithm/flowchart for management of depression, and educational materials.

Management is based upon the principle that clinicians initially treat the disorder (ie, the depressive disorder or the comorbid disorder) that causes the greatest distress or impairment. In addition, if a comorbid disorder (eg, substance use disorder or anorexia nervosa) reduces the likelihood of recovery from depression, then the comorbidity should be addressed first. Treating the comorbidity may improve the depressive symptoms (eg, initially treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may improve the depressive syndrome). Also, some comorbid disorders (eg, anxiety disorders) respond to the same treatments that are used for depression.</p><p>Comorbidity may indicate the need for referral to mental health clinicians.

However, response is not the same as remission; the threshold for response is relatively low, compared with remission. In addition, youth who achieve a symptomatic response may still suffer functional impairment.</p><p>Baseline predictors of nonresponse include severe (intense) depressive symptoms such as suicidal ideation with a plan and intent, suicidal or nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior, longer duration of illness, hopelessness, poorer functioning, comorbid psychiatric disorders (eg, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, or obsessive-compulsive disorder), younger age, history of abuse, disappointing life events, family psychopathology, and family conflicts [<a href="#rid70">70,80-87</a>].</p><p>The long-term prognosis may not be related to the specific acute-phase treatment that is administered. An observational study followed adolescents with unipolar major depression (n = 196) for up to five years after onset of acute, randomly assigned treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8465" href="/d/drug information/8465.html" rel="external">fluoxetine</a> alone, CBT alone, or fluoxetine plus CBT [<a href="#rid81">81</a>].

However, for patients who remit with pharmacotherapy alone, it can be useful to add psychotherapy to prevent relapses (see <a class="local">'Sequential treatment'</a> below).

Patients who had difficulty achieving remission, have a history of recurrent depression, or present with ongoing risk factors (eg, comorbidity, suicidality, stressors, or family history of depression) should receive continuation therapy for at least 12 months.

We suggest maintenance treatment for patients with risk factors associated with increased risk of recurrence, youth with recurrent episodes of major depression (eg, three or more episodes), as well as patients whose acute depressive episode preceding recovery was severe. Severity includes the intensity of symptoms, duration of the episode, and the occurrence of psychosis, suicidality, and functional impairment. Risk factors for recurrence are discussed separately.
