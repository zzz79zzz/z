Response to therapy is assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) after two cycles of chemotherapy (PET2). A full course of ABVD treatment is six cycles and, as such, the total duration of chemotherapy is 24 weeks. Adverse events include cytopenias, nausea/vomiting, neuropathy, bleomycin-associated pulmonary toxicity, and long-term cardiopulmonary complications. (See <a class="local">'ABVD chemotherapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Response adapted therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>BV+AVD adds <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16806" href="/d/drug information/16806.html" rel="external">brentuximab vedotin</a>, but eliminates <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9160" href="/d/drug information/9160.html" rel="external">bleomycin</a> from the ABVD backbone. BV+AVD is repeated every 14 days in 28-day cycles, two treatments are considered one cycle, and six cycles of chemotherapy require 24 weeks. Cytokine support is needed to lessen infectious complications. Acute adverse events include cytopenias, and peripheral neuropathy; long-term toxicities are less well defined. (See <a class="local">'BV+AVD'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>BEACOPP may have particular utility in younger patients with a high-risk disease (eg, international prognostic score [IPS] ≥4). BEACOPP is administered with growth factor support on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle for four to eight treatment cycles (a total 12 to 24 weeks of chemotherapy). Four or six cycles of escalated BEACOPP (eBEACOPP) is at least as effective and less toxic than eight cycles of eBEACOPP, which was shown to be superior to standard (baseline) BEACOPP or COPP/ABVD. When compared with ABVD, eBEACOPP has more toxicity, including bone marrow suppression, secondary malignancies, and sterility. Escalated BEACOPP should only be used for younger patients (&lt;60 years), because toxicities are particularly severe in older patients. It is unknown how eBEACOPP affects the ability to provide effective salvage therapy (eg, autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation) to patients who relapse. (See <a class="local">'BEACOPP chemotherapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Response adapted therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>For most patients with advanced stage cHL, we suggest treatment with ABVD, although eBEACOPP is a reasonable alternative, as discussed below. Compared with ABVD, eBEACOPP achieves superior progression-survival (PFS) at five years and may result in superior overall survival (OS), but this advantage may be lost over time due to second malignancies and cardiac toxicity, which account for the majority of late deaths [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The greatest potential benefit of eBEACOPP is seen with IPS ≥4. Details on the efficacy and toxicities associated with these regimens are presented in detail in the sections that follow.</p><p>The antibody-drug conjugate <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16806" href="/d/drug information/16806.html" rel="external">brentuximab vedotin</a> (BV; anti-CD30 antibody complexed with monomethyl auristatin E) was effective and well-tolerated when combined with AVD (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9391" href="/d/drug information/9391.html" rel="external">doxorubicin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10044" href="/d/drug information/10044.html" rel="external">vinblastine</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9316" href="/d/drug information/9316.html" rel="external">dacarbazine</a>) in a phase 1 study of initial treatment of advanced stage cHL [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. After more than five years of follow-up, treatment of 26 patients with BV+AVD achieved 92 percent failure-free survival and 100 percent overall survival [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. No unexpected toxicities were detected and the two patients who relapsed achieved a second remission. Importantly, addition of BV to ABVD caused excessive pulmonary toxicity that was not seen when BV was combined with AVD (ie, no <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9160" href="/d/drug information/9160.html" rel="external">bleomycin</a>). A phase III study is underway to test BV plus AVD versus ABVD. Additional details regarding BV are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4765.html" rel="external">"Treatment of relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma"</a>.)</p><p>Despite guidelines for the treatment of cHL, there must remain room for individualization of care to accommodate concerns about the risks of relapse versus toxicity. As an example, availability of effective salvage therapy for relapsed disease (eg, immunotherapy) may influence concerns regarding treatments associated with a higher risk of recurrence but less toxicity. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2614629280"><span class="h3">Response adapted therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mid-treatment positron emission tomography (PET) has prognostic value. Although modification of therapy based on PET after two cycles of chemotherapy (PET2) is often done in clinical practice, its use remains controversial. Initial studies suggest that treatment de-escalation may be safe in PET2 early responders; data regarding treatment escalation in patients without an early response are currently inconclusive. </p><p>PET-response adapted therapy will be discussed here. The prognostic value of mid-treatment PET is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4762.html" rel="external">"Monitoring of the patient with classic Hodgkin lymphoma during and after treatment", section on 'Radiologic studies'</a>.)</p><p>Use of mid-treatment PET-response adapted therapy must closely follow the methods used in trials that demonstrated its efficacy. It should take into account the method for PET interpretation, pre-treatment PET/computed tomography (CT) results, initial therapy, timing of the scan, and cutoff values. It is also important to consider the individual patient’s preferences, values, and risk factors. As an example, a decision to de-escalate ABVD to AVD (ie, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9160" href="/d/drug information/9160.html" rel="external">bleomycin</a> withdrawal) based on a negative PET2 scan may be especially attractive to a patient with additional risk factors for bleomycin toxicity (eg, older age, underlying pulmonary disease, active smokers), but less important for others. </p><p>There is a paucity of data regarding the preferred approach for patients with a positive PET2 scan (ie, Deauville score of 4 or 5). Outside of a clinical trial, many clinicians will continue ABVD therapy for a PET2 negative scan (ie, Deauville 1-3) or switch to eBEACOPP for patients with a positive PET2 scan. </p><p>Randomized studies that support treatment de-escalation based on PET2 early response include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A multicenter trial reported equivalent outcomes in 935 patients who were randomly assigned to de-escalation with four additional cycles of AVD versus four additional cycles of ABVD after achieving a negative PET2 scan following two cycles of ABVD for advanced stage cHL [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. This study, RATHL (Response-Adapted Therapy in Advanced Hodgkin Lymphoma), included patients with stages IIB to IV disease or stage IIA with adverse features (ie, bulky disease or at least three involved sites, who constituted 42 percent of participants). AVD and ABVD achieved equivalent three-year progression-free survival (PFS; 84 versus 86 percent, respectively) and overall survival (OS; 98 versus 97 percent). Omission of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9160" href="/d/drug information/9160.html" rel="external">bleomycin</a> lowered the incidence of fatigue and respiratory events and led to better preservation of pulmonary function. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>German Hodgkin Study Group HD18 reported equivalent five-year PFS with four cycles of escalated BEACOPP (eBEACOPP) versus either six or eight cycles of eBEACOPP in &gt;1000 patients with advanced stage cHL who achieved PET2 negativity after two cycles of eBEACOPP [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].

A possible exception to this is in patients with nodular sclerosis cHL who may have improved tumor control with RT [<a href="#rid60">60</a>]. (See <a class="local">'General'</a> above.)</p><p>While the optimal use of adjuvant radiation remains ill-defined as part of initial therapy in patients with advanced stage cHL, its use is further discussed below. The decision to incorporate adjuvant radiation into the treatment plan after ABVD must be individualized. Factors to be taken into account when making this decision include the patient's age, sex, history of prior radiation, and the size and location of the proposed radiation field. Given this information, we use the following approach to determining whether a patient should receive consolidation RT:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with advanced stage cHL and initial bulky mediastinal disease (&gt;10 cm or &gt;1/3 the chest diameter), we suggest the use of consolidation RT after ABVD rather than observation.

When compared with patients who received RT, patients who did not receive RT had similar rates of event-free survival (77 versus 73 percent) and overall survival (85 versus 78 percent) at eight years. Patients who received RT had a nonsignificant trend towards a higher rate of secondary cancer at eight years (13 versus 6 percent). However, there are several limitations to this trial: the chemotherapy regimen (MOPP/ABV hybrid) is no longer in use due to its excessive toxicity; most patients received eight cycles of chemotherapy and still the fraction of patients randomized in CR was only 65 percent, and, most patients with bulky disease were not randomized. It is also unexplained why the excess in leukemia cases that was reported only in CR patients who received low-dose radiation consolidation has not been observed in the larger group of partial responders who have all received radiation as well.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1140082178"><span class="h4">Partial response</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The use of RT in patients with a PR after ABVD is supported by the EORTC trial described above.

In this trial, response was determined using computed tomography (CT) criteria. It is likely that a percentage of patients who achieve a PR by CT criteria had fibrosis rather than residual cHL suggesting that some of these patients were potentially overtreated.

Although the radiation group included mostly patients with these unfavorable features, the addition of consolidation RT resulted in superior progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.40, 95% CI 0.23-0.69).

Additional support for this approach comes from the extrapolation of data from patients with early stage disease with bulky mediastinal disease, which suggests that the addition of RT to chemotherapy results in significantly higher disease-free survival rates and a trend towards improved overall survival.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed.

In this discussion, advanced stage cHL refers to clinical stage (CS) III and IV disease. CS III describes involvement of lymph nodes or lymphoid structures on both sides of the diaphragm. CS IV refers to diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or more extranodal organs or tissues, with or without lymph node disease.

Patients who attain a PET2 score of 1, 2, or 3 ("PET2-negative") may reasonably complete therapy with four additional cycles of AVD (without <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9160" href="/d/drug information/9160.html" rel="external">bleomycin</a>). The decision for an individual patient must take into account the risk of pulmonary toxicity with further bleomycin versus the potentially small increase in relapse with bleomycin omission. This approach is most attractive for those at high risk for bleomycin toxicity (eg, older age, underlying pulmonary disease, active smokers). Younger patients who wish to minimize their chance of relapse may choose to complete therapy with four more cycles of ABVD. (See <a class="local">'Response adapted therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The role of consolidation radiotherapy (RT) after chemotherapy induction for advanced stage cHL is controversial. RT appears to improve freedom from progression but not overall survival. Its use depends primarily upon the initial chemotherapy administered and the patient's response to that chemotherapy. (See <a class="local">'General'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The decision to proceed with adjuvant radiation after ABVD must be individualized.

The radiation dose is usually 30 to 36 Gy, and depends upon field size, initial disease volume, and response to chemotherapy.

If the biopsy demonstrates residual disease, additional therapy is administered as appropriate for relapsed/refractory disease. Alternatively, consolidation with RT or close observation with short interval follow-up may be chosen in select circumstances in which a biopsy may prove difficult or dangerous or when PET residual abnormality is of borderline significance.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H625749756"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Steven Horwitz, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Mauch PM, Kalish LA, Kadin M, et al.
