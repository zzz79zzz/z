Children with T-B-NK+ SCID present early in life with serious infections, failure to thrive, low-to-absent T and B cell numbers and function, and normal numbers of NK cells. Typical SCID, by definition, leads to early death from overwhelming infection in the first year or two of life in the absence of definitive treatment.</p><p>Autosomal recessive defects in several genes, all involved in V(D)J recombination that randomly combines <strong>v</strong>ariable, <strong>d</strong>iverse, and <strong>j</strong>oining gene segments in lymphocytes, result in this form of SCID. Some of the proteins encoded by these genes are also involved in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair. Defects in all ubiquitously expressed DNA repair genes are associated with radiation/alkylating agent chemotherapy sensitivity, and some of them are associated with growth and developmental abnormalities.</p><p>The management of T-B-NK+ SCID is reviewed here. The primary treatment is hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The pathogenesis, genetic defects, clinical manifestations including radiation sensitivity, and diagnosis are discussed in detail separately. An overview of SCID and the different forms of SCID are also presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3955.html" rel="external">"Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): An overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3912.html" rel="external">"Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): Specific defects"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3950.html" rel="external">"T-B-NK+ SCID: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2362041932"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT PRIOR TO DIAGNOSIS AND TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Infants suspected of immunodeficiency require special care and treatment before definitive diagnosis is made and correction is performed. This includes protective isolation, avoidance of live vaccines, and prophylaxis against infection (antimicrobials and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy). For those patients suspected of radiation-sensitive SCID (RS-SCID), avoidance of exposure to unnecessary radiation is also important. These measures are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3955.html" rel="external">"Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): An overview", section on 'Protective measures'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H900717517"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO DEFINITIVE THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Typical SCID is universally fatal in infancy without definitive treatment. These patients require definitive therapy to have a chance at survival. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only confirmed curative therapy for children with T-B-NK+ SCID  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef134345" href="/z/d/graphic/134345.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), but outcomes depend upon the donor type available and the conditioning used [<a href="#rid2">2-5</a>]. Gene therapy (GT) for T-B-NK+ SCID remains experimental and in the early stages of clinical investigation. We recommend HCT with a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched related donor, if available, for infants with T-B-NK+ SCID. For patients without an HLA-matched related donor, we suggest HCT with an alternative donor, preferably a matched unrelated donor or, if one is not available, a haploidentical related donor or an unrelated cord blood donor. Patients without a matched related donor who have Artemis-deficient SCID (ART-SCID) are eligible for GT as part of a clinical trial (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT03538899&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH%2BMCpwZ1%2F1ekxPNPMKVLjpmaYHe8zrXvzH2T%2BuJ969tBuKIiSIZEhXgBFg%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=96155" target="_blank">NCT03538899</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Hematopoietic cell transplantation'</a> below and <a class="local">'Gene therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2362041938"><span class="h1">HEMATOPOIETIC CELL TRANSPLANTATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1545784398"><span class="h2">Outcomes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As with all SCID hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients, the outcome for T-B-NK+ SCID is best in those who have a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched related donor, usually a sibling [<a href="#rid3">3,7,8</a>]. T and B cell immune reconstitution appears better in patients with T-B-NK+ SCID who do not have radiation sensitivity (ie, recombination-activating gene SCID [RAG-SCID]) and who receive myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning. However, outcomes are not as good in patients with radiation-sensitive SCID (RS-SCID), who have a higher rate of infections, poorer survival, and more long-term complications when treated with alkylating therapy and/or ionizing radiation than those with T-B-NK+ SCID without radiation sensitivity [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In fact, it appears that patients with certain genotypes of RS-SCID (eg, ligase IV deficiency) do more poorly if treated with myeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115988.html" rel="external">"Hematopoietic cell transplantation for severe combined immunodeficiencies"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3950.html" rel="external">"T-B-NK+ SCID: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Radiation-sensitive SCID due to DNA repair defects'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2378805606"><span class="h3">HLA-matched related donor</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In a multicenter, retrospective study of 145 children with either Artemis or RAG 1 and 2-deficient T-B-NK+ SCID (ART-SCID or RAG1/2-SCID), 88 percent of the 63 recipients of an HLA-matched related donor transplant without conditioning were long-term survivors (median follow-up 51 months for Artemis and 32 months for RAG defects) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Similar results were seen in an earlier study of 16 patients with ART-SCID, who had an overall 75 percent long-term survival (median follow-up seven years) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Patients were generally transplanted at an early age (mean 2.3 months) and had a relatively short interval between diagnosis and HCT (mean of 1.5 months). As an example, 7 of the 16 infants were diagnosed either in utero or at birth (because of a positive family history), with early transplantation prior to the onset of serious infections. The use of nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens in 14 of 16 initial transplants also likely contributed to the absence of mortality in the immediate posttransplant period and subsequent long-term survival, although the patients who received alkylating therapy as conditioning had increased late effects and poorer survival beyond two years compared with patients with non-RS-SCID [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Conditioning regimens'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3515638545"><span class="h3">HLA-matched unrelated donors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Matched unrelated donors with varying conditioning regimens have been used to treat T-B-NK+ SCID. Anecdotal evidence suggests that these patients respond similarly to other SCID genotypes. However, there are no comparative data published in peer-reviewed literature to indicate any preferred alternative donor for T-B-NK+ SCID. As discussed below, the major concern for this type of SCID regardless of the donor is conditioning and whether the patient is radiation sensitive. (See <a class="local">'Conditioning regimens'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3262700034"><span class="h3">Haploidential related donor</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Survival is lower in patients without an HLA-matched related donor. Only 52 percent of the 82 recipients of haploidentical related donor transplants in the first study discussed above were long-term survivors [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Survival in the haploidentical transplant group was 67 percent in patients who received myeloablative conditioning.</p><p>Successful engraftment of haploidentical T cell-depleted parental grafts is significantly reduced in children with T-B-NK+ SCID (unless maternal chimerism is present) compared with those with T-B+NK- SCID [<a href="#rid3">3,7,8</a>]. This is presumed to be due to the presence of normal functioning NK cells, which are known to mediate graft resistance.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2362041950"><span class="h2">Conditioning regimens</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The best approach for conditioning for HCT in children with T-B-NK+ SCID is not yet defined, although ongoing studies in North America by the Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium (PIDTC), a consortium of 47 centers focused on HCT, gene therapy (GT), and enzyme replacement therapy for children with SCID, should help to shed light on this problem [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>In an analysis of 640 children in North America with typical or leaky SCID who received HCT from an alternative donor (haplocompatible related, unrelated adult, or cord blood) between 1968 and 2010, the PIDTC found that, in general, patients with SCID had the best T cell immune reconstitution and were more likely to come off of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy when they received either reduced-intensity or myeloablative conditioning rather than no conditioning or only immunosuppression [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Of importance, those with ART-SCID did significantly worse in terms of survival and immune reconstitution when compared with other genotypes such as interleukin 2 receptor common gamma chain (IL2RG; X-linked SCID [X-SCID]), Janus kinase 3 (JAK3), interleukin 7 receptor alpha chain (IL7RA), and RAG.</p><p>In a large, multicenter, retrospective study from Europe using the Stem Cell Transplant in Primary Immune Deficiency in Europe (SCETIDE) registry, 338 patients with SCID who underwent an HCT between 2006 and 2014 were evaluated for two-year overall and event-free survival [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]; 34 had ART-SCID, and 76 had RAG1- or RAG2-SCID. The results were relatively similar to that reported by the PIDTC [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], although the poorer survival in this T-B-NK+ subgroup compared with other SCID genotypes did not reach statistical significance at two years. In the PIDTC study, the patients with RAG-SCID had much better outcomes than those with ART-SCID, and HLA-matched sibling transplants were not included in the analysis. It is possible that the failure to achieve statistical significance in the European study was due to the inclusion of matched sibling recipients and the merging of patients with ART-SCID with those with RAG-SCID.</p><p>Myeloablative preparative regimens facilitate engraftment and immune reconstitution. However, these regimens also significantly increase transplant morbidity and mortality, especially in young infants with RS-SCID. As an example, patients with ART-SCID who are exposed to alkylating agents are at risk for late complications, such as pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage, absence of secondary teeth and other dental abnormalities, endocrinopathies, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), short stature, and decreased survival, that are not seen in other forms of SCID [<a href="#rid7">7,8,11</a>]. Patients with other genotypes of RS-SCID also have poorer survival when exposed to high-dose alkylating therapy [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].The North American experience with alkylating therapy to open marrow niches for patients with SCID undergoing HCT is predominantly with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9173" href="/z/d/drug information/9173.html" rel="external">busulfan</a> and, to a lesser extent, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9605" href="/z/d/drug information/9605.html" rel="external">melphalan</a> [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In Europe, there appears to be a growing experience with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="134625" href="/z/d/drug information/134625.html" rel="external">treosulfan</a>, another alkylating agent similar to busulfan but with apparently fewer side effects [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Whether or not this agent will impact long-term outcomes for patients with RS-SCID remains to be determined.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2362041956"><span class="h3">General approach in T-B-NK+ SCID</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The type and degree of pre-HCT conditioning in patients with T-B-NK+ SCID to a large degree depends upon donor availability, presence of maternal chimerism, and genotype [<a href="#rid3">3-5,7,8,14-17</a>]. In general, conditioning therapy is not needed to achieve at least T cell reconstitution when HLA-matched related donors are available. Some form of immunosuppression to prevent rejection and myeloablation to open marrow niches with an alkylating agent is often necessary for transplantation with alternative donors in order to achieve full and durable T and B cell immune reconstitution. When maternal cells are present in the patient, rejection of a maternal graft is eliminated. However, this is associated with an increased risk of GVHD [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1461305794"><span class="h4">HLA-matched donor</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>No conditioning is necessary for transplantation with HLA-matched related donors (and possibly with a perfectly matched unrelated donor) in order to achieve durable T cell reconstitution and, in limited cases, B cell reconstitution. An HLA-matched related donor may be used without conditioning therapy even with maternal engraftment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2452807621"><span class="h4">Maternal engraftment and no HLA-matched relative</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with maternal engraftment are already tolerant of maternal cells. Thus, the mother should be used as the donor if maternal engraftment is present and an HLA-matched relative is unavailable. Under these circumstances, conditioning is not required, but T cell depletion of the graft (either by CD34 cell selection or T cell receptor [TCR] alpha/beta depletion) should be performed along with administration of pretransplant serotherapy with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8725" href="/z/d/drug information/8725.html" rel="external">alemtuzumab</a> to minimize the risk of fatal GVHD [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1946418886"><span class="h4">No HLA-matched relative or maternal engraftment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Immunosuppressive conditioning is generally used for those children without maternal engraftment or an HLA-matched relative, although, in one study, approximately one-third of children with NK+ SCID without maternal engraftment and with no conditioning engrafted with haploidentical donors [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Thus, it is reasonable to attempt a haploidentical transplant without conditioning under certain circumstances, such as while searching for an unrelated donor, and to consider immunosuppression only if the graft is rejected, especially if the child has no active infections. In a retrospective review of 10 newly diagnosed patients with SCID, 9 of whom had either ART-SCID or RAG-SCID, low-exposure <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9173" href="/z/d/drug information/9173.html" rel="external">busulfan</a> (median dose 5.9 mg/kg, range 4.8 to 9.1) was used along with other nonalkylating agents, although three patients with non-RS-SCID also received 10 mg/kg <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9992" href="/z/d/drug information/9992.html" rel="external">thiotepa</a> [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Six of the 10 patients had full T and B cell reconstitution, including three patients with ART-SCID.</p><p>Most North American transplant centers use either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9173" href="/z/d/drug information/9173.html" rel="external">busulfan</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9605" href="/z/d/drug information/9605.html" rel="external">melphalan</a> with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8452" href="/z/d/drug information/8452.html" rel="external">fludarabine</a> regimens for myeloablation when an HLA-matched related donor is not available for a child with SCID [<a href="#rid19">19,21,22</a>]. Fludarabine (a nonalkylating agent) has more specific T cell immunosuppressive activity, although it has little to no effect on NK cells. In addition, it is less toxic than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>, the previous drug of choice for immunosuppressive conditioning [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. These myeloablative regimens are more likely to result in B cell reconstitution [<a href="#rid4">4</a>], but they are also associated with a higher mortality than the immunosuppressive regimens or no conditioning approaches, at least in patients with RS-SCID who have active infection at the time of HCT [<a href="#rid3">3,4,8,15</a>].</p><p>In one European study, for example, none of the T-B- SCID recipients who did not receive <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9173" href="/z/d/drug information/9173.html" rel="external">busulfan</a> conditioning developed B cell function [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. The failure to reconstitute B cell immunity in T-B-NK+ SCID suggests a more complex maturation process for the B cell lineage and absence of the selective advantage that appears to exist for donor T cells. The higher mortality seen with myeloablation is largely because children with SCID who are ill at the time of diagnosis with opportunistic infections and/or failure to thrive are more susceptible to toxic chemotherapy [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. It is possible that replacing busulfan with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="134625" href="/z/d/drug information/134625.html" rel="external">treosulfan</a> may reduce the toxicity associated with busulfan; however, this remains to be documented [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].

Thus, the goal for these patients is to minimize the use of alkylators and, if possible, to avoid using more than one alkylator and minimize dosing [<a href="#rid7">7,9,12</a>]. The use of either no conditioning or immunosuppressive conditioning alone (eg, low-dose cyclophosphamide or possibly <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9992" href="/z/d/drug information/9992.html" rel="external">thiotepa</a>) for the initial HCT with an alternative donor in children with non-RAG1 or RAG2 types of T-B-NK+ SCID is suggested to minimize the exposure to alkylating agents. Donor marrow "boosts" or repeat HCT with myeloablative conditioning are reserved for those cases in which the initial procedure results in inadequate T cell immune reconstitution or graft failure.

Unpublished results in a limited number of T-B-NK+ SCID are variable, and more studies are needed in this patient population. If T cell reconstitution can be obtained with a transplant without conditioning, especially in infants, then there is the option to do a boost transplant with therapy directed at opening marrow niches when the child is older and possibly less susceptible to alkylating agents to achieve B cell reconstitution.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2528430931"><span class="h3">Specific defects</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1388762607"><span class="h4">RAG1/2 defects</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with defects in recombination-activating gene (RAG) 1 or 2 tolerate aggressive conditioning regimens compared with non-RAG1 or RAG2 types of T-B-NK+ SCID because those with RAG1 or RAG2 defects are defective in T and B cell V(D)J recombination but do not have a defect in double-stranded DNA repair [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].

In one series, there was no difference in survival or the incidence of acute GVHD in patients with ART-SCID, regardless of exposure to alkylators, although a higher incidence of infection was seen. However, in patients surviving more than two years post-HCT, there was a significant association among short stature, abnormal dental development including absent secondary teeth, and late endocrine effects in patients with ART-SCID who received high-dose alkylator therapy prior to their transplant.

In general, conditioning therapy is not needed to achieve at least T cell reconstitution when HLA-matched sibling donors are available. When alternative donors are used, depending on the genotype, some form of immunosuppression and myeloablation is necessary. However, patients with RS-SCID are at increased risk of toxicity from alkylating agents, and, therefore, use of alkylators should be at least minimized in these patients.
