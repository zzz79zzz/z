         HF is a common clinical syndrome with symptoms caused by impaired ability of one or both ventricles to pump at a normal pressure due to a structural or functional cardiac disorder [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. It is characterized by specific symptoms, such as dyspnea and fatigue, and signs, such as fluid retention. There are many ways to assess cardiac function. However, there is no diagnostic test for HF, since it is largely a clinical diagnosis that is based upon a careful history and physical examination. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3510.html" rel="external">

         The history, including assessment of New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, and physical examination in conjunction with the diagnostic tests reviewed below should both establish the primary cause of the HF and provide a reasonable estimate of its severity.

         The classification system that is most commonly used to quantify the degree of functional limitation imposed by HF is one first developed by the NYHA. This system assigns patients to one of four functional classes, depending on the degree of effort needed to elicit symptoms  (

         There are several stages in the evolution of HF, as outlined by the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association guidelines [

         HF is caused by a variety of disorders, including diseases affecting the pericardium, myocardium, endocardium, cardiac valves, vasculature, or metabolism [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The discussion here will focus primarily on myocardial causes of HF. There are two basic pathophysiologic myocardial mechanisms that cause reduced cardiac output and HF: systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Systolic and diastolic dysfunction each may be due to a variety of etiologies. Effective management is often dependent upon establishing the correct etiologic diagnosis. As an example, coronary revascularization may be beneficial in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy who have evidence of hibernating myocardium. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3479.html" rel="external">
          "Epidemiology of heart failure"
         </a>

         <a class="local">

         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The challenge of finding the correct etiology in patients with HF is illustrated by studies that have compared the clinical (pre-transplant) diagnosis and morphologic diagnosis (based upon pathologic examination of the explanted heart) in heart transplant recipients. In two series, each spanning two decades, 17 and 13 percent of patients were misdiagnosed prior to transplantation, particularly patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (30 and 22 percent with clinical misdiagnosis) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. Conditions that were missed clinically included cardiac sarcoidosis, myocarditis, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (in both series), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and noncompaction (in one series [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]).

         HF with reduced EF (HFrEF; LVEF ≤40 percent) is also known as systolic HF or HF due to systolic dysfunction.
        </p>
        <p>
         The most common causes of systolic dysfunction are coronary (ischemic) heart disease, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertension, and valvular disease. Effective therapy of hypertension has led to a changing pattern in which coronary disease has become more prevalent as a cause of HF [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. In one review, coronary disease and hypertension accounted for 62 and 10 percent of cases, respectively [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         As compared with all patients presenting with HF, patients who present with initially unexplained DCM have a different distribution of etiologies. After a complete evaluation of 1278 such patients, the relative frequency of the different causes was as follows [

         HFpEF is also known as diastolic HF and refers to HF in patients with an LVEF ≥50 percent or &gt;50 percent [

        <p>
         Diastolic dysfunction can be caused by many of the same conditions that lead to systolic dysfunction. The most common causes are hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. However, many patients with symptoms suggestive of HF (shortness of breath, ankle edema, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea) who have intact LV systolic function may not have diastolic dysfunction, but have other etiologies that can account for their symptoms, including obesity, lung disease, or occult coronary ischemia [

In patients with mitral valve disease, a preliminary report indicates that the ratio of isovolumetric relaxation time to the time interval between the onset of E and Ea (TE-Ea) correlates with PCWP [

         Exercise testing should be part of the initial evaluation of virtually all patients with HF.

         Virtually all patients with unexplained HF should be evaluated for the presence of coronary heart disease. Most patients with HF due to ischemic cardiomyopathy have known coronary heart disease. However, occult disease is a common cause of dilated cardiomyopathy, accounting for as many as 7 percent of initially unexplained cases [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. On the other hand, chest pain alone is not sufficient to make the diagnosis since up to one-third of patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy have chest pain that may resemble angina or be atypical. Revascularization may be of benefit in the appreciable number of patients in whom hibernating myocardium or silent ischemia is in part responsible for the decline in myocardial function.
        </p>

         This was illustrated in a meta-analysis of 24 studies involving 3088 patients (mean LVEF 32 percent) [

         Noninvasive stress testing is a reasonable first step in the evaluation of coronary artery disease, as it not only provides information about the presence of ischemic heart disease, but also can be used for risk stratification and prognostic purposes. However, coronary angiography can be considered an alternative to stress testing in high-risk patients. (See

          2

         However, the angiographic findings must be considered in the context of the patient's history and other data. The presence of asymptomatic angiographic coronary artery disease in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy does not prove causality unless there is evidence of prior infarction or hibernating myocardium [

         This was illustrated in a study of 55 patients who underwent heart transplantation; the patients carried a diagnosis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and all had had a normal coronary arteriogram within the preceding 10 years and no ischemic events [

         Because of concerns about the risk of invasive coronary angiography, noninvasive methods have been evaluated for the diagnosis of ischemic cardiomyopathy, although none are as yet recommended as a replacement for cardiac catheterization in patients with HF. Coronary artery disease can be directly imaged by computed tomography (CT) or cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Studies using MDCT or CMR have shown this to be a promising approach to the noninvasive distinction between ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. (See

         For example, among patients with idiopathic DCM, it is estimated that at least 25 percent have familial disease. No clinical or histologic criteria, other than family history and careful examination of relatives (including those who are asymptomatic), have been derived to distinguish familial from nonfamilial disease. The mode of inheritance is usually autosomal dominant, although autosomal recessive, X-linked, and mitochondrial inheritance have also been described. These disorders are discussed separately. (See

         The 2009 Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) genetic evaluation of cardiomyopathy guideline recommends a careful family history for three or more generations for all patients with cardiomyopathy [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. This recommendation applies to patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), DCM, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), LV noncompaction (LVNC), restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM), and cardiomyopathies associated with extracardiac manifestations (eg, muscular dystrophy, Fabry disease, amyloidosis, or sarcoidosis).
        </p>
        <p>
         The initial evaluation of the index patient should include family history and pedigree analysis for unexplained HF before age 60 or sudden cardiac death in the absence of ischemic symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Referral to a center with expertise in genetic cardiomyopathies may be helpful in obtaining and reviewing family history and pedigree information, as well as providing genetic counseling and testing. Specialized centers may also compile databases and perform research that promotes advances in this field.

         We agree with the 2009 HFSA guideline recommendation of screening first-degree relatives of patients with cardiomyopathy (including all types for which the guidelines recommend detailed family history).
