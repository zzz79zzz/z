         The myocardial action potential refers to the "all or nothing" depolarization followed by repolarization of the cell membrane, which results from a complex interaction of voltage and time dependent ion channels and carriers in the cellular membrane. When abnormalities arise in the normal process of cardiac excitability, patients may develop tachyarrhythmias by a variety of mechanisms.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will review the normal cardiac excitation process and the generation of the myocardial action potential, along with mechanisms of arrhythmia and the classes of antiarrhythmic medications and their impact on cardiac excitability. The treatment of specific tachyarrhythmias is discussed elsewhere. (See

         Cardiac excitability refers to the ease with which cardiac cells undergo a series of events characterized by sequential depolarization and repolarization, communication with adjacent cells, and propagation of the electrical activity. The normal heartbeat arises from an organized flow of ionic currents across the cell membrane, through the myoplasm and between cells and the extracellular space [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Excitable membranes containing specialized ion-specific channels, cell-to-cell connecting proteins, and intracellular components transmit the action potential and lead to excitation-contraction coupling.
        </p>
        <p>
         Understanding cardiac electrophysiology requires knowing the types and regulation pathways of ion channels, electrogenic exchange transporters, gap junctions, and the proportional contribution of each mechanism. Abnormalities of these elements, both inherited and acquired, can lead to arrhythmia.

         Inherited abnormalities arise from mutations in genes encoding the subunits and associated proteins of these channels, and have been associated with familial arrhythmic syndromes and sudden cardiac death. Examples include the congenital long QT syndrome (mainly sodium and potassium current), the Brugada syndrome (mainly sodium current), and congenital heart block (sodium current). (See

         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The pore-forming protein is called the alpha subunit, which also contains the voltage-dependent sensors and gates. For many ion channels, one or more secondary regulatory subunit proteins are present (usually named beta, gamma, delta, and so on) in association with the alpha subunit, and many ion channel proteins have subunit isoforms adding to their complexity. The encoding genes, amino acid sequences, and structure-function relationships for many ion channels have been described and are now reasonably well understood  (

         Ion channels are grouped and currents are named in one of three ways: by the ionic charge species to which the channel is permeant, the distinguishing kinetics, or pharmacology  (

         The resting cardiac cell membrane potential is normally polarized between -80 and -95 mV, with the cell interior negative relative to the extracellular space. The resting membrane potential is determined by the balance of inward (Na
         <sup>
          +
         </sup>
         and Ca
         <sup>

         ) and outward (K
         <sup>
          +
         </sup>
         ) currents and the corresponding equilibrium potentials of these currents. In turn, the equilibrium potential for a given ion is determined by the concentrations of that ion inside and outside the cell. Using these concentrations, the equilibrium potential is calculated by the Nernst equation. As an example, potassium ion concentrations are higher inside than outside the cell, and the potassium equilibrium potential is between -80 and -95 mV. When potassium channels open, potassium ions flow down their gradient as an outward current, carrying positive ions outside the cell and taking the cell toward more negative potentials.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In the heart, the resting membrane potential is generated by the inward rectifier current (I
         <sub>
          K1
         </sub>
         ), which is the predominant open channel at rest. Potassium current flowing through these channels continues until the interior negative potential is at the same magnitude as the equilibrium potential for potassium. Only small amounts of actual potassium flow are required to maintain this potential. The equilibrium potentials for sodium and calcium are positive (approximately +40 mV and approximately +80 mV, respectively) so that when these channels are open, they tend to depolarize the membrane.
        </p>
        <p>
         Voltage-sensitive sodium, calcium, and potassium channels play only a small role in the resting state since most of these channels are closed [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. The Na-K-ATPase pump maintains the potassium and sodium gradients by pumping potassium into and sodium out of the cells. The Na-Ca exchanger uses the power of the Na gradient to pump Ca out of the cell. These and other pumps maintain the ion channel gradient that is important for both excitability and contraction.

         Tissues that depend upon the opening of voltage-sensitive, kinetically rapid (opening in less than a millisecond) sodium channels to initiate depolarization are called fast response tissues [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Fast response tissues include the atria, the specialized infranodal conducting system (bundle of His, fascicles and bundle branches, and terminal Purkinje fibers), and the ventricles  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63340" href="/z/d/graphic/63340.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ), while the sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes represent slow response tissues. It is important to recognize that accessory AV pathways (ie, bypass tracts) associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome are derived from the atria and are thus also fast response tissues dependent upon sodium current for depolarization.

          Phase 0

         – Rapid depolarization (phase 0) occurs when the resting cell is brought to threshold, leading sequentially to activation or opening of voltage-dependent sodium channels, rapid sodium entry into the cells down a favorable concentration gradient, and a cell interior positive potential that can approach +45 mV. The marked depolarization initiates voltage-dependent inactivation of the sodium channels. Calcium channels also open during depolarization, but the inward calcium flux is much slower.

         – Following initial repolarization in phase 1, phase 2 represents a plateau that lasts for hundreds of milliseconds and distinguishes the cardiac action potential from nerve and skeletal muscle action potentials, which are significantly shorter. Late inactivating depolarizing calcium and sodium currents are balanced by activating repolarizing potassium currents to maintain the plateau, which is often down-sloping as repolarizing currents begin to dominate.

        </p>
        <p>
         The resting and inactivated states are different physiologically, even though the channel is effectively nonconducting in both settings. In the resting state, the channels can be opened positive to the threshold potential. In comparison, the inactivated channel cannot be activated until it cycles or "recovers" to the resting state. These different states are important clinically, since, for example, some antiarrhythmic drugs (such as the class I antiarrhythmic drugs) preferentially bind to open and inactivated sodium channels.

         ]. These channels are selective for calcium, have a slower conduction velocity than the sodium channels, and take longer to reactivate.

         In some cases, as with tissue damage or changes in the extracellular milieu, fast response tissues can be converted to slow response tissues. In this setting, sodium channels become inactivated and depolarization is dependent upon the slow calcium channels.

         When an action potential forms in a patch of membrane (the source), current flows from this patch to neighboring patches (the sink). Gap junctions are the low resistance structures that allow ions to flow from one cell to another and, if the current flow is sufficient, to cause sequential depolarization from cell to cell. The gap junctions are actually active, opening and closing in response to changes in pH, calcium, and, at times, voltage. In addition to ion flow and gap junction resistance, impulse propagation can also be affected by the orientation of fibers and of the collagen matrix in which the fibers reside.

         "Fast" tissues may conduct very slowly (declining from meters/second to millimeters/second) in a number of circumstances, resulting in prolongation of the QRS and QT intervals on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG). These include inactivation of sodium channels induced by hyperkalemia or ischemia-induced acidosis, direct damage to the cells, or the effect of drugs, particularly antiarrhythmic drugs. (See

         While the term "arrhythmia" also includes bradyarrhythmias caused by a failure of impulse generation, this section will focus on the cellular and tissue mechanisms of tachyarrhythmias. Three distinct mechanisms underlie tachyarrhythmia induction: enhanced automaticity, reentry, and triggered activity  (

         Enhanced automaticity refers to abnormal phase 4 diastolic depolarization, and occurs when spontaneous depolarization develops during diastole  (

         ). While this is a normal phenomenon in nodal cells, and with subsidiary pacemakers at slower rates in all myocardial cells, enhanced or abnormal automaticity may lead to tachyarrhythmia. A typical example is automatic (ie, focal) atrial tachycardia. Common automaticity stimulants include excess catecholamine or situations causing hypoxia, acidosis, or ischemic related metabolites.

         Initiation of reentry requires a unidirectional block within the reentrant path, such that one arm of the circuit conducts the approaching electrical wave front and the blocks it in the other arm. Reentry can travel around a fixed or anatomical circuit such as myocardial scar, or a functional circuit such as an area of tissue that is depolarized or refractory and does not support conduction.
        </p>
        <p>
         A common example of a reentry-based arrhythmia is AV reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT) related to an accessory pathway (ie, bypass tract) as part of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. In AVRT, the fast conducting limb (for either antegrade or retrograde AVRT) is the accessory pathway, which uses Na
         <sup>
          +
         </sup>
         channels to support rapid conduction, while the slow conducting limb is the normal AV node. An example of fixed reentry arrhythmia is ventricular tachycardia with a fixed myocardial scar and variable conduction in the surrounding myocardium.

        <p>
         Interventions to terminate reentrant arrhythmias differ from other mechanisms and are generally geared to modify the critical components of the reentrant circuit. Blocking Na

         </sup>
         channels prolongs the action potential and therefore increases refractoriness. Another approach is to improve functional properties such as ischemia in an area of functional block that can terminate the arrhythmia. Interventions that electrically interrupt the reentrant loop include delivering a small electrical impulse to depolarize or block a small part of the reentrant loop (ie, anti-tachycardia pacing), delivering a large electrical shock to depolarize most or all the reentrant loop (ie, cardioversion), or ablating tissue critical to the reentrant loop.

         Triggered activity refers to a depolarization that occurs after the initial depolarization wavefront and comes in two forms, either early or late. Secondary depolarizations that occur before the action potential has fully repolarized are early afterdepolarizations (EADs)  (

         channel time and voltage dependence, EADs occur at slow stimulation rates or after a ventricular pause when action potential duration (phase 2) is prolonged and they are suppressed with faster heart rates. EADs are thought to initiate the polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias torsades de pointes (TdP) found in inherited and acquired long QT syndrome (LQTS), for example drug-induced LQTS. A point of distinction to be made here is that triggered activity can initiate TdP, but TdP may be a re-entrant mechanism at the organ level with a functional (spiral reentry) rather than fixed anatomical core.

         The different antiarrhythmic drugs often have several effects on action potential generation and propagation and may also affect the autonomic nervous system. The classification of antiarrhythmic drugs according to the Harrison modification of the Vaughan Williams classification was originally based upon their effects on the action potential, but later modification and enhancements included the molecular targets such as specific ion channels and beta adrenergic receptors [
         <a href="#rid8">

          ivabradine

         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. This scheme differs slightly from a classification endorsed by international societies [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Further modifications are to be expected. All these classification schemes assume that individual drugs have a predominant mechanism of action. This distinction remains useful, even though it does not account for the complicated electrophysiologic and autonomic interactions that are present, with some drugs having actions on more than one target.
        </p>
        <p>
         The modified Vaughan Williams classification has proven surprisingly useful even though it represents an oversimplification of the electrophysiologic events that occur. The classification appears to work because the multiple factors that influence cardiac excitability are sufficiently coordinated to produce predictable outcomes, rather than unpredictably complex behavior [

         Certain arrhythmogenic substrates are common, such as those induced by ischemia or infarction. In this setting, a certain effect of a drug becomes predominant and predictable, as with class I activity in ischemia, and a drug classification appears accurate. However, the major drug effect may be quite different if a different proarrhythmic substrate exists. Consider, for example, the differences in digitalis action in hypokalemia and hyperkalemia.

Class Ia agents also have anticholinergic activity and tend to depress myocardial contractility. At slower heart rates, when use-dependent blockade of the sodium current is not significant, potassium channel blockade may become predominant (reverse use-dependence), leading to prolongation of the APD and QT interval and increased automaticity.

          nifedipine
         </a>
         , have little electrophysiologic effect on the heart. Verapamil and diltiazem can slow the sinus rate (usually in the presence of sinus node dysfunction or beta blockade), increase the refractoriness of and prolong conduction through the AV node, occasionally prolong the PR interval, and depress LV function.

         The newer classification scheme  (

          table 2

          table 3

         ) calls this class "Ca handling modulators" and divides it into five subclassifications of targets, of which Class IVa is the classic Vaughan Williams surface channel blockers [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. The additional classes IVb through IVe for the most part do not yet contain clinically available drugs, but this scheme does serve as a template for further research. An exception to this are the Class I drugs
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8449" href="/z/d/drug information/8449.html" rel="external">
          flecainide

          propafenone
         </a>
         , which qualify as class IVd ryanodine receptor blockers and are active against catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Additional proposed classes include Class V (mechanosensitive channel blockers) and Class VI (gap junction blockers), which have drugs under investigation. Class VII (upstream target modulators) includes angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers that may have antiarrhythmic action by their effects on cardiac remodeling.

         Classification of antiarrhythmic drugs is generally done by their predominant action and target  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120226" href="/z/d/graphic/120226.html" rel="external">
          table 2

          table 3

         ). Note that nearly all clinically used drugs act on multiple targets. (See

          'Classification of antiarrhythmic drugs'
         </a>

         The multiple electrophysiologic actions of antiarrhythmic drugs interacting with the variable underlying substrate present in each patient determine whether the clinical effect will be proarrhythmic or antiarrhythmic. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Classification of antiarrhythmic drugs'
