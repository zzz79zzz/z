Mild disease is defined as a factor activity level above 5 and below 40 percent; moderate disease is a factor activity level between 1 and ≤5 percent; and severe disease is a factor activity level &lt;1 percent [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1310.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hemophilia", section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Hemophilia C refers to factor XI (factor 11) deficiency, but the phenotypic disease severity, type of bleeding manifestations, and management differ from hemophilia A and B. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1333.html" rel="external">"Factor XI (eleven) deficiency"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Acquired hemophilia refers to development of a clotting factor deficiency that was not present at birth. Typically, this occurs when an autoantibody is produced against an endogenous factor. Acquired hemophilia A (acquired inhibitor against endogenous factor VIII) is the most common. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1305.html" rel="external">"Acquired hemophilia A (and other acquired coagulation factor inhibitors)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment</strong> – Previously untreated patients (PUPs) are those who have not received infusions of replacement factor. Previously treated patients (PTPs) are those who have been exposed to replacement factor.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Minimally treated patients are those with ≤3 exposure days. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Exposure days</strong> – Exposure days refers to the number of days on which the individual was exposed to exogenous factor. As an example, an individual treated with factor infusions on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for two weeks has six exposure days. An individual treated with two infusions of factor on Monday has one exposure day. The number of exposure days correlates with the risk of inhibitor development, but it is not necessarily a good surrogate for treatment intensity, as discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Therapy considerations'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inhibitors</strong> – An inhibitor is a neutralizing antibody that interferes with the function of the factor against which it is directed. In hemophilia A and B, inhibitors are alloantibodies directed against infused factor. Not all antibodies to factor act as inhibitors. Non-neutralizing antibodies directed against coagulation factors may be seen in individuals with hemophilia and in the general population [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Titer</strong> – Inhibitor titers are quantified using the Bethesda assay. This is a clot-based assay in which serial dilutions of patient plasma are incubated with pooled normal plasma and residual clotting activity is measured. In many cases, the Nijmegen modification is used. If exogenous factor VIII has been administered, heat treatment is sometimes used to remove any exogenous factor VIII and more accurately determine the patient's true inhibitor titer. Individuals receiving <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="115772" href="/z/d/drug information/115772.html" rel="external">emicizumab</a> cannot have an inhibitor titer determined using a clot-based assay. A chromogenic bovine reagent-based Bethesda assay (CBA) is used for individuals receiving emicizumab.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The titer is the reciprocal of the dilution of patient plasma that results in 50 percent factor activity, expressed as Bethesda units (BU) or Nijmegen-Bethesda units (NBU). The titer may also be expressed in BU/mL. The greater the dilution required to titrate out the inhibitor, the higher the inhibitor titer.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>High-responding versus low-responding inhibitor</strong> – An inhibitor titer of ≥5 BU at any time is considered a high-responding inhibitor, and a persistent titer &lt;5 BU despite repeated factor VIII or IX exposure is considered a low-responding inhibitor [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Low-responding inhibitors do not rise to ≥5 BU with repeated exposure to factor. A patient whose titer is ≥5 BU has a greater likelihood of increase upon re-exposure to factor.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Transient inhibitors</strong> – Inhibitors that disappear spontaneously (that decrease below the definition threshold within six months of initial documentation despite continuing exposure to factor without immune tolerance induction) are referred to as transient inhibitors [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Immune tolerance induction</strong> – Immune tolerance induction (ITI, also called immune tolerance therapy [ITT] or inhibitor eradication) is the primary method used to eliminate or control inhibitors. It involves administration of frequent, regularly scheduled doses of the deficient factor to reset (tolerize) the individual's immune system and reduce or ablate production of the antibody. The immunologic principles are somewhat similar to immunotherapy for allergic disease, although there are significant differences in the clinical manifestations of the immune response. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/362.html" rel="external">"Allergen immunotherapy for allergic disease: Therapeutic mechanisms"</a> and <a class="local">'Immune tolerance induction'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H825939789"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3652302391"><span class="h2">Mechanisms of formation and action</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Inhibitors form when the immune system recognizes the infused factor as foreign and generates neutralizing antibodies. Predisposing and provoking factors are enumerated below. (See <a class="local">'Predisposing influences'</a> below.)</p><p>Inhibitors are high-affinity antibodies (primarily immunoglobulin G [IgG]) directed against the factor protein [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. They are often polyclonal (produced by separate B cell clones with many distinct antibody specificities that recognize distinct epitopes). In contrast, inhibitors in individuals with acquired hemophilia are often monoclonal (derived from a single B cell clone). In one study, approximately 80 percent of individuals with hemophilia A who developed inhibitors had at least two or more independent antibody specificities against factor VIII [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Emerging data suggest that IgG subtype signatures may impact inhibitor development [<a href="#rid8">8-11</a>].</p><p>In hemophilia A, most antibodies are directed against the A2 and/or C2 domains of the protein (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef120087" href="/z/d/graphic/120087.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Mechanisms include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Interference with factor VIII binding to phospholipids or von Willebrand factor (VWF) via binding to the C2 domain [<a href="#rid7">7,12-18</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Interference with factor VIII binding to factor IX or blocking of the intrinsic ten-ase activity of the factor VIIIa-factor IXa complex [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased clearance of factor VIII via direct proteolysis [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]</p><p></p><p>The domain structure of the factor VIII and factor IX molecules and functional regions of the proteins are discussed separately.

As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Different populations in different parts of the world may have different pathogenic variants in the <em>F8</em> or <em>F9</em> genes and immune response genes and may be treated using different products at different intensities, starting at different ages.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Individuals with more severe disease are likely to have more exposure days earlier in their disease course and are at higher risk for inhibitor development generally.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Individuals in certain populations may co-inherit certain factor mutations and certain mutations affecting the immune response</p><p></p><p>Risk factors for inhibitor development in hemophilia A have been studied extensively compared with hemophilia B because hemophilia A is more common and the incidence of inhibitors is higher. Further, hemophilia B is often associated with point mutations, which are less commonly associated with inhibitor development, rather than deletions, insertions, inversions, and frame shift mutations. The extent to which the information on predisposing factors can be generalized to hemophilia B is not known and may differ substantially. Research continues to define the best predictors of inhibitor development in both hemophilia A and B, as well as methods to decrease or prevent formation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2384198487"><span class="h3">Patient characteristics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Inhibitors are much more common in hemophilia A than in hemophilia B. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> below.)</p><p>Beyond this, there are several established patient characteristics that increase inhibitor risk. These include genetic factors related to the specific factor mutation and those related to immune response genes. Race and ethnicity also play a role, but their mechanisms are not well-elucidated.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Factor gene variant</strong> – The specific variant in the relevant factor gene (<em>F8</em> or <em>F9</em>) determines disease severity, and more severe disease is associated with greater inhibitor risk. This is likely because lower levels (or absence) of endogenous factor will make it less likely that the individual's immune system was tolerized to the antigen during development and more likely that the infused product is recognized by the recipient's immune system as foreign. There may also be factor antigen circulating in some individuals with absent factor activity, and these individuals may be more likely to be tolerized to that factor.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Thus, large deletions and nonsense mutations (creation of an internal stop codon) in the<em> F8</em> gene are much more likely to be associated with inhibitors compared with small deletions, insertions, or missense mutations (creation of an amino acid change) [<a href="#rid5">5,23-27</a>]. The intron 22 gene inversion, present in 40 to 45 percent of individuals with severe hemophilia A, carries an intermediate risk [<a href="#rid26">26,28</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1311.html" rel="external">"Genetics of hemophilia A and B", section on 'F8 gene (hemophilia A)'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a meta-analysis of studies that examined <em>F8</em> genotype and inhibitor risk in 5383 individuals with hemophilia A using intron 22 inversions as the control group, the odds ratios (ORs) for inhibitor development with large deletions, nonsense mutations, small deletions/insertions, and missense mutations were 3.6, 1.4, 0.5, and 0.3, respectively [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In an analysis of 586 participants who had data entered in the Haemophilia A Mutation, Search, Test and Resource Site (HAMSTeRS registry), the frequencies of inhibitors were as follows [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Large (&gt;200 bp) deletions – 38 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Nonsense mutations – 36 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Inversions – 20 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Small (≤86 bp) deletions – 14 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Missense mutations – 7 percent</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other studies have identified specific high-risk <em>F8</em> variants in individuals with mild to moderate hemophilia A such as the C2 domain Trp2229Cys mutation and the Arg593Cys mutation [<a href="#rid30">30,31</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">As noted below, there are several normal <em>F8</em> polymorphisms that do not cause hemophilia and may be distributed differently in individuals of different races; these may contribute to different rates of inhibitor development (eg, due to minor antigenic differences between endogenous factor VIII and the factor VIII protein sequence in the replacement product) [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Replacement product'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Data are much more limited for hemophilia B, but they confirm a greater frequency of inhibitors in those with severe disease [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. In a sequencing study, complete <em>F9</em> gene deletions conferred a higher risk than truncating mutations, partial deletions, or missense mutations [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Immune response genes</strong> – Development of inhibitors is an immune phenomenon, and some data have suggested that genes involved in the immune response to foreign proteins may contribute to inhibitor development [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. As an example, the Hemophilia Inhibitor Genetics Study (HIGS) evaluated genes involved in immune regulation among 104 sibling pairs with hemophilia A who were discordant in inhibitor status [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. As siblings, these individuals had the same <em>F8</em> mutation. Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) demonstrated variations in 13 immune response/immune modifier genes that correlated with inhibitor development. Other studies have implicated specific genes including those that encode human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II antigens, interleukins, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and/or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) [<a href="#rid36">36-41</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A prospective study in previously untreated patients with hemophilia A found different classes of immune responses during the first 50 exposure days, some of which correlated more strongly with inhibitor development (eg, development of IgG3 against factor VIII) [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other genetic contributions</strong> – There may be other as yet undefined genetic factors that influence inhibitor development. This possibility is suggested by case-control studies that have found increased rates of inhibitors in individuals with a family history of inhibitors [<a href="#rid24">24,30,43</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Race and ethnicity</strong> – Individuals with African ancestry or Hispanic ethnicity have a higher rate of inhibitor development compared with White people. A study from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the United States that reported on the prevalence of inhibitors among 5651 people with hemophilia A found the following prevalence of inhibitors in different races/ethnicities [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Black people – 27 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hispanic people – 25 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Non-Hispanic White people – 16 percent</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other studies have reported significantly higher inhibitor prevalences in Black people and people from Asian countries with hemophilia. As an example, a study involving 460 families in the Malmo international brother study (388 families with hemophilia A and 72 families with hemophilia B) reported inhibitors in 56 percent of Black people and 27 percent of White people [<a href="#rid45">45</a>].

Heat treatment may be used to test for the presence of endogenous factor if there is strong suspicion for this quenching phenomenon.</p><p>The diagnosis of an inhibitor is made using a Bethesda assay, which both identifies the inhibitor and quantifies it. The assay principle uses serial dilutions of patient plasma incubated at 37ºC with pooled normal plasma and measures factor activity using an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based assay [<a href="#rid92">92</a>]. Typically, the Nijmegen modification is used (ie, the Nijmegen-Bethesda assay [NBA]); the NBA is considered the gold standard for inhibitor testing [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

Emicizumab will normalize the aPTT despite the presence of an inhibitor, making it appear that the inhibitor is absent or of markedly lower titer than it actually is. For individuals receiving emicizumab, inhibitor titer must be measured with a bovine substrate chromogenic assay specific for factor VIIIa activity, similar to testing factor VIII levels on emicizumab.

Possible co-deletion of immune response modifier genes in individuals with <em>F9 </em>gene deletions has also been proposed [<a href="#rid120">120</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Individuals with allergic reactions to factor IX infusions may need desensitization therapy prior to initiating ITI. This may involve skin testing and IV administration of gradually escalating doses or continuous infusions of factor IX in a monitored setting such as a hospital, under the direction of an allergist/immunologist, similar to that used for other hypersensitivity reactions and allergies [<a href="#rid121">121,122</a>]. These protocols are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2071.html" rel="external">"Rapid drug desensitization for immediate hypersensitivity reactions"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nephrotic syndrome</strong> – In some cases, ITI for hemophilia B is complicated by the development of nephrotic syndrome. This phenomenon is typically associated with the allergic phenotype described above. Experience is limited, but features of this phenomenon appear to include development of a nephrotic picture approximately eight to nine months into the course of ITI using high-dose factor IX (100 to 325 units/kg per day), with periorbital edema, proteinuria, and low serum albumin [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]. Immune complexes may play a role. In one case, kidney biopsy demonstrated an appearance consistent with membranous glomerulonephritis [<a href="#rid103">103</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Unlike typical childhood nephrotic syndrome, glucocorticoids generally are not effective therapy. The main treatment is to withdraw the protein (ie, discontinue factor IX).</p><p></p><p>These observations have led many experts to use a pre-ITI desensitization protocol in individuals with the allergic phenotype or to treat these individuals with a concomitant immunosuppressive agent such as cyclosporin, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9670" href="/z/d/drug information/9670.html" rel="external">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a>, or intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> (IVIG); some avoid ITI in these individuals. Additional details of these approaches are described in case reports and treatment summaries [<a href="#rid116">116,121-124</a>].</p><p>As noted above, close consultation with the local hemophilia treatment center or other ITI expert is an essential component of the ITI approach in these individuals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H745384698"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/z/d/html/112393.html" rel="external">"Society guideline links: Hemophilia A and B"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10846052"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Definition</strong> – Inhibitors are antibodies directed against infused clotting factors that inhibit the functional activity or pharmacokinetics of the factor against which they are directed. (See <a class="local">'Terminology and definitions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk factors</strong> – Inhibitors occur most often in severe hemophilia (factor VIII or IX &lt;1 percent). They are more common in hemophilia A than in hemophilia B and in individuals of African ancestry or Hispanic ethnicity (prevalence in severe hemophilia A in White people, 20 to 30 percent; in severe hemophilia A in Black people, up to 50 percent; in severe hemophilia B in White people, 1.5 to 3 percent; in severe hemophilia B in Black people, up to 5 percent). Risk factors include the specific genetic variant; "danger signals" to the immune system; immune response mediators; and details of prophylactic therapy (product, age at first dose of factor, intensity). (See <a class="local">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Detection</strong> – Inhibitors may be clinically silent or discovered when factor infusions become ineffective in treating or preventing bleeding or in raising the factor level. Infusion reactions may occur, and factor IX inhibitors often cause allergic reactions to infused factor IX. Routine screening is appropriate. (See <a class="local">'Typical presentation'</a> above and <a class="local">'Routine screening and preoperative testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Titer</strong> – Inhibitors are tested using the Bethesda assay (with Nijmegen modification). This establishes the diagnosis of an inhibitor and quantifies the titer. Titers ≥5 Bethesda units (BU) are considered high titer, and high titer inhibitors are considered high-responding, even if they subsequently decline to &lt;5 BU. Knowledge of the most current inhibitor titer is essential, as this determines acute treatment of severe/life-threatening bleeding episodes.(See <a class="local">'Inhibitor diagnosis and characterization (titer)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevention</strong> – General best practices include working collaboratively with the local comprehensive hemophilia treatment center (HTC), discussing nonfactor prophylaxis options, and ensuring that individuals with hemophilia B have their genetic alteration identified and receive their first 20 factor IX infusions in a monitored setting with resuscitation capabilities. (See <a class="local">'Follow best practices'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/107911.html" rel="external">"Hemophilia A and B: Routine management including prophylaxis", section on 'Emicizumab for hemophilia A'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Elimination</strong> – If an inhibitor develops, immune tolerance induction (ITI) is used for eradication most commonly in factor VIII deficiency. The indications for ITI are evolving due to the availability of nonfactor products for prophylaxis in hemophilia A. Guidance from the local HTC or other ITI expert is essential. ITI can be conducted while an individual is receiving <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="115772" href="/z/d/drug information/115772.html" rel="external">emicizumab</a>; data are evolving. (See <a class="local">'Immune tolerance induction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bleeding</strong> – Treatment of bleeding and surgery in individuals with inhibitors is discussed separately.
