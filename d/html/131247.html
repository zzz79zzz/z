Of note, other genes have been proposed as potential contributors to PHTS and many cases remain idiopathic even after thorough genetic evaluation. Involvement of a genetic counselor or hereditary cancer syndrome expert is important in individuals with PHTS for whom a pathogenic variant in <em>PTEN</em> cannot be identified. They may suggest additional testing (eg, with a gene panel) and provide specialized physical examination that can contribute to a clinical diagnosis.

The defining clinical feature of PHTS is the presence of hamartomatous lesions, which are disorganized benign growths of native cells in native tissues. Besides multiple hamartomas in a variety of tissues, patients have macrocephaly, neurodevelopmental impairment (developmental delay/intellectual disability and/or autism), characteristic dermatologic manifestations such as trichilemmomas, oral fibromas, and punctate palmoplantar keratoses, and an increased risk of breast, endometrial, and other cancers.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H943186240"><span class="h3">Cowden syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with Cowden syndrome have characteristic mucocutaneous lesions and an elevated risk of breast, endometrial, thyroid, colorectal, and renal cancers as well as various other manifestations such as macrocephaly and dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum.

Common lesions associated with Cowden syndrome are trichilemmomas, acral keratoses, and facial papules/oral papillomas. Although commonly noticed in the second decade of life, the age of onset may vary from 4 to 75 years. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Breast </strong>– Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in Cowden syndrome, although it is one of the more rare causes of hereditary breast cancer. The onset of breast cancer is often early, with diagnosis at a mean of 38 to 46 years of age.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thyroid</strong> – Thyroid disease is the most frequent extracutaneous manifestation of Cowden syndrome, occurring in over one-half of patients. Benign thyroid abnormalities include multinodular goiter, lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis, and adenomas.
