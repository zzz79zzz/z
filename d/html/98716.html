Common indications for referral include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diagnostic uncertainty</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Suicidal ideation and behavior (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1708.html" rel="external">"Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Psychotic features (eg, auditory hallucinations commanding patients to kill themselves) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17193.html" rel="external">"Psychosis in adults: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic evaluation", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Catatonia – Prominent psychomotor disturbances, such as immobility, mutism, and posturing, which occur during most of the mood episode (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14683.html" rel="external">"Catatonia in adults: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15869.html" rel="external">"Catatonia: Treatment and prognosis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Impulsive and dangerous behavior (eg, running away from home or significant aggression)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fluctuating symptoms</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pregnancy</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Functional impairment (eg, not attending school)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Comorbid psychopathology (eg, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, and substance-related and addictive disorders)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use of potentially destabilizing medications (see <a class="local">'Potentially destabilizing drugs'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Multiple (eg, two) failed medication trials due to poor response or lack of tolerability</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Administering adjunctive psychotherapy</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recurrent mood episodes</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Poor adherence</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Discontinuing treatment following a period of stability</p><p></p><p>Primary care clinicians who refer patients to specialists are encouraged to remain involved in management [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Pediatricians can help educate patients and families about the benefits and risks of pharmacotherapy and reinforce the need for adherence, and typically collaborate in evaluating patients prior to treatment by obtaining a general medical history and performing a physical examination, and monitoring vital signs, weight, height, waist size, and metabolic laboratory tests during treatment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H121264208"><span class="h1">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prior to commencing pharmacotherapy for pediatric bipolar disorder, clinicians should evaluate patients to establish the diagnosis and determine the treatment plan. Interviews should include the patient and parents, and reports from the school may be helpful as well [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The assessment may take several hours and multiple visits [<a href="#rid3">3,8</a>].</p><p>However, children and adolescents may present with severe symptoms that require clinicians to initiate pharmacotherapy after an expedited evaluation, but before the diagnosis of bipolar disorder is certain. In these situations, family psychiatric history, prior treatment history (including response and adverse effects), comorbidities, and burden of current manic or depressive symptoms can guide decisions about potential risks and benefits of specific pharmacologic treatments. As an example, if a patient without a family history of bipolar disorder clearly has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and possibly has manic symptoms, but has never had a trial of stimulants, the risk/benefit ratio might favor an initial trial of stimulants rather than an antimanic drug. By contrast, if a patient with ADHD symptoms also has recurrent, distinct one- to two-day episodes of elated mood, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, and increased goal-directed activity, along with a family history of mania, and has become agitated and aggressive during trials of two different stimulants, the risk-benefit ratio favors treatment with an antimanic drug.</p><p>The evaluation identifies target symptoms for pharmacotherapy, including symptoms of mania, hypomania, and major depression  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91106" href="/z/d/graphic/91106.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91107" href="/z/d/graphic/91107.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91398" href="/z/d/graphic/91398.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), as well as anxiety, psychosis, inattention, and hyperactivity [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. As an example, chronic distractibility and impulsivity in a child with bipolar disorder and comorbid ADHD often do not improve substantially with antimanic drugs; however, euphoria, irritability, grandiosity, and decreased need for sleep should improve. Identifying the target symptoms often requires probing. A patient with episodes of rage may reveal that the episodes stem from an inability to complete homework, which in turn is due to anxiety and poor attention [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Target symptoms may need to be modified over time as patients undergo developmental changes [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. A comprehensive assessment of symptoms enables clinicians to subsequently distinguish psychiatric adverse effects secondary to pharmacotherapy from the baseline disorder [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Pretreatment assessments also address factors that can interfere with pharmacotherapy [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. These include prior nonadherence to medications as well as fears, prejudices, and false beliefs regarding medication on the part of patients and parents. Treatment is unlikely to succeed without the family’s cooperation [<a href="#rid3">3,7</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Adherence'</a> below.)</p><p>If many (eg, three or more) months have elapsed since the last examination by the primary care clinician, we suggest referral for a complete general medical history and physical examination, to rule out general medical illnesses that may account for the psychiatric symptoms, rule out contraindications for specific medications (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="16033" href="/z/d/drug information/16033.html" rel="external">olanzapine</a> is avoided in diabetic patients, and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12559" href="/z/d/drug information/12559.html" rel="external">lithium</a> in significant renal or thyroid disease), and establish the absence of movement disorders at baseline. The history includes cardiac illnesses, endocrine or metabolic problems, gastrointestinal difficulties, and neurologic symptoms, as well as menstrual history in girls [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. It is useful to ask about recent somatic and cognitive symptoms (eg, headaches, stomach aches, feeling tired, sleep problems, or impaired concentration) to establish a baseline so that these symptoms are not misattributed to new medications. Clinicians should also ask about the patient’s ability to swallow pills. Family history of cardiac conduction problems (particularly sudden cardiac death) and endocrine and metabolic illnesses is important.</p><p>In addition, the history should identify current medications that may interact with psychotropic medications. Specific interactions of psychotropic drugs with other medications may be determined using the <a class="external" href="/drug-interactions">drug interactions program</a> included in UpToDate.</p><p>A baseline blood pressure, pulse, weight, and body mass index (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13478.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>) should be obtained, because these are monitored during pharmacotherapy (see <a class="local">'Monitoring'</a> below). Laboratory tests are performed as indicated by the history and examination [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Tests are also guided by the choice of medication and are used to establish a baseline for potential adverse effects (eg, obtaining a lipid profile and glucose before initiating an antipsychotic or obtaining renal function tests prior to using <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12559" href="/z/d/drug information/12559.html" rel="external">lithium</a>) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. A pregnancy test is recommended for all postmenarchal females; a 12-month prospective study of female adolescents with bipolar disorder (n = 125) found that pregnancy occurred in 5 percent [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>Assessment by other specialists may indicated, such as neurology [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. If there are concerns about learning disorders or cognitive impairment, neuropsychological testing may be indicated.</p><p>Additional information about assessing youth for bipolar disorder and making the diagnosis is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83083.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder: Assessment and diagnosis", section on 'Assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with pediatric bipolar disorder may have parents with psychopathology (eg, bipolar or unipolar depressive disorders) that can affect treatment outcomes in the offspring. We suggest referring parents for evaluation if they are not receiving psychiatric treatment and appear to have a mental illness or difficulty coping with their child’s illness.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H66708203"><span class="h1">PATIENT AGE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>More studies of pharmacologic treatment for bipolar disorder have been conducted in adolescents than in younger children. Nevertheless, pharmacotherapy can effectively treat children as well as adolescents. Multiple randomized trials have demonstrated that medications (eg, second-generation antipsychotics) are efficacious for mania in patients aged 10 to 17 years [<a href="#rid12">12-17</a>]. Randomized trials also indicate that preadolescent and preschool children with bipolar disorder, as well as adolescents, respond to pharmacotherapy [<a href="#rid16">16,18,19</a>]. As an example:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A small, six-week trial compared <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12770" href="/z/d/drug information/12770.html" rel="external">risperidone</a> with placebo for mania in children aged three to seven years (n = 25) and found that improvement was greater with risperidone [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An eight-week trial found that <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12770" href="/z/d/drug information/12770.html" rel="external">risperidone</a> was efficacious for treating mania in 279 youth and that the rate of response (symptoms improved much or very much from baseline) appeared to be comparable for children age 6 to 12 years and adolescents age 13 to 15 years (65 and 75 percent) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p></p><p>In addition, multiple observational studies suggest that medications can successfully treat mania in children as young as age four years [<a href="#rid22">22-25</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H40437333"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Nearly all children and adolescents with bipolar disorder are treated with pharmacotherapy. However, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is indicated for severely and persistently ill patients who are refractory to many (eg, four to five) medication trials.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H40437339"><span class="h2">Pharmacotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pharmacotherapy is indicated for treatment of bipolar youth with [<a href="#rid1">1,26-29</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mania  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91106" href="/z/d/graphic/91106.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) or hypomania  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91107" href="/z/d/graphic/91107.html" rel="external">table 2</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Subsyndromal symptoms that do not meet diagnostic criteria for mania or hypomania, but nevertheless impair functioning; these syndromes are diagnosed as “other specified bipolar and related disorder”</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Comorbid attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder or anxiety disorders that impair functioning</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Moderate to severe major depression  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91398" href="/z/d/graphic/91398.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) (eg, substantial impairment, psychotic features, or suicidal ideation with a plan for self-harm)</p><p></p><p>Medications are also indicated for treatment of major depression of mild severity if psychotherapy is not available or effective.</p><p>Maintenance pharmacotherapy is indicated for children and adolescents with bipolar disorder who recover from acute mood episodes, because bipolar disorder is highly recurrent. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15924.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder: Clinical manifestations and course of illness", section on 'Course of illness'</a>.)</p><p>The goals of pharmacotherapy are to reduce mood symptoms and symptoms of comorbid disorders, and to improve the overall functioning of the child or adolescent. Optimally, the child or adolescent should return to their baseline “premorbid” position on the developmental trajectory, prior to the onset of mood symptoms. In many youth with bipolar disorder, it can be difficult to identify a premorbid baseline, in which case the goal is the best possible functioning achievable with the fewest adverse effects.</p><p>Practice guidelines from the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend judicious use of pharmacotherapy in treating pediatric bipolar disorder [<a href="#rid2">2,6</a>]. As an example, ongoing treatment with antipsychotics should be periodically re-evaluated (eg, every three months). In addition, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12873" href="/z/d/drug information/12873.html" rel="external">valproate</a> is avoided in females of childbearing age unless alternatives are not available and contraception is used, due to the risk of teratogenesis and developmental abnormalities.</p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of mania, hypomania, major depression, psychosis, and other specified bipolar and related disorder in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15924.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder: Clinical manifestations and course of illness", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83083.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder: Assessment and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H40437567"><span class="h2">Electroconvulsive therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The indications for ECT in bipolar disorder are similar for youth and adults. Indications include [<a href="#rid3">3,30,31</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Severe mood episodes, such as those with psychotic features, that do not respond to multiple (eg, five or more) trials of pharmacotherapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Catatonia that does not respond to pharmacotherapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute safety concerns that are caused by mood episodes and cannot be mitigated by environmental interventions or pharmacotherapy; safety concerns include recurrent suicide attempts, fluid and food refusal that compromises the patient’s health, and persistent, severe agitation or aggression.</p><p></p><p>ECT is used infrequently for adolescents and rarely for younger children.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3214833047"><span class="h1">TREATMENT SETTING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment of pediatric bipolar disorder can occur in outpatient or inpatient settings, as well as intermediate levels of care such as intensive outpatient programs and day treatment or partial hospital. The choice is based upon the resources that are available to ensure patient safety while maintaining the highest level of functioning within the family, at school or work, and socially. Indications for a higher level of care include more severe symptoms (eg, suicidal behaviors or psychotic features), risky or dangerous behaviors (eg, physical fights), comorbid psychopathology (eg, substance-related disorder or anxiety disorder), poorer psychosocial functioning (eg, truancy), problematic adherence to pharmacotherapy, and insufficient family support.</p><p>For outpatient treatment of bipolar disorder, specialized mood disorder clinics may be superior to general, standard psychiatric clinics, based upon a randomized trial in adults that found readmission to the hospital occurred in fewer patients who received specialized care [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H172388639"><span class="h1">CHOOSING TREATMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Choosing a specific medication regimen is discussed separately.

Parents/caregivers must be involved in assessments of clinical response. Although some children and adolescents have good insight into the nature of their symptoms, others do not, and lack of insight is a common feature of mania or hypomania. One four-week randomized trial (n = 296 patients) found that parent and clinician ratings of mania severity agreed with each other, whereas patient ratings were substantially lower than parent and clinician ratings [<a href="#rid59">59</a>].

Hospitalized patients are seen daily, and patients with suicidal ideation, a specific plan, and intent to kill themselves may require constant observation. Acutely ill outpatients are generally seen weekly or every other week, until they achieve substantial improvement in the number, intensity, and frequency of symptoms; at that point, outpatients are seen every two to four weeks until they remit.</p><p>Patients with bipolar disorder who remit can initially be seen every month.

A six-month study of administrative claims data found that among children and adolescents with bipolar depression (n &gt;5400), discontinuation of all pharmacotherapy occurred in 14 to 30 percent, depending upon the specific medication regimen prescribed [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].</p><p>Among adolescents with bipolar disorder, multiple factors are associated with poor adherence to treatment, including greater illness severity, denial of one’s illness, impaired family functioning, complex medication regimens, frequent (eg, three or four) daily doses, cognitive difficulties, and adverse effects [<a href="#rid7">7,62,63</a>]. Resistance to taking medication may also stem from difficulties accepting bipolar disorder as part of one’s identity (feeling different from peers), and concerns about fitting in with peer groups. Conversely, factors that are associated with good adherence include good family functioning, parents who believe the medical disorder is serious and that the treatment is effective, having close friends, an internal locus of control, and perceived empathy from one’s clinician [<a href="#rid63">63</a>].</p><p>Another factor involved in adherence is the youth’s developmental stage. Concrete thinking may prevent younger adolescents from understanding the consequences of not taking their medications [<a href="#rid63">63</a>].</p><p>Adherence in adolescents is typically assessed by initially asking open-ended questions (eg, “When do you take your pills” and “What do you dislike about the medicine”) [<a href="#rid63">63</a>]. This is followed by more direct questions about remembering to take the medication and asking patients to rate their own adherence using a Likert scale anchored at one end by never taking the medication and the other end by always taking the medication. We suggest asking patients about adherence without the parent/caregiver present, because patients may be more likely to disclose times when they received medication from the parent but did not take it. In discussions with adolescents about adherence to pharmacotherapy, clinicians should monitor their own responses for negative attitudes and judgmental evaluations.</p><p>Other means of assessing adherence include serum concentrations for relevant medications (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12559" href="/z/d/drug information/12559.html" rel="external">lithium</a>), pill counts, electronic monitoring of pill bottles or boxes, and checking prescription refills. Counting pills may yield higher estimates of adherence than serum concentrations. In a 20-week, prospective observational study of children and adolescents who were treated with lithium (n = 107), pill counts suggested that adherence to lithium was 100 percent [<a href="#rid60">60</a>]. By contrast, the proportion of serum concentrations greater than the minimal therapeutic level (&lt;0.6 mEq/L/0.6 mmol/L) was 66 percent. Other prospective studies suggest that subjective reports from patients, parents, and prescribing clinicians overestimate adherence [<a href="#rid62">62</a>].</p><p>Parents/caregivers must be involved in treatment to facilitate adherence to medication regimens [<a href="#rid2">2,3,7</a>]. School personnel may also need to assist patients taking their medication [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Use of weekly pillboxes can help everyone involved monitor whether doses are taken, while allowing trustworthy adolescents to take primary responsibility [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Parents/caregivers do not remind the adolescent about taking the medication unless the dose is still in the box after the dose time.</p><p>Other steps for enhancing adherence include informing the patient and family about potential adverse effects without creating negative expectations (nocebo effects), reducing the frequency of doses (eg, twice per day rather than three times per day), and preparing everyone involved for the possibility that multiple treatment trials may be necessary to optimize efficacy and adverse effects.</p><p>Adherence may also be improved by taking a flexible approach to accommodate patient preferences to the extent that they are feasible. One option when selecting a medication is to provide a list of comparable possibilities and allow patients to make the final choice. In addition, patients are more likely to adhere to treatment if they choose the drug formulation (eg, extended release pills, sublingual tablets, transdermal patches, and liquid) and timing of administration.</p><p>Different adjunctive psychotherapies administered for pediatric bipolar disorder often address medication adherence, and adjunctive motivational interviewing can be used to focus primarily upon adherence. As an example, one specialty clinic developed a three-session, motivational interviewing intervention that targeted adherence by educating patients about bipolar disorder and medications, eliciting thoughts and feelings about pharmacotherapy, assessing to what extent patients are ready to change their behavior regarding adherence, collaborating with patients to create an action plan for improving adherence, and evaluating the utility of the plan and need for modifications [<a href="#rid64">64</a>].

Nevertheless, the referring pediatrician is encouraged to remain involved in management. (See <a class="local">'Role of the pediatrician'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pretreatment evaluation </strong>–<strong> </strong>Prior to commencing pharmacotherapy for pediatric bipolar disorder, clinicians should evaluate patients to establish the diagnosis and identify target symptoms  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91106" href="/z/d/graphic/91106.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91107" href="/z/d/graphic/91107.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91398" href="/z/d/graphic/91398.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) and factors that can interfere with pharmacotherapy. However, some patients may present with severe symptoms that require clinicians to initiate pharmacotherapy after an expedited evaluation. (See <a class="local">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83083.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder: Assessment and diagnosis", section on 'Assessment'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment setting </strong>–<strong> </strong>Treatment of pediatric bipolar disorder can occur in outpatient or inpatient settings, and intermediate levels of care. Indications for a higher level of care include more severe symptoms, comorbid psychopathology, poorer psychosocial functioning, problematic adherence to pharmacotherapy, and insufficient family support. (See <a class="local">'Treatment setting'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pharmacotherapy</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Multiple medications are available to treat pediatric bipolar disorder. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15925.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder: Overview of choosing treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/99164.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar major depression: Choosing treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For most children and adolescents with bipolar disorder, we suggest initiating pharmacotherapy with monotherapy rather than medication combinations, to facilitate adherence, avoid drug-drug interactions, and minimize adverse effects and costs (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Monotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Medication combinations involving drugs from different classes are used in bipolar patients who respond incompletely to monotherapy, and patients with severe mood episodes, comorbidities, or side effects from an otherwise efficacious drug. (See <a class="local">'Medication combinations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Antidepressants and/or stimulants may possibly destabilize children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. (See <a class="local">'Potentially destabilizing drugs'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Medications are generally started at low doses and slowly titrated upward. Weight-adjusted doses are typically higher in youth than adults, to achieve the same serum concentrations and therapeutic benefits. (See <a class="local">'Dose'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Comprehensive treatment </strong>–<strong> </strong>Pediatric bipolar disorder is typically managed with multimodal treatment that includes pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. (See <a class="local">'Comprehensive treatment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring </strong>–<strong> </strong>Patient monitoring ’includes symptoms, adverse effects, adherence, and functioning, as well as blood pressure, pulse, weight, waist size, body mass index (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13478.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>), and metabolic laboratory tests. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adherence </strong>–<strong> </strong>Adherence to pharmacotherapy requires involvement of parents and may be enhanced by using weekly pillboxes, reducing the complexity of medication regimens and the frequency of doses, and informing patients and families about potential adverse effects without creating negative expectations. (See <a class="local">'Adherence'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute pharmacotherapy trials </strong>– An acute pharmacotherapy trial for pediatric mania generally lasts approximately four to eight weeks before determining whether the regimen is beneficial, and approximately eight weeks for bipolar major depression. (See <a class="local">'Duration of an adequate trial'</a> above.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">McClellan J, Kowatch R, Findling RL, Work Group on Quality Issues.
