         Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most successful orthopedic procedures performed today. For patients with hip pain due to a variety of conditions, THA can relieve pain, restore function, and improve quality of life. Sir John Charnley, a British orthopedic surgeon, developed the fundamental principles of the artificial hip and is credited as the father of THA. He designed a hip prosthesis in the mid- to late 1960s. Approximately 500,000 THAs are performed each year in the United States alone [
         <a href="#rid1">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The evaluation and management of patients undergoing THA, as well as the conduct of the procedure, are reviewed here. The complications of THA are presented in detail separately. (See

         Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is indicated for patients who have failed conservative or previous surgical treatment options for a deteriorated hip joint and who continue to have persistent, debilitating pain and a significant decrease in the activities of daily living. Patients with significant deformity and limitation of motion may also be candidates if the disability that results is considerable, even in the absence of pain. The decision to proceed with THA is made with an understanding of the potential benefits and risks. A thorough understanding of the procedure and the anticipated outcome is an important part of the decision-making process.
        </p>
        <p>
         The normal hip functions as a "ball-and-socket" joint. The femoral head (ball) articulates with the acetabulum (socket), allowing a smooth range of motion in multiple planes. Any condition that affects either of these structures can lead to deterioration of the joint. This, in turn, can lead to deformity, pain, and loss of function. The most common condition affecting the hip in this way is osteoarthritis. Other conditions that may affect the hip adversely include inflammatory arthritides (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, spondyloarthropathies), femoroacetabular impingement syndrome, developmental hip dysplasia, childhood hip disorders (eg, Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, slipped capital femoral epiphysis), trauma, neoplasms, and osteonecrosis.

         THA is typically an elective procedure. Thus, a conservative approach aimed at treating the underlying disease should be tried before THA. For patients with osteoarthritis, this usually includes nonoperative treatment measures, such as weight reduction, physical therapy, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), assistive devices (eg, a cane), and intraarticular glucocorticoid injections. For patients with inflammatory arthritis of the hip (eg, rheumatoid arthritis or spondyloarthropathy), THA is offered to address the symptoms of advanced structural disease and not those of the underlying inflammatory disorder, which is treated medically.
        </p>
        <p>
         In selected cases, the suitability of surgical procedures other than THA such as hemiarthroplasty, hip resurfacing, arthrodesis, and hip osteotomy may be discussed with the patient. (See

         A careful preoperative evaluation is essential to confirm hip pathology as the source of symptoms and disability and ensure the appropriateness of surgery, as well as to assist with surgical planning. General issues in preoperative medical consultation and management are presented elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4816.html" rel="external">

         Most patients with deterioration of the hip joint present with pain. This is typically localized to the anterior hip or groin. Pain may also be present in the posterior buttock and trochanteric region and can radiate to the thigh or knee. Pain typically occurs with activity but can also be present at rest. The pain is often exacerbated by weightbearing and may be worse with initial movement. Patients frequently describe "stiffness" or "tightness" of the hip, and loss of motion is often noted. Disruption of sleep and difficulty walking, putting on shoes and socks, going up and down stairs, or getting into and out of a car are common complaints. The patient may also need an assistive device (eg, cane).
        </p>
        <p>
         A thorough musculoskeletal examination should be performed in every candidate for total hip arthroplasty (THA). A more detailed description of hip anatomy, pain patterns, differential diagnosis, and physical examination of the hip, including special maneuvers, is available elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/252.html" rel="external">
          "Approach to the adult with unspecified hip pain"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Particular attention to the spine, pelvis, and knees is also essential to rule out radicular pathology, since hip pain may be the indirect result of radicular pathology, as well as other concomitant diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to surgery, the following evaluations of the lower extremities are essential:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Inspection – Gait, previous incisions, abnormal swelling of hip or limb, abrasions, discolorations, and cutaneous infections should be evaluated by inspection. Gait assessment should include an evaluation of any limp, use of assistive devices, and/or limb length discrepancy. The presence or absence of a Trendelenburg gait should be noted. Any evidence of a "minor" infection (eg, infected ingrown toenail) may require a delay in surgery until the infection has completely resolved.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Palpation – Anterior superior iliac spines, iliac crest, greater trochanter, posterior superior iliac spines, ischial tuberosity, and sacroiliac joint should be evaluated by palpation. Palpation can help rule out nonarticular causes of "hip pain." For example, lateral hip pain localized over the greater trochanter is usually not an indicator of hip joint pathology but may actually represent greater trochanteric bursitis or greater trochanteric pain syndrome (from inflammation or tendinopathy of the gluteus medius and minimus tendons). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7760.html" rel="external">

         Range of motion – Hip flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, and internal/external rotation should be recorded. Contractures should be noted. Limitation of motion often develops as hip pathology progresses. Joint surface incongruity, muscle spasms, soft tissue contracture, and/or mechanical block (eg, osteophytes or loose bodies) may all contribute to decreased motion.

         Muscle testing – Motor strength and tone of the hip flexors, extensors, abductors, and adductors should be evaluated and documented. In addition, muscle strength and tone of the distal limb should also be tested.

         Nerve and vascular status – Preoperatively, it is imperative to evaluate and document nerve and vascular status. Sciatic and peroneal nerve function testing, assessment of arterial pulses, and a sensory examination should be performed and documented for both limbs. In addition, venous insufficiency should be noted. Severe vascular disease should be evaluated by a vascular surgeon prior to proceeding with surgery.

         Leg length measurement – As part of preoperative planning, leg lengths must be evaluated. There are two types of leg length discrepancy:

         "Apparent" leg length discrepancy is the result of compensation in response to pathology or contracture rather than an actual difference in leg lengths (eg, presence of scoliosis or pelvic obliquity).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent3">
         <span class="glyph">
          -
         </span>
         True leg length discrepancy is the result of an anatomic or structural change in the lower limb (eg, tibia fracture). Typically, a deteriorated hip joint will cause a decrease in true leg length.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         To measure leg length, the patient should lie supine with the lower limbs in comparable positions with the legs slightly apart and parallel. A tape measure can be used to record the length between the anterior superior iliac spine and the medial malleolus for each limb. Another useful method of identifying a true leg length discrepancy is by using blocks of varying height. The patient is asked to stand, and blocks of varying height are placed under the shorter limb. When the iliac crests are at the same level, the block height represents a good approximation of the true leg length discrepancy.

         Trendelenburg sign – This test assesses the strength and function of the hip abductors. The sign is elicited by asking the patient to stand on the involved leg. Normally, the pelvis on the opposite side rises. However, if the pelvis on the opposite side drops, this test is positive. A positive test indicates that the hip abductors of the involved limb are weak or are relatively inhibited.

         The patient undergoing THA must be able to tolerate anesthesia, associated operative stress, and perioperative blood loss, as well as the rehabilitation process involved following THA. Since many patients who undergo THA are older, specific attention should be paid to the patient's comorbid medical problems and symptoms that may reflect underlying comorbidities that need to be considered prior to undergoing THA.

         Plain radiographs of the hip and pelvis confirm the diagnosis and help with preoperative planning for THA. Preoperative films should include a weightbearing anteroposterior (AP) pelvis, as well as AP and lateral views of the affected hip. Care should be taken to ensure that the entire proximal femur is visualized so that any deformity can be identified. In addition to plain radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be necessary to evaluate certain hip disorders such as osteonecrosis. If significant lumbar disease or history of lumbar spine surgery is noted, separate lumbar spine films may be obtained for further evaluation. Standing and sitting lateral films from the first lumbar vertebra to the pelvis may help in evaluation of the spine-pelvis-hip relationship. A discussion of imaging techniques and modalities for evaluation of hip pain is presented separately. (See

         </span>
         THA may be performed with general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or neuraxial anesthesia (ie, spinal, epidural, or combined spinal epidural). The choice of anesthetic technique is based on patient comorbidities and patient choice. General anesthesia is used for patients with contraindications to neuraxial anesthesia and for some patients with potential difficulty with airway management. In practice, many patients receive some elements of both types of anesthesia. During neuraxial anesthesia, most patients receive heavy sedation, and patients who receive general anesthesia for THA may also have epidural analgesia for postoperative pain control.
        </p>
        <p>
         Comparisons of general and neuraxial anesthesia for THA show some differences for some, but not all, outcomes. In one meta-analysis that includes patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty, length of hospital stay was reduced for those undergoing neuraxial anesthesia (weighted mean difference -0.4 days [-0.76 to -0.03]) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. However, there were no significant differences in mortality, chest infection, or thromboembolism. Blood loss and transfusion were not evaluated because of the low quality of studies.
        </p>
        <p>
         For uncomplicated primary THA, single injection spinal anesthesia is a commonly used technique. Epidural or combined spinal-epidural are used for procedures that are expected to last more than approximately two hours and if postoperative epidural analgesia is planned. Any plans for ongoing use of antithrombotic therapies (antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants) should be discussed with the surgeon before finalizing plans for regional anesthesia techniques, either used intraoperatively or postoperatively.

         All total hip arthroplasties (THAs) consist of a femoral component, an acetabular component, and a bearing surface. Most systems are modular with a separate femoral stem, femoral head, acetabular liner, and acetabular shell. This modularity gives the operating surgeon tremendous flexibility in dealing with any intraoperative situation or anatomic variation. There are a number of femoral and acetabular implants available for use in THA. The choices reflect different philosophies regarding the type of fixation, design features, and materials.
        </p>
        <p>
         Fixation of the prosthetic components to host bone can be achieved with one of two techniques. The more common approach in the United States achieves fixation without the use of cement and relies on bony ingrowth into or onto the porous implant surface that has been either "press-fit" or "interference-fit" into the surrounding bone. Alternatively, methylmethacrylate cement can be used to fix the femoral and/or acetabular component in patients with poor bone quality.
        </p>
        <p>
         Surgeons may select antibiotic-loaded cement in total hip arthroplasty (or hip hemiarthroplasty), either routinely or selectively in patients at high risk for infection. The optimal dosing and effectiveness have not been fully assessed. Commercially available antibiotic-loaded cement usually comes premixed with low-dose antibiotics (typically less than 1 gram per 40 gram batch of cement). Surgeons may choose to place higher doses of antibiotics within the cement (greater than commercially available) for high-risk patients, but this must be weighed against the potential that high-dose antibiotics can weaken the cement and predispose to failure. Moreover, in a randomized trial, high-dose dual antibiotic-loaded cement did not reduce the incidence of deep surgical site infection after hip hemiarthroplasty compared with single antibiotic-loaded cement [

         While there are many options for acetabular components in primary THA, the majority of acetabular components inserted today are cementless, porous, and modular. Typically, a hemispheric porous metal shell is inserted into the acetabulum, and a modular liner is then placed within the shell. The acetabular liner, typically made of highly crosslinked polyethylene, is designed to articulate with a highly polished femoral head (ball). The porous surface of the implant varies from manufacturer to manufacturer and may have a surface coating (such as hydroxyapatite) that promotes bony ingrowth or ongrowth. Many designs allow for the insertion of screws for supplementary fixation of the shell.
        </p>
        <p>
         The alternative to a cementless acetabular component is an acetabular component fixed to the acetabulum with cement. This type of acetabular implant has fallen out of favor in the United States due to studies showing a higher overall loosening rate than with uncemented implants. However, some surgeons advocate the use of an all-polyethylene cemented acetabular implant for older patients with poor bone quality [

          —
         </span>
         In the past, the standard bearing surface consisted of a metallic (cobalt-chromium) femoral head, which articulated with a smooth, high-density polyethylene acetabular liner. Due to osteolysis (bone loss and destruction) caused by wear and resultant particle debris, this combination is used less commonly. The most widely used combination is a ceramic femoral head with an acetabular liner made of highly crosslinked polyethylene. Laboratory results show superior wear performance of highly crosslinked polyethylene compared with conventional high-density polyethylene [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, clinical results have shown superior longevity of highly crosslinked polyethylene compared with conventional high-density polyethylene in vivo [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11-13
         </a>
         ]. Ceramic femoral heads avoid the risk of taper corrosion that can occur with a metal head on metal trunnion (mixed-metal taper junction).
        </p>
        <p>
         Other bearing surfaces used in the hip include ceramic-on-ceramic and metal-on-metal. While these have both demonstrated reduced wear as compared with standard metal-on-polyethylene, other potential complications have limited their widespread use. Ceramic-on-ceramic bearing surfaces have rarely shown catastrophic breakages as well as minor chips and cracks. With newer ceramic technology, this occurs much less frequently. Another complication of a ceramic-on-ceramic bearing surface is an audible squeak.
        </p>
        <p>
         Metal-on-metal bearing surfaces were introduced because they were thought to offer advantages over other materials, including less wear and lower risk of dislocation because of the ability to use larger head ball sizes. However, subsequent studies showed that metal-on-metal THA did not confer a clinical advantage over other bearing surfaces and resulted in higher rates of revision [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14-18
         </a>
         ]. The lack of evidence as a superior bearing surface along with adverse local tissue reactions have limited the use of metal-on-metal bearing surfaces in conventional THA. This is in contrast to metal-on-metal resurfacing procedures, where the results in select patient cohorts have been equal to or better than conventional THA in terms of implant survival, patient mortality, and function [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19-21
         </a>
         ]. However, adverse local tissue reactions have been described for metal-on-metal resurfacings as well. It should be noted that metal-on-metal bearing surfaces are contraindicated in patients with compromised kidney function as well as women of childbearing age due to unknown effects of metal ions on the unborn fetus. Complications from metal-on-metal wear is discussed separately. (See

         </span>
         Femoral components can be classified as either cementless or cemented. A cementless femoral component is the implant of choice for younger patients and any patient with good bone stock (particularly those with thick femoral cortices and with smaller diameter femoral canals). However, in older patients and those with osteoporosis, it may be more difficult to get good initial stability with a cementless component and there is a higher risk of periprosthetic femoral fracture. In addition, a larger (and necessarily stiffer) implant would be required. Therefore, a cemented implant is an appropriate choice in the older, low-demand patient with poor bone stock (thin cortices and larger canal diameter).
        </p>
        <p>
         Cementless implants are typically porous-coated to increase surface area for bone ingrowth. In addition, the roughened surface helps to achieve initial stability of the implant, which is critical for the long-term success of the implant. The porous coating may be limited to the proximal portion of the femoral implant or may extend over the entire length of the implant. This varies depending upon the philosophy of the design. Proximally porous coated implants rely on the metaphysis or metadiaphyseal junction for fixation and stability. Extensively porous-coated implants rely more on diaphyseal fixation. Cementless implant designs use a circumferential porous coating, which has been shown to help prevent access of wear particles from the articulating surface down along the implant-bone interface.
        </p>
        <p>
         The use of bone cement during arthroplasty can rarely cause bone cement implantation syndrome (BCIS), which is a poorly understood condition that can cause hypoxia and hypotension, and may result in cardiac arrest. Measures to prevent BCIS include pulse lavage of the femoral canal, slow introduction of the stem, providing a vent hole in the bone for long-stem component insertion, and minimal pressurization of cement.

         The femoral head in any THA must match the acetabular bearing surface. Almost all THAs performed today utilize a highly polished ceramic or cobalt chrome femoral head. Due to increased awareness and prevalence of trunnionosis (wear at the femoral head-neck interface), there has been a shift towards greater use of ceramic as the femoral head material of choice. Different diameters are available ranging from 22 mm up to 40 mm (or greater). The key considerations regarding head size are range of motion, stability, and propensity for wear. In general, increasing head size is correlated with increased range of motion and decreased dislocation rate but also with increased volumetric wear and generation of particle debris. Therefore, a compromise must be made. The introductions of more durable acetabular liners (eg, highly crosslinked polyethylene) and alternative bearing surfaces have led most surgeons towards the use of a larger head size than the prior standard of 28 mm typically used in primary THA. The larger prosthetic head allows for improved range of motion and decreased risk of dislocation.

         The posterolateral approach, also called the Kocher-Langenbeck approach, gains exposure to the hip through a posterior incision. The gluteus maximus muscle is split and the short external rotators are dissected off the posterior aspect of the hip. The joint is entered posteriorly through the capsule. The gluteus medius is left intact. This approach is usually performed with the patient in the lateral decubitus position. Variations of this approach preserve some or all of the short external rotators. A piriformis sparing approach accesses the hip joint below the piriformis tendon and a superior variation of the posterior approach accesses the hip above the short external rotators.

         Because the posterolateral approach disrupts the posterior soft tissue of the hip, it has historically been associated with having a higher rate of dislocation compared with the direct lateral approach. Additional information regarding the risk of dislocation is presented separately. (See

Typically, this approach is performed with the patient in the lateral position. However, the direct lateral approach may be performed with the patient supine or in a semilateral position. Once the THA is completed, the gluteus medius muscle insertion is repaired (by the tendon itself or with a portion of detached bone).

         The anterior approach, also called the Smith-Petersen or Hueter approach, gains exposure to the hip anteriorly without the need to detach any of the surrounding muscles. A space is created between the tensor fascia lata and the sartorius muscles. Access to the hip is provided through the anterior hip capsule. A variation of the anterior approach, the anterolateral approach (or Watson-Jones approach), accesses the hip through the space posterior to the tensor fascia lata. Anterior approaches are performed with the patient supine but can also be performed with the patient in a lateral position. A special operating table and the assistance of fluoroscopy are often used, but a regular operating table ("off-table") can also be used. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94593.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Complications associated with the anterior approach include intraoperative femoral fracture (due to a more challenging femoral exposure), ankle fracture (from positioning or traction issues when using a specialized operating table), and damage to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve or femoral nerve (as branches of this nerve sit very close to the surgical field). Because the muscles around the hip are not detached during the procedure, many surgeons who use the anterior approach tell their patients that dislocation precautions are not necessary. There appears to be a lower risk of dislocation with the direct anterior approach as compared with the posterior approach, but the direct lateral approach has the lowest dislocation rate [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. There is also some preliminary evidence that the anterior approach is associated with a more rapid early recovery [

          26,27
         </a>
         ]. However, speed of recovery depends upon many variables, and a good rapid recovery can be achieved with any of the approaches with the right anesthetic regimen, patient education, and postoperative assistance.

         As noted previously, a deteriorated hip joint may cause a decrease in leg length. In most patients, it is desired to achieve equal leg lengths postoperatively. Sometimes, however, surgeons may desire to lengthen a leg beyond the pre-arthritic length to improve stability of the hip. Tensioning the soft tissues around the hip (hip capsule and abductors) may help reduce the risk of dislocation. Ultimately, hip stability is more important than leg length discrepancy. Most surgeons would accept a small leg length inequality in exchange for a hip that is more stable and less likely to dislocate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Intraoperatively, there are many techniques to determine limb length. These range from special devices that measure from a fixed point on the pelvis to a simple comparison of intraoperative knee and heel positions. Intraoperative radiographs or fluoroscopy may also be very useful. Some method is required for measuring limb length, and redundancy is desirable.

         Many patients can be discharged home after surgery, but some may require a temporary inpatient rehabilitation or nursing facility stay. Mobilization and physical therapy are initiated as soon as possible to facilitate recovery of function and to help prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Rapid recovery protocols are becoming more widespread. Exercises to restore normal hip motion and strength and a gradual return to everyday activities are initiated in the hospital and continued upon discharge [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. This may involve 20 to 30 minutes of exercises two or three times daily during early recovery. Typically, weightbearing as tolerated is allowed, and an assistive device is used to help with balance and stability. Walking aids are weaned as strength, balance, and comfort improve. Depending on the surgical approach and surgeon's protocol, some patients may need to follow certain dislocation precautions. As an example, patients given posterior hip dislocation precautions may be asked to avoid low chairs, not to bend their hip beyond 90 degrees, and to avoid crossing their legs. Some surgeons may also recommend formal outpatient therapy, but this is often individualized based on the surgeon's preferences and the patient's needs [

High-impact activities such as manual labor, heavy lifting, and high-intensity sports (eg, running, jogging) should be avoided. Other activities such as yoga and Pilates may be allowed if care is taken to avoid extremes in range of motion to avoid dislocation. Long-term follow-up is recommended to evaluate for wear of the bearing surface or other implant-related issues.

         For patients at high risk of heterotopic ossification (HO), we suggest administering prophylactic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). External beam radiation (typically given as a single dose perioperatively) is a reasonable alternative for patients who cannot tolerate NSAIDs or for whom NSAIDs are contraindicated. However, the decision for which method of prophylaxis to use is typically surgeon dependent. Both methods have been shown to decrease the incidence of HO in high-risk patients. A previous history of HO is one of the strongest risk factors for HO after THA [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56

          Indomethacin

The efficacy for NSAIDs in reducing the incidence of postoperative HO is supported by randomized trials and meta-analyses [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58-61
         </a>
         ]. In one of the largest meta-analyses including both randomized trials and observational studies, both selective and nonselective NSAIDs decreased the risk of forming HO after THA when compared with placebo (odds ratio [OR] -1.35, CI -1.83 to -0.86 and OR -1.58, CI -2.41 to -0.75, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58

          62,63

          62

          "NSAIDs (including aspirin): Treatment and secondary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity"

         ). While indomethacin is relatively inexpensive and readily available, some patients are not able to tolerate the medication due to gastrointestinal side effects. Kidney issues (such as chronic renal insufficiency) may also make indomethacin a poor choice for prophylaxis. These patients may be more appropriate for external beam radiation.

         A retrospective analysis from the United Kingdom assessed mortality within 90 days of hip replacement from 2003 to 2011, and included 409,096 primary hip replacements for osteoarthritis [
         <a href="#rid91">
          91
         </a>
         ]. During the eight years of follow-up, there was a significant decrease in mortality from 0.56 to 0.29 percent, even after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidity.

        <p>
         A number of factors are associated with the risk of death after THA. As an example, mortality rates are higher in patients who have THA in the setting of hip fracture management when compared with those who have elective surgery for other indications [
         <a href="#rid92">
          92
         </a>
         ]. In addition, improved survival has been noted in patients administered spinal anesthesia as well as mechanical or chemical thromboprophylaxis [
         <a href="#rid91">
          91
         </a>
         ]. (See

         Complications following THA include those that may occur with any major surgery, such as those related to anesthesia, blood loss, or transfusion reactions. Complications that are specific to the hip arthroplasty procedure are discussed in detail separately. (See

         Total hip arthroplasty (THA), also known as total hip replacement, consists of resection of the diseased articular surfaces of the hip, followed by replacement with prosthetic hip components. For the properly selected patient, the procedure results in significant pain relief, as well as improved function and quality of life. In spite of the potential benefits of THA, it is typically an elective procedure and should only be considered after a thorough discussion of the risks, benefits, and alternatives. (See

          'Introduction'
         </a>

         The most common indication for THA is for the relief of pain associated with osteoarthritis of the hip in patients who have failed nonoperative treatments. Other conditions that cause pain and loss of function that may result in the need for THA include inflammatory arthritides (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, spondyloarthropathies), femoroacetabular impingement syndrome, developmental hip dysplasia, childhood hip disorders (eg, Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, slipped capital femoral epiphysis), trauma, neoplasms, and osteonecrosis.

         Active infection is perhaps the most significant contraindication to THA. Other contraindications include preexisting or significant medical problems (eg, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, heart failure, severe anemia), skeletal immaturity, quadriplegia, or permanent or irreversible muscle weakness in the absence of pain. Relative contraindications include paraplegia, inability to ambulate that is not related to the hip disorder per se, absence of hip abductor muscle function, progressive neurologic deficit, a neuropathic (Charcot) joint, and patents with severe obesity.

         A careful preoperative evaluation must be performed to confirm hip pathology as the source of symptoms and disability and ensure the appropriateness of surgery as well as to assist with surgical planning. The evaluation includes particular elements of the history, a physical examination, imaging and laboratory studies, a review of treatment alternatives, and discussions of the benefits and risks of the procedure.

         Prophylactic antibiotics are given preoperatively to reduce the risk for surgical site infection and prosthetic joint infection. Postoperative thromboprophylaxis should also be administered in patients undergoing THA. Prophylactic antibiotic regimens and the approach to thromboprophylaxis in adult orthopedic surgery are discussed in detail separately. (See

         THA can be performed with general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or neuraxial (ie, spinal, epidural, or combined spinal epidural) anesthesia. The choice of anesthetic technique is based on patient comorbidities and patient choice. (See

         Total hip prostheses consist of a femoral component, an acetabular component, and a bearing surface. There are a number of femoral and acetabular implants available for use. The choices reflect different philosophies regarding the type of fixation, design features, and materials. (See

         Postoperative care includes pain management and venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis, as well as appropriate physical therapy to achieve the best possible hip motion and return to full function as quickly and safely as possible. (See

         For patients at high risk of heterotopic ossification (HO), we suggest administering prophylactic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). External beam radiation is a reasonable alternative for patients who cannot tolerate NSAIDs or for whom NSAIDs are contraindicated.
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8559" href="/z/d/drug information/8559.html" rel="external">
          Indomethacin
         </a>
         is the most commonly used NSAID for HO prophylaxis, although other NSAIDs are also effective. The usual dose of indomethacin is 75 to 100 mg/day and should be continued for 7 to 14 days postoperatively. Measures aimed at preventing HO should be administered before the fifth postoperative day, optimally within 24 to 48 hours. (See

         THA typically results in excellent clinical and functional outcomes. Mortality following THA is overall low, with estimates citing a 30- or 90-day mortality of less than 1 percent, and is primarily related to preexisting medical comorbidities. (See
