         The initial evaluation of critically ill children must quickly identify those with respiratory or circulatory compromise. Early recognition and treatment of a patient with deficiencies in oxygenation, ventilation, or perfusion frequently prevents deterioration to respiratory or cardiac arrest. Outcomes for children who develop cardiopulmonary arrest are poor [

         This topic will review the clinical features that rapidly identify children with respiratory failure or circulatory compromise. Priorities for initial stabilization are presented.

         Most children with respiratory or cardiovascular compromise can be easily recognized during a rapid initial assessment. Obvious examples include children with respiratory conditions such as severe asthma exacerbations, or inadequate perfusion, such as hypovolemic shock. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6387.html" rel="external">
          "Assessment of systemic perfusion in children"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Children with subtle features of physiologic compromise can also be identified with a systematic evaluation of key clinical findings. Frequent reevaluation and close monitoring are essential to quickly recognize those whose conditions are deteriorating.
        </p>
        <p>
         Throughout the evaluation, interventions to provide oxygen, support ventilation, and improve perfusion should be promptly administered as indicated. A detailed physical examination and ancillary studies, such as pulse oximetry and end-tidal CO

         The pediatric assessment triangle (PAT) is a rapid assessment that relies on three observations to quickly identify a child with respiratory or circulatory compromise, or both, who requires immediate supportive care and has shown high reliability when used in pre-hospital and hospital settings [

        <p>
         In addition to recognizing children who require stabilization with respiratory or cardiovascular interventions, the PAT also identifies most children with a serious illness who should receive prompt evaluation. A child in respiratory failure may have abnormal work of breathing with either abnormal appearance or circulation, while a patient with abnormalities in all three of the components of the PAT is likely in impending cardiopulmonary arrest. In comparison, an infant with an abnormal appearance alone may be physiologically stable but have a life-threatening infection, such as meningitis.

         Young children in an unfamiliar environment can be agitated, crying, or resist examination. Such patients must be distinguished from children who are restless or anxious as the result of hypoxia, or somnolent from hypercarbia, severe hypoxia, or shock. The following characteristics of a child's appearance (the "TICLS" mnemonic) help the clinician distinguish between a developmentally appropriate response and signs of serious illness [

         <strong>
          Tone
         </strong>
         – What is the infant's muscle tone? Vigorous movement and normal muscle tone are reassuring. In comparison, children who are seriously ill may have decreased muscle tone or appear limp and weak.

         </strong>
         – Is the child playful and interactive, or indifferent to distractions in the environment? A child who will reach for a toy or exhibit developmentally appropriate stranger anxiety is less worrisome than one who does not respond to a caregiver or appropriately resist examination.

          6-8
         </a>
         ]? Similar to decreased muscle tone, a weak cry is an important indication of serious illness. In addition, a hoarse or muffled voice suggests upper airway obstruction.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         A child who is alert, easily consolable when crying, has good muscle tone, and responds to a caregiver is unlikely to be critically ill. On the other hand, the clinician should be very concerned about an infant who is limp, not interactive, listless, and has a weak cry.

         </span>
         Children with deficiencies in oxygenation and/or ventilation may have some evidence of respiratory compromise, as indicated by increased work of breathing. Decreased work of breathing may be noted as the patient becomes fatigued and progresses toward respiratory failure and respiratory arrest.
        </p>
        <p>
         Assessment of airway sounds, the child's position of comfort, and use of accessory muscles provides information regarding the patient's work of breathing.

         <strong>
          Airway sounds
         </strong>
         – Abnormal airway sounds that can be heard without a stethoscope are often an indication of respiratory distress. These include stridor, snoring, grunting, and wheezing.

         <strong>
          Positioning
         </strong>
         – To maximize airway opening when there is obstruction, a child may assume the "sniffing position" (neck flexed, head mildly extended) to align the airway axes and improve airflow. For older children, the tripod position, in which the child is sitting up and leaning forward on outstretched hands, may be preferred.

         <strong>
          Accessory muscle use
         </strong>
         – Patients with inadequate oxygenation or ventilation often use accessory muscles (such as supraclavicular, intercostal, and/or substernal groups) to increase tidal volume, thereby improving minute ventilation. Retractions result from the use of accessory muscles. They can be supraclavicular, intercostal, and/or substernal. Severe retractions of more than one muscle group indicate significant hypoxia.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Head bobbing (extension of the head on inhalation and forward movement on exhalation) and nasal flaring (opening of the nostrils to allow the passage of more air) are additional indicators of accessory muscle use and respiratory distress [

        <p>
         A child who has abnormal breathing sounds, is in a position to maximize airflow, and is using accessory muscles is in respiratory distress.

         Pallor or cyanosis is a worrisome finding that may indicate hypoxemia or inadequate perfusion to the skin. Poor capillary refill or cool skin also occurs with poor perfusion. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6387.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         However, cool environmental temperatures can cause peripheral vasoconstriction in healthy young infants, resulting in a mottled appearance to the skin in an infant who has normal circulation. Similarly, acrocyanosis (as the result of vasomotor instability) may be a normal finding in infants less than two months of age [

         Following the rapid initial assessment (PAT) and initiation of appropriate supportive care, a thorough physical examination should be performed. This information may identify the underlying condition and guide specific treatment. In addition, it establishes a baseline from which changes in the child's condition can be recognized and supportive care and specific treatment modified. As an example, the condition of a child who was initially in severe respiratory distress with an anxious appearance and now has decreased work of breathing and lethargy has deteriorated from respiratory distress to respiratory failure. The patient may now require assisted ventilation, as well as supplemental oxygen.
        </p>
        <p>
         Vital signs should be obtained, particularly respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, and pulse oximetry. Weight in kilograms should also be recorded whenever possible.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         An accurate weight may not be available for a child who requires weight-based interventions such as medications and fluid resuscitation. Health care provider weight estimates can be inaccurate [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. While parent or primary caregiver estimation is most accurate (within 10 percent of actual body weight approximately 80 percent of the time), they frequently are
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         available during pediatric resuscitation.
        </p>
        <p>
         When parent/primary caregiver estimation is not available, we recommend the use of length-based measurements (eg, Broselow, Handtevy, PAWPER, or Mercy tapes) rather than age-based methods. In a systematic review of 80 studies, the Broselow tape provided a weight estimate within 10 percent of actual weight 54 percent of the time while the Mercy tape was accurate in 70 to 77 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. By contrast, in a retrospective evaluation of age-based formulas in over 1000 children from South Africa, weight predicted by age-based formulas had critical errors (&gt;20 percent difference from actual weight) 25 to 70 percent of the time, depending upon the specific formula used [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         These methods may underestimate the child's actual weight, especially for those over 25 kg living in resource-rich regions [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11-17
         </a>
         ]. By contrast, among children in resource-limited settings, length-based methods may significantly overestimate weigh [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. The PAWPER tape, which uses WHO weight-for-length data has body habitus adjustments for very thin to obese children, and has performed well [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. In a separate study, habitus adjustment of length-based formulas improved accuracy by 40 percent [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Regardless, because most resuscitation drugs have a volume of distribution associated with lean weight, length-based methods provide reasonable estimates when weights cannot be measured [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9

         If neither parent/primary caregiver estimation nor length-based methods are available, age-based methods can be used but will often be highly inaccurate [

         – Level of consciousness provides an important indication of brain perfusion. It can be quickly categorized using the AVPU scale, where A is alert, V responds to verbal commands, P responds to painful stimuli, and U is unresponsive. Abnormal mental status may result from a non-neurologic cause (such as hypoxia or hypovolemic shock) or from a primary neurologic disorder. Focal findings consistent with a neurologic process include abnormalities in pupillary light response, extraocular movements, or motor activity.

         Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive technique in which a sensor is placed on the skin (usually a digit or ear lobe). The sensor then measures the absorption of light by oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin to determine the percent of hemoglobin that is saturated with oxygen. The spectrophotometric principles of pulse oximetry are discussed elsewhere. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Pulse oximetry should be monitored continuously for measurements at or below 94 percent. Within the range of PaO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         that represents clinically significant hypoxemia, small changes in the level of saturated hemoglobin reflect much larger decreases in PaO

         <sub>

        </p>
        <p>
         Technical difficulties such as improper placement of the sensor or motion can create artifacts that make the oximeter reading unreliable. In addition, low perfusion states, the presence of abnormal hemoglobin (such as carboxyhemoglobin or methemoglobin), and anemia can also result in inaccurate pulse oximetry readings. (See

A nonrebreather mask with reservoir is required to deliver higher concentrations. (See

         Parent/primary caregiver estimation of weight is most accurate when an actual weight is not available. When this estimation is not available, we recommend the use of length-based measurements (eg, Broselow, PAWPER, or Mercy tapes) rather than age-based methods. (See
