(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8031.html" rel="external">"Virology of human papillomavirus infections and the link to cancer"</a>.)</p><p>While traditional, environmentally related OPSCC rates have declined, there has been a dramatic rise in OPSCC related to high-risk types of HPV. Patients with locoregionally confined HPV associated OPSCC typically have highly curable cancers and a better prognosis than those with non-HPV associated OPSCC.</p><p>The treatment approach to HPV related OPSCC will be reviewed here. Details on the epidemiology, staging, and clinical presentation of HPV related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, as well as the treatment of non-HPV associated oropharyngeal head and neck cancer are discussed separately. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3390.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and risk factors for head and neck cancer", section on 'Human papillomavirus'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3378.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, staging, and clinical presentation of human papillomavirus associated head and neck cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3399.html" rel="external">"Treatment of early (stage I and II) head and neck cancer: The oropharynx"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3385.html" rel="external">"Overview of the treatment of locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer: The oropharynx"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3171665156"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical presentation of HPV associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is distinct from non-HPV associated OPSCC  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef129474" href="/d/graphic/129474.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). These features are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3378.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, staging, and clinical presentation of human papillomavirus associated head and neck cancer", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H245848328"><span class="h1">STAGING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The eighth edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging systems  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110640" href="/d/graphic/110640.html" rel="external">table 2A</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110641" href="/d/graphic/110641.html" rel="external">table 2B</a>) were modified from the previous seventh edition to address the improved outcomes of HPV related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) relative to those with non-HPV associated disease [<a href="#rid1">1-8</a>]. The most notable changes to the staging system are the reassignments of the cervical nodal metastasis groupings [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>This was the direct result of data which demonstrated improved outcomes in this disease relative to its non-HPV related counterpart, and the fact that the prior AJCC staging system was inadequate to properly stratify this population [<a href="#rid2">2-5,10</a>]. The revised eighth edition staging system appears to offer superior discrimination when compared with the previous staging system [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. Despite the improvements in the staging system, additional data are required to validate and refine this new system, and results of clinical trials designed and stratified according to the revised staging will provide insights into the system's performance [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. For example, smoking imparts a negative effect on outcome in HPV associated OPSCC but is not incorporated into the staging system. Most clinical trials, in particular those evaluating treatment deintensification, exclude or stratify by patients who smoke.</p><p>The purpose of the AJCC eighth edition stage group is to provide prognostic value and not necessarily to guide treatment decision making. Rather, treatment decisions should continue to employ the AJCC seventh edition staging system and match the staging criteria which determined eligibility for enrollment into the trials which established each relevant standard of care. As an example, some patients classified as stage I in the eighth edition of the AJCC staging system would have been stage III or IVA in the seventh edition of the AJCC staging system and therefore included in the pivotal trials of chemoradiation. While stage I HPV mediated oropharynx cancer has an excellent prognosis as described in the eighth edition of the AJCC staging manual, the existing evidence supports multimodality treatment for a subset of these patients.</p><p>Our treatment approach is generally consistent with the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Provisional Clinical Opinion on the Role of Treatment Deintensification in the Management of p16+ Oropharyngeal Cancer [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3399.html" rel="external">"Treatment of early (stage I and II) head and neck cancer: The oropharynx", section on 'General principles'</a> and <a class="local">'Is there a role for treatment deintensification?'</a> below.)</p><p>Further details on the staging system for HPV associated head and neck cancer are discussed separately.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1188555672"><span class="h1">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pretreatment evaluation of patients with HPV associated head and neck cancer is similar to that of non-HPV associated cancers, and should include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nutrition consultation</strong> – Patients with HPV related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) who are underweight prior to therapy have worse overall survival (OS) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Therefore, patients should be evaluated by a nutritionist to ensure appropriate nutritional intake during and after therapy. The evaluation should include intake of oral nutrition, use of liquid nutritional supplements, and consideration of enteral nutrition (eg, tube feeds) with placement of a gastrostomy tube only when indicated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2830.html" rel="external">"The role of parenteral and enteral/oral nutritional support in patients with cancer", section on 'Head and neck cancer'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation for intravenous (IV) access and gastrostomy tube placement</strong> – We evaluate all patients for IV access and potential placement of a subcutaneous port (depending upon the expected treatment received) and their need for gastrostomy tube. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88861.html" rel="external">"Gastrostomy tubes: Placement and routine care"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8194.html" rel="external">"Central venous access in adults: General principles", section on 'Subcutaneous ports'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dental evaluation</strong> – Patients undergoing surgery or radiation should receive a complete dental evaluation. All dental procedures (eg, tooth extractions, root canals) should be completed prior to initiation of therapy, when feasible. Changes to the teeth and jaw from these procedures may affect treatment planning. Additionally, poor dental health may lead to long-term complications after therapy is completed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89977.html" rel="external">"Overview of approach to long-term survivors of head and neck cancer", section on 'Dental complications and oral health'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Speech and swallowing evaluation</strong> – Many patients have baseline tumor-related dysphagia, and a significant number develop treatment-related dysphagia. Early identification of dysphagia and early intervention with swallowing therapy may minimize the risk of muscle atrophy, aspiration pneumonia, and malnutrition. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3368.html" rel="external">"Speech and swallowing rehabilitation of the patient with head and neck cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pain management and supportive care</strong> – Patients may have pain related to their tumor or cervical lymphadenopathy; others develop treatment-related symptoms that require pain management and extensive supportive care. Early consultation with pain management and/or other supportive care teams is encouraged. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3408.html" rel="external">"Management and prevention of complications during initial treatment of head and neck cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2036157712"><span class="h1">INITIAL TREATMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The treatment of HPV related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) may include surgery, radiation therapy (RT), and chemotherapy, either as single modalities or in combination. In particular, nonsmoking patients with early-stage HPV associated OPSCC are highly curable with these treatment modalities. </p><p>Treatment for patients with HPV associated OPSCC is similar to those with HPV negative OPSCC, except in the context of a clinical trial. Although testing for HPV association provides prognostic information, there are insufficient phase III data to alter therapy based on HPV status [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Given the excellent long-term prognoses of these patients, the approach to treatment must take into consideration oropharyngeal function preservation, the potential for late treatment-related toxicities, and avoidance of unnecessary intensification of therapy, if possible. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3365.html" rel="external">"Management of late complications of head and neck cancer and its treatment"</a>.)</p><p>Improved surgical techniques, often utilizing transoral approaches, are an important option for selected patients with locoregional disease. Surgery can potentially lead to decreased use of adjuvant RT or chemoradiation, based on pathologic features, although this approach remains under investigation in deintensification trials. The potential complications of surgery should be weighed against a potential decrease in adjuvant therapy. (See <a class="local">'Is there a role for treatment deintensification?'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3385.html" rel="external">"Overview of the treatment of locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer: The oropharynx", section on 'Surgery'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2313444476"><span class="h2">T1-T2, node negative</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3078000104"><span class="h3">Selection of therapy: Surgery versus radiation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with HPV associated early-stage, node-negative (eg T1-T2, N0) disease, we offer initial treatment with either minimally invasive surgery or RT  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef129299" href="/d/graphic/129299.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). This approach is similar to that of patients with non-HPV associated OPSCC. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3399.html" rel="external">"Treatment of early (stage I and II) head and neck cancer: The oropharynx"</a>.)</p><p>It is uncommon for patients with HPV associated disease to present with early-stage, node-negative tumors, as most present with nodal involvement  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef129474" href="/d/graphic/129474.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Therefore, data are limited for the optimal treatment approach in this patient subgroup, and clinical trials are ongoing. (See <a class="local">'Is there a role for treatment deintensification?'</a> below.)</p><p>The choice of therapy should be based on a clinical risk-benefit discussion in a multidisciplinary setting and take into account functional outcomes and potential toxicities of each treatment modality, as well as patient comorbidities and preferences for therapy.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Surgery</strong> – Surgery alone is appropriate when the primary tumor appears amenable to margin-negative resection and good functional outcomes (ie, well-lateralized T1-T2 disease without significant soft palate involvement). As an example, patients with tonsillar cancers (which are lateralized by definition) who meet these criteria may be more appropriate surgical candidates than those with a base of tongue cancer (which is typically located more centrally in the oropharynx).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For patients who choose surgery, we suggest minimally invasive transoral surgery rather than more invasive surgical techniques (eg, transmandibular or transcervical open surgery). These patients also should undergo elective neck dissection. Some patients may prefer surgery over other treatment approaches such as RT, as resection offers both immediate diagnosis and treatment. However, not all patients are candidates for surgery due to anatomic considerations or comorbidities. Patients should take into account potential surgical risks and complications, (eg, anesthesia, bleeding, operative morbidity, potential for functional impairment). A thorough evaluation by an experienced, high-volume surgeon is needed to assess these possibilities, as surgical outcomes are superior with such surgeons. As well, careful radiographic evaluation is warranted, as pathologic findings often indicate the need for postoperative radiation or chemoradiation, with the attendant risks of multimodality therapy. (See <a class="local">'Surgical technique'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">One randomized trial (ECOG-ACRIN 3311) suggested excellent survival outcomes in patients with no nodal involvement (or one node without extranodal extension) treated with transoral robotic surgery (TORS) alone [<a href="#rid14">14</a>], further confirming the efficacy of surgery as a single modality in patients with HPV-associated, early-stage, node-negative disease. In this study, the subset of patients with HPV associated OPSCC treated with TORS followed by observation demonstrated excellent survival outcomes. Further details for this trial in the context of treatment deintensification are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Dose-reduced adjuvant radiation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, only a minority of patients enrolled in this trial received surgery as a single modality, despite a deintensification strategy that withheld postoperative radiation for patients with a single node or initially positive margins. While carefully selected patients treated with initial primary surgery may potentially avoid the use of additional postoperative RT or chemoradiation, others may require such additional therapy. This raises the possibility that initial surgery will sometimes lead to treatment intensification and greater morbidity, and clinicians offering surgery should discuss this possibility with patients. (See <a class="local">'Adjuvant RT with or without chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Radiation therapy (RT)</strong> – Another appropriate option is RT alone. RT is delivered to both the primary tumor and to cervical lymph nodes. RT is the preferred option for patients who are ineligible for or who wish to avoid the potential complications of surgery, or in situations where expertise in transoral resection is not available.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Radiation is often given with elective treatment of the bilateral neck. However, unilateral RT should be offered to patients with well-lateralized primary tonsillar cancers that do not invade &gt;1 cm beyond the mucosa of soft palate or tongue base and do not extend to the posterior pharyngeal wall. Successful completion of an RT course requires adherence to a daily treatment schedule; furthermore, radiation carries risks of short- and long-term toxicities, which must be taken into account. (See <a class="local">'Radiation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2771573498"><span class="h3">Surgical technique</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with well-lateralized T1-T2 disease with no clinical or radiographic evidence of multiple or bilateral nodes or extranodal extension that appears amenable to margin-negative resection, we suggest minimally invasive transoral surgery rather than more invasive surgical techniques (eg, transmandibular or transcervical open surgery).</p><p>Two minimally invasive techniques, transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and transoral laser microsurgery (TLM), are equally effective and well tolerated [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. For patients who are not eligible for these minimally invasive approaches, we avoid the use of more aggressive surgical approaches (eg, transmandibular or transcervical open surgery), as these patients can be treated effectively using RT with or without chemotherapy with superior functional outcomes and high cure rates. The functional outcome of minimally invasive surgical techniques, on the other hand, can be very similar to RT. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3399.html" rel="external">"Treatment of early (stage I and II) head and neck cancer: The oropharynx", section on 'General principles'</a>.)</p><p>Patients treated with resection of the primary tumor should also receive selective neck dissection, as those with a clinically negative neck are still at risk of occult metastases [<a href="#rid16">16-19</a>]. The laterality of the neck dissection and the treated lymph node levels are dependent upon the location of the primary tumor. This approach is discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3399.html" rel="external">"Treatment of early (stage I and II) head and neck cancer: The oropharynx", section on 'Management of the neck'</a>.) </p><p>A majority of patients treated with initial primary surgery will require additional postoperative RT or chemoradiation, either due to unexpected pathologic upstaging or uncertainty about the completeness of the resection. The likelihood of needing this type of adjuvant therapy is important to take into account during presurgical planning, as patients who receive postoperative chemoradiation will undergo treatment "intensification" by receiving three major modalities of treatment. These patients are at risk for more significant swallowing impairment, unless they are receiving de-escalated RT or more limited fields. (See <a class="local">'Adjuvant RT with or without chemotherapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Is there a role for treatment deintensification?'</a> below.)</p><p>Short-term risks (eg, those associated with anesthesia, tumor resection, and elective neck dissection) and long-term toxicities (eg, swallowing difficulties) of surgery are discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94228.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for head and neck surgery"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3368.html" rel="external">"Speech and swallowing rehabilitation of the patient with head and neck cancer", section on 'Postsurgical complications'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H570929312"><span class="h3">Radiation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>RT monotherapy is an effective treatment strategy for patients with limited disease burden (eg T1-T2, N0 disease) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Treatment with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is well tolerated with good functional outcomes. In addition to treatment of the primary tumor, patients with a clinically negative neck should also receive elective neck irradiation to address potential microscopic disease. This approach is discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3399.html" rel="external">"Treatment of early (stage I and II) head and neck cancer: The oropharynx", section on 'Radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Unilateral RT may be an appropriate strategy in patients with well-lateralized tonsillar tumors that do not invade &gt;1 cm beyond the mucosa of the soft palate or tongue base and do not extend to the posterior pharyngeal wall [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>Limitations to RT includes logistical issues (eg, adherence to a daily treatment schedule for up to six or seven weeks; supportive care for significant, severe short-term toxicities) and the potential for long-term toxicities associated with RT.
