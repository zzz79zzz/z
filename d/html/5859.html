Although abdominal pain is often associated with functional constipation, it is not among the diagnostic criteria.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6003059"><span class="h2">Functional fecal incontinence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Functional fecal incontinence is the involuntary passage of stool in the underwear after the acquisition of toileting skills, in the absence of overt neuromuscular anorectal dysfunction.

The diagnostic criteria for nonretentive functional fecal incontinence are [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]:</p><p>At least a one-month history of the following symptoms in a child with a developmental age older than four years:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Defecation in locations inappropriate to the social context</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>No evidence of fecal retention</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>After appropriate medical evaluation, the fecal incontinence cannot be explained by another medical condition</p><p></p><p>In these children, the physical examination is normal and excessive stool is absent on rectal or radiologic examinations.

Conversely, fecal incontinence is a common symptom of constipation. In a study of 418 constipated children, 68 percent of boys and 52 percent of girls presented with fecal incontinence [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Functional constipation and associated fecal incontinence is particularly common among children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>] and autism spectrum disorder [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], as well as those with anxiety and depressive symptoms. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99538.html" rel="external">"Functional constipation in infants, children, and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nonretentive</strong> – Approximately 20 percent of children with fecal incontinence have nonretentive fecal incontinence (ie, do not have underlying constipation) [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>]. This proportion varies among studies depending on the population and diagnostic criteria; in one study involving nearly 500 children with fecal incontinence, only 5 percent met criteria for the nonretentive form [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The disorder is approximately four times more common in boys than girls [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Retentive</strong> – Functional constipation is associated with several types of environmental triggers. In particular, there are three periods in which the developing child is particularly prone to develop constipation [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The first occurs after the introduction of cereals and solid food into the infant's diet, the second with toilet training, and the third during the start of school. Other common triggers are psychosocial stressors such as separation from parents or schedule changes. Any of these triggers can lead to a painful, frightening, or otherwise distressing experience associated with defecation. Because the child wishes to minimize this experience, they attempt to avoid evacuation ("stool withholding"), which further contributes to the constipation. The pathophysiology of functional constipation is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99538.html" rel="external">"Functional constipation in infants, children, and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Contributing factors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The triggers and pathophysiology that cause functional constipation are also associated with the development of retentive fecal incontinence. It is not clear why fecal incontinence develops in some children with constipation and not in others. Among children with constipation, there are no clear differences in pathophysiology or psychology between those with and without fecal incontinence. In both groups, constipation in children is frequently triggered by dietary changes, psychosocial stressors such as separation or schedule changes, and/or behavioral adaptations such as stool withholding.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nonretentive</strong> – The causes of nonretentive fecal incontinence remain unclear [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. As for functional constipation, there is some association with psychological and behavioral symptoms, including attention problems and anxiety and mood disorders. In a large study, behavioral problems were somewhat more common in children with nonretentive fecal incontinence compared with those with retentive fecal incontinence (59 versus 49 percent) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Fecal incontinence episodes are generally linked to certain persons or situations (eg, visits to a divorced parent), suggesting that there are specific triggers for the acute soiling episodes [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. However, up to 40 percent of children have never been toilet trained properly, suggesting a longstanding underlying physical or environmental cause [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. It is unclear whether the associated psychosocial problems are a cause or consequence of the incontinence. Nonretentive fecal incontinence appears to be somewhat more common in children with a history of sexual abuse compared with the general population and has also been reported in children referred for psychiatric problems [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. However, although some cases of fecal incontinence are associated with emotional stress, the isolated symptom of fecal incontinence does not appear to be a marker for sexual abuse.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Nonretentive fecal incontinence also can result from surgical resection of the rectosigmoid colon, eg, in children following pull-through surgery for Hirschsprung disease [<a href="#rid16">16</a>] or following surgery for imperforate anus, especially in patients who have suboptimal anal sphincter pressure. Proctitis may cause urgency and fecal incontinence and can usually be distinguished by its acute or subacute onset and associated rectal bleeding. Proctitis in children usually results from inflammatory bowel disease but may also be due to cow's milk protein intolerance, infection, or radiation injury.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children with fecal incontinence most commonly present with repeated soiling of their underwear. Some parents may mistake this type of soiling for diarrhea [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The child frequently denies both the visible and olfactory signs of soiling of their underwear. The child may appear oblivious or nonchalant about the problem, even though it may be a source of considerable embarrassment and confusion for the child, frustration for the parents, and a cause of social stigmatization among peers. In some cases, the episodes appear to be triggered by emotional stress; this is somewhat more likely in the nonretentive form of fecal incontinence. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99538.html" rel="external">"Functional constipation in infants, children, and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Contributing factors'</a>.)</p><p>Other symptoms may coexist with fecal incontinence. In one series, more than one-half of children had abdominal pain ranging in quality from vague chronic discomfort to severe attacks several days before a large bowel movement or even daily [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. If the abdominal pain persists after the child begins to pass soft, regular bowel movements with laxatives, the possibility of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome should be considered. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/111.html" rel="external">"Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Approach to the evaluation"</a>.)</p><p>Among children with nonretentive fecal incontinence, 15 to 50 percent have concurrent daytime and/or nighttime urinary incontinence [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>]. Some experts consider concurrent fecal and urine incontinence in otherwise healthy children without signs of fecal retention as a combined bowel and urine elimination dysfunction disorder [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. An underlying behavioral or neurodevelopmental disorder is thought to be the cause. Urinary incontinence is also reported in up to 45 percent of children with functional constipation, with or without fecal incontinence [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5906.html" rel="external">"Constipation in infants and children: Evaluation", section on 'Constipation and bladder dysfunction'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6580.html" rel="external">"Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children", section on 'Bowel and bladder dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial evaluation of a child presenting with fecal incontinence is similar to that of a child presenting with constipation and is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5906.html" rel="external">"Constipation in infants and children: Evaluation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H352691082"><span class="h2">Goals</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the child with fecal incontinence, the evaluation has three goals:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Exclude underlying organic or anatomic disease as a cause of the incontinence</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Determine whether the child has underlying constipation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assess for psychosocial precipitants that may contribute to the underlying constipation or to nonretentive fecal incontinence</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">History</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Exclude organic causes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The history should evaluate for organic disorders that may be associated with the incontinence by causing underlying constipation, interfering with regular toileting habits, or affecting sphincter control  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94998" href="/d/graphic/94998.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. These are responsible for a small minority of cases of fecal incontinence (approximately 5 percent) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>] and include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Static neurologic disorders (cerebral palsy, hypotonia, or intellectual disability).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Congenital anterior displacement of the anus (ectopic anus). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99538.html" rel="external">"Functional constipation in infants, children, and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Anorectal anomalies'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Progressive neurologic disease, such as tethered cord or other manifestations of spinal cord dysraphism. These disorders are rare causes of fecal incontinence but should be considered in patients with refractory constipation. There may be associated muscle weakness or back pain, but some children have no other neurologic symptoms [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/93935.html" rel="external">"Closed spinal dysraphism: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hirschsprung disease is occasionally first identified in children presenting with chronic constipation if it is a short-segment form and is not diagnosed at birth but is unlikely in a child with fecal incontinence. A subset of children who have undergone pull-through surgery for Hirschsprung disease develop fecal incontinence due to resection of the rectosigmoid colon, which is the storage region for stool. In these patients, high-amplitude colon contractions can propagate right up to the anal verge and the frequency of high-amplitude colon contractions can also be increased [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. These patients tend to present with history of passing multiple soft and painless bowel movements every day and can have associated urgency. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5903.html" rel="external">"Congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease)", section on 'Postoperative outcomes and management'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Organic causes of constipation are discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99538.html" rel="external">"Functional constipation in infants, children, and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Evidence of constipation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is critical to distinguish between children in whom the fecal incontinence is related to constipation and those with nonretentive fecal incontinence or incontinence following colorectal surgery because the treatment will differ. The constipation may be obvious and well recognized before the child presents with fecal incontinence. In other cases, the symptoms of constipation are subtle and have not been previously recognized by the child's family/caregivers. Even if constipation is initially excluded, the parents and provider should remain vigilant for new evidence of constipation.</p><p>Valuable information to determine if there is underlying constipation includes  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79830" href="/d/graphic/79830.html" rel="external">table 3</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The intervals between bowel movements and amount, diameter, and consistency of the stool deposited into the toilet and of stools deposited into the underwear  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57882" href="/d/graphic/57882.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Information about stool consistency and volume is important because some children have daily bowel movements but evacuate incompletely. Stools that tend to clog the toilet strongly suggest underlying constipation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The timing of episodes of incontinence. Many children with underlying constipation will have episodes of incontinence during sleep, whereas children with functional nonretentive fecal incontinence will more often have episodes during the afternoon and evening [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h3">Psychosocial precipitants and comorbidities</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children with fecal incontinence should be screened for psychological symptoms, including anxiety, depression, and behavioral symptoms; validated questionnaires may be useful for this purpose [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. In addition, understanding the psychosocial context in which the problem arose may provide clues to whether there is underlying constipation and whether there are psychosocial stressors that either exacerbate the problem or interfere with treatment.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A history of events that may have precipitated the onset of symptoms. Common triggers for constipation and encopresis include toilet training, separation (eg, starting school or divorce), or other emotional stressors or a change in the child's daily schedule that may have interfered with regular toileting.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with higher prevalence of fecal and urinary incontinence. Although the underlying mechanism for fecal incontinence in ADHD is poorly understand, it is likely to be multifactorial. Altered communication between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system causing altered signaling of rectal distention, medication side effects, and delayed gastrointestinal motility have been implicated. Because of the distracted behavior, children with ADHD may not respond appropriately to physical cues signaling a need for defecation or urination and may have difficulty interrupting other tasks for these bodily functions [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99538.html" rel="external">"Functional constipation in infants, children, and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Predisposing conditions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The child's relationships with family members, peers, people at school, and adults with whom they come into contact. The answers can disclose an important influence on the child's toileting behavior. In some cases, they can reveal a hidden focal point for his or her constipation and/or fecal incontinence. Careful questioning may reveal a troublesome, threatening, or confusing event associated with certain important persons (power figures such as a parent or teacher), places (such as the school and school bathroom), events (such as parental divorce), or things (such as the toilet itself).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Children who are victims of sexual abuse may present with physical symptoms or findings, including fecal incontinence, enuresis, or anogenital problems [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Behavioral changes may be disclosed during the history, including sexual acting out, aggression, depression, eating disturbances, and regression. A history of sexual acting-out behavior can be a marker for sexual abuse and warrants referral for further psychiatric evaluation, if not already done [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. If there are any concerns of sexual abuse, it is important for the clinician to carefully obtain and record the child's statements since physical findings are often within normal limits; referral to an appropriately trained child psychologist should be considered. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6605.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The physical examination for a child with fecal incontinence is similar to that for a child with constipation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79830" href="/d/graphic/79830.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), except that the clinician should be particularly alert for signs of neurologic dysfunction. It is important to exercise sensitivity and patience during the examination since children with constipation may be particularly fearful of anal and digital rectal examination and a few may have a history of physical or sexual abuse.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abdomen – An abdominal fecal mass, indicating underlying constipation, can be palpated in approximately one-half of the children with fecal incontinence [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Digital rectal examination – In patients with fecal incontinence, a digital examination of the rectum should be performed if at all possible. By contrast, a digital examination is not routinely needed for patients with a typical presentation of functional constipation. The rectum is significantly dilated and packed with stool in more than 90 percent of children with underlying functional constipation, except in those who have recently had a large bowel movement. Children who have retentive fecal incontinence often resist the examination by squeezing their buttocks tight and voluntarily increasing the external anal sphincter tone. In contrast, reduced tone of the anal sphincter as assessed during the digital examination suggests either large fecal retention (with inhibition of resting sphincter tone) or a disease involving the sphincter (or both). A patulous anal canal suggests an underlying neurologic disorder or can be due to surgical repair of imperforate anus.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Perineum and anus – Examination of the perineum and perianal area may reveal fecal material, anal irritation, or fissures. Ectopic or anterior displacement of the anus can be diagnosed on inspection of the perineum by observing the relationship of the perineal pigmentation to the anus  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78404" href="/d/graphic/78404.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Spine – Examination of the lower back for a sacral dimple, excess hair, or lipoma might indicate a form of closed spinal dysraphism (spina bifida occulta), which may cause fecal incontinence because of neurologic impairment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5906.html" rel="external">"Constipation in infants and children: Evaluation", section on 'External examination'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/93935.html" rel="external">"Closed spinal dysraphism: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management", section on 'Cutaneous'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Neurologic examination – On neurologic examination, using a cotton swab to elicit an anal wink tests the perianal sensation and function. Sensation and strength of the lower extremities should be examined. Abnormalities in this examination may indicate spinal cord dysraphism or impingement and should prompt further work-up, including magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/93935.html" rel="external">"Closed spinal dysraphism: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management", section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The physical examination for specific organic causes of constipation is discussed in more detail separately.

This is because an abdominal radiograph is not particularly specific for constipation, is inconsistently interpreted by different clinicians, and rarely adds value to the diagnosis if the constipation has already been identified by rectal examination. However, in selected cases, radiography can be helpful to document retained stool when there is inadequate relevant historical information or if the physical examination is limited by patient cooperation or obesity or is deferred for psychological considerations. In children with constipation and any findings highly suspicious for spinal dysraphism or neurologic dysfunction, advanced imaging is indicated to exclude lower spine abnormalities. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5906.html" rel="external">"Constipation in infants and children: Evaluation", section on 'Imaging'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/93935.html" rel="external">"Closed spinal dysraphism: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management", section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Nonretentive fecal incontinence – An abdominal radiograph is reasonable but not required for children with suspected nonretentive fecal incontinence. Nonretentive fecal incontinence should be suspected if there is no evidence of constipation on physical examination or history, and the radiograph may help to confirm that there is no occult constipation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Colonic transit studies</strong> – Colonic transit studies evaluate colonic motility by tracking the passage of radiopaque markers using radiography. These studies are not necessary for the routine evaluation of constipation. However, they may be useful to help distinguish between retentive (constipation-associated) fecal incontinence and nonretentive fecal incontinence if the diagnosis is unclear after a thorough initial evaluation [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Colonic transit time is prolonged in a majority of children with constipation and normal or rapid in most children with nonretentive fecal incontinence [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].

Tests may include celiac serology, thyroid-stimulating hormone, electrolytes and calcium, or blood lead level. A urine culture is appropriate if the child has enuresis or daytime wetting.

However, it may be helpful to evaluate selected children with intractable symptoms who have been unresponsive to treatment or those who have had a pull-through operation for Hirschsprung disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5906.html" rel="external">"Constipation in infants and children: Evaluation", section on 'Anorectal manometry'</a>.)</p><p>If manometry is performed, the findings may provide evidence supporting the following diagnoses:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Retentive (constipation-related) fecal incontinence – Supportive findings include colonic inertia (with a high rectal sensation threshold), anal sphincter spasm (eg, increased sphincter tone in the presence of an anal fissure due to fear of pain), or paradoxical external sphincter contraction. These findings are not always present [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nonretentive fecal incontinence – Children with this condition usually have normal manometric findings (ie, no abnormalities of anorectal sensorimotor function), but they may have abnormal defecation dynamics (coordination) [<a href="#rid6">6,26</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Neurologic dysfunction caused by spinal cord abnormalities – Typically associated with robust anal sphincter relaxation with relatively small rectal balloon size and anal sphincter spasm following balloon distension [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Disruption of the anal sphincter – Manometric findings may include low anal sphincter pressure; the sphincter disruption can be further evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging. One cause of anal sphincter disruption is sexual abuse with anal penetration. Other causes include anorectal malformations such as imperforate anus.

(See <a class="local">'Functional fecal incontinence'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Types</strong> – Functional fecal incontinence can be categorized into two types, which guide the evaluation and management:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Retentive</strong> – Refers to fecal incontinence with underlying constipation, which is present in at least 80 percent of children with functional fecal incontinence. The symptoms of constipation may be obvious and well recognized by the child's family/caregivers or may be subtle. Evaluation and management of these children is similar to that of other children with functional constipation. (See <a class="local">'Retentive'</a> above and <a class="local">'Evidence of constipation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Nonretentive</strong> – Refers to fecal incontinence without underlying constipation; this is the case for approximately 20 percent of children with functional fecal incontinence. The pathophysiology of this disorder is not clear, but there is a strong association with psychosocial triggers and dysfunction. (See <a class="local">'Nonretentive'</a> above and <a class="local">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical manifestations</strong> – Children with fecal incontinence frequently deny knowledge of stool in their underwear and give the impression that they are unable to sense the need to defecate. Because the stool smear is usually soft, parents often presume that the child has diarrhea, even when there is underlying constipation. (See <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – Evaluation of children with fecal incontinence should seek to exclude organic causes of the symptom  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94998" href="/d/graphic/94998.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) and to determine if there is underlying constipation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79830" href="/d/graphic/79830.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). If the history and physical examination (including a digital examination) do not show evidence of constipation, radiographic imaging should be performed to confirm that there is no occult constipation.
