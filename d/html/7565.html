Adenomatous polyps occur in about 30 percent of men and about 20 percent of women. A colon polyp must be biopsied to determine its pathology, because gross appearance does not reliably distinguish adenomatous polyps from hyperplastic polyps, which are typically not precancerous.</p><p>Progression from adenoma to carcinoma is believed to take an average of approximately 10 years [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. This estimate is imprecise and may not apply to all types of polyps. The clinical presentation and natural history of colon polyps are described in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2594.html" rel="external">"Overview of colon polyps"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H765576190"><span class="h2">Benefits of screening</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We recommend that average-risk patients over the age 45 years be screened for CRC. CRC incidence and mortality rates have been declining in the United States, likely due to an increase in screening [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2606.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and risk factors for colorectal cancer", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Screening tests for CRC can improve disease prognosis by identifying early-stage CRC that is easier to treat and has a lower mortality rate than CRC detected after symptoms develop. In addition, screening can prevent CRC by detecting and removing premalignant polyps before they progress to CRC.</p><p>Across the multiple strategies that are recommended for screening by major guidelines, the numbers of CRC deaths averted appear to be relatively similar, although sensitivity and specificity for detection of polyps and of CRC vary, as shown in a figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116366" href="/d/graphic/116366.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). A mortality benefit has been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials for guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing (gFOBT) and sigmoidoscopy and is inferred for other screening tests based on observational studies and indirect comparison with studies of other screening strategies that have undergone randomized controlled trials. The types of evidence supporting efficacy of each CRC screening strategy are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7576.html" rel="external">"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H738982062"><span class="h2">Harms associated with screening</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most of the harms of screening for CRC are related to the risks from colonoscopy, including perforation. Any abnormal results of initial screening tests other than colonoscopy (eg, stool test, virtual colonoscopy) necessitate a colonoscopy to evaluate the abnormality; thus, all screening modalities are associated with the potential for colonoscopy-associated complications [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. In a meta-analysis of over 335,000 individuals screened initially by either FOBT or sigmoidoscopy with positive results followed up with colonoscopy, a major complication was recorded in 0.08 percent of participants, including 0.03 percent who initiated screening with FOBT [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In older adults, colonoscopy carries increased risk of complications. Complications of colonoscopy are described in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13927.html" rel="external">"Overview of colonoscopy in adults", section on 'Adverse events'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2877796130"><span class="h2">Cost and cost effectiveness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The cost of the various screening tests for CRC varies over a wide range, from a few US dollars for gFOBT to USD $1000 or more for colonoscopy. Models regarding the cost-effectiveness (cost per year of life saved) of CRC screening come to somewhat different conclusions because they make different assumptions. The cost per year of life saved is within the generally accepted range in the United States (USD $50,000), relative to no screening, for all of the recommended CRC screening tests [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. For example, in one analysis the cost per year of life saved was USD &lt;$15,000 for all recommended tests, compared with no screening [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">ASSESSING RISK FOR COLORECTAL CANCER</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The first step in screening is identifying the patient’s level of risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) because level of risk impacts screening and follow-up recommendations. For this purpose, patients are generally determined to be either at average risk or at increased risk.</p><p>We assess the risk for CRC at the initial visit for an adult who is age 20 years or older, unless a genetic risk is already known and documented, to identify high-risk patients who should begin CRC screening at an earlier age than those at average risk. Subsequent reassessment every three to five years identifies whether the patient or their biologic family members have developed factors that raise the patient’s level of risk for CRC. Although there are no published guidelines supporting this approach, one study from a United States national population-based cancer registry found that the number of patients who would meet criteria for high-risk screening based on family history significantly increased from age 30 (2.1 percent) to age 50 (7.1 percent), supporting the need to update the family history [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>Factors important to determine increased CRC risk can be assessed by asking several questions. A "no" response to all of these questions generally indicates average risk.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Have you ever had CRC or an adenomatous polyp? </strong>A personal history of CRC increases the risk of another primary (metachronous) cancer. Surveillance following CRC is discussed separately.

CRC incidence is also disproportionately high in geographic locations such as the Mississippi Delta region and the Appalachian region that are correlated with socioeconomic disadvantage [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. Disparities in incidence and mortality among Black people are apparent even prior to the age recommended for initiating screening in people at average risk for CRC.</p><p>Several factors have been shown to contribute to disparities, including disproportionate rates of exposure to risk factors, historical social injustices, and barriers to access to screening and other preventive services. Disparities have also been documented in the quality of screening and care received, such as delays in initiation of treatment [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. A report by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found an extensive body of literature on implementation strategies for delivering preventive care services, including CRC screening [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>]. The USPSTF encouraged development of delivery services to ensure equitable access to high-quality care from screening through treatment, particularly for people from groups that experience disproportionate incidence, late-stage diagnosis, and death from CRC. Studies in the state of Delaware and in Kaiser Permanente, Northern California have shown that system-based coordinated strategies for equitable delivery of screening and follow-up care while addressing structural barriers, including patient navigation and reminder systems, can reduce or even eliminate disparities [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>].

Although most cases of CRC occur over age 50 years, initiating screening at age 45 years balances the benefits of detection and prevention with the burden on the patient and the risk of harms from screening [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].

Screening at least until age 75 years for patients at average risk for CRC is recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and many other guidelines [<a href="#rid5">5,22,26-29,34</a>]. This is based on the increasing frequency of CRC with age and the time course of progression from polyp to CRC.</p><p>For older adults who have never been screened, results of a modeling study suggest that one-time screening appears to be cost-effective up to an age that varies depending on the patient’s life expectancy, comorbidities, and the test used for screening [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. As an example, for patients at average risk for CRC and without any comorbidities, in the simulation study, assuming a willingness to pay USD $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, colonoscopy was cost-effective to age 83 years, sigmoidoscopy to 84 years, and fecal immunochemistry testing (FIT) to 86 years. In that study, colonoscopy was the most effective, due to its overall effectiveness for both CRC and adenomas, and was also the most expensive strategy for one-time screening.</p><p>For patients aged 76 to 85 years who have been screened before, we individualize the decision about whether to continue screening, based on factors including the patient’s preferences, prior testing results, and comorbidities. Some guidelines recommend not continuing screening, whereas others recommend that the decision to screen adults 76 to 85 years be individualized, taking into account the patient’s overall health and prior screening history [<a href="#rid5">5,22,26,34,36,37</a>]. Data supporting continued screening are limited; trials have included too few older patients to provide reliable evidence-based guidance about the balance of benefits and harms of screening beyond age 75 years. A prospective observational study of Medicare beneficiaries found that undergoing colonoscopy modestly decreased the risk of developing CRC over an eight-year period for those aged 70 to 74 years (2.2 versus 2.6 percent in the no-screening group), with a non-significant decrease in risk for those 75 to 79 years. In a modeling study of adults aged 65 years at average risk for CRC with average life expectancy and negative colonoscopy at age 55, extending screening beyond age 75 resulted in net harm (loss of quality-adjusted life-years) due to complications from colonoscopy.</p><p class="bulletIndent1">Shortened life expectancy modifies these age guidelines. Patients with a life expectancy less than 10 years (some would say five years) would not be expected to benefit from colorectal screening, since studies indicate benefit from screening in a population starts to accrue after about five years. For example, in a meta-analysis of screening with sigmoidoscopy, an absolute risk reduction of one CRC-related death for every 5000 sigmoidoscopies was observed at 4.3 years, and an absolute risk reduction of one CRC-related death for every 1000 sigmoidoscopies occurred by 9.4 years [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. In one modeling study, screening patients ages 67 to 69 with three or more comorbidities would save fewer lives than screening older patients (ages 75 to 79) with no comorbidity (81 versus 459 lives saved per 100,000) [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].

We recommend FIT for screening for patients unable or unwilling to have a colonoscopy as initial screening, or when access to colonoscopy is limited, with the understanding that if the FIT result is positive, colonoscopy needs to be performed promptly. Compared with colonoscopy, FIT has similar detection rates for CRC but lower detection rates for advanced adenomas.

Screening has been shown to decrease mortality from CRC, and organized screening has been shown to reduce disparities; most of the risks of CRC screening are due to the risks of colonoscopy.

Patients at sufficiently increased risk to change screening recommendations (eg, start screening at an earlier age and/or perform screening more frequently) include those with a personal or family history of CRC or advanced adenomatous polyp and other risk factors. (See <a class="local">'Assessing risk for colorectal cancer'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Age to initiate and discontinue screening</strong> – We recommend that average-risk patients age ≥ 45 years be screened for CRC (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_1" rel="external">Grade 1A</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>We initiate screening at age 45 years in most average-risk adults to balance the benefits of detection and prevention with the burden on the patient and the risk of harms from screening. (See <a class="local">'Age to initiate screening'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>We continue to screen for CRC through age 75 years for average-risk patients, as long as their life expectancy is 10 years or greater. Screening at least until age 75 years for patients at average risk for CRC is recommended by most guidelines. Screening decisions should be individualized and based on shared decision-making for those aged 76 to 85 years. Screening until age 86 may be reasonable for patients who have never been screened, depending on their comorbidities. (See <a class="local">'Discontinuing screening'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Discussing screening tests with patients</strong> – After determining that a patient is at average risk for CRC, we use a motivational interviewing and shared decision-making process to discuss specific CRC screening test protocols. Individual patient preferences, values, and risk, as well as test effectiveness, resource availability, test safety, convenience, comfort, and cost, are factors in determining which screening test among those recommended by guidelines groups is preferred by a specific patient. (See <a class="local">'Advising patients about screening'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Our approach</strong> – A variety of tests are endorsed for screening by major guidelines. The numbers of CRC deaths averted appear to be relatively similar across modalities that are recommended by guidelines, although the frequency of testing and the sensitivity and specificity for detection of polyps and of CRC vary, as shown in the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116366" href="/d/graphic/116366.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>We advise colonoscopy every 10 years for most patients at average risk for CRC who are willing to undergo this procedure. We advise screening by FIT for occult blood annually on a single sample, by multitarget stool DNA (MT-sDNA) testing every one to three years, or by computed tomography colonography<strong> </strong>(CTC) every five years for patients unable or unwilling to have a colonoscopy as initial screening, or when access to colonoscopy is limited, with the understanding that if the other test result is positive, colonoscopy needs to be performed promptly. (See <a class="local">'Preferred tests'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Other tests available for CRC screening include sigmoidoscopy with FIT or with gFOBT, sigmoidoscopy alone, gFOBT alone, and capsule colonoscopy. (See <a class="local">'Other tests used'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Colorectal cancer screening should<strong> not</strong> be based on an office-based gFOBT performed following a digital rectal examination (DRE). <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9180" href="/d/drug information/9180.html" rel="external">Barium</a> enema tests are no longer recommended for screening because other tests are more effective. (See <a class="local">'Tests that are less effective or lack sufficient evidence on effectiveness'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Follow-up of abnormal results</strong> – Every positive CRC screening test other than colonoscopy should be followed expeditiously by a colonoscopy to visualize the entire colon, evaluate lesions, and remove polyps. (See <a class="local">'Follow-up of abnormal results'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H29334890"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Robert H Fletcher, MD, MSc, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p><p>The author, Dr. Chyke Doubeni, was a member of the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).
