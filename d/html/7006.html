          Temperate climates −
         </strong>
         In temperate climates, human influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal epidemics of disease, typically during the winter months (in the Northern hemisphere: October to March  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60877" href="/z/d/graphic/60877.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ); in the Southern hemisphere: April to September). Less commonly, individual influenza infections and outbreaks occur during warm weather months.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Influenza A epidemics typically begin abruptly, peak over a two- to three- week period, and last for two to three months. In most seasons, the earliest indication of influenza activity occurs among children. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7004.html" rel="external">
          "Seasonal influenza in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Between seasonal epidemics, how influenza virus persists remains poorly understood. Episodes of sporadic illness may be caused by influenza (but not diagnosed as such) or influenza may be imported from geographically distant sites.

         </strong>
         − In a global modeling study using death records and surveillance data to estimate mortality in 33 countries between 1999 and 2015, the estimated mean annual influenza-associated mortality rates were 0.1 to 6.4 per 100,000 individuals among those &lt;65 years of age, 2.9 to 44.0 per 100,000 among 65 to 74 years, and 17.9 to 223.5 per 100,000 among those ≥75 years of age [

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The highest estimated mortality rates were in sub-Saharan Africa (2.8 to 16.5 per 100,000), Southeast Asia (3.5 to 9.2 per 100,000), and among individuals ≥75 years of age (51.3 to 99.4 per 100,000). In addition, it was estimated that 291,000 to 645,000 seasonal influenza-associated deaths occur annually worldwide (4.0 to 8.8 per 100,000). These estimates are higher than previous estimates, likely due to the inclusion of resource-limited countries in the analysis.

         During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic between October 2020 and May 2021, influenza activity was lower than during any previous influenza season in the United States since 1977 (the first season for which data are available). Among more than 1 million specimens tested during this period, 0.05 percent were positive for influenza, of which 60 percent were positive for influenza A and 40 percent were positive for influenza B [
         <a href="#rid9">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The reasons for the reduced activity of influenza and other common respiratory viruses are uncertain; a number of alterations in human behavior (reduced travel, mask use, and physical distancing) may have played a part [

         Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on two proteins on the surface of the virus: hemagglutinin (HA or H) and neuraminidase (NA or N). There are 18 different H subtypes (H1 through H18) and 11 different N subtypes (N1 through N11).
        </p>
        <p>
         In humans, three major subtypes of hemagglutinins (H1, H2, and H3) and two subtypes of neuraminidases (N1 and N2) have been described. Influenza A virus subtypes that routinely circulate in humans include A(H1N1) and A(H3N2).
        </p>
        <p>
         More than 130 influenza A subtype combinations have been identified in nature, primarily from wild birds. There are many more potential combinations given the propensity for virus reassortment, a process by which influenza viruses swap gene segments. Reassortment can occur when two influenza viruses infect a single cell in a host at the same time and swap genetic information.
        </p>
        <p>
         Influenza A viruses are the only influenza viruses known to cause global influenza pandemics. A pandemic can occur when a new influenza A virus emerges that has the ability to spread efficiently among humans.

         Antigenic “drift” refers to minor HA or NA gene mutations causing changes in the viral protein antigenicity. Antibodies (produced in response to prior infection or vaccination) do not bind well to antigenically drifted virus strains. Therefore, antigenic drift drives seasonal epidemics, necessitating year-round and worldwide influenza surveillance and annual updating of vaccine antigens.
        </p>
        <p>
         Antigenic “shift” refers to major HA or NA gene mutations, leading to emergence of a novel influenza A virus that is antigenically and genetically distinct from viruses previously circulating in humans. Novel influenza A viruses can cause sporadic human infections from exposure to infected animals (usually birds or pigs); in addition, these viruses are capable of causing pandemics if most of the population lacks immunity to the novel virus.

         An influenza pandemic is a global outbreak of an influenza A virus that is very different from recent circulating seasonal influenza A viruses [

Because such viruses may be relatively new to large segments of the population, very few individuals may have immunity, and an effective vaccine may not be widely available.

The resulting epidemic affected primarily young individuals born since 1957. Influenza A H1N1 strains circulating between 1918 and 1957 were replaced in 1957 first by H2N2, then H3N2 strains, leaving, in 1977, those under 20 to 25 years of age susceptible to H1N1. The 1977-78 H1N1 pandemic, which occurred primarily in young adults, resulted in approximately 700,000 deaths. Since 1977, H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes have cocirculated as seasonal influenza [

Initial viral infection occurs in the upper respiratory columnar epithelium and then spreads distally in airways.

          Definition
         </strong>
         − An influenza epidemic occurs when regional influenza activity is higher than the baseline level of influenza activity during months when influenza viruses are not widely circulating in humans. A seasonal influenza epidemic occurs in the United States nearly every year. (See

          Surface proteins

         − Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on two proteins on the surface of the virus: hemagglutinin (HA or H) and neuraminidase (NA or N). In humans, three major subtypes of hemagglutinins (H1, H2, and H3) and two subtypes of neuraminidases (N1 and N2) have been described. (See
