Breastfeeding has important short- and long-term health benefits for both infant and mother. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5013.html" rel="external">"Infant benefits of breastfeeding"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5022.html" rel="external">"Maternal and economic benefits of breastfeeding"</a>.)</p><p>For many women, difficulties in breastfeeding result in early termination of breastfeeding before the recommended period of time. However, with accurate advice and treatment, most of these difficulties can be overcome, and breastfeeding can be successfully sustained for longer periods.</p><p>Common problems associated with breastfeeding and their management are reviewed here. Other aspects of breastfeeding are discussed in the following topics:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4986.html" rel="external">"Initiation of breastfeeding"</a>.) – Includes breastfeeding technique and issues related to maternal medications</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4978.html" rel="external">"Breastfeeding: Parental education and support"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4978.html" rel="external">"Breastfeeding: Parental education and support", section on 'Contraindications to breastfeeding'</a>.) – Includes considerations for maternal infectious diseases</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4960.html" rel="external">"Maternal nutrition during lactation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5035.html" rel="external">"Breastfeeding the preterm infant"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H115298521"><span class="h1">INADEQUATE MILK INTAKE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Inadequate milk intake or the perception of inadequate milk production is the most common reason for early termination of breastfeeding. Inadequate milk intake may be due to insufficient milk production or failure of the infant to extract milk or a combination of these factors. In many cases, the problem can be solved by optimizing breastfeeding frequency and technique, with close monitoring and lactation support.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H122440419"><span class="h2">Diagnosis of inadequate intake</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of inadequate milk intake is made clinically by demonstrating insufficient feeding based on a nursing history, decreased infant urine and stool output, and excess weight loss of the infant. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4986.html" rel="external">"Initiation of breastfeeding", section on 'Assessment of intake'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical signs and behaviors</strong> – For healthy term newborns, assess intake by clinical signs of hydration and feeding  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef131200" href="/d/graphic/131200.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). During the first week of life, mothers with term infants should nurse when the infant exhibits hunger cues, which usually occurs 8 to 12 times in 24 hours. By four weeks after birth, nursing usually decreases to seven to nine times per day. By the fifth day of life, infants with adequate intake urinate at least six to eight times daily and have three or more pale yellow and seedy stools daily.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Some mothers perceive that the infant is not ingesting adequate milk, because the infant seems hungry and is nursing more frequently. If the infant is gaining weight appropriately, the infant may be undergoing a growth spurt or is having difficulty removing milk, leading to more frequent feeding. Growth spurts typically occur at two to four weeks, six weeks, three months, and six months.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Infant weight</strong> – To determine whether caloric intake is adequate, infants must be weighed naked at each office visit and at any time a parent is concerned about having enough milk.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Term infants generally lose weight in the first three to five days of life with an average loss of 7 percent of their birth weight. They typically will regain their birth weight by one to two weeks of life and gain approximately 30 grams per day. Once the mother's breasts feel full with milk by day three to five, the infant should not continue to lose weight. If an infant has lost 10 percent of its weight or fails to regain birthweight appropriately, inadequate intake should be considered and further assessment should be performed, including direct observation of breastfeeding. (See <a class="local">'Observed feeding'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Late preterm infants (born between 34 and 37 weeks gestation) or infants with underlying medical problems are at increased risk for feeding problems and inadequate milk intake. As a result, they often need additional breastfeeding support and monitoring, often including scheduled feedings and after-feeding pumping, and sometimes test weighing (before and after a feed) to determine actual milk intake. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5035.html" rel="external">"Breastfeeding the preterm infant", section on 'Late preterm infants'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5035.html" rel="external">"Breastfeeding the preterm infant", section on 'Test weighing'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H577639466"><span class="h2">Management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Inadequate milk intake is most commonly related to or worsened by ineffective breastfeeding technique In some cases, specific maternal and/or infant factors contribute to the problem, which may warrant specific interventions, depending on the cause  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91872" href="/d/graphic/91872.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Optimize breastfeeding technique</strong> – Inadequate milk intake is most commonly related to or worsened by ineffective breastfeeding technique. The first step is a careful assessment of breastfeeding technique, including direct observation of feeding, and providing maternal education and support to increase breastfeeding frequency and optimize technique. Proper latch-on is illustrated in the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112380" href="/d/graphic/112380.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) and further detailed in <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fibconline.ca%2Fbreastfeeding-videos-english%2F&amp;token=pVMvGfWNjOJbRhP8X8ZXzE6K0DqP6mKvrEwh5eIziuTOijM6J1LhVDl17KGreX5iVa%2F5g7mU0DSKls0Qs0jOeA%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=4996" target="_blank">videos available here</a>. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4986.html" rel="external">"Initiation of breastfeeding", section on 'Optimize mechanics of feeding'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assess and address contributing factors</strong> – In some cases, specific maternal and/or infant factors contribute to the problem, which may warrant specific interventions, depending on the cause  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91872" href="/d/graphic/91872.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If the mother reports nipple or breast pain, the breast should be examined for evidence of nipple injury or dermatitis, engorgement, or narrowed (blocked) ducts, all of which cause pain and may interfere with breastfeeding and/or milk transfer. The most common cause of nipple pain and injury is an ineffective latch. Diagnosis and management of these problems are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Nipple and breast pain'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>During the first weeks after birth, an important marker of milk production is the timing of lactogenesis II (also called secretory activation), which is the transition from making concentrated drops of colostrum to larger quantities (ounces) of breast milk; this transition typically occurs by 72 hours postpartum. Lactogenesis II is delayed if has not occurred within three to four days postpartum; this occurs in approximately 20 percent of women and is more common in those who are primiparous, in those with obesity or insulin resistance, or after cesarian birth [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. In most cases, this problem can be addressed by optimizing technique, increasing breastfeeding frequency, and ensuring complete breast emptying to stimulate milk production.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Increased maternal stress has been associated with decreased let-down and, thus, less effective breastfeeding. Mothers who are overly stressed may benefit from relaxation techniques or other interventions to help them remain calm [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Unfortunately, as the mother becomes more stressed, breastfeeding may worsen and a vicious circle can ensue.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Supplementation (if medically necessary)</strong> – Supplementation of feeds with formula or donor human milk should be avoided if possible. If supplementation reduces breast milk removal, it may decrease milk production and exacerbate the breastfeeding problem. However, supplementation may be necessary in some cases to provide adequate nutrition to the infant, including a delay in lactogenesis II. When supplements are medically necessary, they are ideally given in small volumes and only for a brief period while addressing the breastfeeding technique and ensuring signaling to improve the mother's milk production (ie, increased frequency and thorough milk removal of the breast). When possible, the supplemental formula should be given via one or more alternative techniques, including use of a syringe, cup, spoon, or a supplemental nursing system at the breast, rather than using a bottle and artificial nipple [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. To ensure safety, methods other than bottle feeding should be guided by appropriately trained clinical staff. Indications and techniques for supplementation are outlined separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4986.html" rel="external">"Initiation of breastfeeding", section on 'When and how to supplement with formula'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If the mother chooses to supplement with donor human milk, it should be obtained from an established human milk bank that follows safety regulations for optimal milk collection, pasteurization, storage, and shipping. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5050.html" rel="external">"Human milk feeding and fortification of human milk for premature infants", section on 'Use of donor milk'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Galactagogues (not recommended)</strong> – Galactagogues (or lactagogues) are medications or other substances believed to augment maternal milk production. The most commonly used prescription agents are dopamine receptor antagonists, primarily <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9642" href="/d/drug information/9642.html" rel="external">metoclopramide</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8777" href="/d/drug information/8777.html" rel="external">domperidone</a>. We do <strong>not</strong> recommend the routine use of galactagogues, because there is limited evidence to support their efficacy and because of potential safety concerns [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. These agents should never be used in place of an evaluation and correction of any modifiable factors such as frequency and thoroughness of milk removal [<a href="#rid5">5,7,8</a>]. If galactagogues are considered in selected patients who have not responded to lactation support, they should be used with caution, and mothers need to be aware of potential side effects and the lack of data supporting their use.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Most studies suggest limited efficacy of galactagogues in increasing milk production [<a href="#rid6">6,9-15</a>]. In small randomized trials of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9642" href="/d/drug information/9642.html" rel="external">metoclopramide</a> given to mothers of term or preterm infants at a dose of 10 mg every eight hours, there was no difference in the amount of milk production between mothers who received metoclopramide compared with mothers who received placebo [<a href="#rid9">9,14,15</a>]. A systematic review concluded that <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8777" href="/d/drug information/8777.html" rel="external">domperidone</a> may increase the volume of expressed breast milk in mothers pumping for their preterm infants, but the findings may not be generalizable, because the two included studies involved mothers greater than 14 days postpartum and who had full lactation support [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>]. In another trial of 80 mothers who were expressing breast milk to feed their infants in the neonatal intensive care unit, 10-day courses of domperidone and metoclopramide appeared to be equally effective in increasing milk production [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Although 15 percent of mothers reported side effects (eg, headaches, diarrhea, and mood swings), this may be an underestimation, as a significant number of mothers withdrew from the trial (n = 15). Another trial in mothers of preterm infants under 29 weeks gestation found that domperidone appeared to increase milk volume, at least in some of the subjects, although the absolute increase in milk volume was modest [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9642" href="/d/drug information/9642.html" rel="external">metoclopramide</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8777" href="/d/drug information/8777.html" rel="external">domperidone</a> is also limited by concerns about possible adverse effects and because the long-term effects of these medications on offspring are unknown [<a href="#rid5">5,21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9642" href="/d/drug information/9642.html" rel="external">metoclopramide</a>, no definite adverse effects on the infant have been demonstrated. However, there are theoretical concerns about the use of this drug during lactation because of its known effects on the central nervous system [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8777" href="/d/drug information/8777.html" rel="external">Domperidone</a> is excreted in low concentrations in breast milk and does not cross the blood-brain barrier. However, because of important concerns about arrhythmias due to QT prolongation, domperidone is not approved for marketing in the United States [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. Moreover, the quality of product available from compounding pharmacies cannot be assured. Domperidone use is most risky in mothers with a history of arrhythmias or who are at risk for prolonged QT syndrome, are on other medications that increase the QT interval, on CYP3A4 inhibitors such as grapefruit juice or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8450" href="/d/drug information/8450.html" rel="external">fluconazole</a>, or who take domperidone doses over 30 mg daily [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Severe psychiatric side effects have been reported with high doses and abrupt weaning of domperidone [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Data on the use of herbal galactagogues are even more limited. Fenugreek is the most widely used herbal agent, including in many "lactation cookies," but data are insufficient to determine its efficacy and safety [<a href="#rid6">6,26-30</a>]. Reported side effects include diarrhea, flatulence, allergic reactions, and hypokalemia. In addition, it is not known whether components of the herb are transferred to the infant via breast milk. As with all herbal supplements, manufacturers are not required to demonstrate efficacy, and the contents of individual products vary. Further information about fenugreek and other herbal galactagogues is available from the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fbooks%2FNBK501922%2Ftoc%2F&amp;token=wEsKVFvqlKzpT%2BqOtddW%2Fy3%2BLj0shalBW%2BL1ZyL4tryFu07IvXnavzOhNczeXqP3S5J5ch8%2BiV0OFrTqwASZjA%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=4996" target="_blank">LactMed database</a>, which is maintained by the National Library of Medicine.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">NIPPLE AND BREAST PAIN</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>After insufficient milk intake, nipple and breast pain are the most common causes of premature discontinuation of breastfeeding.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1196284118"><span class="h2">Etiology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Causes of nipple and breast pain include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nipple injury from breastfeeding (eg, due to improper latch or suck) or pumping (eg, due to poorly fitted breast shield)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nipple vasoconstriction</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Engorgement</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Narrowed (blocked) ducts</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nipple and breast infections (see <a class="local">'Breast infections'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Excess milk production</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nipple dermatitis/psoriasis</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H115298707"><span class="h2">Evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evaluation of breast pain begins with a thorough history, examination of the infant and mother's breasts, and observation of feeding.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1934622461"><span class="h3">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following are key elements in the history:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The onset of breast pain, as breast pain in the first days of breastfeeding is most often caused by poor latch, whereas infectious causes of breast pain occur later.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Description of the pain including the clinical setting.

Infants usually bite more at the end of the feeding since their tongues cover the teeth during active feeding. Biting is often avoided by keeping the baby close to the breast while feeding with the mouth wide open, which prevents the baby's latch from becoming shallow onto the nipple. Once swallowing is over and the baby is nursing for comfort, taking the baby off the breast prevents biting. If these steps are not helpful, and the baby continues to bite, the mother should say "no" firmly, break the suction with her finger, and put the infant on a safe surface. Mothers should avoid expressing too much emotion over the event to discourage the infant from repeating it [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Most infants learn quickly not to bite.

This is more common in women with a history of either of these two skin conditions.

Mothers should use careful hand hygiene and cover any lesions with which the infant might come into contact. Mothers can pump and the expressed milk that does not come into direct contact with open herpetic lesions can be given to the infant.

After the child starts solid foods, the child will diminish breastfeeding, and gradually the weaning process begins. If the weaning is gradual, engorgement is not likely to occur.</p><p>Strategies for weaning include dropping a breastfeeding session every two to five days, shortening each breastfeeding session, and increasing the time between breastfeeding sessions. Midday feedings are often ideal to eliminate first since the child is often active at this time and so may not become fussy. Persons other than the mother may have more success offering other feedings [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. During the weaning process, it is important that the mother continue to maintain closeness.</p><p>It may be challenging for exclusively breastfed infants to accommodate to bottle feeding. Older infants may be directly weaned to a cup. For infants being weaned to a bottle, varying the type of nipple may be helpful in those who are having difficulty adjusting to bottle feeding.</p><p>If engorgement occurs during the weaning process, mothers should try to avoid pumping any more than is necessary to relieve engorgement as this will increase milk production.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2887438607"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

For healthy term newborns, assess intake by clinical signs of hydration and feeding  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef131200" href="/d/graphic/131200.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and by tracking the infant's weight. In many cases, the problem can be solved by providing maternal education and support to increase breastfeeding frequency and optimize technique, with close monitoring of the infant's weight and hydration. In some cases, specific maternal and/or infant factors contribute to the problem, which may warrant specific interventions, depending on the cause.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We do <strong>not</strong> suggest the use of galactagogues to increase milk production (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>).

These problems are usually due in part to incorrect breastfeeding techniques. (See <a class="local">'Nipple and breast pain'</a> above and <a class="local">'Breast infections'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4986.html" rel="external">"Initiation of breastfeeding", section on 'Evaluating a latch for effectiveness'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>General measures</strong> – For conditions that present with breast pain, the primary intervention is to identify and correct any improper breastfeeding technique to ensure that the infant is achieving a satisfactory latch-on  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112380" href="/d/graphic/112380.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) and is thoroughly emptying the breast on a regular and frequent basis.

It is usually is due to incorrect breastfeeding technique, such as improper latch-on, or pumping with a poorly fitted breast shield. Women with nipple injury should be assessed for breastfeeding technique and for an underlying nipple condition. Pain due to nipple injury needs to be distinguished from nipple sensitivity, which peaks during the fourth postpartum day and then resolves. (See <a class="local">'Nipple pain'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Areolar dermatitis</strong> – Eczema and psoriasis of the nipple/areolar complex can present as itchy and painful burning of the areola and nipples, with a red, scaly rash  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef133161" href="/d/graphic/133161.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). This is more common in women with a history of either of these two skin conditions. Other contributing factors include irritant dermatitis due to soaps or fragrances, solid foods in the infant's diet, or allergic reaction to topical agents such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="101844" href="/d/drug information/101844.html" rel="external">lanolin</a>, antifungals, or antibiotics. (See <a class="local">'Areolar dermatitis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Engorgement</strong> – Interventions for symptomatic pain relief for engorgement include cool compresses, hand expression of breast milk, and use of analgesics (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8547" href="/d/drug information/8547.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a>).

Other interventions include very gentle hand expression of breast milk and cold compresses. If there is no resolution after 72 hours, further assessment (and possible intervention) is required. Unrelieved ductal narrowing may result in lactational mastitis, which may require antibiotics, or galactoceles  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65929" href="/d/graphic/65929.html" rel="external">image 1</a>), which may need to be aspirated. (See <a class="local">'Ductal narrowing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Lactational mastitis</strong> – Lactational mastitis is a condition in which the breast becomes painful, swollen, and red  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef126606" href="/d/graphic/126606.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>); it is most common in the first three months of breastfeeding. It tends to occur in the setting of breastfeeding problems that result in prolonged engorgement or poor drainage, including nipple trauma, inefficient milk removal, excessive pumping, or infrequent feedings and overproduction of milk. The condition occasionally evolves into a breast abscess. Diagnosis and management of lactational mastitis and breast abscess are discussed separately.
