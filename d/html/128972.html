There are no data on the choice of specific regimens; in general, we recommend "standard" adjuvant chemotherapy regimens in chemotherapy-naïve cases (eg, an anthracycline- and taxane-containing regimen), and in situations where prior chemotherapy has been given, attempt to offer different regimens if possible.

While there are no large clinical experiences to prove the value of anti-HER2 treatment and chemotherapy in this clinical context, the known value of such therapies in both early- and late-stage breast cancer argue for benefit here, too.

In the KATHERINE trial, trastuzumab emtansine improved on outcomes in women treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and trastuzumab but with residual disease at the time or surgery [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. By inference, such therapy is likely to be beneficial in local recurrence, too. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/773.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant systemic therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer", section on 'Patients who were treated with neoadjuvant therapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2004463291"><span class="h2">Rationale</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are relatively few trials of chemotherapy as "adjuvant" type treatment after surgery and/or radiation therapy (RT) for locoregional breast cancer recurrence [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Data from a randomized trial suggest there is a benefit to postexcision chemotherapy for women with ER-negative tumors [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. However, the role of chemotherapy in this setting for ER-positive disease is less clear. Our approach to such patients is discussed above. (See <a class="local">'ER-positive, HER2-negative tumors'</a> above.)</p><p>In the CALOR trial, 162 patients who experienced ILRR after their initial treatment for breast cancer (including BCT for approximately three-quarters and mastectomy for one-quarter) underwent surgical excision of their recurrent breast cancer and were randomly assigned to postexcision chemotherapy (with the regimen determined by the patient's treating oncologist) or to no chemotherapy (control group) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. While all patients were advised to undergo RT, RT was mandatory for women with microscopically involved surgical margins. Patients with ER-positive ILRR received adjuvant endocrine therapy; anti-HER2 therapy was optional.</p><p>Of the patients enrolled, the majority had a hormone receptor-positive recurrence (68 percent). Compared with the control group, more women in the treatment group were chemotherapy naïve (42 versus 32 percent, respectively) and premenopausal at the time of recurrence (24 versus 18 percent). A similar proportion of women underwent RT for their ILRR (36 versus 38 percent).</p><p>At a median follow-up of nine years, results were as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chemotherapy improved ten-year disease-free survival in patients with ER-negative ILRR (70 versus 34 percent in patients treated with or without chemotherapy, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 0.29, 95% CI 0.13-0.67), but not in patients with ER-positive disease (50 versus 59 percent in patients treated with or without chemotherapy, respectively; HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.57-2.00) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Overall survival (OS) at ten years in patients with ER-negative ILRR was 73 percent with chemotherapy versus 53 percent without chemotherapy (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.19-1.20); among patients with ER-positive ILRR, ten-year OS was 76 versus 66 percent, respectively (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.32-1.55).</p><p></p><p>These data support the use of chemotherapy in women with breast cancer following resection for locoregional, ER-negative recurrence. However, interpretation of the study is affected by the small sample size, and by the variety of different treatments patients had prior to locoregional recurrence [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. In addition, there were relatively few events, especially in the ER-positive breast cancer cohort. Therefore, questions about the benefits of treatment based on tumor location (eg, chest wall versus regional nodal recurrence), prior treatment with chemotherapy or RT, or breast cancer subtype (eg, triple negative, HER2 positive, or hormone receptor positive) remain unresolved.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1398089694"><span class="h1">ADDITIONAL SYSTEMIC THERAPY CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H980502249"><span class="h2">Endocrine therapy in hormone receptor-positive disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are no randomized trials to address the value of ongoing anti-estrogen therapy in women with locoregional recurrence. However, women with estrogen receptor-positive disease should be treated with endocrine therapy (irrespective of whether chemotherapy was administered), typically a different endocrine regimen than they have been receiving in the past. For example, women previously on <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a> may be offered an aromatase inhibitor (AI), if postmenopausal, or ovarian suppression and an AI, if premenopausal. Women previously treated with an AI may be offered <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8784" href="/d/drug information/8784.html" rel="external">fulvestrant</a>, although resuming an AI may be an option for women who wish to avoid monthly injections, particularly those with smaller, node-negative local recurrences that did not occur while on AI therapy.</p><p>Although there are limited data to support the benefit of treatment in this clinical setting, treatment is based on the benefits of endocrine therapy observed both in the adjuvant setting and among patients with evidence of measurable metastatic breast cancer. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/749.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant endocrine and targeted therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/120706.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/778.html" rel="external">"Treatment for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p>The only randomized trial evaluating the benefit of endocrine therapy in the local recurrence setting assigned 167 women with hormone receptor-positive or hormone receptor-unknown, locally recurrent breast cancer (all of whom underwent resection of disease) to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a> or observation [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. With a median follow-up of 11 years, the median disease-free survival (DFS) following the initial locoregional recurrence was longer with tamoxifen compared with observation (6.5 versus 2.7 years, respectively). This translated into an improvement in the five-year DFS rate favoring tamoxifen (61 versus 33 percent). However, there was no difference in median overall survival in the overall population (11.5 versus 11.2 years, respectively).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H504937376"><span class="h2">Timing of treatment</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>While in many cases chemotherapy, if indicated, is administered following surgery and prior to radiation therapy (RT), in certain instances it may be appropriate to administer induction treatment.
