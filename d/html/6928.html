         Because of the prolonged natural history of prostate cancer, there are a large number of cancer survivors who are being followed after initial definitive treatment. One of the most important aspects of follow-up care for males who have undergone definitive local treatment for prostate cancer is the identification and management of therapy-related complications (particularly sexual and urinary dysfunction). The complications of radical prostatectomy, RT, and ADT are discussed elsewhere, as is an overview of the overall approach to prostate cancer survivors. (See

         Males who have undergone definitive local treatment should also undergo periodic assessments for recurrent disease. This topic will discuss the approach to post-treatment surveillance to detect a recurrence after definitive local treatment for prostate cancer. The surveillance strategy for males with low-risk, localized prostate cancer who are managed with active surveillance, and recommendations for assessment during treatment for males with advanced prostate cancer are discussed elsewhere.

         Serial evaluation of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the mainstay of surveillance testing in males who have undergone definitive therapy for localized prostate cancer. There are no clinical trials that define the optimal frequency for measuring serum PSA. We agree with guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), which recommend that serum PSA be monitored every 6 to 12 months for the first five years and annually thereafter [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         Regular clinician visits may serve to reassure the patient, but they are of questionable utility in detecting recurrent tumor given that most recurrences manifest as a rise in serum PSA. Nevertheless, periodic evaluation by a health care provider is important to evaluate potential complications of therapy and for overall health care. The value of serial digital rectal examination (DRE) in this setting is unclear. DREs may have some value in detecting a local recurrence if the PSA becomes elevated.

         Imaging studies, such as bone scan, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, have no role as screening tests for recurrence of localized prostate cancer in the absence of a rising serum PSA or specific symptoms. These tests may be indicated to evaluate a rising PSA after definitive local treatment. (See

         In general, a recurrence is detected by a rise in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a highly specific marker for prostate tissue, prior to any radiologic or symptomatic evidence of recurrence or progression. Most relapses after localized treatment happen within five years; however, late recurrences may also occur [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-5
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in a series of 4561 males who had undergone radical prostatectomy, 31 percent eventually developed a PSA recurrence [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Of these, approximately 10 percent occurred after five years. Patients with a pretreatment PSA &lt;10 ng/mL and those with a Gleason score &lt;7 were more likely to have a delayed recurrence. In contrast to a biochemical recurrence, the development of a clinically or radiologically overt local recurrence or distant metastases usually occurs significantly later in the natural history of the disease [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A variety of factors have been evaluated in an attempt to identify males at high risk of a disease recurrence following radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy (RT). In multivariate models, the most important determinants of outcome are the pretreatment serum PSA and Gleason score, as well as the anatomic extent of disease. These are the factors that are used in risk stratification models, including those of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), which categorize males with newly diagnosed prostate cancer into different levels of risk  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118962" href="/z/d/graphic/118962.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         ). (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Increasingly, models are being developed and validated that can be used to predict individualized estimates of biochemical recurrence [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,8-11
         </a>

          11-13

         ] after definitive local treatment of prostate cancer, based on clinicopathologic factors. One such model, the

         , is an individualized web-based prognostic tool for males with newly diagnosed nonmetastatic prostate cancer that estimates the likelihood of survival at 10 and 15 years postdiagnosis [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Models such as these do not take into account genomic tests or molecular markers. Multiple molecular prognostic tests are emerging specifically with the aim of better risk stratifying males treated for localized prostate cancer. However, the role of these tests in males who have undergone definitive treatment for prostate cancer is not yet as a standard approach. (See

         Although biochemical relapse is an independent risk factor for the development of distant metastases and prostate cancer-specific mortality [

         </a>
         ]. Several models or nomograms to predict outcome following a PSA recurrence are available.

         Data from an analysis of 1997 males treated at Johns Hopkins were initially used to construct the "Pound tables" to predict the likelihood of being free of metastases following a biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. A later analysis of a cohort from this same institution (450 males with a biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy who did not receive adjuvant or salvage therapy before the development of metastatic disease) provided information about 5- and 10-year metastasis-free survival, stratified by pathologic Gleason score and PSA doubling time [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. A somewhat more clinically useful table combining Gleason score and PSA doubling time was presented by this group in 2003 based on 312 males, but it was never published  (

         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. A preliminary report of a later analysis of a slightly larger cohort (513 men) treated at this same institution attempted to identify a PSA cutpoint that indicates the imminent emergence of metastases among males with a PSA doubling time &lt;12 months [

         In some cases, the diagnostic evaluation will reveal a localized recurrence for which salvage local therapy may be appropriate and potentially curative. (See

        <p>
         Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the key component of treatment for males with documented distant metastases. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6941.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of systemic treatment for recurrent or metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer"

        </p>
        <p>
         The natural history of prostate cancer in males with a PSA-only recurrence (without an identifiable locoregional recurrence or distant metastases) after definitive local therapy is often prolonged, and a biochemical recurrence alone is not necessarily an indication for therapy. If a "PSA-only failure" occurs, other clinical characteristics, such as time to biochemical recurrence or PSA doubling time, can be used to counsel patients and to help guide treatment decisions regarding secondary therapy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6950.html" rel="external">
          "Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Definition, natural history, and risk stratification"

          "Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Definition, natural history, and risk stratification", section on 'Specific prognostic factors'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, in many cases, early intervention is pursued if a recurrence is detected, since many recurrences following initial treatment can be successfully treated. Furthermore, treatment of PSA-only recurrences when the PSA is very low can prolong survival. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6933.html" rel="external">
          "Role of systemic therapy in patients with a biochemical recurrence after treatment for localized prostate cancer", section on 'When to initiate ADT-based therapy'

         Clinical practice guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA), American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommend that clinicians monitor patients with localized prostate cancer post-therapy with serial PSA measurements, with the specific intervals tailored to disease risk based on clinicopathologic features [

         There are no randomized trials that have defined the optimal follow-up strategy to detect a local or distant recurrence in males following initial definitive treatment for localized prostate cancer. Regular monitoring of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a highly specific marker for prostate tissue, is widely practiced following definitive therapy. In general, a recurrence is detected by a rise in serum PSA prior to any radiologic or symptomatic evidence of recurrence or progression. The development of a clinically or radiologically overt local recurrence or distant metastases usually occurs significantly later in the natural history of the disease. As such, imaging studies, such as bone scan, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, have no role as screening tests to detect a recurrence in the absence of a rising serum PSA or specific symptoms. These tests may be indicated to evaluate a rising PSA after definitive local treatment. (See

         An important point is that when considering post-treatment surveillance strategies, the impact of therapy for recurrent disease on both overall survival and quality of life should be discussed with the patient, with shared decision making on whether and how to perform post-treatment surveillance. The patient's individual preferences and overall health status are of primary importance in choosing a surveillance strategy after treatment for localized prostate cancer. If a man would not desire additional treatment in the event of a disease recurrence, or if his life expectancy is severely limited due to comorbid conditions, early detection of recurrent disease would only cause psychological distress and could detract from quality of life while not affecting overall survival. In this situation, it may be appropriate to forego some or all components of the post-treatment surveillance strategy.

         Serial evaluation of serum PSA is the mainstay of surveillance testing in males who have undergone definitive therapy for localized prostate cancer. There are no clinical trials that define the optimal frequency for measuring serum PSA. We agree with guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), which recommend that serum PSA be monitored every 6 to 12 months for the first five years and annually thereafter [

         Serum PSA is a sensitive marker for recurrent prostate adenocarcinoma and is elevated in 95 percent of males with recurrent disease. While the use of PSA for cancer screening is controversial, there is little debate that it is an excellent tumor marker in males with an established diagnosis of prostate cancer. (See

         – All prostate tissue is removed during a successful radical prostatectomy. Thus, any detectable PSA in the serum using the standard immunoassay (the typical limit of detection is 0.1 ng/mL) theoretically indicates remaining prostate tissue and might represent persistent or recurrent disease. Ultrasensitive PSA assays may detect lower levels of PSA, but the utility of basing treatment decisions on the much lower levels of PSA detected with these assays remains unclear. (See

          Radiation therapy
         </strong>
         – The definition of a biochemical failure following radiation therapy (RT) is more complicated since there is benign prostate tissue remaining after RT. The American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) has established guidelines to define a PSA recurrence following RT. In the 2005 Phoenix criteria, a PSA rise of 2 ng/mL or more above the nadir PSA is considered the standard definition of a biochemical failure after external beam RT [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. These criteria are discussed in more detail separately. (See

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The interpretation of an increase in serum PSA following RT is further complicated by the observation that serum PSA levels can fluctuate ("bounce") significantly after RT (particularly brachytherapy) before reaching the post-treatment nadir. Thus, increases in PSA must be interpreted with caution, and they do not necessarily indicate a recurrence. The PSA bounce phenomenon is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6950.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Notably, because PSA is a highly specific tumor marker for prostate adenocarcinoma, the absence of a rise in PSA over time (regardless of the initial form of treatment) can provide significant psychological reassurance to males following definitive local treatment that the disease has not recurred.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once a biochemical recurrence is diagnosed, potential approaches include salvage local treatment, systemic therapy, and observation, depending on the site and extent of recurrent disease, and other factors, such as PSA doubling time. The diagnostic evaluation for males with a rising serum PSA after definitive local therapy for prostate cancer is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6929.html" rel="external">

         Even if the site of a recurrence cannot be identified, there may be a prolonged period after the documentation of a PSA recurrence before there is any clinical evidence of disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         While biochemical relapse is an independent risk factor for the development of distant metastases and prostate cancer-specific mortality, a PSA relapse does not necessarily predict the development of metastases or death, and not all biochemical-only recurrences require aggressive therapy.

         The majority of recurrences following radical prostatectomy or RT for localized prostate cancer are asymptomatic and manifested only by a rising serum PSA. While regular clinician visits may serve to reassure the patient, they are of questionable utility in detecting recurrent tumor. Nevertheless, periodic evaluation by a health care provider is important to evaluate potential complications of therapy and for overall health care.

         Monitoring serum PSA, rather than a digital rectal examination (DRE), is the "gold standard" for early detection of a recurrence following definitive local therapy in patients with localized prostate cancer. The value of serial DRE in this setting is unclear. DREs may have some value in detecting a local recurrence if the PSA becomes elevated.
        </p>
        <p>
         Following radical prostatectomy, the prostatic fossa should be empty on DRE. However, DRE is not sensitive enough to detect a local recurrence early [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25-28
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in a retrospective analysis of 501 males who had undergone radical prostatectomy, 72 had a rising PSA [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. Only 4 of the 501 males (0.8 percent) had an abnormal DRE, and the PSA was elevated in each of these cases.
        </p>
        <p>
         In males treated initially with RT, the role of DRE is also unclear. DRE was used routinely prior to the availability of PSA, but this outcome is now seldom reported. Moreover, the clinical significance of a change in DRE following RT is unclear. Furthermore, there is considerable intraobserver variability in assessing change in DRE, which limits the utility of this endpoint.

         The technetium-99 radionuclide bone scan is a sensitive and reliable test for detecting the presence of skeletal metastases in symptomatic patients. In the absence of symptoms, bone scan has been replaced by PSA testing for the early detection of an asymptomatic recurrence.
        </p>
        <p>
         Bone scans are more likely to detect metastases when the serum PSA level is markedly elevated (especially &gt;10 ng/mL) [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. However, almost all males who have a biochemical recurrence after definitive local treatment will have a serum PSA that is much lower (often &lt;1 ng/mL). In this setting, the bone scan is unlikely to identify bony metastases in the absence of symptoms referable to bone. The limited yield of bone scan in this setting can be illustrated by a series of 239 males in whom 414 bone scans were performed [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. The frequency with which positive bone scans were identified increased progressively with the level of serum PSA. For patients with a PSA &lt;10, 10 to 20, 20 to 50, and &gt;50 ng/mL, the frequency of a positive bone scan was 4, 36, 50, and 79 percent, respectively.

          Risk of recurrence and timing
         </strong>
         – In general, a recurrence is detected by a rise in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a highly specific marker for prostate tissue, prior to any radiologic or symptomatic evidence of recurrence or progression. Most relapses after localized treatment happen within five years; however, late recurrences may also occur. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Risk of recurrence and timing'
         </a>
         above.)

         Serial evaluation of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the mainstay of surveillance testing in males who have undergone definitive therapy for localized prostate cancer. We recommend that serum PSA be monitored every 6 to 12 months for the first five years and annually thereafter. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Serum prostate-specific antigen'

         Periodic evaluation by a health care provider is important to evaluate potential complications of therapy and for overall health care. The value of serial digital rectal examination (DRE) in this setting is unclear. DREs may have some value in detecting a local recurrence if the PSA becomes elevated. (See
         <a class="local">
          'History and physical examination'

         above.)

         Imaging studies, such as bone scan, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, have no role as screening tests for recurrence of localized prostate cancer in the absence of a rising serum PSA or specific symptoms.
