(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1022.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation: Overview and management of new-onset atrial fibrillation"</a>.)</p><p>Diagnosis of AF has important implications for acute and long-term management. A missed diagnosis of AF may result in a failure to appropriately anticoagulate for stroke prophylaxis or effectively treat symptoms due to AF, while overdiagnosis of AF may lead to inappropriate testing and therapy including unwarranted anticoagulation with associated risk of major bleeding. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1022.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation: Overview and management of new-onset atrial fibrillation"</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the electrocardiographic (ECG) features of AF. The mechanisms of AF are presented separately.

In most patients, a single 12-lead ECG, recorded while the patient is in AF, is sufficient to secure the diagnosis. Examination of prior ECGs may be helpful, but prior diagnosis (or misdiagnosis) of AF should not influence interpretation of a current ECG. In some patients, AF is detected on ECG recordings from cardiac telemetry, ambulatory ECG monitor (eg, Holter monitor or loop recorder), or cardiac implantable electronic device (permanent pacemaker [PPM] or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [ICD]). Each recording approach has unique capabilities to diagnose AF. In some instances, such as with a CIED, intracardiac recordings can add additional diagnostic certainty, but a single-lead recording from a monitor strip may lack the ability to diagnose AF with certainty. This is often the key limitation for accurately identifying AF with wearable monitors. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/941.html" rel="external">"Permanent cardiac pacing: Overview of devices and indications"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/921.html" rel="external">"Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators: Overview of indications, components, and functions"</a> and <a class="local">'Ambulatory ECG monitoring'</a> below and <a class="local">'Wearable consumer devices'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1088890712"><span class="h2">Our approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While the ECG diagnosis of AF with typical features can be straightforward in patients with characteristic features of AF (see <a class="local">'Key features of atrial fibrillation'</a> below), misdiagnosis of AF is common, as there are a significant number of AF mimics that should be excluded.

Both typical and atypical atrial flutter can mimic AF. In atrial flutter, atrial rates are generally 250 to 350 bpm (but are sometimes as low as 190 to 200 bpm). While atrial flutter with a constant degree of AV block (2:1, 3:1, 4:1) typically results in regular rhythms, atrial flutter with variable AV conduction is irregular. Some patients with AF also have episodes of atrial flutter.

The term is inaccurate and may impact care as there are differences in the short- and long-term management for AF and atrial flutter. When it is difficult to distinguish these conditions, we use alternate language such as "The atrial activity is unclear and coarse, but the likely diagnosis is AF. However, atrial flutter with variable conduction cannot be excluded." Some patients have both of these conditions. If an ECG catches a transition between AF and atrial flutter, this transition should be noted and not labeled as "atrial fibrillation/flutter."</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The presence of <strong>sinus P waves</strong> (upright in II, inverted in aVR, and biphasic in V1) suggests an underlying sinus rhythm. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Sinus arrhythmia</strong> – If all P waves are sinus, <strong>variation in PP </strong>(by &gt;0.16 seconds) with a relatively constant PR suggests sinus arrhythmia  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef132171" href="/d/graphic/132171.html" rel="external">waveform 11</a>).

Numerous apparent microreentrant circuits within the atria may generate multiple waves of impulses that compete with or extinguish each other in what is termed "fibrillatory conduction." The sinus node is suppressed and cannot activate the atrium. Mechanisms causing this abnormal pattern of atrial electrical activity are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16402.html" rel="external">"Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation"</a>.)</p><p>Rapid, irregular, and variable fibrillatory (f) waves may be coarse (amplitude ≥1 mm) or fine (&lt;1 mm) and may not be identified. Some studies have found that fine AF is associated with older age, but age ranges for coarse and fine AF overlap widely [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. The amplitude of f waves does not correlate with left atrial size [<a href="#rid1">1,3</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis for AF is discussed above.

As rapid and irregular atrial impulses bombard the AV node, some impulses occur in such rapid succession that they are blocked due to the refractoriness of the AV node, resulting in irregular impulse conduction through the AV node to the ventricular myocardium via the His-Purkinje system. High frequency of atrial stimuli reaching the AV node does not lead to high frequency of AV conduction, as frequent impulses may cause "concealed" depolarization (ie, not evident on the surface ECG) impairing AV conduction. The large number of atrial impulses arriving at the AV node compete with each other, interfering with their penetration into and through the AV node, leaving this tissue variably refractory.</p><p>While the ventricular rate in adults with AF is usually 90 to 170 bpm, in young, untreated individuals, rates are 160 to 200 bpm, reflecting the maximal rate at which the AV node can conduct (as determined by its refractory period in lieu of concealed conduction). Increases in the ventricular response rate to over 200 bpm may occur if the refractory period of the AV node is shortened, as with an increase in circulating catecholamines (eg, sympathetic stimulation or pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism, or conduction down a manifest accessory pathway). A decrease in the ventricular response rate occurs when the refractory period of the AV node is increased (eg, with aging, conduction system disease, drugs, or enhanced vagal tone) or AV conduction otherwise slows.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H938639862"><span class="h3">With aberrant conduction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A common cause for QRS widening during AF is aberrant conduction, which is a rate-related change in conduction. Most aberrancy is tachycardia-dependent, although bradycardia-dependent aberrancy does occur [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The aberrant conduction in AF involves a rate-related (tachycardia-induced) change in conduction, typically a functional bundle branch block; right bundle branch block (RBBB) is more common than left bundle branch block (LBBB), as the RBB has a longer refractory period than the LBB.</p><p>An important property of the conducting system and myocardium is that refractoriness is longer at slow rates and shorter at faster rates. The refractoriness of the conducting system varies on a beat-by-beat basis and is related to the coupling interval of the preceding beat. As such, a long coupling interval leads to prolongation of bundle branch refractoriness (typically R&gt;L), and if the next beat comes in early (ie, a long-short cycle), the refractoriness of the RBB leads to a RBBB configuration and QRS widening that resembles a premature ventricular complex (PVC). This pattern of long-short cycle typically leads to RBBB morphology (known as Ashman phenomenon [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]) and can occur during sinus rhythm with appropriately timed premature atrial complexes (PACs)  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef132178" href="/d/graphic/132178.html" rel="external">waveform 18</a>) as well as during AF  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef132179" href="/d/graphic/132179.html" rel="external">waveform 19</a>). Aberrancy with LBBB morphology is less common but can occur. The QRS of aberrant beats typically exhibits an upstroke similar to those of other native supraventricular beats in leads other than V1 to V2, while PVCs typically exhibit markedly different morphology from supraventricular beats in multiple leads, as shown for sinus rhythm  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef132178" href="/d/graphic/132178.html" rel="external">waveform 18</a>). The approach to evaluating wide QRS complex tachycardia to distinguish supraventricular tachycardia from ventricular tachycardia is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/920.html" rel="external">"Wide QRS complex tachycardias: Approach to the diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>During AF, Ashman phenomenon is associated with frequent isolated wide-complex aberrantly conducted beats. However, aberrantly conducted beats can also occur in couplets or longer nonsustained runs that can resemble ventricular tachycardia  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef132179" href="/d/graphic/132179.html" rel="external">waveform 19</a>). In these situations, there is no longer a long-short cycle but rather short-short cycles of rapid AF. In this case, the functional RBBB and activation down the LBBB is followed by partial penetration up the right bundle, leading to RBBB of the subsequent beat. This represents "concealed conduction" up the right bundle (ie, not evident on the surface ECG, which solely reflects atrial and ventricular activity). This can continue for a number of consecutive beats until functional BBB resolves either despite continued short cycle length or when the cycle length lengthens. As such, AF with concealed perpetuated aberrant conduction can resemble ventricular tachycardia, and it is critical to distinguish ventricular tachycardia from sustained aberrancy. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2547718683"><span class="h3">With Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When AF is associated with ventricular preexcitation due to anterograde conduction down an accessory pathway before conduction occurs via the AV node in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW), the ventricular response rate may be very rapid and may exceed 280 to 300 bpm  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef132180" href="/d/graphic/132180.html" rel="external">waveform 20</a>), since impulse activation bypasses the AV node. Preexcited AF is facilitated when the refractory period of the accessory pathway is very short. Accessory pathway tissue differs from that of the AV node. Specifically, the accessory pathway does not exhibit postrepolarization refractoriness but rather conducts rapidly as the tissue is dependent on sodium (rather than calcium) channel activity. </p><p>Conduction down the accessory pathway typically results in a slurred QRS upstroke (ie, "delta" wave), and the QRS morphology depends on the location of the pathway and its insertion into the ventricular myocardium. The QRS complex is usually wide, with rapid activation down the accessory pathway into ventricular muscle, often in concert with some conduction down the AV node and His-Purkinje system leading to possible QRS fusion. The more conduction proceeds through the accessory pathway, the wider and more slurred the QRS complex. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/962.html" rel="external">"Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Anatomy, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Electrocardiographic findings'</a>.)</p><p>A distinguishing feature of AF with preexcitation is the relationship between heart rate and QRS duration; the faster the rate, the wider the QRS. At times, it can resemble ventricular tachycardia (based on its appearance and, often, the presence of precordial concordance). While the rhythm is irregularly irregular, variations may be difficult to measure at extremely fast rates. The clinical significance of AF with rapid ventricular response in patients with WPW is discussed separately.

Automatic computer interpretation of the ECG is common practice, with over 100 million automatic ECG interpretations yearly. Limited data are available on the accuracy of automatic computer interpretation for AF, but an estimated 10 to 30 percent of the computer ECG interpretations may misdiagnose AF, and such misdiagnosis may be frequently missed by clinicians [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. Such misdiagnosis can lead to inappropriate interventions and therapies. The methodological approaches that computers utilize to determine whether or not AF is present are not well clarified. Insufficient overreading may be a growing problem as formal ECG interpretation becomes less of a focus in many training programs.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H601148962"><span class="h2">Ambulatory ECG monitoring</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ambulatory ECG monitors (Holter, event, patch-based monitors, and implantable loop recorders) are a commonly employed clinical method to detect occult AF. Each has an important utility but also key limitations, the main one being that they are limited to one-, two-, or three-channel recordings. Given the limited number of leads and nonconventional electrode placements, each monitor looks slightly different when demonstrating a cardiac rhythm, including AF. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/958.html" rel="external">"Ambulatory ECG monitoring"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1865788588"><span class="h2">Wearable consumer devices</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There has been growing use of wearable consumer devices such as smart watches and other devices that can connect to smart phones [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>] to monitor heart rate and rhythm [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. The smart watches and other fitness bands passively measure pulse rate from the wrist using photoplethysmography. The most recent generations of the Apple Watch are capable of generating a continuous ECG lead tracing, which can automatically detect AF. The patient applies their fingertip to the “digital crown” button, which contains a titanium electrode; a chromium silicon nitride is later applied to a sapphire crystal on the back of the watch, in contact with the wrist. The ECG app records a tracing from a closed circuit, analogous to lead I. The KardiaMobile is another phone-based monitoring system that can generate a single-lead recording by interfacing with a separate electrode.</p><p>While these widely used electronic devices have potential capabilities for detecting AF, and algorithms are improving, they are subject to limitations. Generally, the methodology (often proprietary) monitors the irregularity in ventricular response rates but does not monitor the presence and type of atrial activation. Also, some devices may require a threshold episode duration (eg, 30 seconds) to detect an arrhythmia. These limitations are likely to limit the sensitivity and specificity of these devices in detecting and diagnosing AF. Thus, all patients with suspected AF require clinician review of recordings on clinically approved ECG equipment, as described above.
