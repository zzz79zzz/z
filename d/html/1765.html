         Diet and physical activity are critically important in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Basic principles of nutritional management, however, are often poorly understood by both clinicians and people with type 1 diabetes.
        </p>
        <p>
         The nutrition prescription for adults with type 1 diabetes should aim to optimally address the "ABCs" of diabetes management: glycemia as measured by glycated hemoglobin (
         <strong>
          A
         </strong>
         1C) and glucose monitoring,

         lood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
         <strong>
          c
         </strong>
         holesterol. The prescription must also be tailored for the individual to address diabetes complications and other concomitant conditions.
        </p>

         The role of nutrition and the development of a medical nutrition therapy (MNT) plan for a person with type 1 diabetes are discussed here.

         Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is the process by which the nutrition prescription is customized for each individual based on medical, lifestyle, and personal factors. It is an integral component of diabetes management and diabetes self-management education [

         </span>
         Variations in food intake, particularly carbohydrate intake, can result in erratic blood glucose levels and hypoglycemia in people with type 1 diabetes. Intensive insulin regimens, which combine basal insulin with boluses or injections of rapid-acting pre-meal insulins, allow for some flexibility in the carbohydrate content of meals. In one study of people receiving intensive insulin therapy, as an example, the total amount of carbohydrate in the meal did not influence glycemic response if pre-meal insulin was adjusted for variations in the carbohydrate content of the meal [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. People who use rapid-acting insulin analogs by injection or via an insulin pump may need to take additional bolus insulin with snacks that contain carbohydrates.
        </p>
        <p>
         For people receiving fixed doses of insulin, however, day-to-day consistency in the amount of carbohydrate and source of carbohydrate at meals and snacks is especially important. Carbohydrate consistency for these individuals has been associated with lower A1C levels, whereas day-to-day variations in calorie, protein, or fat intakes were not significantly related to A1C [
         <a href="#rid15">

         There are several meal planning approaches to achieve carbohydrate consistency, including basic and advanced carbohydrate counting, the exchange system, and sample menus. The best approach for an individual is determined by an assessment of their lifestyle and learning capabilities.

         </span>
         In its simplest form, the goal of basic carbohydrate counting is to support glycemic management by implementing a consistent pattern of carbohydrate consumption with meals and snacks day to day. Since carbohydrate intake directly determines postprandial blood glucose, management of carbohydrate consumption and appropriate insulin adjustments for identified quantities of carbohydrate can improve glycemia [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         People with diabetes who have been instructed in carbohydrate consistency consume a predetermined total amount of carbohydrate at meals and snacks each day, calculated in grams of carbohydrate per food portion. The calculated carbohydrate intake is derived from an optimal percentage of total calories from carbohydrates, based on nutrition goals and the usual eating pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
         The person with type 1 diabetes needs to be comfortable with simple arithmetic computations. Most people will require specific training in carbohydrate counting, if possible by a registered dietitian, to set appropriate meal and snack targets and learn to measure or estimate portion sizes and read food labels  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51729" href="/z/d/graphic/51729.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         The exchange system was developed in 1950 by the American Dietetic Association (now called the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics), the American Diabetes Association (ADA), and the United States Public Health Service as an educational tool to provide consistency in meal planning and allow a wider variety of food choices for people with diabetes [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Originally, the exchange lists categorized foods into six groups: starch/bread, meat and meat substitutes, vegetables, fruit, milk, and fat. Each portion of food listed within a group was "exchangeable" because it contained approximately the same nutritional value in terms of calories, carbohydrate, protein, and fat.
        </p>
        <p>
         The food groups have been more recently categorized into three groups to simplify the teaching of carbohydrate consistency concepts. These three groups are carbohydrate, meat and meat substitutes, and fat  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52063" href="/z/d/graphic/52063.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         and
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75559" href="/z/d/graphic/75559.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). The exchange lists also identify foods that are good sources of fiber and foods that have a high sodium content [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The exchange system meal planning approach can be used as a tool to help people achieve calorie, fat, and carbohydrate goals. However, many individuals find that it is a complicated system to learn.

         Sample menus are defined meal menus that specify the time and amounts of food to be eaten at each meal and snack. For people with type 1 diabetes, menus are developed to meet calorie needs and provide consistent carbohydrate intake at meals and snacks. Dietitians typically tailor the menus to incorporate food preferences and medical nutrition therapy (MNT) goals. Sample menus are created after review of a person's typical food intake; they are best suited for people who have fairly routine eating habits and who do not eat a wide variety of foods. They also are appropriate for people who need structured guidance on what to eat.

         At a more advanced level, carbohydrate counting focuses on adjustment of insulin dosing based on anticipated carbohydrate intake. There are different methods that can be used to calculate the insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17

         ]. Calculating the ratio based on individually recorded data is more accurate than estimating it using the 450 to 500 rule.

         – When initiating advanced carbohydrate counting, it is helpful to log food intake, insulin doses, and activity. The individual is asked to record time of meals and snacks, the amount and type of food eaten, amount of carbohydrate consumed, insulin doses, physical activity, and glucose monitoring results. People should first practice eating usual amounts of carbohydrate at meals and snacks so that baseline insulin requirements can be matched to the carbohydrate intake using pre- and postprandial glucose testing results. When pre- and postprandial glucose levels are in the target range, then insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios can be determined as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Divide the number of grams of carbohydrate eaten at the meal by the number of units of pre-meal insulin (eg, 45 g carbohydrate divided by 3 units of insulin is a 1:15 ratio). Insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios can vary with time of day and are affected by stress, illness, and variations in physical activity.

         When consuming high amounts of fat and protein, estimating insulin dosing based only on the carbohydrate content of the meal will be insufficient for many individuals with type 1 diabetes.

The higher fat content meals significantly reduced early (1 to 2 hour) postprandial glycemia and increased late (3 to 5 hour) postprandial glycemia, irrespective of the type of fat added (saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated). With higher fat meals, dual-wave insulin boluses, with larger amounts of insulin delivered in the late postprandial interval, improved glycemia.

If the person had a pre-meal glucose of 180 mg/dL and wanted to correct to a pre-meal glucose of 100 mg/dL, then the person would take an extra 2 units of rapid-acting insulin to correct to the target of 100 mg/dL and add the number of units needed to cover the carbohydrates consumed.

         Exercise is a significant component of diabetes management. Benefits of exercise include improved glycemia, weight management, reduction in comorbidities (hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease), improved mood, and quality of life. We encourage most adults with diabetes to perform at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week (30 to 60 minutes on most days of the week). A shorter duration of more vigorous aerobic exercise (75 minutes per week of jogging 9.6 km/hour) is an alternative for physically fit individuals who have been regularly exercising. People with comorbid conditions should discuss an appropriate exercise regimen with their health care providers. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1777.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The timing of exercise in relation to insulin dose, type, mode of delivery, and time of injection should be considered. People with diabetes should check glucose levels before and after exercising, especially in the beginning of an exercise program, to evaluate their glycemic response to exercise and to adjust insulin and carbohydrate regimens, as needed, to prevent hypoglycemia. Adults who learn to self-adjust their diet or insulin to accommodate exercise can achieve near-normal A1C levels without undue hypoglycemia. For people who are trying to lose weight, it is preferable to adjust insulin doses rather than increase food intake to compensate for exercise. Glycemic management during exercise is reviewed in more detail separately. (See

         Weight gain is a potential adverse effect of intensive diabetes therapy in type 1 diabetes, and it occurs when insulin dosing matches nutritional intake (particularly when excess calories are ingested) and glycosuria is eliminated [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24,25
         </a>

         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. The mean increase in weight in patients in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) was 5.1 kg in the intensive therapy group and 2.4 kg in the conventional therapy group [

          25

        </p>
        <p>
         If blood glucose is high enough to promote glycosuria, then lowering calorie intake by an additional 250 to 300 calories per day is necessary to prevent weight gain with intensification of diabetes therapy [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>

Other strategies to minimize weight gain with intensive therapy are to reduce insulin doses preferentially for patterns of hypoglycemia rather than increasing meal size or adding an undesired snack. To reduce calories further, it is helpful to reduce fat intake and try to keep carbohydrate intake consistent to minimize risk of hypoglycemia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Weight gain is most prominent in women, especially those with high A1C values at baseline, and has been a cause of nonadherence with insulin therapy. As examples, approximately 30 percent of women with type 1 diabetes in one study occasionally omitted insulin injections intentionally [

         Saturated fat and trans fat contribute to coronary heart disease, while mono- and polyunsaturated fats are relatively protective. Saturated fats (eg, in meats, cheese, ice cream) can be replaced with mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (eg, in fish, olive oil, nuts). Trans fatty acid consumption should be kept as low as possible. High-fat diets are associated with greater insulin requirements. (See

         An automatic reduction of dietary protein intake (eg, 15 to 19 percent of calories) below usual protein intake in patients who develop diabetic kidney disease is not recommended. The role of dietary protein restriction is uncertain, particularly in view of problems with adherence in people already being treated with saturated fat and simple carbohydrate restriction. Furthermore, it is uncertain if a low-protein diet is significantly additive to other measures aimed at reducing cardiovascular risk and preserving renal function, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and aggressive control of blood pressure and blood glucose.

         Foods containing the same amount of carbohydrate can have significantly different glycemic effects. These differences led to the development of the concepts of glycemic index and glycemic load:

         Glycemic index is an in vivo measure of the relative impact of carbohydrate-containing foods on blood glucose. A particular food's glycemic index is determined by evaluating the incremental rise in blood glucose after ingestion of a portion of the test food containing 50 g of carbohydrate, compared with the same amount of carbohydrate from a reference food, which is usually white bread or glucose [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37,38
         </a>
         ]. Some examples of low glycemic index foods include non-starchy vegetables, nuts, legumes, and certain grains such as barley and converted rice. High glycemic index foods include potatoes, candies, white bread, and other refined products made from grains.

         Glycemic load is the product of the glycemic index value of a food and its total carbohydrate content [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39,40
         </a>
         ]. The concept of the glycemic load was developed because the blood glucose response is influenced not only by the quality of the carbohydrate consumed (ie, the glycemic index), but also by the quantity of carbohydrate consumed.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In systematic reviews and randomized trials, low glycemic index diets in individuals with type 1 diabetes or at risk for diabetes had equivocal impact on A1C compared with other diets, leading to uncertainty in their utility over other diets in clinical care [

         Increasing fiber intake preferably through food (vegetables, fruits, legumes, and intact whole grains) may help in modestly lowering A1C and at the same time will promote eating lower glycemic index foods. Observational studies (eg, The European Diabetes Centers [EURODIAB] Prospective Complications Study and the Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes (CACTI) study) showed an inverse association between fiber intake and A1C in adults with type 1 diabetes [

         In people receiving fixed doses of short- and intermediate-acting insulins, meal timing at regular intervals is important for attaining glycemic goals and avoiding hypoglycemia [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,16,48
         </a>
         ]. If the amount and timing of carbohydrate intake varies widely, blood glucose profiles fluctuate, with little chance of achieving target A1C values without a substantial risk of hypoglycemia. Insulin analogs mitigate this risk somewhat and allow for more flexibility in meal schedules and content. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1796.html" rel="external">
          "Management of blood glucose in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus"

        </p>
        <p>
         An alternative approach to a fixed mealtime and carbohydrate intake is to determine how much short- or rapid-acting insulin is needed to cover a certain amount of carbohydrate. People vary considerably in the amount of insulin required to cover a set amount of carbohydrate; some adults need a different carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio at different meals. Once the ratio is established, people with type 1 diabetes have flexibility to vary the amount of carbohydrate ingested at particular meals. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Advanced carbohydrate counting'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         As an example, a person may have been told to eat 60 g of carbohydrate with their evening meal and precede this with 4 units of rapid-acting insulin. This means that they are using 1 unit to cover every 15 g of carbohydrate and can decrease their insulin dose proportionately if they plan to eat less carbohydrate at a meal. Facility with carbohydrate counting strategies is important in making these adjustments.

         Motivating a person to make a long-term commitment to dietary alterations is a challenge. While nutritional counseling by clinicians in the diabetes health care team is essential, ultimately individuals determine what they are willing or able to do to achieve improved glycemic control.
        </p>
        <p>
         The dietary prescription should begin by determining the patient's dietary preferences, physical activity patterns, medication dosing and adherence, social support, education level, time, financial constraints, and other challenges, as well as the need and/or desire for weight management. A dietary history, along with several days of food records, is helpful in an assessment of caloric intake, dietary content, and carbohydrate consistency. Recognizing that this is not always possible in the context of the clinician visit, a brief 24-hour recall will usually provide an assessment that will serve as a basis for initial changes and can be improved upon at follow-up visits.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once sufficient data are obtained, changes can be advised to move toward a more ideal diet and eating pattern. It is important to remember that the more marked the changes are from what the patient likes to eat, the less likely that the patient will adhere with the dietary prescription [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. The individual's own food records and motivation to learn can be helpful in guiding decisions for the type of eating pattern (low carbohydrate, low fat, Mediterranean) and meal planning approach; choices between a detailed exchange system, sample menus, or basic or more advanced carbohydrate counting approaches can be made on an individual basis based on an assessment of lifestyle and learning capabilities [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         If possible, teaching is done in a setting where real food can be used, so that the patient can become familiar with household measures and can improve their ability to estimate the carbohydrate content of foods commonly eaten. This is often best accomplished in dietary workshops for small groups of people [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         During follow-up visits, it is important for the clinician to ask specifically about diet and physical activity to reinforce their importance. Ideally, a patient should be able to quote their nutrition and exercise prescription in detail. People with type 1 diabetes, if possible, should specify how many grams of carbohydrate they aim to eat at each meal and snack during the day. Most adults should also be able to specify their insulin correction factor and carbohydrate-to-insulin ratios for meals. All people with type 1 diabetes should be well trained in methods to prevent and treat hypoglycemia.

          Medical nutrition therapy
         </strong>
         – Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is the process by which the nutrition prescription is customized for each individual based on medical, lifestyle, and personal factors. It is an integral component of diabetes management and diabetes self-management education. Key aspects of MNT for people with type 1 diabetes include (see

          Meal planning and insulin dosing
         </strong>
         – Maintaining a consistent day-to-day carbohydrate intake at meals and snacks allows insulin adjustments to be made to usual carbohydrate intake. Learning to adjust insulin in response to hyperglycemia and variations in carbohydrate intake at meals allows for more flexibility; further adjusting insulin dosing for high-fat and high-protein meals is a more advanced skill.

          Weight management
         </strong>
         – Modifying caloric intake, along with appropriate behavioral interventions, is important for the patient with type 1 diabetes who has overweight or obesity, or who has a high glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and glycosuria and is about to intensify diabetes management. An easy-to-use

         for roughly estimating caloric intake associated with weight maintenance uses the patient's age, sex, height, weight, and usual level of physical activity. To estimate caloric needs for weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds per week, subtract 500 to 1000 calories per day from weight maintenance calories. (See

          Macronutrient composition
         </strong>
         – The impact of specific dietary composition on glycemic control and cardiovascular risk remains uncertain. The optimal macronutrient composition of the diet for people with diabetes should be individualized, based upon weight loss goals, other comorbidities and metabolic needs (eg, hypertension, dyslipidemia, nephropathy), and food preferences. A diet that includes carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and low-fat milk is encouraged. (See

          Eating disorders
         </strong>
         – Eating disorders and insulin omission are common among young females with type 1 diabetes, manifested most commonly as bulimia and weight loss due to purposely missed or reduced insulin doses; poor glycemic control and increased retinopathy are consequences. (See

          Dietary adherence
         </strong>
         – Promoting dietary adherence is a challenge. A registered dietitian can be helpful in developing and monitoring a nutrition prescription. Success can be fostered by tailoring the nutrition prescription to the individual's preferences, psychosocial condition, and lifestyle; reviewing food diaries; and providing positive feedback. (See
