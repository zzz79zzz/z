However, concern regarding transmission of blood-borne pathogens and efforts at cost containment caused a re-examination of transfusion practices in the 1980s. The 1988 National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference on Perioperative Red Blood Cell Transfusions suggested that no single criterion should be used as an indication for red cell component therapy, and that multiple factors related to the patient's clinical status and oxygen delivery needs should be considered [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>During the subsequent 35 years, a large body of clinical evidence has been generated, resulting in the publication of many guidelines for RBC transfusion in different settings. (See <a class="local">'Review of guidelines'</a> below.)</p><p>Over these years, a large number of randomized trials have been performed in different patient populations, allowing for guidelines to be based on prospective clinical trial data rather than on observational data. A common theme of these transfusion threshold guidelines is the need to balance the benefit of treating anemia with the desire to avoid unnecessary transfusion, with its associated costs and potential harms. This requires considerable diagnostic skill and acumen on the part of physicians ordering transfusions.</p><p>This topic reviews indications and thresholds for RBC transfusion in adults. Separate topics discuss indications and thresholds for other populations and other aspects of transfusion:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Newborns</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5041.html" rel="external">"Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in the neonate"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Children</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5910.html" rel="external">"Red blood cell transfusion in infants and children: Indications"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Surgery</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112610.html" rel="external">"Intraoperative transfusion and administration of clotting factors", section on 'Red blood cells'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Trauma/massive transfusion</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7931.html" rel="external">"Massive blood transfusion"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/113837.html" rel="external">"Initial management of moderate to severe hemorrhage in the adult trauma patient"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hematologic disorders</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90145.html" rel="external">"Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease: Indications and transfusion techniques"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7118.html" rel="external">"Management of thalassemia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pretransfusion testing</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7953.html" rel="external">"Pretransfusion testing for red blood cell transfusion"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Practical aspects of administration</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7939.html" rel="external">"Practical aspects of red blood cell transfusion in adults: Storage, processing, modifications, and infusion"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H89427174"><span class="h1">RATIONALE FOR TRANSFUSION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h2">Role of blood in oxygen delivery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Blood delivers oxygen to the tissues, and the vast majority of oxygen delivered is bound to hemoglobin in RBCs. Thus, anemia has the potential to reduce oxygen delivery and, most importantly, end-organ oxygen utilization. However, most patients are able to increase tissue oxygen delivery as well as the extraction of oxygen from the RBCs over a range of hemoglobin concentrations. </p><p>The major physiologic considerations relevant to anemic patients are the degree to which oxygen delivery to the tissues is adequate, the extent of oxygen extraction at the tissue level, and whether compensatory mechanisms for maintaining oxygen delivery and utilization will become overwhelmed or deleterious [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1623.html" rel="external">"Oxygen delivery and consumption"</a>.)</p><p>Oxygen delivery (DO<sub>2</sub>) is determined by the formula:</p><div class="formulaContainer"><div class="formula"><p class="bulletIndent1">DO<sub>2</sub> = cardiac output × arterial oxygen content</p></div></div><p></p><p>In healthy patients, DO<sub>2</sub> can generally be raised by increasing cardiac output (via increased heart rate or stroke volume). In critically ill patients, DO<sub>2</sub> may become more dependent on arterial oxygen content, and end-organ oxygen utilization can become pathologically dependent upon DO<sub>2 </sub>(supply dependence). Determining what hemoglobin level is adequate in individual clinical scenarios has been the goal of a large number of clinical studies and randomized trials.</p><p>At rest, there is a large reserve in oxygen delivery, since the rate of delivery normally exceeds consumption by a factor of four. Thus, if intravascular volume is maintained during bleeding and cardiovascular status is not impaired, oxygen delivery theoretically will be adequate until the hematocrit falls below 10 percent, since greater cardiac output, rightward shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve, and increased oxygen extraction can compensate for the decrease in arterial oxygen content  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68984" href="/d/graphic/68984.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>These predictions were confirmed in a study in which healthy resting individuals underwent acute isovolemic reduction of their hemoglobin to 5 g/dL (equivalent to a hematocrit of approximately 15 percent) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Though some individuals did develop electrocardiogram (ECG) changes consistent with myocardial ischemia, there was little evidence of inadequate oxygen delivery/utilization, and the fall in hemoglobin was associated with progressive increases in stroke volume and heart rate (and therefore cardiac output). Heart rate was found to increase linearly in response to the acute isovolemic anemia [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Cognitive function measured by reaction time and immediate memory was impaired when the hemoglobin concentration was reduced to 5 to 6 g/dL [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>The oxygen-carrying capacity of blood does not directly reflect the delivery of oxygen to tissues nor the extraction of oxygen from RBCs at the tissue level. Although techniques to measure tissue oxygenation are under development, they are not yet ready for routine clinical use [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>The preceding considerations represent the optimal clinical response in healthy adults. However, blood transfusion is usually administered to patients who are ill with underlying comorbidities, and there is concern that compensatory mechanisms may be impaired in critically ill patients, particularly in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. It has been argued in the past that this might justify prophylactic transfusion to maintain a hemoglobin &gt;10 g/dL. However, data in favor of this hemoglobin target level are lacking. To the contrary, multicenter randomized controlled trials indicate that compared with a target hemoglobin of 10 g/dL, target hemoglobin values of 7 to 8 g/dL are associated with equivalent or better outcomes in most patient populations. (See <a class="local">'Overview of our approach'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H430736121"><span class="h2">Impact of anemia on morbidity and mortality</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While numerous observational studies have shown an association between anemia and increased mortality, it is not clear that correction of anemia will improve mortality. The following studies illustrate the deleterious effect of severe postoperative anemia:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a study of 1958 patients who declined blood transfusion for religious reasons, the odds of death rose as the preoperative hemoglobin fell, and the odds of death were much greater in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a subset analysis of 300 postoperative patients, a hemoglobin between 7 and 8 g/dL appeared to have no immediate adverse effect on mortality, whereas there was a clear risk of postoperative death when the hemoglobin fell below 7 g/dL [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Similar results were observed in a 2014 analysis in 293 patients [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. The combined 30-day in-hospital mortality for patients with various postoperative hemoglobin levels were [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>7.1 to 8.0 (n = 232): 0.9 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>5.1 to 7.0 (n = 217): 9.2 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>3.1 to 5.0 (n = 101): 26.7 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>≤3.0 (n = 37): 62.1 percent </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a follow-up study of the same 1958 postoperative patients, one-third died in the hospital [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The time from surgery to death was long, suggesting that there would be time to intervene (median of three days from surgery to hemoglobin nadir and two days from hemoglobin nadir to death). There was not a single etiology that was predictive of mortality for these severely anemic patients. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A retrospective database review of 310,311 veterans &gt;65 years of age undergoing non-cardiac surgery evaluated the association of preoperative anemia with mortality or cardiac events [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The adjusted odds of death or cardiac events correlated inversely with the preoperative hematocrit. Even mild anemia (HCT 36.0 to 38.9) was associated with a 10 percent increase in events; this rose to a 52 percent increased risk with more severe anemia (HCT 18.0 to 20.9).</p><p></p><p>While these and other studies suggest that severe anemia is associated with poor outcome, data from randomized trials have shown that more aggressive correction of anemia does not necessarily improve these outcomes [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. Clinical trials are needed to establish whether anemia is merely a marker for more severe underlying disease or a direct cause of poor outcomes.</p><p>Over the long term, use of a restrictive transfusion strategy leads to fewer transfusions without an increase in major complications of anemia. This was demonstrated in a cohort study involving electronic health record data for nearly 450,000 adults who were discharged from the hospital with anemia [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The proportion of patients who were discharged with moderate anemia increased over time due to greater use of restrictive transfusion strategies; despite this change, survival was comparable in those discharged with moderate anemia compared with those with higher discharge hemoglobin levels earlier in the study. Likewise, readmission rates were similar between the two groups. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that this tolerance of lower discharge hemoglobin levels applied to a variety of patient groups and persisted for at least six months after discharge. These results further support the use of restrictive strategies. (See <a class="local">'Restrictive transfusion strategy for most stable patients'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H89426930"><span class="h1">RISKS AND COMPLICATIONS OF TRANSFUSION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The risks and potential long-term complications of RBC transfusion, and strategies to minimize these risks and complications, are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Infection</strong> – Infection is a risk of transfusion since certain viruses, bacteria, and parasites can be transmitted if they are present in donor blood and if they escape detection by screening assays. In addition, some studies have reported that transfusion-mediated immunosuppression may lead to increased risk of postoperative bacterial infection, although a 2021 meta-analysis of randomized trials did not find an increased risk of such infection [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7950.html" rel="external">"Blood donor screening: Medical history", section on 'Screening for infectious risks'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7946.html" rel="external">"Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing", section on 'Infectious disease screening and surveillance'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Immunologic reactions</strong> – Allergic, hemolytic, and other immunologic transfusion reactions can occur in any patient and are more common in multiply-transfused patients.

As noted in a 2019 editorial, transfusion should be considered as a short-term treatment with a mixed risk-benefit profile; it does not substitute for specific treatment directed at the underlying cause of anemia, which must be determined and addressed for the individual patient [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The evaluation of anemia is summarized in an overview topic and expanded in several topics included with the overview. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7133.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to anemia in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Although the hemoglobin threshold chosen as a transfusion trigger is based on results from clinical trials, we emphasize that clinical judgment as to when to transfuse each particular patient is required. We consider many factors in deciding whether to transfuse patients with anemia, rather than basing the decision solely on the presence or absence of symptoms or on a specified hemoglobin level. The final decision to transfuse should incorporate the clinical status, comorbidities, and the individual wishes of the patient. It is also important to recognize that lower hemoglobin thresholds have not been tested in most clinical settings and may be tolerated by many patients. </p><p>Our approach is consistent with that used in the 2023 Association for the Advancement of Blood &amp; Biotherapies (AABB) Red Blood Cell Transfusion International Guidelines, which one of us coauthored [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. These 2023 AABB Guidelines revise and augment prior AABB Guidelines that were published in 2012 and 2016 [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>].

This practice is based on the results of multiple clinical trials  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef93934" href="/d/graphic/93934.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The specific threshold is based on the value established as safe in the clinical trial with the population that most closely resembles the patient. <span class="utd-adt-cnt utd-adt-pathwys utd-content-120415">(Related Pathway(s):  <a class="utd-content-120415" href="/pathway/120415?topicRef=7948&amp;source=see_link">Anemia: Indications for red blood cell transfusion in hospitalized adults</a>.)</span> </p><p>Some patients will remain asymptomatic from anemia at hemoglobin values that are lower than our recommended threshold; conversely, transfusion at a higher hemoglobin level is often appropriate for symptomatic patients (see <a class="local">'Symptomatic patient'</a> below). In addition, threshold-based transfusion generally is not appropriate for patients requiring massive transfusion. The final decision regarding transfusion must take into account the patient's wishes and clinical status. </p><p>Major exceptions to the use of a threshold of 7 to 8 g/dL include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptomatic patients may be transfused at higher hemoglobin levels to treat their symptoms.

The 30-day mortality rate was unaffected by adoption of a restrictive rather than a liberal practice (7.8 versus 7.8 percent) despite reduction in the number of units transfused (from 42 to 31 units per 100 patients). A subsequent study in 445,371 adults who were discharged from this hospital system found that there was an increase in the prevalence of moderate anemia (7 to 10 g/dL) after discharge; but subsequent transfusion, rehospitalization, and mortality did not rise during the six months after discharge, and overall RBC transfusions declined during a four-year period [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. </p><p>In deciding which restrictive threshold to use, we favor applying specific thresholds as closely as possible to the patient population in which they were established in randomized trials, rather than applying a single threshold to all patients  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef93934" href="/d/graphic/93934.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Review of guidelines'</a> below.)</p><p>As an example, a hemoglobin threshold of 7 g/dL may be safer for patients with gastrointestinal bleeding because it reduces portal pressure and decreases the chance of rebleeding, whereas a threshold of 8 g/dL for patients with preexisting coronary artery disease may provide better oxygen delivery to a vulnerable myocardium. In contrast, the distinction between using a threshold of 7 g/dL for hemodynamically stable patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 8 g/dL for hemodynamically stable medical and surgical patients not in the ICU is based solely on the values used in randomized trials; we do not know if these two populations (ICU and medical/surgical) are biologically or physiologically distinct and truly have different hemoglobin requirements.</p><p>Evidence in specific populations is discussed in the sections below.

We agree with the premise that symptomatic anemia should be treated with transfusion in patients with hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL, regardless of the hemoglobin level, provided that the symptoms are severe enough and are clearly related to the anemia rather than the underlying condition. It is reasonable to defer transfusion for some symptomatic individuals with a hemoglobin between 7 and 10 g/dL; an example would be a young person without comorbidities or coronary artery disease whose hemoglobin is 8 g/dL, is not expected to decline further, and/or is expected to increase their hemoglobin within one or two weeks.</p><p>Symptoms of anemia may include symptoms of myocardial ischemia, orthostatic hypotension or tachycardia unresponsive to fluid replacement, or marked dyspnea at rest. It is important to note, however, that these symptoms can also be caused by other conditions (eg, massive pulmonary embolus). While exertional symptoms can be helpful in alerting the clinician to the presence of anemia, they are generally not considered indications for red cell transfusion.
