Detecting and effectively treating respiratory distress and improving patient-ventilator interaction is an important skill for clinicians who care for ventilated patients, since some of the associated causative conditions are immediately life threatening [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis and evaluation of respiratory distress in a previously stable patient receiving mechanical ventilation will be reviewed here. The ventilator management of acute respiratory distress syndrome is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1653.html" rel="external">"Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Ventilator management strategies for adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGIES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The etiologies of respiratory distress in a mechanically ventilated patient are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef132769" href="/d/graphic/132769.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Common causes include errors in ventilator settings, endotracheal tube (ETT) obstruction, ETT or cuff leak, ETT displacement, mucus plugging, acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, aspiration, pneumothorax, inadequate sedation, and compression of the lungs by pleural fluid or ascites.</p><p>In brief, etiologies are grouped as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ventilator equipment and settings</strong> – Errors in ventilator settings are common, especially when patients develop respiratory distress any time a ventilator setting is initiated or changed (eg, after the initiation of mechanical ventilation, following procedures or transport) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Alternatively, the ventilator and ventilator circuit (including the heat moisture exchanger [HME]) may be a source of an airway leak or obstruction or be subject to a technical malfunction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Airway issues</strong> – In a ventilated patient, the airway consists of the artificial airway, which is composed of the ETT, ventilator tubing, HME, and the native airways (ie, trachea and bronchi) [<a href="#rid4">4-7</a>]. Airway issues cause respiratory distress by increasing airway resistance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Artificial airway issues:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>ETT obstruction – ETT obstruction (partial or complete) most commonly occurs due to inspissated secretions  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98321" href="/d/graphic/98321.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) but can also be due to blood, torsion, ETT kinking  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93200" href="/d/graphic/93200.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>), or a foreign body [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Occasionally, the patient can bite on the ETT causing partial obstruction. Rarely, herniation of the ETT cuff over the end of the tube has been reported as a cause of respiratory distress and increased airway pressures [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>ETT or cuff leak – The balloon cuff at the end of the ETT can leak or rupture. Patients can also bite through the pilot balloon tube (ie, the tube that is used to inflate the cuff  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98323" href="/d/graphic/98323.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>)) or through the ETT itself [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>ETT displacement – The ETT can migrate out of position  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55694 graphicRef68470" href="/d/graphic/55694.html" rel="external">figure 1A-B</a>) superiorly (cephalad) above the vocal cords resulting in an air leak. Inferior (caudal) migration may result in mainstem intubation (typically right sided) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Displacement can occur due to patient-related neck or other movements or to external factors such as turning, prone positioning, and transport.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>HME malfunction or ventilator tubing obstruction – Occasionally, respiratory distress occurs when the HME is obstructed or malfunctions or when ventilator tubing is kinked or obstructed with excess of secretions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1656.html" rel="external">"The ventilator circuit"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Native airway issues:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Mucus plugging with or without atelectasis – Abundant thick airway secretions, blood, or a foreign body may become impacted in a large- or medium-sized airway, causing distal obstruction and atelectasis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4387.html" rel="external">"Airway foreign bodies in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Bronchospasm – Bronchospasm occurs most commonly in patients with obstructive lung disease or volume overload but may also be induced by bronchoscopy, airway suctioning, administration of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, and allergic reactions to medications.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pulmonary parenchyma (including dynamic hyperinflation [DHI]) and vasculature issues</strong> – Atelectasis, pneumonia, aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastroesophageal contents, pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolus (thrombo-, gas-, fat-, or amniotic fluid- embolism), and other rare conditions (eg, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage) can all cause respiratory distress in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">DHI (auto-PEEP) is another cause of respiratory distress. DHI is characterized by increased levels of intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi or "auto-PEEP"). The hyperinflation is progressive (dynamic) because air accumulates in the lung with each breath as a result of a failure to achieve complete exhalation before the onset of the next breath  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78052" href="/d/graphic/78052.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). Auto-PEEP usually occurs in the setting of acute or chronic airflow obstruction. It may also occur in patients with markedly increased minute ventilation (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome) and may be precipitated by ventilator setting changes such as an increase in minute ventilation or a reduction in the peak inspiratory flow rate.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute pleural disorders</strong> – Acute pleural processes can cause respiratory distress by restricting inspiration. This includes pneumothorax and large pleural effusions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/117242.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of pneumothorax"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6691.html" rel="external">"Treatment of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14867.html" rel="external">"Indications for bedside ultrasonography in the critically ill adult patient", section on 'Thoracic ultrasonography'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Extrapulmonary disorders</strong> – Extrapulmonary processes can cause respiratory distress by restricting inspiration (eg, ascites, ileus, or splinting from abdominal pain) or increasing respiratory drive (eg, fever, shock, pain, delirium, and anxiety).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2769499246"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES AND INITIAL RAPID BEDSIDE ASSESSMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with respiratory distress on mechanical ventilation often appear anxious or agitated and are dyssynchronous with the ventilator (ie, a mismatch between the patient and ventilator-assisted breathing). Patients typically have tachypnea and tachycardia, use their accessory muscles of breathing, have uncoordinated thoracic wall or abdominal movement, or have evidence of deteriorating gas exchange [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Because respiratory distress may signify the onset of a life-threatening complication, an initial rapid, focused evaluation is required  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef139060" href="/d/graphic/139060.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef139087" href="/d/graphic/139087.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). The purpose of the initial evaluation is to perform the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Perform a rapidly assessment of cardiopulmonary status</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rapidly assess the patient and the monitoring equipment (including ventilator mechanics and graphics, if time allows)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identify the likely problem at hand</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Perform initial maneuvers to treat the presumed cause</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Put in place additional and follow-up testing and preventative measures, as needed</p><p></p><p>During the initial assessment, we keep in mind the common etiologies including endotracheal tube (ETT) obstruction, air leak or ETT displacement, acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, aspiration, mucus plugging, inadequate sedation, large pleural effusion, or ascites. Other etiologies to keep in mind include those likely to occur in the setting of recent events such as tension pneumothorax following central catheter placement, acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema following the administration of fluid or blood products, or ventilator setting errors following transport  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef132769" href="/d/graphic/132769.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Although a comprehensive evaluation is ideal in all patients, those with cardiorespiratory instability require more urgent attention and the workflow is different. (See <a class="local">'Cardiorespiratory instability'</a> below and <a class="local">'Cardiorespiratory stability'</a> below.)</p><p>For the purposes of this topic, this assessment does not comprise patients who require advanced cardiac life support. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/278.html" rel="external">"Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">CARDIORESPIRATORY INSTABILITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If respiratory distress is severe or the patient is hemodynamically unstable, stabilization must take precedence over a detailed evaluation or diagnostic procedures  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef139060" href="/d/graphic/139060.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). The evaluation and management are team focused, such that the clinician, respiratory therapist, and nursing staff work together to avoid further deterioration. If adequate staff is available, assigning key roles may be helpful (eg, one is assigned to examine the ventilator and circuitry while another assesses the patient).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1680466631"><span class="h2">Disconnection, bag ventilation, and capnography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with respiratory distress who are unstable, we typically disconnect the endotracheal tube (ETT) from the ventilator and perform manual bag ventilation through the ETT with 100 percent oxygen. Manual bag ventilation should not be overly aggressive and should target approximately 10 breaths per minute at 300 to 400 mL per breath. Overventilation may cause or lead to worsening dynamic hyperinflation (DHI), precipitating tension pneumothorax, or cardiac arrest.</p><p>We concurrently use capnography to evaluate airway placement of the ETT and are careful not to overventilate patients manually. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/273.html" rel="external">"Carbon dioxide monitoring (capnography)"</a>.)</p><p>Ventilator disconnection may be lifesaving when the issue is ventilator related. This maneuver also allows the clinician to manually assess resistance to ventilating the patient during manual bag ventilation, which may indicate a problem with the ETT or lung parenchyma. Occasionally, air may escape from the ETT after disconnection, which may suggest DHI.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2780668477"><span class="h3">Patients who improve (likely ventilator-related issue)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If the patient's status improves immediately after disconnection, the ventilator (settings or machine) or the ventilator circuit is the likely source of the problem.</p><p>The ventilator settings and the machine and circuitry should be examined, and the culprit etiology identified. Any identified problem should be corrected before resuming mechanical ventilation, typically on the original or corrected ventilator settings. If the problem recurs, components of the ventilator or, rarely, the ventilator itself may need to be replaced. Further details are provided separately. (See <a class="local">'Ventilator and equipment'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1656.html" rel="external">"The ventilator circuit"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1640.html" rel="external">"Overview of initiating invasive mechanical ventilation in adults in the intensive care unit"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1344827548"><span class="h3">Patients who do not improve</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If the patient's condition does not improve or deteriorates despite disconnection from the ventilator, we continue manual ventilation with capnography and <strong>simultaneously</strong> evaluate resistance to bag ventilation while also considering the empiric treatment of life-threatening conditions when they are strongly suspected  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef139060" href="/d/graphic/139060.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). For the latter, we take a brief history and perform a rapid chest, cardiovascular, abdominal, and neurologic examination. We also perform focused bedside ultrasound examination, although that expertise is not universally available. (See <a class="local">'Focused history and examination'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2104454916"><span class="h4">Evaluate difficulty of bag ventilation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The difficulty of bag ventilation can help narrow the differential diagnosis of respiratory distress in the ventilated patient.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Difficult manual ventilation</strong> – Difficulty in manual ventilations may suggest an obstruction in the ETT or major airway or an intrinsic pulmonary problem (eg, poor lung compliance, DHI, or increased respiratory effort). The passage of a suction catheter through the ETT into the trachea helps differentiate these options.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Catheter resistance</strong> – If the catheter meets resistance, this suggests ETT or major airway obstruction. Efforts should be made to remove the obstruction. Further details regarding clinical assessment and management of suspected ETT or airway obstruction are provided below. (See <a class="local">'Obstruction'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Minimal catheter resistance</strong> – If the suction catheter passes easily, a trial of increased sedation, with or without short-term neuromuscular paralysis, may help determine whether respiratory distress is the result of an intrinsic respiratory compliance problem, or the consequence of an increase in the patient's respiratory efforts.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>If the distress resolves with sedation or neuromuscular blockade, active respiratory effort is the likely part of the cause and the underlying etiology must be sought. Possibilities include hypercapnia or hypoxemia, delirium, pain, fever, shock, or a structural central nervous system lesion. (See <a class="local">'Extrapulmonary disorders'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1590.html" rel="external">"Neuromuscular blocking agents in critically ill patients: Use, agent selection, administration, and adverse effects"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1606.html" rel="external">"Sedative-analgesia in ventilated adults: Management strategies, agent selection, monitoring, and withdrawal"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Persistent difficulty with manual ventilations despite sedation or paralysis suggests the presence of a new lower airway, parenchymal, or thoracic wall problem. A rapid history, focused physical examination, measurement of respiratory mechanics, bedside ultrasonography, and chest radiograph will often lead to the correct diagnosis. For proper assessment of respiratory mechanics, the patient should be placed back on the ventilator. (See <a class="local">'Native airway issues'</a> below and <a class="local">'Pulmonary parenchyma and vasculature'</a> below and <a class="local">'Extrapulmonary disorders'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>No difficulty with manual ventilation</strong> – When manual ventilations meet with minimal resistance, an air leak should be suspected; we examine the patient for cephalad displacement of the ETT and the cuff for an air leak by measuring cuff pressure. Further details regarding clinical assessment and management of a suspected air leak are provided below. (See <a class="local">'Cuff leak'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1644.html" rel="external">"Complications of the endotracheal tube following initial placement: Prevention and management in adult intensive care unit patients", section on 'Displacement and unplanned extubation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1644.html" rel="external">"Complications of the endotracheal tube following initial placement: Prevention and management in adult intensive care unit patients", section on 'Endotracheal cuff leaks'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H609712043"><span class="h4">Empiric treatment of immediately life-threatening conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Empiric treatment of immediately life-threatening conditions may be required before a definitive diagnosis is made.

Importantly, ventilator graphics are different for patients on volume-controlled and pressure-controlled ventilation such that clinicians should familiarize themselves with these differences so that the differential can be narrowed appropriately  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef139087" href="/d/graphic/139087.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>).

We also perform capnography to determine airway placement of the ETT. (See <a class="local">'Arterial blood gas analysis and capnography'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Bedside imaging</strong> – Bedside imaging including point-of-care ultrasonography and chest radiography may identify ETT displacement, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, atelectasis, or consolidation. Bedside ultrasonography of other organs (eg, heart, abdomen, legs) may also provide a clue to an extrapulmonary etiology (eg, ruptured mitral valve or septal defect, pericardial tamponade, pneumoperitoneum, ruptured aortic aneurysm). Critical care ultrasonography is discussed separately.
