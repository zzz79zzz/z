         Acne keloidalis nuchae (AKN) is a common, chronic, inflammatory scalp disorder characterized by the development of papules, pustules, and keloidal scarring on the posterior scalp or posterior upper neck  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97613 graphicRef97614 graphicRef97615 graphicRef97616 graphicRef97617 graphicRef97993 graphicRef97994" href="/z/d/graphic/97613.html" rel="external">

         ). AKN can cause pruritus, pain, and cosmetic disfigurement.
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment of AKN generally consists of interventions intended to reduce inflammation and scarring as well as avoidance of potential exacerbating factors  (

         ). Early treatment is preferred, given the potential for disfiguring scarring.

         The management of AKN will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of AKN are reviewed separately.

         Treatment data on AKN are limited, and there are no consensus guidelines regarding therapy [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Decisions for treatment are usually guided by clinician experience and modified based upon the clinical presentation and patient preferences. The lack of consensus is evident in the widely variable treatment suggestions made by a panel of dermatologists in a review of AKN [

         Occasionally, infection occurs as a complication of AKN. Findings suggestive of infection include extensive erythema, suppuration, pain, drainage, odor, or systemic symptoms such as fever. In this setting, obtaining a culture with susceptibility testing and initiating antibiotic therapy to treat the infection are appropriate. We typically delay treatment with topical corticosteroids and intralesional corticosteroids, both common treatments for AKN, until resolution of infection.

         Topical or systemic medications with anti-inflammatory properties represent the primary method of improving inflammatory manifestations of AKN (inflammatory papules and pustules). The severity of inflammation influences treatment selection. (See

         Patients who present with small, inflammatory papules or pustules can often achieve improvement in symptoms with topical therapy  (

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Topical corticosteroid therapy is often combined with topical antibacterial therapy and topical retinoid therapy in an attempt to augment the response to treatment. In our experience, inclusion of a topical antibacterial agent can be particularly helpful in patients with pustules. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Topical corticosteroids'
         </a>

        <p>
         Intralesional injection of corticosteroids, as often used for moderate to severe inflammation in AKN, is an alternative approach for local corticosteroid therapy that some patients may prefer. (See

          table 1
         </a>
         )) topical corticosteroid can be applied once or twice daily to the affected area. We usually have patients apply a topical corticosteroid once daily and an adjunctive therapy once daily. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         A typical regimen consists of application of the topical corticosteroid in two-week cycles that alternate with two-week, treatment-free intervals in an attempt to minimize risk for topical corticosteroid-related adverse effects [

         Topical corticosteroids are available in a variety of vehicles (eg, ointments, foams, gels, creams, solutions), which can be selected based upon patient preference. In our experience, many patients prefer ointments or lotions, as these formulations tend to be more soothing and cosmetically acceptable.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         We re-evaluate patients every four to six weeks to assess the response to treatment and to observe for adverse effects. We expect a response to topical corticosteroid therapy (noticeable reduction in severity of papules and pustules) within the first six to eight weeks of treatment, followed by continued improvement with continued therapy.

         Once sufficient improvement is achieved, we discontinue the topical corticosteroid, with the plan to restart therapy if symptoms recur. If little improvement is evident after six to eight weeks of treatment, we transition to other therapies. (See

          Efficacy
         </strong>
         – Despite the frequent use of topical corticosteroids for AKN, there are few data on efficacy. Some support stems from an open-label study in which 20 African American adults with mild to moderate AKN (defined as fewer than 50 papules or pustules) were treated with topical

         <a href="#rid8">
          8

          Adverse effects

         – Potential adverse effects of topical corticosteroids include cutaneous atrophy and hypopigmentation at the treatment site. Therefore, patients should be cautioned to apply the corticosteroid only to the affected areas of the scalp and to avoid applying the corticosteroid for extended periods without medical supervision. Additional adverse effects of topical corticosteroids are reviewed separately. (See

The best results occurred in patients with early, papular lesions compared with later-stage disease with keloidal plaques. Recurrence of active AKN (characterized by a few papular lesions) developed in 2 of 10 patients who were re-evaluated after one year; however, these patients responded well to additional laser treatment.

         Benefit of non-hair removal lasers has also been proposed. A trial that randomly assigned 30 male patients with AKN to six treatment sessions with either an ablative 2940 nm Er:YAG laser or a long-pulsed 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser found reductions in mean papule counts, plaque size, and plaque consistency in both groups and a decrease in plaque count in the Er:YAG group [

         Use of intralesional corticosteroid injection for keloidal lesions in AKN is based upon the efficacy demonstrated for keloids and clinical experience that supports benefit for AKN. Treatment may support softening and shrinking of keloidal papules or plaques of AKN. (See

         We typically use

          triamcinolone
         </a>
         acetonide in concentrations of 5 to 40 mg/mL depending on the size of the scarred area. Keloidal papules may improve with doses as low as 5 mg/mL, whereas large, thick plaques may require higher doses to achieve noticeable improvement. Limiting the total dose to 40 mg or less per month is advised to minimize risk for systemic adverse effects of corticosteroid treatment. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5568.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Injections can be repeated every four to six weeks, and the dose can be progressively titrated upward based upon the response. At least a partial clinical response (at least some softening of the lesions) is expected within one to three treatments.
        </p>
        <p>
         Intralesional injections can be uncomfortable. When necessary, application of a topical analgesic (eg, topical
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/z/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">
          lidocaine
         </a>
         ) prior to treatment can help to reduce discomfort. Alternatively, the corticosteroid may be diluted in lidocaine. Spraying the site with liquid nitrogen prior to injection may also help to reduce pain of injection and may ease injection into the tissue. However, hypopigmentation is a risk of liquid nitrogen, particularly in individuals with moderately to highly pigmented skin. We typically do not use liquid nitrogen for analgesia. (See

          Procedures
         </strong>
         – AKN has been successfully treated with scalpel excision, electrosurgical excision, and laser excision. Regardless of the surgical technique selected, the following measures may optimize results:

         <strong>
          Deep excision
         </strong>
         – The depth of excision must extend below the base of the hair follicles to reduce risk of recurrence [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21-23
         </a>
         ]. Some authors suggest excising to the level of the deep subcutaneous tissue or muscular fascia, given the propensity for hair follicles to extend into the subcutaneous fat [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22

         <strong>
          Horizontal excision
         </strong>
         – Orienting the excision horizontally with intent to incorporate the posterior hairline may yield the best cosmetic results [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Some authors have proposed performance of a bat-shaped excision as a method of promoting a natural-appearing hairline after healing [

         <strong>
          Primary wound closure
         </strong>
         – Primary wound closure provides immediate closure of the wound and simplifies wound care for the patient. However, high tension on the closure may result in spreading of the scar, hypertrophic scarring, or restricted head movement. Therefore, the preoperative evaluation should include an assessment of the excision size and surrounding skin laxity to determine if the wound can be comfortably closed. If the affected area is too large to excise in a single procedure, staged excision with primary closure or secondary intention healing are options [

         <strong>
          Secondary intention healing
         </strong>
         – Secondary intention healing eliminates concern for excessive wound tension that may occur with primary wound closure but requires an average of 6 to 12 weeks for the wound to close. Scars often contract to a smaller size than the initial excised area, yielding improved cosmesis after healing [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. Some authors have proposed debridement of granulation tissue as a potential method of promoting wound contraction to minimize scarring [

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         One review found data to suggest that fewer recurrences occur with secondary intention healing than with primary closure; however, further study would be necessary to confirm this finding [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. The authors postulated that the secondary intention healing process might effectively eliminate hair-bearing tissue or that the inflammatory response or process of prolonged healing might have other beneficial effects on AKN [

          Efficacy
         </strong>
         – Although surgery is considered an effective treatment for AKN, few studies have evaluated its efficacy. One of the largest studies evaluating surgical intervention for AKN involved 25 male patients with AKN refractory to medical therapy [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. The patients had extensive, coalescent, keloidal plaques on the nuchal scalp. Twenty patients underwent complete excision with primary closure of the surgical defect. The remainder had lesions too large for this procedure and had either a two-stage excision with primary closure (four patients) or excision with secondary intention healing (one patient).

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         One year after the procedure, the surgeon and the patients both rated cosmetic results as good to excellent. Complications included mild recurrence of small papules and pustules in 15 patients (managed with topical corticosteroids) and hypertrophic scars in four patients who had excision of large lesions and primary wound closure in a single procedure. In this particular study, the four patients who underwent electrosurgical excision seemed to have a greater requirement for pain medication than patients whose excisions were performed with a scalpel. However, good tolerance of electrosurgery has also been reported [

The UVB device emitted 290 to 320 nm light, with peaks at 303 and 313 nm. After eight weeks, both sides of the scalp were treated. After the initial eight-week period, the mean lesion count on the treated sides decreased significantly, while the counts on the untreated side did not change. Further improvement was demonstrated in sites that received an additional eight weeks of UVB treatment.

         UVB therapy was well tolerated; side effects were mild, including a transient burning sensation, erythema, and hyperpigmentation. However, the need for multiple clinical visits can make phototherapy inconvenient for some patients.

          Disease overview
         </strong>
         – Acne keloidalis nuchae (AKN) is a chronic, inflammatory scalp condition characterized by inflamed papules, pustules, and keloid-like scarring on the posterior scalp and nape of the neck  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97613 graphicRef97614 graphicRef97615 graphicRef97616 graphicRef97617 graphicRef97993 graphicRef97994" href="/z/d/graphic/97613.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          General approach
         </strong>
         – Data on treatments for AKN are limited. Treatment goals include reducing inflammation, improving keloidal lesions, and minimizing exposure to potential exacerbating factors  (

          algorithm 1

         ). Early treatment is important to minimize risk for severe scarring. (See

          Small, inflammatory papules or pustules (mild to moderate inflammation)

         – For patients with small, inflammatory papules or pustules, we suggest combination therapy with a high-potency topical corticosteroid, topical antibacterial agent, and topical retinoid, rather than monotherapy with any of these agents (
