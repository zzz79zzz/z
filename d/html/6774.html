         Cervical insufficiency refers to painless cervical dilation that leads to second-trimester fetal expulsion (miscarriage or preterm birth). Although the diagnosis may be suspected in the first pregnancy in which it occurs, the diagnosis is confirmed when it recurs in consecutive pregnancies. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' definition of cervical insufficiency is "the inability of the uterine cervix to retain a pregnancy in the second trimester in the absence of clinical contractions, labor, or both" [

         <strong>
          Cervical trauma
         </strong>
         – Cervical trauma is probably the most common risk factor for cervical insufficiency. It may result from the process of labor or birth (spontaneous, forceps- or vacuum-assisted, cesarean) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ], mechanical cervical dilation before a gynecologic procedure, or treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. (See

         <strong>
          Congenital cervical abnormality
         </strong>
         – Congenital abnormalities can be associated with structural cervical weakness, but this is rare. These abnormalities include structural uterine anomalies, genetic disorders affecting collagen (eg, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ], and in utero diethylstilbestrol exposure. Biologic variation of the cervix may also account for some cases of cervical insufficiency. (See

         <strong>
          History of short cervical length
         </strong>
         – In contemporary obstetrics, where transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) cervical length (CL) screening is often performed, patients may describe a past pregnancy or pregnancies in which a short CL was detected on ultrasound and was associated with subsequent second-trimester loss/birth. The finding of an asymptomatic short second-trimester CL on TVU examination alone is not a strong risk factor for cervical insufficiency as many patients with a short CL deliver at term, even without intervention. CL screening is reviewed separately. (See

         Early in the course of cervical insufficiency, the cervix may be soft and closed, with minimal effacement [

         ]. Tocodynamometry typically reveals no or infrequent contractions at irregular intervals that are not perceptible or barely perceptible to the patient. Provocative maneuvers such as suprapubic or fundal pressure by the clinician or having the patient make a forced expiratory effort against a closed glottis (Valsalva maneuver) may reveal fetal membranes in the endocervical canal or vagina, which is always an abnormal finding. In some cases, membranes may be prolapsed without provocation or may be ruptured.

         We make an obstetric history-based diagnosis of cervical insufficiency in patients with a classic history of ≥2 consecutive prior second-trimester pregnancy losses or extremely preterm births (&lt;28 weeks) associated with no or minimal mild symptoms. The presence of risk factors for structural cervical weakness supports the diagnosis. Most of these cases are pregnancy losses before 24 weeks. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Past history'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Challenges to making this diagnosis are that the relevant findings in the prior pregnancy are often not well-documented in medical records and the patient's recounting of events may not provide adequate information; thus, the process that led to the second trimester loss or extremely preterm birth is often a subjective assessment.

         We make an ultrasound-based diagnosis of cervical insufficiency in patients with both an obstetric history of second-trimester loss or extremely preterm live birth (&lt;28 weeks) plus a short cervix on transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) examination (CL ≤25 mm before 24 weeks) in the current pregnancy, after exclusion of relevant other diagnoses (eg, labor, infection, bleeding related to placental abruption or placenta previa) (see
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnoses to exclude before making the diagnosis'
         </a>
         below). The presence of risk factors for structural cervical weakness supports the diagnosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Past history'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         To identify these individuals, we perform serial TVU examinations in patients with a past history of preterm birth and those in whom a history-based diagnosis is uncertain, as shown in the algorithm  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107318" href="/z/d/graphic/107318.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). TVU screening is discontinued at 24 weeks of gestation, as cerclage is rarely performed after this gestational age [

         </a>
         above) between cervical screening examinations, an ultrasound examination for CL should be performed promptly because a normal physical examination cannot reliably exclude the diagnosis of cervical insufficiency. Most cervixes that are 10 to 25 mm in length by second-trimester TVU feel long and closed on physical examination; effacement and dilation are usually not detected until the transvaginal CL is ≤10 mm. In one study, less than one-third of patients with CL &lt;11 mm had cervical dilation ≥1 cm on physical examination [

         Infection should be excluded by appropriate testing, such as urinalysis/urine culture and possibly amniocentesis for laboratory examination of amniotic fluid. Amniocentesis is not routinely performed in patients with an ultrasound-based diagnosis, as most do not have significant cervical dilation, prolapsed membranes, or abnormal-appearing amniotic fluid, which are high-risk factors for subclinical infections. By comparison, amniocentesis is often indicated in patients with a physical examination-based diagnosis since many have significant cervical dilation, prolapsed membranes, or abnormal-appearing amniotic fluid and thus at high risk for subclinical infection.

The author performs a single transvaginal cervical length (CL) measurement at 18 to 24 weeks of gestation (usually at approximately 20 weeks, with the anatomic survey ultrasound) in this population, and treats those with a short cervix in the same way as other patients without a history of preterm birth who develop a short cervix.

         </a>
         ) in asymptomatic patients at high risk for preterm birth (eg, cervical length (CL) ≤25 mm), pessary use did not result in a statistically significant reduction in spontaneous preterm birth &lt;28, 34, or 37 weeks or improve perinatal outcome; however, the trials had many limitations and there was uncertainty around the effect estimates [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32-34
         </a>
         ]. In a subsequent well-designed trial in which 544 patients were randomly assigned to Arabin pessary placement at 16 to 23 weeks of gestation or usual care, the rate of preterm birth or fetal death &lt;37 weeks was the same for both groups (45.5 versus 45.6 percent; RR 1.00, 95% CI, 0.83-1.20). Fetal or neonatal/infant death occurred more often in the pessary group (13.3 versus 6.8 percent; RR 1.94; 95% C, 1.13-3.32) [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. Whether the excess perinatal deaths in the pessary group were due to pessary use or a confounding factor was not clear. Strengths of this trial included a very high-risk population (short cervical length was defined as &lt;20 mm), exclusion of individuals with a history of preterm birth, and routine use of progesterone supplementation in both groups.

        <p>
         The theory behind use of vaginal pessaries is that they alter the axis of the cervical canal and displace the weight of the uterine contents away from the cervix. By changing the angle of the cervix in relation to the uterus, the pessary also obstructs the internal os and thus may provide protection against ascending infection.

          37

In one study, approximately 50 percent of patients with a history of an ultrasound-indicated cerclage required another ultrasound-indicated cerclage in the subsequent pregnancy, and their outcomes were similar to those who underwent planned cerclage in the subsequent pregnancy [

         Successful pregnancy outcome after ultrasound-indicated cerclage does not establish or exclude a diagnosis of cervical insufficiency.

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – We base the diagnosis of cervical insufficiency on either a classic obstetric history or on a combination of obstetric history and transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) measurement of cervical length (CL). Physical examination alone is adequate for diagnosis of cervical insufficiency in patients with advanced cervical dilation. The diagnosis is usually limited to singleton gestations because the pathogenesis of second-trimester pregnancy loss/extremely preterm delivery (ie, &lt;28 weeks) in multiple gestations is usually unrelated to anatomic weakness of the cervix. (See
         <a class="local">

          Obstetric history-based diagnosis of cervical insufficiency
         </strong>
         – We make an obstetric history-based diagnosis of cervical insufficiency in patients with a classic history of ≥2 consecutive prior second-trimester pregnancy losses/extremely preterm births (ie, &lt;28 weeks) associated with no or minimal mild symptoms. The presence of risk factors for structural cervical weakness support the diagnosis. Most of these cases are pregnancy losses before 24 weeks. Using this diagnostic approach, all of these patients will be offered a history-indicated cerclage. (See

          Ultrasound-based diagnosis of cervical insufficiency
         </strong>
         – In patients with a past history of a spontaneous preterm birth and those in whom a history-based diagnosis is uncertain, we perform serial TVU examinations and make a diagnosis of cervical insufficiency when CL is ≤25 mm before 24 weeks  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107318" href="/z/d/graphic/107318.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). TVU screening is discontinued at 24 weeks of gestation as cerclage efficacy has not been adequately studied after this time. The presence of risk factors for structural cervical insufficiency supports the diagnosis. Using this diagnostic approach, approximately 40 percent of these patients will be offered a cerclage. (See

          Physical examination-based cervical insufficiency
         </strong>
         – We make a diagnosis of physical examination-based cervical insufficiency in patients at 14 to 27 weeks of gestation with a dilated and effaced cervix on physical examination and no contractions or weak irregular contractions that appear inadequate to explain the cervical dilation and effacement. The membranes may be prolapsed or ruptured. Most patients &lt;24 weeks of gestation will be offered cerclage (in the absence of contraindications such as infection, [often evaluated by amniocentesis] or rupture of membranes). After 24 weeks, each case must be individualized, weighing the risks of the procedure against the likely outcome with expectant management since the procedure may cause accidental rupture of the fetal membranes leading to early preterm delivery of a viable infant, with its attendant high risk of neonatal morbidity and mortality.

         We perform amniocentesis to look for subclinical infection before cerclage when the cervix is ≥2 cm dilated on manual or speculum examination, as the incidence of intraamniotic infection in these patients is approximately 20 to 50 percent. We also perform amniocentesis on a case-by-case basis when ultrasound findings are consistent with inflammation (eg, debris in the amniotic fluid [sludge or biofilm]  (
