         Surgical resection offers the only chance of cure for nonmetastatic exocrine pancreatic cancer. However, only 15 to 20 percent of patients have potentially resectable disease at diagnosis; approximately 40 percent have distant metastases, and another 30 to 40 percent have locally advanced, unresectable tumors. Typically, patients with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer have tumor invasion into adjacent critical structures, particularly the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. The optimal management of these patients is controversial, and there is no internationally embraced standard approach. Therapeutic options include radiation therapy (RT) alone, chemoradiotherapy, and chemotherapy alone. In some cases, a response to initial therapy will be sufficient to permit an attempt at subsequent resection.
        </p>
        <p>
         Others have disease that is categorized as "borderline resectable." Although the definition is variable (and often dependent on the individual surgeon), patients with focal tumor abutment of the superior mesenteric artery, encasement of the gastroduodenal artery up to the hepatic artery, or involvement of the superior mesenteric vein/portal vein that is potentially resectable and reconstructible could all fall into this category. While these patients are potentially resectable, the high likelihood of an incomplete resection has prompted interest in strategies to "downstage" the tumor prior to surgical exploration using chemotherapy with and without RT (neoadjuvant therapy).
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic review will focus on initial chemotherapy and RT for patients with nonmetastatic, locally advanced, unresectable or borderline resectable, exocrine pancreatic cancer. Management of patients with potentially resectable disease, systemic chemotherapy for patients with metastatic disease, and a compilation of chemotherapy regimens used for treatment of pancreatic cancer are discussed separately.

         An assessment of resectability is usually made based on a preoperative staging contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan and less commonly at the time of laparotomy/laparoscopy. A variety of other imaging modalities, including magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopic ultrasound, as well as staging laparoscopy, may be needed in some circumstances. This topic is addressed in detail separately. (See

          Criteria for unresectability

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         In general, pancreatic cancers can be categorized along a continuum from resectable to unresectable according to the involvement of adjacent structures and the presence of distant metastases  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97572" href="/z/d/graphic/97572.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A pancreatic cancer is categorically unresectable if distant metastases are present in the liver, peritoneum, omentum, or any extra-abdominal site.
        </p>
        <p>
         Local unresectability is usually (but not always) due to vascular invasion, particularly of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97571" href="/z/d/graphic/97571.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). Although practice is variable across institutions, many surgeons would consider a pancreatic cancer to be locally advanced and unresectable if it is associated with encasement (more than one-half of the vessel circumference) of the SMA or celiac artery, occlusion of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) or SMV-portal vein confluence without suitable vessels above and below the tumor to allow for reconstruction.
        </p>
        <p>
         We follow the consensus-based guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [
         <a href="#rid2">

         Similar guidelines are available from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ] and others [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Many of these patients will be managed nonsurgically with initial chemotherapy with or without chemoradiotherapy, although there are some exceptions. Increasingly, a sufficient downstaging response will be obtained after multiagent chemotherapy so that subsequent resection can be considered. Celiac artery resection can be done and appears to be safe [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ], but this is a novel approach and is not reflected in guidelines from any group. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Locally advanced, unresectable disease'
         </a>

         Some cases are considered "borderline" resectable, although the definition is variable [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8-11
         </a>
         ] and the point at which the transition takes place along the continuum from resectable to unresectable locally advanced disease is not well defined  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97572" href="/z/d/graphic/97572.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Some reserve the term "borderline resectable" for cases where there is no more than focal (less than one-half of the circumference) tumor abutment of the visceral arteries or short-segment occlusion of the SMV, portal vein, or SMV/portal vein confluence [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,12,13
         </a>
         ]. Others suggest that venous narrowing without occlusion also be included in the definition of borderline resectable disease [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14-16
         </a>
         ]. Still others suggest that there be no interface between the tumor and the mesenteric vasculature for a pancreatic cancer to be considered "potentially resectable" [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Definitions continue to evolve over time, with some groups also taking into account nonanatomic "conditional" criteria, such as performance status and patient comorbidities, which significantly increase the risk for morbidity or mortality after surgery [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19
         </a>
         ]. However, this is not a widespread practice.
        </p>
        <p>
         An important issue is that encasement (more than one-half of the vessel circumference) or occlusion of the SMV or the SMV-portal vein confluence  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97571" href="/z/d/graphic/97571.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ) used to be considered a criterion for unresectability. However, with increasing experience in vascular reconstruction, fewer pancreatic surgeons view such cases as unresectable. Many centers have demonstrated the feasibility of SMV reconstruction, and this is now considered by many to represent borderline resectable disease, as long as there is a suitable vessel proximal and distal to the area of involvement. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91408.html" rel="external">
          "Surgical resection of lesions of the head of the pancreas", section on 'Vascular evaluation'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The NCCN formally defines the category of borderline resectable pancreatic cancer [

         <a href="#rid2">
          2,4
         </a>
         ]. The American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines do not specifically address the definition of "borderline resectable pancreatic cancer," but they recommend preoperative therapy rather than initial surgery for any patient with no clinical evidence of metastatic disease who has what appears to be potentially resectable pancreatic cancer with a radiographic interface between the primary tumor and mesenteric vasculature on cross-sectional imaging [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with borderline resectable disease differ from those with potentially resectable disease in that they are at a high risk for a positive margin of resection due to tumor artery abutment [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]; they require a more complex operation, usually involving vascular resection and reconstruction; and they may be at higher risk of harboring radiographically occult metastatic disease. At many centers, all patients who meet the definition for borderline resectable disease because of vascular involvement are referred for some form of induction (neoadjuvant) treatment to increase the likelihood of a margin-negative resection.

         For patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer, both genomic (ie, germline) testing (if not already known) and gene profiling of tumor tissue (ie, with next-generation sequencing) should be undertaken as quickly as possible after diagnosis. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic alterations in the breast cancer susceptibility (

         </em>
         -like pathogenic variant might be interpreted as likely somatic or germline, but most tests cannot reliably distinguish between the two, and this may not be reported uniformly by all the different companies that provide this service. Furthermore, pathogenic germline variants (PGVs) may be missed by tumor testing alone for a variety of reasons, including technical limitations of tumor sequencing (especially small copy number deletions and large or complex insertions or deletions), variant interpretation differences between tumor and germline tests, or differences in the genes tested in the tumor and the germline. In one report, in which 2023 patients with cancer unselected for family history received germline testing and previously had tumor DNA sequencing, PGVs were found in 617 (30.5 percent), and in 41.7 percent of the 187 pancreatic cancers [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. Potentially more importantly, 8.1 percent of the PGVs were missed by tumor sequencing. Thus, tumor testing cannot substitute for germline testing in patients for whom a PGV in a gene such as a
         <em>

This is despite the paucity of evidence from prospective randomized trials that these more intensive neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens are more effective than other regimens, and acknowledging the fact that the frequency of a complete resection and long-term survival are low for patients who have initially unresectable tumors.

         For patients treated initially with multiagent neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the contribution of radiation therapy (RT) to achieving a microscopically complete resection is unclear, and the use of RT in this setting is diminishing. An important area of controversy that informs this debate is the unreliability of imaging to assess resectability after modern combination chemotherapy. (See

         For patients who present with obstructive jaundice, delivery of neoadjuvant therapy necessitates durable biliary decompression for up to six months. This can usually be accomplished through placement of a biliary stent. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91408.html" rel="external">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For patients with persistently elevated bilirubin despite stenting, a decision must be made prior to initiating chemotherapy as to whether there is adequate drainage of the common bile duct (CBD). If good visualization of the CBD was not seen on endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, a repeat attempt at adequate drainage should be considered, or the possibility of transhepatic drainage should be discussed. For those patients who have persistently elevated bilirubin levels but good drainage of bile through the CBD into the small intestine or through a transhepatic catheter, consideration could be given to dose-adjusted FOLFIRINOX or

         with close monitoring of toxicities. In this manner, patients may have the opportunity to experience downstaging of their pancreatic cancer so that it might be resected. While single-agent gemcitabine can be used, conversion to resectable in the locally advanced setting is uncommon (&lt;5 percent), and therefore, treatment is not considered potentially curative. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2505.html" rel="external">

For instance, if the performance status is poor due to recent infection (eg, cholangitis) and the patient is recovering well after intervention, then consideration could be made for dose-adjusted combination chemotherapy. If the performance status is poor due to locally advanced disease-causing disabling pain and gastric outlet obstruction, then aggressive treatment of the pain and/or gastric outlet obstruction should be considered prior to initiation of chemotherapy.

         For most patients, we prefer enrollment in a clinical trial testing new treatment strategies. If a clinical trial is unavailable or participation is not feasible, we suggest an initial period of chemotherapy rather than immediate radiation therapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy (CRT). The optimal regimen has not been established, and enrollment of these patients in clinical trials is preferred. If trials are unavailable or participation is not feasible, we base our initial approach on candidacy for chemotherapy and the presence or absence of a pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline or somatic variant in a gene associated with homologous recombination repair (HRR) deficiency (see

         For patients who develop metastatic disease after initial chemotherapy we suggest continued chemotherapy rather than CRT. However, CRT is a reasonable approach to optimize local control in selected patients, such as those who can no longer tolerate further chemotherapy but who continue to have localized disease and maintain a good performance status.

         For patients who remain potential surgical candidates, concomitant CRT cannot be recommended as a standard approach after initial chemotherapy. However, this is a controversial issue. At some institutions, FU-based CRT or stereotactic body RT (SBRT) or additional chemotherapy would be offered if there was concern that a microscopically complete resection might not be possible following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, it is unknown whether RT contributes to a higher resection rate following systemic chemotherapy, particularly if FOLFIRINOX is given. Furthermore, imaging assessment of resectability may be unreliable after initial multiagent chemotherapy [

         There is considerable debate and institutional variability regarding which patients should be taken to the operating room (OR) after neoadjuvant therapy. In the absence of distant metastases, some centers (including those of some of the authors and editors of this topic) take nearly all patients with a radiographic response to initial chemotherapy for exploration regardless of local imaging findings, while other centers rely more on imaging characteristics to guide surgical decision-making. We await the results of ongoing clinical trials to guide this debate. (See

         An important point is that the ability to reliably determine resectability of a locally advanced cancer is limited after multiagent chemotherapy due to the presence of fibrosis and scar tissue. Traditional signs of unresectable disease may not apply in this setting. Because of this, in our view, in the absence of overt metastatic disease, the determination of resectability should be made intraoperatively. Specific issues regarding the accuracy of radiographic assessment after multiagent chemotherapy are discussed below. (See

         For patients who are not considered candidates for surgical exploration, continued chemotherapy is our preferred approach. However, fluoropyrimidine-based CRT could be considered in selected patients, such as those who can no longer tolerate further chemotherapy but who continue to have localized disease and maintain a good performance status.

         RT as a single modality could be considered to palliate pain for a patient who is not considered a candidate for combined CRT due to medical comorbidities, and whose pain is not adequately controlled with narcotic analgesics. Another option is celiac plexus nerve block. (See

         We prefer that eligible patients be enrolled in clinical trials testing novel neoadjuvant strategies. Where such trials are unavailable or patients are ineligible or choose not to participate, upfront combination chemotherapy is a reasonable option for patients with good enough performance status, as long as they understand the lack of data proving benefit for this more toxic approach as compared with single-agent

         Although it appears that objective response rates in the primary tumor are at least as good as they are in metastatic disease, there are few data on rates of resectability, perioperative morbidity, and mortality in patients who undergo surgery after receiving FOLFIRINOX for locally advanced, unresectable disease; few data on long-term outcomes; and no adequately powered robust phase III randomized trials proving benefit over less intensive chemotherapy regimens in this setting [

         Nevertheless, the FOLFIRINOX regimen is being increasingly used in this setting as it is an active regimen, and some patients will have sufficient downstaging (with FOLFIRINOX alone or followed by RT/CRT) to permit a later R0 resection [
         <a href="#rid33">

         A systematic review of data from 13 studies of FOLFIRINOX for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (315 patients, most derived from retrospective analysis) concluded that the proportion of patients undergoing surgical resection ranged from 0 to 43 percent (pooled proportion 26 percent), and of those patients undergoing resection, an R0 resection was reported in 74 percent [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39

         Additional information on the benefits of neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX in borderline resectable pancreatic cancer is available from a retrospective analysis of data on 1835 consecutive patients presenting with localized pancreatic cancer (52 percent locally advanced, 29 percent borderline resectable, 19 percent potentially resectable) who received at least one cycle of mFOLFIRINOX chemotherapy as initial treatment in one of five referral centers in the United States and Netherlands between 2012 and 2019 [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. The median number of chemotherapy cycles was 6 (interquartile interval 4 to 8), and subsequent treatment included radiotherapy in 49 percent, and resection in 38 percent. The margin-negative (R0) resection rates for the subgroup with locally advanced unresectable tumors was 55 percent, the median overall survival duration was 18.7 months, and the five-year overall survival rate was 9.5 percent.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         At many institutions, CRT or SBRT has been given after initial chemotherapy in an attempt to increase the likelihood of a R0 resection. Unfortunately, it is unknown whether RT contributes to the R0 resection rate in patients treated with aggressive combination regiments like FOLFIRINOX. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Is there benefit to chemoradiotherapy after initial chemotherapy?'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Given the lack of randomized trials comparing FOLFIRINOX with any other neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer, the identification of which patients are most likely to benefit from an aggressive regimen like FOLFIRINOX would greatly assist in treatment decision-making. Additional research is needed in this important area. The few randomized trials that directly compare the benefits of FOLFIRINOX relative to other neoadjuvant regimens in locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer are described below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Gemcitabine combinations versus FOLFIRINOX'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         An important point is that postchemotherapy imaging may be unreliable at predicting resectability in patients treated with upfront combination regimens such as FOLFIRINOX [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35,45
         </a>
         ]. This was shown in a multi-institutional retrospective review of 40 patients who received neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX as initial treatment for locally advanced/borderline resectable disease [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. Despite the fact that post-treatment clinical staging suggested that 19 were still classified as locally advanced unresectable, and nine had persistently borderline resectable disease, 92 percent had an R0 resection. Although post-treatment imaging should be undertaken to assess the presence of distant metastatic disease, which would preclude an attempt at resection, these data suggest that the determination of resectability should be made intraoperatively.

         For most patients, we suggest an initial period of chemotherapy rather than initial chemoradiotherapy (CRT). As has been seen in a variety of tumors arising in the gastrointestinal tract, the addition of concurrent chemotherapy to EBRT improves outcomes compared with EBRT alone in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. From the standpoint of symptom palliation, cancer-related pain is diminished in a greater number of patients (35 to 65 percent), and cachexia and obstructive symptoms may also improve. However, a survival benefit from CRT relative to EBRT alone or initial chemotherapy alone has been difficult to demonstrate, and local control remains problematic, even in irradiated patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         Furthermore, despite initial CRT, many locally advanced pancreatic cancers metastasize rapidly, which has diminished enthusiasm for choosing CRT as initial treatment. Instead, guidelines from ESMO [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ] and NCCN [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ] advocate induction chemotherapy rather than CRT. A separate issue, whether there is benefit from CRT after initial chemotherapy, is addressed below. (See

         (FU) plus EBRT, which are synergistic in other gastrointestinal malignancies. While the majority compare CRT with EBRT alone, the control arm in a few studies was supportive care only [
         <a href="#rid51">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         A survival benefit for the addition of concomitant FU to RT has been difficult to demonstrate; two early randomized trials directly comparing EBRT with and without concomitant FU-based chemotherapy came to opposite conclusions [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52-54
         </a>
         ]. A pooled analysis of both trials concluded that the length of survival with CRT was significantly increased relative to RT alone (hazard ratio [HR] for death 0.69, 95% CI 0.51-0.94) [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ]. A qualitative meta-analysis of 21 studies also concluded that FU-based CRT improved overall survival when compared with RT alone or best supportive care [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. However, CRT was not superior to chemotherapy alone.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Further support for the benefit of CRT as compared with RT alone was provided by a retrospective but large series of 1700 older adult patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer derived from a linked Medicare/Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ]. Forty-four percent of patients received some form of therapy, and the adjusted mean survival durations for patients undergoing CRT, RT alone, chemotherapy alone, and no therapy were 47, 29, 27, and 15 weeks, respectively. Although not derived from a randomized trial, these data support the view that CRT provides benefit over either modality alone and that treatment appears to be better than supportive care. The authors performed a sophisticated statistical analysis using propensity score methods to minimize the impact of selection bias. However, the possibility that patients who are considered good candidates for CRT may survive longer due to other unmeasurable factors can only be excluded in a randomized trial.

         Two separate meta-analyses of trials comparing CRT (with or without subsequent chemotherapy) versus chemotherapy alone concluded that there was no survival benefit (and greater toxicity) for CRT compared with chemotherapy alone [

          55,56

         Concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) cannot be recommended as a standard approach for all patients who do not have metastatic disease after initial systemic chemotherapy and who are being considered for resection. Although RT can significantly improve local endpoints such as pathologic complete response, this benefit has not translated into an improvement in clinically meaningful endpoints such as progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival. However, this is a very controversial area. As noted above, there are three unresolved controversies that impact the decision to pursue CRT after initial chemotherapy:

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The first controversy is whether the imaging obtained after neoadjuvant chemotherapy accurately predicts for the ability of the surgeon to obtain an R0 resection. Some centers do not rely on imaging after preoperative chemotherapy and are taking nearly all patients who appear to have a radiographic response to initial chemotherapy to the OR for an assessment of resectability while others are not, based on the results of imaging. In our view, all patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who have not experienced progressive disease on initial chemotherapy should be evaluated by an experienced pancreatic surgeon as emerging data does suggest that imaging may not be reliable in certain circumstances. (See
         <a class="local">
          'FOLFIRINOX'

          ●
         </span>
         The second controversy surrounds the ability of RT to improve the rate of successful surgical resection (ie, complete or microscopically complete [R0/R1] as opposed to macroscopic residual disease [R2 resection]) in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Uncontrolled, institutional experiences suggest an improved rate of resection and long-term survival with the addition of RT, but these are subject to various biases and the findings have not been borne out by the available randomized data. There are no randomized data supporting the claim of increased resectability. In the absence of an R0/R1 resection, it is clear from the LAP07 trial (which is discussed below) that standard doses of RT are not beneficial to long term survival [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In the setting of potentially resectable disease, the PREOPANC study suggests that neoadjuvant CRT may improve the R0 resection rate [
         <a href="#rid76">
          76
         </a>
         ]. However, this study used surgery alone and not upfront chemotherapy as the control group. (See

         Lastly, there is controversy around whether there is any added benefit of RT to chemotherapy in the adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or perioperative setting for patients with resectable pancreatic cancer. This controversy has been extended to include those patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who are taken to the OR after initial chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the overall benefit of RT for patients with localized pancreatic cancer, whether initially resectable or potentially resectable, remains an unresolved issue.

         Our preferred approach is to encourage patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer to enroll in clinical trials testing the contribution of neoadjuvant RT to modern combination chemotherapy. If trials are unavailable or participation is not feasible, we suggest not treating with fluoropyrimidine-based CRT if patients are considered appropriate candidates for resection. We reserve CRT for those who are not resected with the goal of improving local control as demonstrated in LAP-07 trial and by others [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71,77

         ]. The trial was terminated prematurely after accrual of only 442 of the 820 intended participants when interim analysis revealed that prespecified futility criteria were met. At a median follow-up of 36 months, CRT was not superior to continuing chemotherapy (median overall survival 15.2 versus 16.5 months), and the proportion of patients with a sufficient therapy response to permit later pancreatectomy after the second randomization was not significantly different (eight patients after chemotherapy alone versus four patients after chemotherapy plus CRT). Local control was significantly better in the CRT group (locoregional progression in 32 versus 46 percent with chemotherapy alone). The toxicity data did not reveal substantial differences in adverse events for individuals treated with or without CRT; however, patient-reported toxicity data were not included.
        </p>
        <p>
         There were some issues with RT compliance; only 32 percent of patients in the CRT arm were treated per protocol, while 50 percent had minor deviations, and 18 percent had major deviations. However, these deviations did not appear to significantly impact outcomes. Median survival from the date of the first randomization for patients treated per protocol or with minor deviations did not differ significantly from that in patients who had major deviations (17 versus 13.4 months).
        </p>
        <p>
         The issue was further addressed in the CONKO-007 trial, in which 525 patients were enrolled to undergo induction chemotherapy for three months (choice of

         <a href="#rid82">
          82
         </a>
         ]. Overall survival was the planned endpoint, but this was changed to complete (R0) resection rate because of slower than anticipated accrual. In a preliminary report presented at the 2022 annual ASCO meeting, at a median follow-up of 16 months, individuals treated with CRT had more severe (grade ≥3) treatment-related toxicity, especially leucopenia and thrombocytopenia; non-hematologic toxicities were comparable. Resection was performed in 122 patients (60 after chemotherapy, 62 after CRT); in this cohort, the addition of RT improved the pathologic complete response rate (7 versus 0.6 percent) and improved the R0 resection rate (69 versus 50 percent, p = 0.04), but the R0 resection rate was not significantly better when the entire randomized cohort of 336 patients was analyzed (25 versus 18 percent, p = 0.11). These differences did not translate into better PFS (median 9 versus 8 months, HR 0.976, 95% CI 0.780-1.222), or overall survival (median 15 months in both groups, HR 0.975, 95% CI 0.756-1.211).
        </p>
        <p>
         In our view, it is increasingly clear that the effect of RT in patients with truly unresectable pancreatic cancer is minimal. Whether RT may contribute to increasing resectability and R0 resection rates in patients who are not progressing after initial FOLFIRINOX as was seen in CONKO-007 is an intriguing idea which remains an unanswered question.

         In experienced centers, SBRT is often considered an alternative to conventional fractionation CRT following systemic multiagent chemotherapy as long as patients are informed about potential risks and general uncertainty as to benefit. However, in our view (and that of ASCO [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]), until randomized trials comparing this approach with conventional modern multiagent chemotherapy with or without fluoropyrimidine-based CRT are completed, the place of SBRT in the therapeutic armamentarium for locally advanced pancreatic cancer will remain uncertain, and it cannot be recommended as a standard approach.
        </p>
        <p>
         SBRT is capable of precisely delivering high doses of radiation to small tumor volumes. SBRT uses a variety of motion management techniques to account for tumor and normal tissue motion, permitting higher doses than conventional RT to the tumor while minimizing the risk of injury to adjacent organs. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89528.html" rel="external">
          "Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment", section on 'Stereotactic radiation therapy techniques'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         SBRT has been explored in an increasing number of clinical studies as an alternative approach to conventionally fractionated EBRT with concurrent chemotherapy for the management of locally advanced disease. However, the benefit of SBRT remains uncertain, since it is not clear that median survival is better than would be expected with other forms of therapy, and toxicity has been worse in some studies [
         <a href="#rid86">
          86-92
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The substantial local toxicity seen in these early reports was not counterbalanced by any suggestion of improved survival. More favorable outcomes have been reported by others using smaller treatment fields, more conformal techniques, and hypofractionated protocols [
         <a href="#rid79">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, benefit from SBRT has been called further into question the phase II Alliance A021501 trial, in which 126 patients with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer were randomly assigned to eight courses of preoperative modified (m) FOLFIRINOX or seven courses of mFOLFIRINOX followed by SBRT (33 to 40 Gy in five fractions) or hypofractionated image-guided RT (25 Gy in 5 fractions) [

         In our view, in the absence of metastatic disease, all patients who have a radiographic response to therapy after initial chemotherapy, who retain an acceptable performance status and comorbidity profile, and who prefer aggressive therapy should undergo exploration. However, there is considerable debate and practice variability regarding which patients are taken to the OR for exploration after induction chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation. Some centers, including those of several of the authors and editors of this topic review, take nearly all patients, regardless of vascular involvement on imaging, to the OR to assess for resectability, especially after receiving initial therapy with the multiagent regimen FOLFIRINOX. (See
         <a class="local">
          'FOLFIRINOX'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         By contrast, other centers rely more on local imaging characteristics to guide surgical candidacy. We await the results of ongoing clinical trials to guide this debate.

         <a href="#rid2">

         </a>
         ] both state that surgery may be considered in a patient with a dramatic response to initial chemotherapy and/or RT, but neither addresses the difficulty in assessing resectability on cross-sectional imaging after initial medical therapy. NCCN guidelines further state that patients with radiographically stable disease after neoadjuvant therapy should still be considered for surgery if there is a marked clinical improvement and/or decrease in cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9). However, it is unclear what level of change in CA 19-9 constitutes a meaningful treatment response. At least some data suggest a lack of association between the magnitude of the change in CA 19-9 level and survival after multimodality treatment in this setting, unless the CA 19-9 normalizes [

         <a href="#rid71">
          71
         </a>
         ]. More recently, multiple institutions have published results showing routine conversion of patients from unresectable to resectable after FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/nabpaclitaxel regimens, although the exact rate of conversion is unknown.

        <p>
         The median survival of patients with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer is approximately 10 to 12 months, but there is a potential for longer-term survival if disease can be resected. Two independent systematic reviews concluded that approximately one-third of initially unresectable pancreatic tumors could be rendered potentially resectable through the use of neoadjuvant therapy [
         <a href="#rid98">
          98,99
         </a>
         ]. Pathologic complete responses have even been reported in 3 to 5 percent of cases [
         <a href="#rid98">
          98
         </a>
         ]. However, these data must be interpreted cautiously given the heterogeneous nature of this group of patients and the treatments given to them, and the fact that at least some of them might have been considered to have potentially resectable disease by modern standards. In the prospective randomized LAP07 trial, described above, only 4 percent of study participants responded to initial treatment sufficiently (

         It is possible that the use of more intensive initial combination chemotherapy (eg, FOLFIRINOX or

Median overall survival for the resected patients was 35 months, and for those undergoing an R0 resection, three-year overall survival was approximately 50 percent. Importantly, this was not a randomized trial, and selection bias may have accounted for these unexpectedly favorable results. (See

          101
         </a>
         ] are unclear. While it is reasonable to evaluate responding patients for potential resectability after neoadjuvant treatment, the frequency with which this results in a dramatic response and culminates in a complete resection (even in patients treated with more effective and more toxic combination regimens such as FOLFIRINOX) is low [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,102-110
         </a>
         ]. In addition, long-term survival appears to be exceedingly rare in this circumstance, largely due to the development of metastatic disease [

        </p>
        <p>
         Nevertheless, in our view, all such patients should be assessed for surgery after initial medical therapy. Imaging is imperfect in this setting. In particular, the ability to reliably determine resectability of a locally advanced cancer radiographically is limited after multiagent chemotherapy due to the presence of fibrosis and scar tissue. Laparoscopic or open evaluation of the abdomen may be necessary in order to determine the potential for resection, particularly in patients treated with highly active regimens, such as FOLFIRINOX or

         Some cases are classified as "borderline resectable," mostly based on radiographic interface between the primary tumor and the mesenteric vasculature. Although some of these patients will prove to be resectable with initial surgery, the likelihood of an incomplete resection is high. (See

         There is no consensus as to the best approach to patients with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. The following represents our preferred approach, which is similar to our approach for patients who have locally advanced, nonmetastatic but unresectable disease at presentation, which is outlined in the algorithm  (

         The major goal of surgery for pancreatic cancer is an R0 resection; a margin-positive resection strongly predicts early recurrence and short survival [
         <a href="#rid113">
          113-116
         </a>
         ]. The term "borderline resectable" was proposed to differentiate a group of patients with limited vascular involvement that was potentially amenable to resection and reconstruction, albeit with a high risk of a margin-positive resection [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,117-120
         </a>
         ]. These patients were considered to be good candidates for neoadjuvant therapy, with the expectation that downstaging would provide an enhanced opportunity for a complete resection and long-term survival [
         <a href="#rid121">
          121,122
         </a>
         ]. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         The bulk of the available data consist of small single-institution series and small phase II (uncontrolled) trials that enrolled a mixture of patients with initially resectable, unresectable, and borderline resectable disease. A meta-analysis of 38 studies consisting primarily of single-arm observational studies in patients with potentially resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer, found that neoadjuvant treatment had similar overall survival compared with upfront surgery (weighted mean overall survival 18.8 versus 14.8 months) [
         <a href="#rid123">
          123
         </a>
         ]. The difference was larger among patients whose tumors were resected (26.1 versus 15 months). Although overall resection rates were lower with upfront surgery (66 versus 81 percent), the R0 resection rate was higher (87 versus 67 percent), and the pathologic nodal positivity rate was also lower (44 versus 65 percent).

However, the difference in median overall survival (the primary endpoint) did not reach the level of statistical significance (median 16 versus 14.3 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0.78, 95% CI 0.58-1.05).

         An important caveat is that, as noted above, there is increasing evidence that a "response" to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with borderline resectable disease is not necessarily reflected by standard radiographic indicators. In a single-center study of 122 borderline resectable cases treated using a variety of neoadjuvant strategies, 15 patients had a partial response, 84 were deemed to have stable disease, and 23 had progressive disease as determined using standard Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors response criteria  (

Although only one patient had disease downstaged to resectable status by imaging criteria, 85 were able to undergo pancreatectomy after neoadjuvant therapy, and 81 achieved R0 resection status. These data raise questions as to the optimal duration and end point of neoadjuvant therapy in these patients. However, they do support the view that all patients who remain surgical candidates should undergo surgical exploration after neoadjuvant treatment in the absence of documented metastatic disease.

         In our view, concomitant CRT or stereotactic body RT (SBRT) cannot be recommended as a standard approach for all patients with borderline resectable disease who have not developed metastatic disease after initial systemic chemotherapy and who are being considered for resection.

         As with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer, there are no randomized trials demonstrating that patients who receive radiation therapy (RT) as a component of neoadjuvant therapy have better survival than do those undergoing induction chemotherapy alone. However, this remains an open question as the available studies have used various RT doses and modalities, and randomized trials such as ALLIANCE A021501 were not adequately powered to compare chemotherapy with or without RT. As a result, the role of RT in the neoadjuvant setting has not been fully vetted [

         There were imbalances in certain prognostic features between the two groups. As an example, the median cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) was higher in the SBRT arm (260 [range 0-14,010] versus 167 [range 1-13, 221] U/mL). Furthermore, CA 19-9 levels as high as 13,000 to 14,000 U/mL suggest categorically unresectable and incurable disease  (

Notably, the lower rates of pancreatectomy (35 percent with combined therapy [R0 in 74 percent] versus 49 percent after chemotherapy alone [R0 resection in 88 percent]) in this study contrast with the results of high-volume centers, which report complete (R0) resection rates of 84 to 97 percent; this relatively low rate of resection might have been attributable to the variable expertise of the enrolling centers.

         In the absence of randomized trials demonstrating benefit, intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) cannot be considered a standard approach for treatment of borderline resectable pancreatic cancer, and it should be reserved for carefully selected patients who are being treated in a center with significant experience and expertise, preferably within the context of a clinical trial.
        </p>
        <p>
         IORT permits the delivery of high-dose RT directly to areas of tumor involvement without the morbidity associated with irradiation of adjacent normal tissues, particularly the small bowel. A number of reports from both single institutions and cooperative groups have explored IORT, usually in conjunction with preoperative CRT [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,130-133
         </a>
         ]. Taken together, the available data suggest that while local control rates may be higher with IORT compared with EBRT alone, this benefit is offset by the rapid development of metastatic disease in most reports, and it is not clear that IORT contributes to higher survival rates. The benefits of IORT have been marginal or absent in other reports [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A systematic review of IORT for treatment of pancreatic cancer included 14 reports published between 1995 and 2007 (the majority case series, no randomized trials) involving patients with either localized resectable or locally advanced disease [
         <a href="#rid134">
          134
         </a>
         ]. The authors concluded that, while the use of IORT may be associated with a slight (and statistically nonsignificant) improvement in median survival among patients with localized, potentially resectable pancreatic cancer, no benefit could be shown in the setting of locally advanced disease. No published studies addressed quality of life issues.

When the neoadjuvant therapy arms were compared, the highest 12-month survival was seen with FOLFIRINOX, followed by GEMCAP, and then CRT (84 versus 79 and 64 percent, respectively), and the differences when compared with immediate surgery were significantly higher for both FOLFIRINOX (HR 0.16, 95% CI 0.05-0.56), and GEMCAP (HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12-0.85).

Randomized trials have demonstrated a significant survival benefit for the administration of six months of adjuvant chemotherapy, and it is recommended in the United States and elsewhere. By contrast, benefit of adjuvant radiation therapy is less certain, and practice is variable within and outside of the United States. (See

         Pathologic scoring systems to assess the response to neoadjuvant therapy in resected pancreatic cancer have been developed as an aid to prognostication and the selection of candidates for adjuvant therapy [
         <a href="#rid139">
          139-141

         ]. However, consensus on how to assess the response to preoperative therapy is lacking [

          142

         ], and more information is needed on the comparative prognostic and predictive value of the various available scoring systems before this approach can be recommended.

         A multidisciplinary team should develop treatment and care plans for patients with nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer guided by radiographic disease extent, performance status, comorbidities, goals of care, patient preferences, psychosocial issues, and symptom burden, and the results of both germline and targeted tumoral (somatic) testing.

         Given the limitations of imaging after neoadjuvant treatment (particularly after FOLFIRINOX), we offer subsequent surgical exploration to all patients without documented metastatic disease. (See

          'Rationale and outcomes'

         above.)

          Adjuvant therapy
         </strong>
         – For patients who received neoadjuvant therapy, we suggest adjuvant systemic therapy to complete a total of six months of systemic chemotherapy, including the preoperative regimen (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Role of adjuvant therapy'

         above.)

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For patients with an excellent performance status who are able to tolerate it, we prefer modified FOLFIRINOX  (

          table 3
         </a>
         ). For less fit patients,

          gemcitabine

         plus

          capecitabine
         </a>
         is an option. Gemcitabine alone or, where available, S-1 alone is another reasonable option, particularly for patients with a borderline performance status or a comorbidity profile that precludes multiagent therapy.
