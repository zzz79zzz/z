The clinical syndrome (phenotype) is characterized by extremely elevated levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a propensity to early onset atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In general, homozygotes manifest the disease at a much earlier age than heterozygotes and the disease is more severe.</p><p>This topic will focus on the primary goal of therapy in FH adults: to significantly lower LDL-C levels. Other issues regarding FH in adults are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/107507.html" rel="external">"Familial hypercholesterolemia in adults: Overview"</a>.)</p><p>The management of children and adolescents with heterozygous or homozygous FH is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/121831.html" rel="external">"Familial hypercholesterolemia in children", section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1269508005"><span class="h1">REFERRAL TO A LIPID SPECIALIST</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients with a diagnosis of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia should be referred to a lipid specialist with particular expertise in the care of these individuals. For adult heterozygote patients who have not achieved their low density lipoprotein cholesterol goal (see <a class="local">'Goal of therapy'</a> below) on statin therapy, consideration should be given to referral.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H392012451"><span class="h1">RATIONALE FOR INTENSE LDL-C LOWERING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Intense low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering in individuals with heterozygous or homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) decreases progression of angiographically demonstrated coronary artery disease [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], and reduces cardiovascular disease events (myocardial infarction) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], coronary heart disease mortality [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], and all-cause mortality [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>]. The magnitude of benefit has varied in these studies due to differing populations, the end point chosen, as well as the intensity and duration of treatment. Reduction in combined end points of up to 50 percent have been found. </p><p>While all studies of the impact of therapy on mortality in FH patients have been observational, the results are consistent with the findings of randomized trials (usually with statins) that enrolled many individuals without FH. In the aggregate, these secondary prevention studies found a lowering of the risk for cardiovascular death and myocardial infarction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112841.html" rel="external">"Management of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease"</a>.)</p><p>Finally, at any level of untreated LDL-C, the prognosis for patients with heterozygous FH is worse than those without. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/107507.html" rel="external">"Familial hypercholesterolemia in adults: Overview", section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1952507243"><span class="h1">GENERAL PREVENTIVE MEASURES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients with elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) should be counseled in lifestyle changes that may decrease LDL-C levels, as well as other cardiovascular risks. This counseling should include dietary modification, physical activity, and weight loss in obese individuals. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1505.html" rel="external">"Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease (secondary prevention) or at very high risk", section on 'Lifestyle modifications'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7573.html" rel="external">"Overview of primary prevention of cardiovascular disease"</a>.)</p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">Aspirin</a> may be appropriate for many of these patients, as they are considered by most experts to be at high risk for a cardiovascular disease event. Specifically, we recommend aspirin for patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and men &gt;55 years of age who have multiple coronary heart disease risk factors.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H805592031"><span class="h1">HOMOZYGOUS INDIVIDUALS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>This section applies to adults with homozygous (HoFH). The management of HoFH in children is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/121831.html" rel="external">"Familial hypercholesterolemia in children", section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p>All adult patients with HoFH should receive care from a lipid expert, and many will benefit from the care of a cardiovascular specialist (see <a class="local">'Referral to a lipid specialist'</a> above). As the disease and its clinical consequences begin at birth, most patients will have been evaluated and treated in childhood. By the time they are under the care of adult physicians, many will have established cardiovascular disease. However, a few will be fortunate enough to be disease-free due to successful lipid-lowering treatment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2078015842"><span class="h2">Goal of therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The broad goal of therapy is to lower the LDL-C with the therapies described below (in this section) as much as is practical (intensive lowering). "Practical" is determined by patient preference, cost, and availability of therapies. Setting a specific LDL-C target, while logical in other patients with elevated LDL-C, may not be helpful in this population. </p><p>HoFH patients often have untreated LDL-C of &gt;500 mg/dL (&gt;13 mmol/L). There is little agreement among experts on the specific LDL-C goal. Values between &lt;50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) and 135 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L) have been articulated. However, values at the low end of this range may be difficult if not impossible to achieve even with multiple cholesterol-lowering drugs. This is due to the fact that they usually depend on the presence of the LDL receptor, which is absent or nearly absent in these patients, for their effect. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4564.html" rel="external">"Statins: Actions, side effects, and administration", section on 'Mechanism of action'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H263889060"><span class="h2">Our approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The treatment strategy for patients with HoFH will likely include a high-dose statin and may include <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a>, a PCSK9 inhibitor, LDL apheresis, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="87508" href="/d/drug information/87508.html" rel="external">lomitapide</a>. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Statin</strong> – Based on their safety, ease of use, and potential for significant LDL-C lowering even in patients with HoFH, high-dose statin therapy is used in most individuals. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ezetimibe</strong> – Although <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a> has not been evaluated in this setting, we often add it to statin based on clinical experience. </p><p></p><p>●<strong>PCSK9 inhibitor</strong> – In many patients, we add a PCSK9 inhibitor to statin and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a>. We specifically <strong>may use a PCSK9 inhibitor as an additional agent in patients who do not meet cholesterol treatment goals with maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapies (eg, statins, ezetimibe) or as an alternative agent in patients who are intolerant of such therapies. We suggest that this therapy is guided by a lipid specialist. </strong>Multiple studies have demonstrated that this class of drug effectively and safely lowers LDL-C in individuals with homozygous FH as long as some LDL receptor function is present [<a href="#rid5">5-9</a>]. In these studies, LDL-C was lowered by about 30 percent. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/106888.html" rel="external">"PCSK9 inhibitors: Pharmacology, adverse effects, and use"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1">The 2020 ODYSSEY HoFH trial is the largest study of PCSK9 inhibitors in these patients [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In this study, 69 patients treated with conventional LDL-C-lowering therapy (usually statin and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a>) were randomly assigned to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="103073" href="/d/drug information/103073.html" rel="external">alirocumab</a> or placebo. Mean baseline LDL-C was 295 and 260 mg/dL in the two groups, respectively. LDL-C levels decreased by 26 percent after 12 weeks on active drug and increased by 8.6 percent in those on placebo (p&lt;0.0001). The safety profile of alirocumab was comparable to that of placebo.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although LDL-C lowering with PCSK9 inhibitor in the range of 30 percent is important and likely associated with an incremental decrease in the rate of adverse cardiovascular events, the LDL-C will remain significantly above the LDL-C goal, discussed above. (See <a class="local">'Goal of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Additional therapies</strong> – After therapy with statin, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a>, and a PCSK9 antibody, the LDL-C goal should be reevaluated and a determination made as to whether additional therapy should be added [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Many homozygous patients will require additional therapies to lower LDL-C, including LDL-C apheresis, liver transplantation, portocaval shunt, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="87508" href="/d/drug information/87508.html" rel="external">lomitapide</a>. Most of these do not require the presence of the LDL receptor. These uncommonly used therapies are generally prescribed by a lipid specialist. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4554.html" rel="external">"Treatment of drug-resistant hypercholesterolemia", section on 'LDL apheresis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4554.html" rel="external">"Treatment of drug-resistant hypercholesterolemia", section on 'Lomitapide'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Monoclonal antibodies to angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) have been shown to reduce LDL-C by &gt;50 percent. ANGPTL3 is a hormone produced by the liver and inhibits lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme that breaks down plasma triglycerides, and lowers LDL-C by an LDL receptor-mediated pathway. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="130778" href="/d/drug information/130778.html" rel="external">Evinacumab</a> is one such ANGPTL3 monoclonal antibody. The drug is being used by some lipid experts in patients with HoFH. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4565.html" rel="external">"Lipoprotein classification, metabolism, and role in atherosclerosis", section on 'Endogenous pathway of lipid metabolism'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the ELIPSE HoFH trial, 65 patients with homozygous FH who were receiving stable lipid-lowering therapy (44 percent were receiving statin, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a>, and a PCSK9 inhibitor) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 manner to an intravenous infusion of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="130778" href="/d/drug information/130778.html" rel="external">evinacumab</a> or placebo every four weeks [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The diagnosis of HoFH was based on either genetic or clinical criteria. The mean baseline LDL-C was 255.1 mg/dL. At week 24, the primary outcome of the percent change from baseline in calculated LDL-C was a reduction of 47.1 percent in the evinacumab group and an increase of 1.9 percent in the placebo group (p&lt;0.001). The absolute difference in LDL-C was -132.1 mg/dL, comparing evinacumab with placebo. The rate of adverse events was 66 and 81 percent in the two groups, respectively. Consistent with their mode of action, the results were independent of the degree of LDL-receptor function. Triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were also significantly lowered. There were two serious adverse events in the evinacumab group: urosepsis and a suicide attempt. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3331381596"><span class="h1">HETEROZYGOUS INDIVIDUALS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The vast majority of adult patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) encountered in clinical practice will be heterozygotes and will usually have an untreated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥190 mg/dL  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112674" href="/d/graphic/112674.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). We recommend intensive lipid lowering for virtually all patients diagnosed with heterozygous FH. </p><p>Numerous studies have found that these individuals often receive suboptimal treatment or no treatment. In a retrospective analysis of 2382 patients referred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory with LDL-C ≥130 mg/dL, severe FH, defined by any prior LDL-C ≥280 mg/dL, was identified in 54 patients [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. LDL-C reduction ≥50 percent of the peak value was achieved in 56 percent, LDL-C &lt;130 mg/dL in 32 percent, and LDL-C &lt;100 mg/dL in 17 percent of patients. Treatment with high-intensity statins plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a> was prescribed for 67 percent, high-intensity statin alone in 24 percent, and other lipid-lowering therapies in 9 percent of patients. In the SAFEHEART study (Spanish Familial Hypercholesterolemia Cohort Study) that included 2732 patients with molecularly diagnosed FH, 46.8 percent were treated with maximal combination therapy (high-intensity statin plus ezetimibe), and 71.8 percent on maximal lipid-lowering therapy (treatment with an anticipated &gt;50 percent reduction in LDL-C) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Among patients treated with maximum lipid-lowering therapy, an LDL-C treatment target &lt;100 mg/dL was achieved by only 11.2 percent of patients. The multivariable predictors of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) at five years were age ≥60 years (hazard ratio 2.92 [1.14 to 7.52 for ages 30 to 59 years], and 4.27 [1.60 to 11.48 for ages ≥60 years versus &lt;30 years]), male sex (hazard ratio 2.01 [1.33 to 3.04]), history of ASCVD before enrollment (4.15 [2.55 to 6.75]), high blood pressure (1.99 [1.26 to 3.15]), obesity (2.67 [1.47 to 4.85]), active smoking (1.62 [1.08 to 2.44]), and LDL-C between 100 and 159 mg/dL (2.50 [0.60 to 10.53]) and ≥160 mg/dL (4.80 [1.15 to 20.01]) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3218063063"><span class="h2">Our approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We attempt to have a detailed discussion with each patient prior to initiating therapy. Similarly, it is important for the clinician and the patient to have an ongoing dialog. Prior to starting therapy, we teach the patient about the nature of the disease, including the potential for early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events. An explanation of the benefits and risks of therapy as well as the fact that there are factual gaps in our understanding of the disease is essential. The patient should be informed that these gaps prevent us from being able to make strong recommendations regarding the end point of therapy in some situations. </p><p>For heterozygous FH patients, the following steps (sequentially) are a reasonable approach  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112294" href="/d/graphic/112294.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>): </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Set LDL-C goal.

If the patient is not at LDL-C goal after statin, start <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a> 10 mg daily and repeat LDL-C in 6 to 12 weeks. If the patient remains above the goal, refer the patient to a lipid specialist for consideration of adding a PCSK9 inhibitor. (See <a class="local">'Second-line therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Some patients who do not achieve their LDL-C goal on statin, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a>, and PCSK9 inhibitor are candidates for third line therapy, which may be recommended by a lipid specialist. This group of patients may include individuals at very high risk of a cardiovascular disease event. (See <a class="local">'Third-line treatment'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3683226314"><span class="h2">Goal of therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most experts agree that intensive lowering of LDL-C is indicated for heterozygous FH patients. The rationale is presented above. (See <a class="local">'Rationale for intense LDL-C lowering'</a> above.) </p><p>We acknowledge that many patients will not be able to achieve their LDL-C goals for reasons presented below. One of the difficult tasks in the management of LDL-C for the clinician and his or her patient is the determination when the LDL-C is close enough to goal such that additional therapy will not be started.</p><p>In addition, some experts believe that there should be different goals for different risk FH patients. For example, the risk of a cardiovascular disease event is different for the following two patients with identical on-treatment LDL-C: someone without a history of cardiovascular disease and another individual with a recent myocardial infarction.</p><p>Achieving an intensive LDL-C goal may be difficult for many reasons, including the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among patients with FH, the pretreatment LDL-C is greatly variable, ranging from 190 mg/dL to greater than 500 mg/dL. If statin therapy consistently reduced LDL-C levels by 60 percent, post-statin LDL-C levels would range from 76 mg/dL to greater than 200 mg/dL. In reality, there is even greater variation since LDL-C response to statin therapy at the maximally tolerated dose ranges from 20 to 60 percent. Thus, it may be unrealistic for a patient whose starting LDL-C is 500 mg/dL to achieve an LDL-C of &lt;70 mg/dL. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Some therapies, such as PCSK9 inhibitors, are costly and may not be an option for some patients.</p><p></p><p>While not based on randomized trial evidence, we believe the following broad approach to goal setting is reasonable:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The LDL-C goal should be individualized for each patient, given the above considerations. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Based on the starting LDL-C, we consider a high intensity statin and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a> as initial therapy for those high-risk patients who may benefit from &gt;60 percent reduction in LDL-C. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">This LDL-C goal can be modified (higher or lower) based on the patient’s risk of future cardiovascular events.

In initial studies, FH heterozygotes were typically treated with multidrug regimens, which included less potent statins. Many studies demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular disease events, including mortality [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. At present, high-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8949" href="/d/drug information/8949.html" rel="external">atorvastatin</a> (titrated to 80 mg daily) or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10282" href="/d/drug information/10282.html" rel="external">rosuvastatin</a> (40 mg daily) should be the initial regimen since these drugs are more effective at lowering LDL-C than other statins as monotherapy [<a href="#rid14">14-16</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4564.html" rel="external">"Statins: Actions, side effects, and administration"</a>.)</p><p>We recognize that some younger patients and vegans may achieve desirable LDL-C on moderate-intensity statins.</p><p>The benefit of this approach was evaluated in a trial in which 325 patients with FH were randomly assigned to high-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8949" href="/d/drug information/8949.html" rel="external">atorvastatin</a> (80 mg/day) or conventional dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9923" href="/d/drug information/9923.html" rel="external">simvastatin</a> (40 mg/day) for two years [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. High-dose atorvastatin produced a larger reduction in LDL-C (308 to 149 mg/dL [8 versus 3.9 mmol/L]) than conventional dose simvastatin (321 to 185 mg/dL [8.3 to 4.8 mmol/L]). High-dose atorvastatin also produced a significant reduction in carotid intima media thickness, measured with B-mode ultrasound, compared with an increase with simvastatin. </p><p>For patients who have not significantly (by at least 30 percent) lowered their LDL-C on <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10282" href="/d/drug information/10282.html" rel="external">rosuvastatin</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8949" href="/d/drug information/8949.html" rel="external">atorvastatin</a>, we switch to the other statin. If neither successfully lowers LDL-C, a less potent statin will very occasionally prove more effective. In addition, clinicians should consider patient's noncompliance as a possible explanation of a less-than-expected response to a potent statin. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1547336039"><span class="h2">Second-line therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We <strong>may use as an additional agent in patients who do not meet cholesterol treatment goals with dietary modification plus maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapies (eg, statins, </strong><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a><strong>) or as an alternative agent in patients intolerant of such therapies.</strong> Most adult heterozygotes will not be able to achieve LDL-C goal with maximally tolerated, high-dose statin monotherapy (see <a class="local">'Goal of therapy'</a> above), which will likely lower LDL-C no more than 55 to 60 percent [<a href="#rid12">12,17,18</a>]. If after three months of compliant statin therapy the LDL-C target has not been reached, we add a second drug to lower LDL-C. However, experts differ on the optimal approach after statin. Most experts recommend ezetimibe, a PCSK9 inhibitor, or both. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/106888.html" rel="external">"PCSK9 inhibitors: Pharmacology, adverse effects, and use", section on 'Clinical effect'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4549.html" rel="external">"Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering therapy in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease", section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p>In our practice, when a second agent is required, we typically initiate <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a> 10 mg daily as the next cholesterol lowering agent based on the results from IMPROVE-IT, and follow this with a PCSK9 inhibitor based on the results from FOURIER when the goal has not been met. Ezetimibe can lower LDL-C by an additional 20 to 30 percent [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. However, if on statin the patient remains significantly above goal such that a 20 to 30 percent additional reduction will not bring the patient to goal, we consider adding a PCSK9 inhibitor as the next LDL-C lowering therapy. We acknowledge that many insurers will not approve a PCSK9 inhibitor without prior trial of ezetimibe.</p><p>While additional lipid lowering therapy produces a further reduction in LDL-C [<a href="#rid19">19-23</a>], there have been no trials in heterozygous FH patients demonstrating improved clinical outcomes in patients already on high-dose statin therapy. However, the FOURIER trial of patients without FH found that a PCSK9 inhibitor (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="103780" href="/d/drug information/103780.html" rel="external">evolocumab</a>) lowered the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and non-fatal stroke. There was no decrease in the risk of cardiovascular death. As patients with FH are at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease events at any LDL-C level compared with those who do not have FH, we believe that FOURIER supports the use of PCSK9 inhibitors to achieve LDL-C goals in these individuals. </p><p>While PCSK9 inhibitors are highly effective at lowering LDL-C and have been shown in patients without FH to lower the risk of MI and stroke, many patients may not have access to these drugs due to cost. Even in geographies where they have been approved for use [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>], they may not be covered by insurance carriers or insurance carriers may require large monthly copayments from patients. Some cost-effectiveness studies have concluded that this class of drug is cost effective despite the absence of direct evidence of cardiovascular disease risk reduction in FH patients [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].

The primary end point of the percentage change in calculated LDL-C from baseline to 24 weeks was greater with alirocumab (-57.9 percent and -51.4 percent in the two studies, respectively).
