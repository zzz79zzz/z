         The possibility that anesthetic and sedative drugs may be neurotoxic to the developing brain is of widespread importance to patients, parents, and the clinicians who care for them. This topic will discuss the animal studies that initially questioned the safety of anesthetics on the developing brain, the proposed mechanisms of damage, as well as the clinical studies and the limitations of studies in humans.

          THE ISSUE

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Studies in animals have shown that anesthetic and sedative drugs can cause neuronal damage to the developing brain, resulting in lasting behavioral and cognitive deficits. Some human studies also suggest an association between exposure to anesthesia in early childhood and subsequent neurodevelopmental deficit, but causation has not been established, and specific anesthetic and patient factors that may affect risk remain unclear [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Any degree of neurotoxicity of anesthetic and sedative drugs in humans may have widespread implications. In the United States, over 1.3 million children under the age of five years undergo surgical procedures each year [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. Most of these children require anesthesia to tolerate these procedures, and most of these procedures cannot be delayed without adding substantial surgical risk. In addition, an increasing number of young children receive sedatives or general anesthesia for neuroimaging studies [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ], with many more requiring procedural sedation in the emergency department.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning about potential risks of negative effects on the developing brain from administration of anesthetics for children under age three, as well as pregnant women during their third trimester, especially for repeated exposures or procedures lasting more than three hours (see
         <a class="local">
          'The FDA warning'
         </a>
         below). Most children who undergo general anesthesia are exposed for less than the FDA defined high-risk threshold of three hours. In a retrospective cohort analysis of approximately 1.5 million pediatric (&lt;18 years of age) anesthetic billing records from the National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry, the median anesthetic duration was 57 minutes, with 6 percent of anesthetics lasting longer than three hours, but in children under one year old, 13.7 percent of anesthetics lasted longer than three hours [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In another retrospective study of approximately 21,000 children born between 1994 and 2007 in Minnesota, 14.9 percent of children were exposed to anesthesia before three years of age. Of the children exposed to anesthesia, 26.3 percent had either one exposure longer than three hours or multiple anesthetic exposures [

         Anesthetic agents cause neuronal oxidative stress by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation within mitochondria during exposure [

         ]. ROS produced in this setting permits cytochrome c mobilization from the inner mitochondrial membrane [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10

         Laboratory studies involving human embryonic stem cells and rodent neurons have suggested that anesthetics may impair neural development during critical periods through abnormalities of NMDA and/or GABA receptor expression, activity, and signaling; neuroinflammation; and dysregulation of other growth and survival pathways [

          7,10-16

         <a href="#rid20">
          20

         Several studies have reported that both single and multiple exposures to anesthetic agents in nonhuman primates (NHPs) result in long term neurodevelopmental defects. The duration of a single exposure was as long as 24 hours. These studies are likely of greater translational value than rodent studies because the neurodevelopmental stage of NHPs is similar to humans at birth. In addition, in contrast with rodent studies, the conditions of human anesthesia can be mimicked in NHPs, and physiologic parameters can be measured and homeostasis maintained during anesthesia, as they would be in humans.

         While
         <strong>
         </strong>
         animal studies find neurotoxic effects due to anesthetic medications, human studies have produced mixed results and have important limitations. Specifically, in most clinical studies it is difficult to distinguish the effect of the anesthetic medication from other patient and peri-operative factors. As a result, the question of whether anesthesia has any long-term neurodevelopmental effects on young children remains unclear. The best evidence suggests that exposure to anesthesia has limited to no association with detrimental effects on intelligence. However, a number of questions still remain, particularly the association between anesthesia exposure and other neurodevelopmental outcomes such as behavior, the effect of prolonged or multiple exposures, and the impact on potentially vulnerable patient populations.

         The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a birth cohort from England, evaluated 13,433 children using a wide array of neurodevelopmental assessments at various ages [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. In the cohort, 1110 children had a single exposure and 212 had multiple exposures to surgery and anesthesia. Compared to children unexposed before age four years, those with single and multiple exposures had lower scores in social communication at age nine years old, and motor function, specifically manual dexterity at age seven years old. Children with multiple exposures also had lower scores in dynamic balance at seven years and an increased number of behavioral difficulties at age eight years. Differences were not seen in a number of other outcomes including general cognitive ability, attention, memory, language, and academic achievement.

         A number of different meta-analyses have been performed synthesizing data from the published clinical studies. Meta-analyses that have pooled data from wide ranges of different outcomes have found that neurodevelopmental outcomes are generally worse in children exposed to surgery and anesthesia than those who have not required surgery and anesthesia. Results from these studies are difficult to interpret given the heterogeneity in the included studies and outcomes. In an attempt to address the issue of heterogeneity, some meta-analyses only pooled similar outcomes and reported that while significantly worse scores were seen in some outcomes such as behavioral problems, a limited association was seen in others like intelligence. Meta-analyses however do not mitigate the fundamental limitations of potential bias and confounding inherent to all observational studies.

         The age at which the developing human brain may be most vulnerable to neurotoxic effects of anesthetic drugs is unknown, and is controversial. There is little support for delaying necessary minor surgery in young children to reduce neurodevelopmental risks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whereas brain development extends from the embryonic period until and through adolescence, neurodevelopment may be more susceptible to environmental insult during specific periods depending on the toxicant [
         <a href="#rid62">
          62
         </a>
         ]. In rodent studies, the vulnerable period to anesthesia is thought to correspond to the period of maximal synaptogenesis (ie, approximately two days before birth until two weeks after birth) [
         <a href="#rid63">
          63
         </a>
         ], based solely on findings of induced apoptosis and neurodegeneration during this time period [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21,64,65
         </a>
         ]. Translation of this data to humans are debated as synaptogenesis in children peaks at under six months of age in the sensorimotor cortex, at approximately 10 months of age in the parietal and temporal cortices, and at approximately age three years in the prefrontal cortex [
         <a href="#rid66">

        </p>
        <p>
         Studies on neurotoxicity have involved children exposed to anesthesia from as early as birth to as late as 10 years of age. While some studies have found varying risk of neurodevelopmental deficit based on the age at exposure to anesthesia, most have not accounted for the fact that children tend to receive different procedures at different ages.

         In one study, children exposed to anesthesia before age three had an increased risk of deficits in language and reasoning, but the same deficits were not present in children exposed between ages three and five, and 5 and 10, suggesting a potential vulnerability at a younger age [

         The opposite result, however, was found in one of the studies from Canada, finding that children exposed between ages two and four years were more likely to have deficits than children exposed from age zero to two years, suggesting vulnerability at an older age [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40

         Most human studies evaluate exposures to general anesthesia but lack information on the specific drugs and doses administered, or even the duration of anesthesia exposure. Thus, the number of exposures to anesthesia has been used as a surrogate for dose, with a single exposure considered to be a lower dose, and multiple exposures a higher dose. However, this approach may not account for the fact that some children undergo single complex procedures with long exposures, while others undergo multiple short straightforward procedures. Whether the number of exposures has an effect independent of the total duration of anesthesia is also unknown.

         Based on the published animal and clinical studies, as well as input from neurotoxicity investigators and stakeholders, in December 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced warnings about potential risks of negative effects on the developing brain from administration of anesthetics and sedative drugs to pregnant women and children under age three, as well as pregnant women during their third trimester, especially for repeated exposures or procedures lasting more than three hours [
         <a href="#rid74">

         ]. The FDA recommends that health care providers discuss with pregnant patients and parents of young children the benefits, risks, and appropriate timing of surgery requiring anesthesia that will take longer than three hours. However, the degree of risk remains unclear. The statements in the FDA warning that the children at risk are those who are under three years or in utero, and are exposed for more than three hours, are largely based on animal data and need to be further verified in clinical studies. Due to the lack of clinical evidence, in April 2017, the FDA modified their warning, stating that medically necessary procedures in pregnant women and children under age three should not be delayed and that practitioners should follow their usual practice paradigms [

         The risk of adverse neurodevelopmental effects from anesthetic agents in children remains uncertain. Many clinical studies including meta-analyses have reported that compared to unexposed children, children with exposure to general anesthesia have more adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, particularly in specific domains. Anesthetic exposure appears to have limited to no impact on the cognition domain as measured by IQ testing, but stronger association has been reported in domains of motor function and behavior. However, at this time there is inadequate evidence to directly attribute this effect to the anesthesia. (See

         There is one observational study reporting an association between prenatal exposure and subsequent abnormal behavioral scores, but given the limitations of the study, it does not provide adequate evidence to justify any changes in clinical practice, particularly since avoiding necessary surgery during pregnancy can have significant detrimental effects on the mother and the child.

         </strong>
         While children who need surgery and anesthesia have worse scores in some neurodevelopmental outcomes compared with children who do not need surgery and anesthesia, these score differences are small with unclear clinical significance, and these differences cannot yet be fully attributed to the anesthesia exposure. Children who undergo surgery and anesthesia and those who do not are different in ways that may not have been fully accounted for in the available studies. Thus, there is still uncertainty that exposure to anesthetic medications has lasting effects on children. (See

         </strong>
         The potential risks of exposure to anesthesia must be weighed against the benefits of the surgical or diagnostic procedure. Given the uncertainty that any long-term effects in children are due to the anesthetic medications, and the potential for complications if necessary surgery is avoided or delayed, changes in clinical management should not be made based on the potential risk of neurotoxicity of anesthesia.
