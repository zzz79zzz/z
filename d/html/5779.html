They can occur in several different anatomic portions of the atrial septum, and the location of the defect generally reflects the abnormality of embryogenesis that led to the anomaly (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52106" href="/z/d/graphic/52106.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). An atrial septal defect (ASD) can be isolated or can be associated with other congenital cardiac abnormalities. The sizes of ASDs are variable, and their functional consequences are related to the anatomic location of the defect, its size, and the presence or absence of other cardiac anomalies, as well as systolic and diastolic function of the ventricles.</p><p>This topic will review the management and outcomes of children with an isolated ASD, focusing on management of secundum ASDs, which are the most common type of isolated ASD. The classification of ASDs and the pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of isolated ASD in children are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5754.html" rel="external">"Isolated atrial septal defects (ASDs) in children: Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H116887543"><span class="h1">GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Important considerations in the management of a child with an isolated ASD include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Size, degree of shunting, and persistence of the ASD</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Likelihood of spontaneous closure</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When closure is indicated, deciding between transcatheter and surgical closure</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2433848213"><span class="h2">Atrial septal defect size</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For the purpose of the discussion in this topic review, we generally define the size of isolated ASDs as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Trivial – &lt;3 mm in diameter</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Small – 3 to &lt;6 mm in diameter</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Moderate – 6 to 8 mm in diameter</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Large – &gt;8 mm in diameter</p><p></p><p>These absolute measurements are not exact, and the relative size of the defect (related to overall heart size) may be more clinically relevant. For example, a 6-mm ASD would be insignificant in an adult but would be of moderate size in a newborn.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2381117442"><span class="h2">Measurement of shunt ratio</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The main indication for ASD closure has been the presence of a left-to-right shunt sizable enough to result in clinically significant right heart overload. This typically occurs in patients with moderate to large ASDs. The usual clinical standard for repair is a measured shunt ratio of pulmonary-to-systemic flow (Qp/Qs) &gt;2:1, though high-quality evidence supporting this threshold is generally lacking [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Other experts in the field have advocated lower thresholds of 1.7:1 and 1.5:1 [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>].</p><p>Cardiac catheterization is considered the gold standard for measuring Qp/Qs, but noninvasive techniques are accepted alternatives in experienced centers. Phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in experienced hands appears to be at least as good as the standard Fick technique for measuring shunt flow with blood samples obtained at catheterization [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. Pulsed Doppler echocardiography is now routinely used in sites that have established an acceptable correlation between echocardiographic and catheterization laboratory or MRI estimates of shunt flow. Because echocardiography and MRI are noninvasive, these techniques easily permit serial monitoring. The technical aspects of measuring Qp/Qs are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1418.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of atrial septal defects in adults", section on 'Approach to diagnosis and evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>If quantitative measures of Qp/Qs are not available, echocardiographic evidence of substantial right heart enlargement and qualitative color and spectral Doppler findings of a large amount of left-to-right shunting through the ASD can be sufficient to justify ASD closure. In addition, the following findings support ASD closure, though these are not sufficient in isolation:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiogram</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Auscultatory finding of a tricuspid flow rumble by an experienced clinician</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased heart size and pulmonary vascularity on chest radiograph</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H116887550"><span class="h2">Spontaneous closure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The majority of isolated small secundum ASDs close spontaneously by two years and some as late as by five years of age [<a href="#rid8">8-10</a>]. Thus, in the absence of associated symptoms, early closure is not indicated for these defects. Secundum defects of moderate and large size, and types of ASDs other than secundum, are unlikely to close spontaneously. However, because there is a possibility, albeit small, of spontaneous closure during the first two years of life, intervention to close even moderate and large isolated secundum ASDs is generally deferred until after the age of two years in asymptomatic patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5754.html" rel="external">"Isolated atrial septal defects (ASDs) in children: Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Spontaneous closure'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H535639991"><span class="h2">Persistent defect</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For children who have persistent small defects without any symptoms, we do not suggest closure. High-quality evidence supporting a benefit of ASD closure in this setting is generally lacking. The risk of paradoxical embolism through a small ASD or valve-competent patent foramen ovale (PFO) is uncertain. The benefit of ASD closure in reducing the risk of embolism must be weighed against the short- and long-term risks of the procedure for closure. Procedure risks are changing as closure techniques continue to improve with decreasing morbidity. Closure is recommended by many clinicians in older adult patients with a small ASD or PFO who have experienced embolic strokes or transient ischemic attacks [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. This issue is discussed in a separate topic review. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1100.html" rel="external">"Stroke associated with patent foramen ovale (PFO): Evaluation"</a>.)</p><p>For patients with a persistent moderate or larger defect, left-to-right shunting usually increases with age if the defect is not corrected. In these patients, we recommend closure if there is significant shunting, as discussed below (see <a class="local">'Criteria and timing for closure'</a> below). The indications for closure of asymptomatic ASDs that are not associated with significant shunting are less clear. Evolving experience with transcatheter ASD closure may make a subset of such patients suitable candidates for closure. Since an increase in shunt volume can occur with moderate-sized ASDs [<a href="#rid13">13</a>], periodic follow-up of patients with such defects is clearly indicated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5754.html" rel="external">"Isolated atrial septal defects (ASDs) in children: Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Persistent moderate to large ASDs'</a> and <a class="local">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2963522941"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Key aspects of managing children with isolated ASDs include deciding whether ASD closure is warranted, determining the choice and timing of intervention, and providing post-procedure follow-up.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H28774558"><span class="h2">Monitoring</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The apparent incidence of ASD may be increasing because of increased usage of echocardiography in the neonatal period. Many secundum ASDs or incompetent foramen ovales identified on echocardiograms obtained for nonspecific indications in early infancy will close spontaneously during later infancy or early childhood. The monitoring of these patients, as well as those patients with defects other than secundum who are diagnosed prenatally, is dependent on the size and type of their defect. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5754.html" rel="external">"Isolated atrial septal defects (ASDs) in children: Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Presentation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5754.html" rel="external">"Isolated atrial septal defects (ASDs) in children: Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patent foramen ovale (PFO) versus ASD</strong> – PFO and small ASDs constitute a spectrum, and there is not general consensus on how best to differentiate between them.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Many cardiologists base the distinction between the two entities on the presence or absence of a tissue flap partially occluding the opening of the atrial septum. Openings with a tissue flap are defined as PFO, and those without a tissue flap are defined as secundum ASD. The absence of a tissue flap is usually associated with a "T artifact," a hyperintense blunted edge at the margin of the defect in the atrial septum on echocardiography.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Other cardiologists use defect size or position in the atrial septum to differentiate between ASD and PFO. Caution should be employed when using absolute defect diameter for classification in premature infants because the physiologic effect of defect size varies with patient size.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Because of the lack of uniformity in subjective interpretations of echocardiograms, and because pediatric cardiology practice standards differ, primary care clinicians should seek pediatric cardiology advice regarding the necessity for follow-up when receiving an echocardiographic report identifying an ASD or a borderline classification such as "PFO/ASD."</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Follow-up for PFO</strong> – If a patient has an isolated defect characterized as "PFO" on the echocardiographic report, follow-up is generally <strong>not</strong> necessary. Based on the available evidence, medical follow-up of asymptomatic patients with PFO does not appear to have any benefit. Many PFOs spontaneously close during childhood and adolescence, and most of the PFOs that persist into adulthood never cause problems. Requiring routine follow-up for such children may cause undue anxiety regarding rare complications that can be associated with PFO later in adulthood (eg, paradoxical embolus and decompression illness). Furthermore, given the high prevalence of PFO, medical follow-up of all PFOs would be burdensome on a population basis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">It is possible that future longitudinal population studies will reveal follow-up to be worthwhile in certain specific anatomical subtypes of PFO, such as those associated with a substantial aneurysm of the septum primum or a large Eustachian valve. However, definitive information in this regard is not yet available, because of selection bias of the extant reports.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Follow-up for trivial ASDs</strong> – Similar to PFO, children with trivial secundum ASDs (&lt;3 mm) do <strong>not</strong> require specific follow-up.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Follow-up for clinically significant ASDs</strong> – The child in whom a clinically significant ASD is detected should be followed regularly by a pediatric cardiologist. Clinically significant ASDs include secundum ASDs with a maximal diameter of ≥3 mm since experience has shown that secundum ASDs of this size can increase substantially with patient growth. The history and physical examination during follow-up evaluations focuses on detecting any signs or symptoms of increased shunting. Signs suggestive of increased shunting include failure to gain weight appropriately, increased frequency of respiratory infections, and, rarely, signs of heart failure such as hepatomegaly or auscultatory evidence of pulmonary congestion. Echocardiography is indicated when there is concern that the shunt may be increasing or to confirm spontaneous closure. (See <a class="local">'Persistent defect'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2930842108"><span class="h2">Criteria and timing for closure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We recommended ASD closure for children who have right heart enlargement, pulmonary overcirculation, and evidence of substantial left-to-right shunting through an ASD (ie, ratio of pulmonary-to-systemic flow [Qp/Qs] &gt;2:1 or other evidence of large amount of left-to-right shunting, as described above). (See <a class="local">'Measurement of shunt ratio'</a> above.)</p><p>These findings are typically associated with moderate to large ASDs. Such defects are unlikely to close spontaneously, and observational data suggest that left-to-right shunting may increase with age, resulting in heart failure, exercise intolerance, and increased risk of arrhythmia and pulmonary hypertension. This approach is also supported by indirect evidence from a randomized trial in adults with ASD demonstrating lower risk of death or major cardiovascular events in patients managed with ASD closure compared with medical management [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5754.html" rel="external">"Isolated atrial septal defects (ASDs) in children: Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Natural history'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95760.html" rel="external">"Surgical and percutaneous closure of atrial septal defects in adults", section on 'Outcomes of surgical closure'</a>.)</p><p>As previously discussed, ASD closure is generally deferred until after age two years in asymptomatic patients because there is a possibility, albeit small, of spontaneous closure during the first two years of life. (See <a class="local">'Spontaneous closure'</a> above.)</p><p>There is <strong>no</strong> definitive evidence that ASD closure is beneficial for patients with a persistent ASD without a significant left-to-right shunt and without symptoms directly attributable to the ASD (including paradoxical embolism or platypnea-orthodeoxia, which is shortness of breath and hypoxemia that occurs when sitting or standing and that is relieved when lying down). Most pathologic consequences of ASD, such as atrial arrhythmias and (rarely) pulmonary hypertension, are secondary to right heart volume overload or pulmonary overcirculation. No studies have shown that prospective closure of asymptomatic small ASDs prevents paradoxical embolization, and the risk of endocarditis with isolated small ASDs appears to be negligible. Since all closure techniques have risk, closure of asymptomatic small ASDs does not appear to be warranted at this time.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3723697401"><span class="h2">Preprocedure evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prior to selecting an intervention, a comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation is performed.

Transcatheter closure should<strong> not</strong> be used in patients with sinus venosus or primum or coronary sinus ASD or in infants with large defects and heart failure. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Surgical closure</strong> is reserved for patients with any of the following (see <a class="local">'Surgery'</a> below):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Secundum ASD with unfavorable anatomy (ie, not meeting the criteria above)</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Sinus venosus defects, coronary sinus defects, primum ASDs, and complex congenital lesions</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Infants with heart failure due to a large ASD</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Patient or family/caregiver prefers surgical closure</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Comparative data</strong> – Observational data suggest that procedural success rates are similarly high for both transcatheter and surgical closure, but complication rates and length of hospital stay are lower with the transcatheter approach [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. There may be a slightly increased risk of needing reintervention with transcatheter closure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Outcomes with the two approaches were described in a multicenter nonrandomized study of 442 children and young adults who underwent transcatheter closure with the Amplatzer device (median age 9.8 years) and 154 patients who underwent surgery (median age 4.1 years); the choice of procedure was based on the family's preference [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. There were no deaths in either group. The procedural success rate was slightly lower with transcatheter closure compared with surgery (96 versus 100 percent), but the complication rate was lower (7 versus 24 percent) and hospital stay was shorter (1 versus 3.4 days). At 12-month follow-up, five patients (1.5 percent) in the device-closure group had a residual shunt, one of whom required a second procedure to correct the residual shunt.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 observational studies (including &gt;3000 adult and pediatric patients) comparing short-term outcomes with transcatheter (n = 1812) or surgical (n = 1270) ASD closure, mortality was low in both groups (no deaths in the transcatheter group and one death in the surgical group) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Length of hospital stay was 2.6 days shorter in the transcatheter group. Early complication rates were lower in the transcatheter group compared with the surgical group (7 versus 31 percent). The types of major complications differed in the two groups. The most common major early complication in the surgical group was bleeding requiring blood transfusion, which occurred in 7 percent, whereas blood transfusion was rarely required in the transcatheter group (&lt;1 percent of patients). Redo surgery was performed in nine surgical patients (five for patch dehiscence, and four for major bleeding). The most frequent major early complication in the transcatheter group was device embolization or malposition needing surgery or further transcatheter therapy, which occurred in 1.6 percent. Other major complications included perforation of the heart due to erosion by the device (three patients), pericardial effusion requiring surgical drainage (two patients), and femoral venous or arterial injury requiring vascular surgery (four patients).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Young infants</strong> – Although successful transcatheter closure can be performed in young infants, the complication rate appears to be higher in infants and young children compared with older patients in the three- to five-year age range who weigh at least 15 kg.

If a child has an isolated defect characterized as "PFO" on the echocardiographic report or a trivial secundum ASD, follow-up is generally <strong>not</strong> necessary. Children with clinically significant ASDs (ie, secundum ASDs ≥3 mm or defects other than secundum such as sinus venosus or primum or coronary sinus ASDs) should be followed by a pediatric cardiologist every one to two years. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management approach</strong> – The management of isolated ASDs in children is dependent upon the likelihood of spontaneous closure and, in patients with persistent ASDs, the size of the defect and the degree of shunting. Our general approach is as follows (see <a class="local">'Management approach'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Indications for closure</strong> – For children with an ASD who have right heart enlargement, pulmonary overcirculation, and evidence of substantial left-to-right shunting, we recommend closure (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). These findings are typically associated with moderate to large ASDs, and such defects are unlikely to close spontaneously. ASD closure is generally deferred until after the age of two years in asymptomatic patients because there is a possibility, albeit small, of spontaneous closure during the first two years of life. Patients who are asymptomatic without evidence of significant left-to-right shunting can be monitored longitudinally. (See <a class="local">'Criteria and timing for closure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Preprocedure evaluation</strong> – Prior to closure, patients should have a comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation to accurately measure the size of the defect, assess the degree of left-to-right shunting, identify other cardiac defects, and assess for pulmonary hypertension. These factors help inform the choice of intervention. (See <a class="local">'Preprocedure evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Transcatheter versus surgical closure</strong> – For children who have an indication for ASD closure, our approach to deciding between transcatheter and surgical closure is as follows (see <a class="local">'Choice of intervention'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>For most children with isolated secundum ASDs, we suggest transcatheter device closure rather than surgical closure if there are appropriate anatomic characteristics (ie, not excessively large and with a sufficient rim of tissue to anchor the device) (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Transcatheter closure avoids cardiopulmonary bypass, sternotomy, and atriotomy and is associated with excellent short- and midterm outcomes. This approach has largely replaced surgery in many centers for patients who meet the anatomic requirements. Observational data suggest that transcatheter closure has a similar likelihood of success, with lower complication rates and shorter duration of hospital stay compared with surgery.
