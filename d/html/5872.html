The opportunity for early intervention is often missed and may result in complications, such as anal fissure, stool withholding, and fecal incontinence (also known as encopresis). The prevention of constipation focuses on timely anticipatory guidance regarding diet, toilet training, and toileting behaviors. The treatment of constipation depends upon the age of the child and the duration of symptoms. It may involve education, dietary changes, behavior changes, and pharmacotherapy, alone or in combination [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>In clinical practice, it is useful to distinguish between relatively recent-onset constipation compared with that of longer duration of symptoms. Therefore, we will focus this topic review on recent-onset constipation (eg, symptoms present for fewer than eight weeks).</p><p>Evaluation and management of children who have persistent or frequently recurrent symptoms of constipation (eg, symptoms for several months) is described separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5906.html" rel="external">"Constipation in infants and children: Evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/99538.html" rel="external">"Functional constipation in infants, children, and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5859.html" rel="external">"Functional fecal incontinence in infants and children: Definition, clinical manifestations, and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5873.html" rel="external">"Chronic functional constipation and fecal incontinence in infants, children, and adolescents: Treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2203281497"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H311452722"><span class="h2">Constipation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Constipation is a disorder in which a child passes infrequent bowel movements (two or fewer per week), has painful defecation, or passes large-caliber and hard stools that may require excessive straining.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2729793554"><span class="h2">Functional constipation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Functional constipation describes persistently difficult, infrequent, or seemingly incomplete defecation without evidence of a primary anatomic or neurologic cause. This definition is operationalized by the "Rome IV" diagnostic criteria, which require at least two of six symptoms describing stool infrequency, hardness, and large size; fecal incontinence; or volitional stool retention for at least one month  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57882" href="/z/d/graphic/57882.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Some children may have rectal impaction and overflow fecal incontinence, which typically develops because they have learned to withhold stool, usually to avoid pain during bowel movements. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/99538.html" rel="external">"Functional constipation in infants, children, and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H546878555"><span class="h2">Recent-onset versus chronic constipation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although a diagnosis of functional constipation requires symptom duration of at least one month, there is no other consensus definition to categorize constipation based on duration. However, in clinical practice, it is useful to distinguish between patients with new-onset constipation compared with those having a longer duration of symptoms:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Recent-onset constipation</strong> – We consider constipation to be "recent-onset" if symptoms have been present for eight weeks or less. These children often respond to a short-term intervention, such as administration of laxatives for several days or weeks, or a brief behavioral intervention, as described in the remainder of this topic review.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chronic constipation</strong> – We consider constipation to be chronic if symptoms have been present for three months or more, which may include multiple episodes of symptoms. These children typically require longer treatment with laxatives and more intensive and sustained behavioral support. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5873.html" rel="external">"Chronic functional constipation and fecal incontinence in infants, children, and adolescents: Treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>These categories are simply tools to guide clinical practice. They are not mutually exclusive, since those with recent-onset constipation may eventually evolve into a chronic case requiring longstanding management. These categories may not capture patients with either intermittent or intermediate duration of symptoms. For many patients, the chronicity of the constipation only becomes clear during the course of ongoing evaluation and management.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PREVENTION AND MONITORING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Discussion of dietary and bowel habits should be part of routine health supervision visits for children of all ages. In particular, anticipatory guidance and supervision should be focused on the developmental stages when constipation is most likely to occur [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Introduction of solid foods or cow's milk</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Toilet training</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>School entry</p><p></p><p>If the parent(s)/caregivers are given appropriate and timely education, these episodes may be anticipated and prevented or, if not prevented, quickly treated with temporary interventions. Complaints of simple constipation should not be ignored. Painful bowel movements can lead to withholding of stool [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], worsening constipation, and eventual fecal impaction and fecal incontinence. This progression often occurs insidiously, so the caregiver may be unaware of the problem.</p><p>The pathogenesis of constipation in each of these contexts is summarized briefly below since it is relevant to the provision of anticipatory guidance. This is reviewed in more detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/99538.html" rel="external">"Functional constipation in infants, children, and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Contributing factors'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Transition to solid diet or introduction of cow's milk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As an infant transitions to a solid diet, caregivers should be vigilant for signs of constipation. Constipation tends to develop in this context because the transitional diet often includes inadequate amounts of fiber and fluid [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In some infants, cow's milk or anal fissures contribute to the problem [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. For prevention and initial treatment of mild constipation, ensuring adequate fiber and fluid intake may be helpful. By contrast, there is little evidence that adding liquid or fiber in excess of the recommended amount to the diet is effective in treating severe chronic constipation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5873.html" rel="external">"Chronic functional constipation and fecal incontinence in infants, children, and adolescents: Treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fiber</strong> – For infants and children younger than two years, a reasonable goal for fiber intake is approximately 5 grams/day. This can be accomplished by providing several servings daily of pureed vegetables, fruits, and a fiber-containing infant cereal. Most vegetables and fruits supply approximately 1 gram of fiber per serving, but prunes and peas can supply up to 2 g. Rice infant cereal supplies a negligible amount of fiber, whereas whole wheat, barley, and multigrain cereals supply 1 to 2 grams per serving [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2866.html" rel="external">"Dietary recommendations for toddlers and preschool and school-age children", section on 'Fiber'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fluid intake</strong> – There is no need to increase fluid intake beyond maintenance requirements, unless there is evidence that the child is dehydrated. However, it is reasonable to ensure that maintenance fluid requirements are met (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6122.html" rel="external">"Maintenance intravenous fluid therapy in children"</a>). The minimum daily fluid intake depends upon the child's weight. As examples:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>5 kg infant – 16 fluid ounces (500 mL) daily</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>10 kg child – 32 ounces (960 mL) daily</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>15 kg child – 42 ounces (1260 mL) daily</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>20 kg child – 50 ounces (1500 mL) daily</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cow's milk</strong> – For some infants and toddlers, transitioning from breast milk or formula to cow's milk also appears to trigger constipation, although this association has not been firmly established. If the development of constipation is temporally associated with transition to cow's milk, it is reasonable to do a two-week trial of a cow's milk-free diet (by substituting soy-based transition formula or calcium-fortified soy milk). If the symptoms improve, continue the milk-free diet for 6 to 12 months, then reintroduce cow's milk. Cow's milk also appears to play a role in constipation in some older children 6 to 12 years of age, especially those with atopic manifestations and perianal fissures [<a href="#rid9">9,11</a>]. The diet of these children should also be reviewed to ensure that they are receiving adequate amounts of calcium and fiber. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/99538.html" rel="external">"Functional constipation in infants, children, and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Cow's milk intolerance'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anal fissures</strong> – Passage of large stool can cause anal fissures, which make defecation painful and can lead to stool-retentive or avoidance behavior, which may in turn lead to persistent or chronic symptoms. Anal fissures can also occasionally be caused by vigorous wiping of the anus during diaper changes.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Toilet training</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When children are around toilet-training age, caregivers and clinicians should be vigilant for signs of developing constipation. Prevention and initial management of constipation in this age group involve taking a relaxed approach to toilet training, providing foot support for sitting on the toilet (for comfort and to relax the pelvic floor)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119803" href="/z/d/graphic/119803.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), ensuring adequate fiber intake, and avoiding excessive cow's milk in the diet. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/611.html" rel="external">"Toilet training"</a>.)</p><p>These strategies address the common triggers of constipation in this age group, which are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Stool withholding</strong> – Toilet training may trigger constipation because toddlers may not respond to the need to defecate and/or because children using adult-sized toilets without foot support may not have sufficient leverage to successfully evacuate their stools. If stool passage is painful, toddlers may begin to withhold stool, compounding the problem and leading to a vicious cycle of withholding, which leads to larger and harder stools and more pain upon defecation. Once the withholding cycle has started, it can only be reversed by making the stools soft and passage of stools pain free. Preventive measures include delaying toilet training until the child shows signs of readiness and using a relaxed, "child-oriented" approach to toileting, in addition to the dietary measures described. If children show signs of stool withholding, it is often necessary to use short-term dietary interventions or laxatives and sometimes to hold off on toilet-training efforts. Anal fissures should be identified and treated. (See <a class="local">'Toddlers and children'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/611.html" rel="external">"Toilet training"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inadequate fiber</strong> – For prevention of constipation, we suggest a goal for fiber intake equal to the child's age plus 5 to 10 g/day, as recommended by a consensus conference on dietary fiber in childhood [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. This translates to between 7 and 15 grams of fiber daily for children two to five years of age. Giving more than this fiber goal has no proven benefit for the management of constipation in children [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The National Academy of Medicine recommends a somewhat higher goal for fiber intake: 14 g/1000 kcals in the diet [<a href="#rid13">13</a>], which translates to approximately 15 to 20 g/day in toddlers and young children. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2866.html" rel="external">"Dietary recommendations for toddlers and preschool and school-age children", section on 'Fiber'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Of note, consumption of excessive amounts of fiber can increase the risk of fecal impaction in children with stool-withholding behaviors. Therefore, for children with stool withholding or a history of fecal impaction, extra fiber intake should be encouraged only after colorectal tone has been restored, eg, after several months of successful treatment with laxatives. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5873.html" rel="external">"Chronic functional constipation and fecal incontinence in infants, children, and adolescents: Treatment", section on 'Dietary changes'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Excessive cow's milk</strong> – The excessive consumption of whole cow's milk (&gt;32 fluid ounces [960 mL] per day) can slow intestinal motility and satiate the child, thereby diminishing the intake of other fluids and foods that promote soft stools, such as water, fruits, and vegetables [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. Milk intake of 24 ounces per day (720 mL) is sufficient to meet the daily calcium requirement of children between one and five years of age. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2866.html" rel="external">"Dietary recommendations for toddlers and preschool and school-age children", section on 'Dairy products'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">School entry</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Transitioning to school can trigger constipation because of stool withholding if the child is reluctant to use the toilet at school or because the change in schedule interferes with toileting. Moreover, as children reach school age, they often use the bathroom by themselves and parents/caregivers may not be aware of the frequency or type of stools.</p><p>To avoid these problems, clinicians should encourage parents/caregivers to regularly ask about their child's bowel movements. The parents/caregivers also should be encouraged to monitor whether their child is holding back from or embarrassed about using the toilet at school. In addition, parents/caregivers should promote routine, unhurried time on the toilet after meals. Finally, continued attention to fiber intake may help  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76461 graphicRef77796 graphicRef62957" href="/z/d/graphic/76461.html" rel="external">table 2A-C</a>). The goal for fiber intake for a six-year-old child is 11 to 16 grams/day (based on the child's age plus 5 to 10 grams/day as recommended by the consensus conference on dietary fiber in childhood [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]). Giving more than this fiber goal has no proven benefit for management of constipation in children [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4057710906"><span class="h1">TREATMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When a child has signs or symptoms of constipation, even if it is of short duration (ie, less than two weeks), it is important to intervene promptly to prevent the cycle of stool withholding that can lead to worsening or recurrent or chronic constipation. The intervention should include a follow-up plan to ensure that the constipation has resolved and the child achieves an appropriate stooling pattern (ie, regular bowel movements and fecal continence if appropriate for the child's age).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Infants</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Constipation that develops in infants after the neonatal period is typically triggered by dietary changes, such as the transition to solids or cow's milk. The constipation is likely to respond to dietary interventions, as discussed below, but, in many cases, the dietary change can be brief.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3648453458"><span class="h3">Assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Infants with severe or recurrent constipation, and especially those with symptoms since birth, should be carefully evaluated for possible organic causes. Alarm signs that suggest the possibility of an organic cause are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94989" href="/z/d/graphic/94989.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Evaluation of an infant with constipation is described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5906.html" rel="external">"Constipation in infants and children: Evaluation"</a>.)</p><p>Infant dyschezia is a common cause of constipation-like symptoms in young infants. "Dyschezia" describes ineffective defecation, manifested as straining in the absence of constipation. Infant dyschezia is defined as at least 10 minutes of straining and crying followed by successful or unsuccessful passage of soft stool in an otherwise healthy infant. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/99538.html" rel="external">"Functional constipation in infants, children, and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Infant dyschezia'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1902702713"><span class="h3">Recent-onset constipation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For recent-onset constipation in infants, interventions include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For infants who have not yet begun solid foods, recent-onset constipation can be treated by the addition of undigestible, osmotically active carbohydrates to the formula, titrating the dose to induce a daily bowel movement. One such option is the addition of sorbitol-containing juices (eg, apple, prune, or pear) as a short-term intervention. For infants four months and older, two to four ounces of 100 percent fruit juice per day is a reasonable starting dose. For infants younger than four months, a reasonable starting dose is one to two ounces of diluted prune juice (eg, approximately one ounce of juice mixed with one ounce of water). Alternatively, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13405" href="/z/d/drug information/13405.html" rel="external">lactulose</a> (approximately 1 mL/kg daily) can be added to the formula. Follow-up and counseling should be provided to avoid excessive juice intake after the episode of constipation has resolved due to potential adverse effects of juice on diet quality and subsequent weight gain, either inadequate or excessive [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2855.html" rel="external">"Introducing solid foods and vitamin and mineral supplementation during infancy", section on 'Foods to avoid and foods not to avoid'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For infants who have begun solid foods, sorbitol-containing fruit purees can be used. To increase the fiber content of the infant's solid foods, multigrain or barley cereal may be substituted for rice cereal and pureed peas or prunes can be substituted for other pureed fruits and vegetables. Dark corn syrup has been used in the past.

Early intervention during new or recurrent episodes of constipation can prevent complications such as anal fissure, stool withholding, chronic constipation, and encopresis. (See <a class="local">'Prevention and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Common triggers</strong> – Times when constipation is likely to occur include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Infant transitioning to a solid diet</strong> – The transitional diet often includes inadequate amounts of fiber and fluid. To avoid constipation, the diet should include at least 5 grams of fiber daily in complementary foods (eg, pureed fruits, vegetables, or cereals) and adequate amounts of fluids. Anal fissures or irritation also may contribute to constipation; these can be caused by vigorous wiping during diaper changes. (See <a class="local">'Transition to solid diet or introduction of cow's milk'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Toilet training</strong> – Children of toilet-training age are susceptible to constipation because of inappropriate pressure on the child around toilet training or uncomfortable positioning on the toilet  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119803" href="/z/d/graphic/119803.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), stool withholding, inadequate fiber intake, and/or excessive milk intake. Preventive measures include increasing fiber and decreasing milk intake; delaying toilet training until the child shows signs of readiness; and using a relaxed, "child-oriented" approach to toilet training. If the child shows signs of stool withholding, it is often necessary to use short-term dietary interventions or laxatives and sometimes to postpone toilet-training efforts. (See <a class="local">'Toilet training'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>School entry</strong> – Transitioning to school can trigger constipation because of stool withholding if the child is reluctant to use the toilet at school or because the change in schedule interferes with toileting.
