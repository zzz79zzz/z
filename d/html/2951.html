Testicular GCTs are more sensitive to systemic chemotherapy than most adult solid tumors. As a result, chemotherapy is the standard treatment for men with advanced seminoma or nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs) and for those with persistently elevated serum tumor markers following orchiectomy. The success of chemotherapy in advanced disease has led to its use in selected men with stage I and II disease.</p><p>The management of men with stage I NSGCT following orchiectomy, including the choice between adjuvant chemotherapy, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), and active surveillance, will be reviewed here. The management of men with stage II NSGCT is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2976.html" rel="external">"Management of stage II nonseminomatous germ cell tumors"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>With only rare exceptions (eg, men who present with widely disseminated disease requiring emergent treatment), men with testicular cancer undergo a radical inguinal orchiectomy for diagnosis and initial treatment. If radiographic imaging studies show no evidence of regional or distant metastases and serum tumor markers are normal after orchiectomy, patients are defined as having clinical stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110731" href="/z/d/graphic/110731.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110732" href="/z/d/graphic/110732.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2986.html" rel="external">"Radical inguinal orchiectomy for testicular germ cell tumors", section on 'Surgical treatment of the testis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2980.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of testicular germ cell tumors", section on 'CT scan'</a>.)</p><p>The majority (75 percent) of clinical stage I NSGCTs are cured with orchiectomy alone and do not require further treatment. However, it is difficult to identify which patients with stage I NSGCT are at highest risk for recurrence and thus have the most to gain from adjuvant treatment. While treatment immediately following orchiectomy can reduce the risk of relapse, it represents overtreatment for most patients and can result in both short- and long-term complications. In addition, although the risk of recurrence is approximately 25 percent for men undergoing surveillance, treatment at the time of recurrence is almost always curative [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. Long-term disease-specific survival exceeds 99 percent regardless of whether patients undergo surveillance, chemotherapy, or retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14236.html" rel="external">"Approach to the care of long-term testicular cancer survivors"</a>.)</p><p>Men with persistently elevated postorchiectomy serum tumor markers and normal imaging studies are defined as having clinical stage IS disease. Persistently elevated markers generally indicate the presence of metastatic disease [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Therefore, these patients should be treated with chemotherapy similarly to men with stage III disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2981.html" rel="external">"Initial risk-stratified treatment for advanced testicular germ cell tumors"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H178160589"><span class="h1">RISK STRATIFICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Numerous attempts have been made to identify men with clinical stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs) at high risk for relapse and thus most likely to benefit from adjuvant treatment following orchiectomy. The most widely used risk factors for recurrence in men undergoing surveillance following orchiectomy for clinical stage I disease include the following [<a href="#rid5">5-10</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lymphovascular invasion (LVI).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Predominance of an embryonal carcinoma (EC) component in the primary tumor – Predominance is histologically defined when EC comprises a greater proportion of the tumor than any other individual germ cell tumor component.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pathologic tumor stage T3 or T4  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110731" href="/z/d/graphic/110731.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p>These risk factors can stratify men with testicular NSGCT by risk of relapse:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Low risk – Tumors with <strong>none</strong> of these risk factors are associated with relapse rates ranging from 10 to 14 percent [<a href="#rid1">1,2,11</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>High risk – Tumors with <strong>one or more</strong> of these risk factors have a higher risk of relapse. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Tumors with a predominance of EC alone (no LVI) are associated with relapse rates between 20 and 40 percent, although the data on this are mixed [<a href="#rid1">1,2,12,13</a>]. For tumors demonstrating LVI alone (no EC), relapse rates range between 40 and 55 percent [<a href="#rid1">1,2,11</a>]. Tumors with both a predominance of EC and LVI are associated with relapse rates of over 50 percent [<a href="#rid1">1,14-16</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>There are limited data for relapse rates in patients with T3 or T4 disease due to the rarity of these tumors and their exclusion from most surveillance series [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. </p><p></p><p>Studies that have evaluated the risk for relapse associated with EC and/or LVI include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In one observational series of 223 men, the relapse rate was about 20 percent in those whose tumor had a predominance of EC without LVI, 40 percent in those with LVI but no EC predominance, and 55 percent in those with both risk factors compared with 10 percent in those with neither risk factor [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>By contrast, another series reported that men with pure EC (ie, tumor that is comprised entirely of EC) with or without LVI had a relapse rate of 45 percent [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Several studies reported that men with LVI and no EC at all had relapse rates of 20 percent or less [<a href="#rid14">14,19,20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other research indicates that the risk of micrometastatic disease increases as the proportion of EC increases [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>].</p><p></p><p>Interpreting studies of the prognostic significance of EC is complicated by the fact that different studies have used different measures to pathologically characterize EC, including whether EC is present or absent, whether it is predominant (variously defined as more than 40 percent, more than 50 percent, or representing a greater proportion of the tumor than any other individual germ cell tumor type), or whether it is pure [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. These issues have made it more challenging to clarify its significance as an independent prognostic risk factor. At least three studies suggest that the mere presence of EC is a significant risk factor for relapse, and a meta-analysis suggests that both the presence and predominance of EC are significant prognostic risk factors [<a href="#rid13">13,14,19-21</a>]. Regardless, EC is a weaker predictor of relapse than LVI [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>As an example, one systematic review and meta-analysis of 24 studies evaluating LVI and EC as risk factors for relapse in men with clinical stage I NSGCT demonstrated that LVI was a strong risk factor and that both the presence and predominance of EC had prognostic value for occult metastatic disease [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. This study defined occult metastatic disease as either lymph node metastases discovered during primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection or relapse during surveillance. In the pooled analysis, the presence of LVI was associated with a higher rate of occult metastases versus the absence of LVI (48 versus 17 percent, odds ratio [OR] 4.33, 95% CI 3.55-5.3). Both presence and predominance of EC were also associated with higher rates of occult metastases (33 versus 16 percent, OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.64-3.77 for presence versus absence of EC; 40 versus 20 percent, OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.93-3.56 for tumors with EC involvement greater than 50 percent versus less than 50 percent). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H40926142"><span class="h1">TREATMENT APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surveillance, adjuvant chemotherapy, and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) are therapeutic options for men with clinical stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs)  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114315" href="/z/d/graphic/114315.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Each approach is associated with a 99 percent rate of long-term disease-specific survival. Importantly, for men who are interested in fertility preservation, sperm banking should be performed prior to treatment with RPLND or chemotherapy.</p><p>The approach to management depends upon various factors, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The likelihood of relapse (based on the presence of low- versus high-risk disease characteristics)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The relative importance of the risk of relapse and of the different toxicities for an individual patient</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The ability of a patient to adhere to posttreatment surveillance</p><p></p><p>The importance of a multidisciplinary approach was illustrated in a Dutch study that included almost 1300 men with clinical stage I NSGCT [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The relapse rate for the entire cohort at five years was 30.6 percent; the median time to relapse was five months. Despite this, the mortality rate was &lt;0.5 percent; only six men died of testicular cancer.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Of 356 patients treated with chemotherapy at the time of relapse, 98 underwent postchemotherapy resection of residual masses, indicating that 8 percent of the nearly 1300 men undergoing surveillance ended up receiving multimodality treatment (ie, chemotherapy followed by surgery).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H40926150"><span class="h2">Low-risk disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For men with low-risk disease, reasonable options include surveillance or adjuvant chemotherapy. These men have an excellent prognosis, and surveillance avoids the complications and toxicity of chemotherapy [<a href="#rid1">1,2,9</a>]. Although surveillance is appropriate for most patients with low-risk disease, not all men will be comfortable with surveillance, even if their risk of relapse is "only" approximately 10 to 15 percent. For men who express a preference for treatment at the time of initial diagnosis, adjuvant chemotherapy is also reasonable [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. For men who have access to a urological surgeon with extensive experience performing RPLNDs, surgery is also a reasonable option and reduces the need for surveillance computed tomography (CT) scans; however, most urologists do not have such experience. In our view, men whose disease is comprised predominantly of teratoma are ideal candidates for RPLND. For men with teratoma with somatic malignant transformation, RPLND is the preferred treatment option, and we do not offer surveillance or primary chemotherapy for such patients. (See <a class="local">'Risk stratification'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2950.html" rel="external">"Surveillance for stage I testicular germ cell tumors following orchiectomy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2192881987"><span class="h3">SWENOTECA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evidence supporting the role of active surveillance comes from the Swedish and Norwegian Testicular Cancer Project (SWENOTECA) Management Program [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Between 1998 and 2005, 745 men in Sweden and Norway were treated prospectively for clinical stage I NSGCTs. Active surveillance was recommended for men without lymphovascular invasion (LVI; n = 491), although they were allowed to choose adjuvant chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 4.7 years:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The relapse rate was higher among men who underwent surveillance rather than BEP (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9160" href="/z/d/drug information/9160.html" rel="external">bleomycin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8430" href="/z/d/drug information/8430.html" rel="external">etoposide</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a>  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65516" href="/z/d/graphic/65516.html" rel="external">table 3</a>)) chemotherapy (12 versus 1.3 percent with one cycle of BEP or 0 percent with two cycles of BEP).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The overall mortality rate was only 1 percent, and none of these deaths was due to progressive testicular cancer.</p><p></p><p>The SWENOTECA results for men with high-risk disease are discussed below.

Because all three options are associated with a greater than 99 percent disease-specific survival, there is no single best option for all patients [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. For those rare men with teratoma with somatic malignant transformation, RPLND is the preferred treatment option and we do not recommend either surveillance or primary chemotherapy for such patients.</p><p>One factor that must be taken into account if placing high-risk patients on surveillance is the psychological stress of worrying about relapse and the potential psychological trauma to the patient if relapse occurs and his life must be put on hold on short notice and at an unpredictable time. One appeal of adjuvant chemotherapy after orchiectomy is the near certainty it provides that the disease has been cured, particularly in this high-risk group.</p><p>Therefore, the decision of which modality to use should be based on patient preference:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For men with high-risk NSGCTs, active surveillance is a highly effective strategy with regard to long-term survival, although it leaves the patient with a substantial risk of recurrence (which would require treatment) at some point in the subsequent two to three years. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2950.html" rel="external">"Surveillance for stage I testicular germ cell tumors following orchiectomy", section on 'Surveillance protocols'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Roughly half of men with high-risk disease will relapse, and approximately one-fourth of those (ie, one-eighth of high-risk men undergoing surveillance) will require additional treatment (eg, RPLND in addition to three or four cycles of chemotherapy). In light of these statistics, some men may reasonably choose to proceed with chemotherapy after orchiectomy in order to nearly eliminate the risk of needing such aggressive treatment in the future. (See <a class="local">'Adjuvant chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For some men, the potential life disruption associated with recurrent disease and the psychological trauma of relapse (with the subsequent need to undergo 9 to 12 weeks of chemotherapy) are unacceptable.

However, this difference may have been due to chance. Moreover, it is not clear that the small absolute benefit, if real, justifies the potential late toxicities of an additional cycle of chemotherapy. Long-term overall survival in this population is excellent regardless of the number of cycles given.

However, RPLND should only be performed if the technical expertise is available (ie, surgeons who perform at least 24 procedures annually, in our opinion) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. When performed by experienced surgeons, RPLND is safe, with essentially no mortality and an extremely low rate of ejaculatory dysfunction or other long-term morbidity. In addition, the use of RPLND substantially reduces the number of men who ultimately receive chemotherapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2992.html" rel="external">"Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for early-stage testicular germ cell tumors"</a>.)</p><p>Unfortunately, very few centers have specialized surgeons sufficiently trained and experienced to perform a high-quality RPLND, and the effectiveness and safety of RPLND in less experienced hands may be compromised [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

Among patients managed with RPLND, 20 percent are likely to be upstaged at final pathology and will undergo adjuvant chemotherapy with two cycles of either BEP  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65516" href="/z/d/graphic/65516.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) or EP (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8430" href="/z/d/drug information/8430.html" rel="external">etoposide</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a>).

The goal of therapy is to reduce the likelihood of relapse and minimize overtreatment and treatment-related toxicity. (See <a class="local">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk stratification</strong> – The most widely evaluated histologic risk factors for recurrence in men undergoing surveillance following orchiectomy for clinical stage I disease include the presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI), the predominance of embryonal carcinoma (EC), and tumor stage above T2. (See <a class="local">'Risk stratification'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Men are at <strong>low risk</strong> if they have none of these risk factors.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Men are at <strong>high risk </strong>if they have any of the following: LVI, a predominance of EC, or a T3 or T4 primary tumor.

However, not all men will be comfortable with active surveillance, despite their excellent prognosis. For men who express a preference for treatment at the time of initial diagnosis, we suggest adjuvant BEP (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9160" href="/z/d/drug information/9160.html" rel="external">bleomycin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8430" href="/z/d/drug information/8430.html" rel="external">etoposide</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a>  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65516" href="/z/d/graphic/65516.html" rel="external">table 3</a>)) for one cycle (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). For men who have access to a urologist with extensive experience performing retroperitoneal lymph node dissections (RPLNDs), RPLND is also a good option, especially if the tumor is predominantly teratoma.
